Aryls may include but are not limited to phenyl, napthyl, biphenyl ring systems and the like. The aryl group may be unsubstituted or substituted with a variety of substituents including, but not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, halide, benzylic, alkyl or aromatic ether, nitro, cyano and the like and combinations thereof.","\u201cSubstituent\u201d refers to a molecular group that replaces a hydrogen in a compound and may include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, C-Calkyl, aromatic or aryl, halide (F, Cl, Br, I), C-Calkyl ether, benzyl halide, benzyl ether, aromatic or aryl ether, hydroxy, alkoxy, amino, alkylamino (\u2014NHR\u2032), dialkylamino (\u2014NR\u2032R\u2033) or other groups which do not interfere with the formation of the diaryl alkylphosphonate.","As defined herein, an \u201carylol\u201d or an \u201carylol group\u201d is an aryl group with a hydroxyl, OH, group substituent on the aryl ring. Non-limiting examples of an arylol are phenol, naphthalenol and the like. A wide variety of arlyols may be used in the embodiments of the invention and are commercially available.","The term \u201calkanol\u201d or \u201calkanol group\u201d refers to a compound including an alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms or more having at least one hydroxyl group substituent. Examples of alkanols include but are not limited to methanol, ethanol, 1- and 2-propanol, 1,1-dimethylethanol, hexanol, octanol and the like.

Alkenols may be further substituted with one or more substituents as described above and may be used in place of alkanols in some embodiments of the invention. Alkenols are known to those skilled in the art and many are readily available commercially.","The terms \u201cflame retardant,\u201d \u201cflame resistant,\u201d \u201cfire resistant,\u201d or \u201cfire resistance,\u201d as used herein, means that the composition exhibits a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of at least 27. \u201cFlame retardant,\u201d \u201cflame resistant,\u201d \u201cfire resistant,\u201d or \u201cfire resistance,\u201d may also be tested by measuring the after-burning time in accordance with the UL test (Subject 94). In this test, the tested materials are given classifications of UL-94 V-0, UL-94 V-1 and UL-94 V-2 on the basis of the results obtained with the ten test specimens. Briefly, the criteria for each of these UL-94-V-classifications are as follows:","UL-94 V-0: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 10 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 50 seconds. None of the test specimens should release any drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","UL-94 V-1: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 250 seconds. None of the test specimens should release any drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","UL-94 V-2: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 250 seconds. Test specimens may release flaming particles, which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","Fire resistance may also be tested by measuring after-burning time. These test methods provide a laboratory test procedure for measuring and comparing the surface flammability of materials when exposed to a prescribed level of radiant heat energy to measure the surface flammability of materials when exposed to fire. The test is conducted using small specimens that are representative, to the extent possible, of the material or assembly being evaluated. The rate at which flames travel along surfaces depends upon the physical and thermal properties of the material, product or assembly under test, the specimen mounting method and orientation, the type and level of fire or heat exposure, the availability of air, and properties of the surrounding enclosure. If different test conditions are substituted or the end-use conditions are changed, it may not always be possible by or from this test to predict changes in the fire-test-response characteristics measured. Therefore, the results are valid only for the fire test exposure conditions described in this procedure.","The state-of-the-art approach to rendering polymers flame retardant is to use additives such as brominated compounds or compounds containing aluminum and\/or phosphorus. Use of the additives with polymer can have a deleterious effect on the processing characteristics and\/or the mechanical performance of articles produced from them. In addition, some of these compounds are toxic, and can leach into the environment over time making their use less desirable. In some countries, certain brominated additives are being phased-out of use because of environmental concerns.","The term \u201chydrolytic stability,\u201d as used herein, is defined as the ability of the polymer to resist hydrolysis in a water boil test. The ability to resist hydrolysis can be measured by the change in relative viscosity after exposure which is an indication in molecular weight change. For example, a neat resin sample can be placed in pure water (triple distilled) for up to 168 hours under reflux conditions at normal pressure. The samples can be removed periodically, and the relative viscosity (\u03b7) can be determined by dissolving the sample in dichloromethane at 25\u00b0 C. at a concentration of 0.5 g polymer\/liter and measuring the solution with an Ubbelohde viscometer. A significant change in the \u03b7value after the water boils is indicative of a change in molecular weight of the polymer due to hydrolysis. A polymer with good hydrolytic stability would not exhibit a significant change in \u03b7as a result of this test.","\u201cMolecular weight,\u201d as used herein, can be determined by relative viscosity and\/or gel permeation chromatography (GPC). \u201cRelative viscosity\u201d of a polymer is measured by dissolving a known quantity of polymer in a solvent and comparing the time it takes for this solution and the neat solvent to travel through a specially designed capillary (viscometer) at a constant temperature. Relative viscosity is a measurement that is indicative of the molecular weight of a polymer. It is also well known that a reduction in relative viscosity is indicative of a reduction in molecular weight, and reduction in molecular weight causes loss of mechanical properties such as strength and toughness. GPC provides information about the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of a polymer. It is known that the molecular weight distribution of a polymer is important to properties such as thermo-oxidative stability (due to different amount of end groups), toughness, melt flow, and fire resistance, for example, low molecular weight polymers drip more when burned.","The term \u201ctoughness\u201d, as used herein, is determined qualitatively on a film or a molded specimen.","Polycarbonates (PC) are outstanding engineering thermoplastics that have an excellent combination of properties, such as, high heat distortion temperature (HDT), low color, transparency, melt processability, and outstanding toughness. These materials are used in a wide variety of applications and are produced commercially on an enormous scale. However, polycarbonates lack the requisite flame resistance, and there is a demand and still a need for flame resistant PCs that also maintain their other advantageous properties. A variety of approaches have been undertaken to impart flame resistance to these materials, but these approaches have been unsuccessful largely because they detract from the important inherent properties that PCs possess.","Embodiments of the invention generally relate to polymer compositions including a mixture of one or more polyphosphonate and one or more organic salts and, in some embodiments, one or more polyphosphonate, one or more polycarbonate, and one or more organic salts. Other embodiments are directed to one or more copolyphosphonates and one or more organic salts and in further embodiments, one or more copolyphosphonates, one or more polycarbonates, and one or more organic salts. Yet other embodiments are directed to one or more polycarbonates, one or more copolyphosphonates, and one or more organic salts.","In further embodiments, these mixtures may further include an additional polymer, and in other embodiments, these mixtures, which may or may not include an additional polymer, may also include one or more silicon containing compounds. The copolyphosphonate s of various embodiments can be either random copolymers in which monomers of the copolyphosphonates of various embodiments are incorporated into polymer chain randomly or block copolymers in which polycarbonate portions and polyphosphonate portions of the copolymer are covalently linked. The polymer compositions of the invention generally provide improved flame resistance over polymer compositions including polycarbonate or copolycarbonate alone or mixtures of polycarbonate or copolycarbonate with organic salts. This improvement is better than would be expected based on the additive effect of a mixture including polycarbonates, polyphosphonates, and organic salts. Thus, these mixtures may exhibit synergistic effects.","The polyphosphonates useful in embodiments may be any polyphosphonates known in the art including, but not limited to, those described U.S. Pat. No. 6,861,499 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,816,486, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In certain embodiments, the polyphosphonates may be characterized as exhibiting at least one, and preferably all of a broad molecular weight distribution with polydispersities of 3.2 or greater, 2.5 or greater, and 2.3 or greater, an Mof greater than about 10,000 using polystyrene standards, and a Tof at least 100\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the polyphosphonates may have a Tof about 25\u00b0 C. to about 140\u00b0 C., about 50\u00b0 C. to about 135\u00b0 C., or about 75\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C. In particular embodiments, the polyphosphonates may be prepared from a aryl phosphonic acid ester and bisphenol A or a mixture of bisphenol A and other bisphenols and a phosphonium catalyst or an alkyl metal catalyst such as a sodium catalyst, and may have a relative viscosity of at least 1.1, transparency, and improved hydrolytic stability. Such polyphosphates may be branched polyphosphonates or linear or cyclic.","In some embodiments, the amount of hydroxy aromatic to aryl phosphonic acid ester may be modified to affect properties of the polyphosphonates. For example, a polyphosphonate prepared using a phosphonium catalysts such as, for example, tetraphenyl phosphonium phenolate exhibits a Tof at least 100\u00b0 C., at least 105\u00b0 C., at least 110\u00b0 C., at least about 120\u00b0 C., at least about 130\u00b0 C., or at least about 140\u00b0 C. These polyphosphonates may exhibit a weight average molecular weight (M) ranging from about 10,000 g\/mole to about 200,000 g\/mole, about 12,000 g\/mole to about 150,000 g\/mole, about 15,000 g\/mole to about 140,000 g\/mole, about 20,000 g\/mole to about 100,000 g\/mole or any value between theses ranges based on polystyrene standards. In particular embodiments, the weight average molecular weight (M) of about 10,000 g\/mole to about 100,000 g\/mole. In general, such polyphosphonates may have a polymer dispersity of greater than about 3. In comparison, branched polyphosphonates prepared from the same monomers using sodium phenolate as catalyst, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,614, exhibits a Tof only 90\u00b0 C., an Mof 21,400 g\/mole and a dispersity of less than 2.","The term \u201ccopolyphosphonate\u201d as used herein is meant to encompass copoly(phosphonate carbonate)s and copoly(phosphonate esters) and include block copoly(phosphonate carbonate)s, random copoly(phosphonate carbonate)s, block copoly(phosphonate esters), and random copoly(phosphonate esters). The constituent components of such copolyphosphonates may include any type of phosphonate and carbonate components.","The random copolyphosphonate of various embodiments may be any random copolyphosphonate known in the art and include, for example, the random copolyphosphonates described in U.S. Provisional No. 61\/383,697 and U.S. Provisional No. 61\/383,686, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In some embodiments, the random copolyphosphonates may be prepared from at least 20 mole % high purity optionally substituted diaryl alkylphosphonate, one or more diphenyl carbonate, and one or more bisphenol, wherein the mole percent of the high purity diaryl alkylphosphonate is based on the total amount of transesterification components, i.e., total diaryl alkylphosphonate and total diphenyl carbonate.","The phosphonate and carbonate content of the copolyphosphonates may vary among embodiments, and embodiments are not limited by the phosphonate and\/or carbonate content or range of phosphonate and\/or carbonate content. For example, in some embodiments, the copolyphosphonates may have a phosphorus content that is indicative of the phosphonate content of from about 1% to about 15% by weight of the total copolyphosphonate, and in other embodiments, the phosphorous content of the copolyphosphonates of the invention may be from about 2% to about 12% or about 4% to about 10% by weight of the total polymer.","The copolyphosphonates of various embodiments exhibit both a high molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e., low polydispersity). For example, in some embodiments, the copolyphosphonates may have a weight average molecular weight (M) of about 10,000 g\/mole to about 100,000 g\/mole as determined by \u03b7or GPC using polystyrene standards, and in other embodiments, the copolyphosphonates may have a Mof from about 12,000 to about 80,000 g\/mole as determined by \u03b7or GPC using polystyrene standards. The narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e., Mw\/Mn) of such copolyphosphonates may be from about 2 to about 7 in some embodiments and from about 2 to about 5 in other embodiments. In still other embodiments, the random copolyphosphonates may have a relative viscosity of from about 1.0 to about 1.75, about 1.1 to about 1.5, about 1.2 to about 1.4, or any value between these exemplary ranges. In further embodiments, the copolyphosphonate may have a Tof about 25\u00b0 C. to about 140\u00b0 C., about 50\u00b0 C. to about 135\u00b0 C., or about 75\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C.","Without wishing to be bound by theory, the use of high purity diaryl alkylphosphonate or optionally substituted diaryl alkylphosphonate, and in particular embodiments, high purity diphenyl methylphosphonate (DPP), in the preparation of the copolyphosphonates of the invention may provide improved properties over random copolymers of the prior. The \u201chigh purity\u201d optionally substituted diaryl alkylphosphonate and DPP of various embodiments may include total acidic components of less than about 0.15% by weight, less than about 0.10% by weight, and in certain embodiments, less than about 0.05% by weight. Such acidic components are known in the art and may include, but are not limited to, phosphoric acid, phosphonic acid, methyl phosphonic acid, and methyl phosphonic acid mono phenylester. In some embodiments, the random copolyphosphonates may include substantially no acidic component contaminants, and in other embodiments, the random copolyphosphonates may include, for example, total acidic components of less than about 0.15% by weight, less than about 0.10% by weight, and in certain embodiments, less than about 0.05% by weight.","The random copolyphosphonates of the invention generally exhibit high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution, which in-turn, may impart a superior combination of properties. For example, the random copolyphosphonates of embodiments are generally tough, extremely flame retardant, and exhibit superior hydrolytic stability. In addition, the copolyphosphonates of embodiments generally exhibit an excellent combination of processing characteristics including, for example, good thermal and mechanical properties.","The block copolyphosphonates useful in embodiments of the invention may be any block copolyphosphonate known in the art. For example, the block copoly(phosphonate carbonate)s and block copoly(phosphonate ester)s may be those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,645,850, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In general, the block copolyphosphonates may include at least one phosphonate oligomer or polyphosphonate and one or more oligoester or polyester or oligocarbonate or polycarbonate covalently linked to the at least one phosphonate oligomer or polyphosphonate to form a poly(block-phosphonato-ester) or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate). In some embodiments, the at least one phosphonate oligomer or poly phosphonate and one or more polyester or polycarbonate may be linked to one another by transesterification or polycondensation, and in certain embodiments, the poly(block-phosphonato-ester) and\/or poly(block-phosphonato-cabonate) may have a single glass transition temperature (T).","The phosphonate oligomer or polyphosphonate of the block copolyphosphonates before incorporation into the block copolyphosphonate may have a solution viscosity (\u03b7) of from about 1.03 to greater than about 1.35 and may have a Tof from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 140\u00b0 C. In some embodiments the phosphonate oligomer or polyphosphonate may be branched or linear and can be prepared with up to about 50 mol. % branching agent. In other embodiments, the phosphonate oligomer of polyphosphonate may have a molecular weight (M) of from about 2,000 g\/mol to about 35,000 g\/mol, and, in certain embodiments, the phosphonate oligomer or polyphosphonate may be prepared from at least a stoichiometrically imbalanced mixture of a phosphoric acid diaryl ester and a bisphenol.","Either commercial or custom synthesized branched or linear polycarbonates may be suitable for use in embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments the polycarbonates may have a relative viscosity (\u03b7) of at least about 1.2 or from about 1.02 to about 1.2 in certain embodiments. Non-limiting examples of commercially available polycarbonates may be those available under the trade names Lexan (General Electric Company), Makrolon (Bayer AG), Apec (Bayer AG), Hiloy (ComAlloy), Calibre (Dow Chemical Co.), Lupilonx (Mitsubishi), Naxell (MRC Polymers), Edgetek (PolyOne), Trirex (Kasei) and Panlite (Teijin Chemicals). It should be understood that any polycarbonate available now or in the future may be used in embodiments of the method presented herein.","Custom polycarbonates may be prepared by any method known in the art. For example, custom polycarbonates may be synthesized from diphenyl carbonate and any known bisphenol using a transesterification catalyst, and in the case of branched polycarbonates, a branching agent, or by an interfacial polycondensation process using phosgene and any bisphenol with or without a branching agent. A variety of bisphenols can be used in such reactions, and a compilation of known bisphenols readily available and well known to those skilled in the art including those containing heterocyclic structures can be found in \u201cEngineering Plastics: A Handbook of Polyarylethers\u201d by Robert J. Cotter, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers S.A., Switzerland 1995. For example, bisphenols may include, but are not limited to, resorcinol, hydroquinone, 4,4\u2032-biphenol, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (bisphenol A), 3,3\u2032-biphenol, 4,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl ether, 4,4\u2032-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone, 9,9-dihydroxyphenyl fluorine, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-5-methylcyclohexane, 4,4\u2032-dihydroxybenzophenone, 4,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl sulfide, 1-methyl-1-phenyl bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane, bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)methane, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane, 9,9-bis(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene, 9,9-bis(3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorine, 1,4-bis[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propyl]benzene, 1,4-bis[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,5 dimethylphenyl]-2-propyl]benzene, 4,4\u2032-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)diphenyl methane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hexafluoroisopropylidene, 1-trifluoromethyl-1-phenyl bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane and combinations thereof.","Any organic salt known in the art may be used in polymer compositions embodied and described herein. An \u201corganic salt,\u201d as used herein, encompasses any compound formed by the reaction between an organic acid and an inorganic base. All such organic acids are encompassed by various embodiments. In certain embodiments, the organic salt may be a \u201csulfonic acid,\u201d which, as defined herein encompasses organic compounds including the structure R\u2014SOOH, in which the sulfur atom, S, is bonded to a carbon atom that may be part of a large aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, R, and also bonded to three oxygen atoms, O, one of which has a hydrogen atom, H, attached to it. The hydrogen atom makes the compound acidic, much as the hydrogen of a carboxylic acid. However, carboxylic acids are weak (with dissociation constants of about 10), sulfonic acids are considered strong acids (with dissociation constants of about 10).","In various exemplary embodiments, the organic salt may be the salts identified in U.S. Pat. No. 3,940,366, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Certain embodiments include articles of manufacture and coatings prepared from the polymer compositions of the invention alone or in combination with another polymer. In still other embodiments, engineering polymers of the polymer compositions may be combined with a reinforcement material such as, for example, glass, carbon, silicon carbide, organic fibers, and the like and combinations thereof to produce composites having an advantageous combination of fire resistance and dimensional stability while maintaining high HDT near that of the unmodified engineering polymer.","The polymer compositions described above including any of the components identified can be prepared by conventional means. For example, in some embodiments, the respective constituents can be mixed in a known manner and subjected to melt compounding and\/or melt extrusion at temperatures such as about 200\u00b0 C. to about 400\u00b0 C. in customary aggregates such as internal kneaders, extruders, or twin-screw apparatuses. Mixing the individual constituents can be affected either successively or simultaneously and at about room temperature (about 20\u00b0 C.) or at higher temperature. For example, in some embodiments, the copolyphosphonate, and organic salt and\/or all additional components or additives can be introduced into the polycarbonate by compounding. In other embodiments, the individual constituents can be introduced separately in different stages of the preparation process into the melt copolyphosphonate or melt polycarbonate. The form of addition of the compounds according to the invention is not limited. For example, the engineering plastics and\/or additional components or additives can be added as solids such as a powder, as concentrate in a polycarbonate powder solution.

In the case of fiber-reinforced composites, the reinforcement may be in the form of continuous, woven, or chopped fibers including, but not limited to, glass, carbon, silicon carbide, and organic fibers or combinations thereof. These articles may be well suited for a variety of applications as support parts, electrical components, electrical connectors, electrical housings, electrical covers, electrical insulators, printed wiring laminated boards, housings, covers, brackets, support structures, enclosures and subcomponents and components in consumer products that must meet UL or other standardized fire resistance standards.","The polymer compositions of the invention are generally self-extinguishing, i.e., they stop burning when removed from a flame and any drops produced by melting in a flame stop burning are almost instantly extinguished and do not readily propagate fire to any surrounding materials. Moreover, these polymer compositions do not evolve noticeable smoke when a flame is applied.","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description and the preferred versions contained within this specification. Various aspects of the present invention will be illustrated with reference to the following non-limiting examples.","Into 250 L reactor equipped with a distillation column and mechanical stirrer was placed 75 kg (328.95 mol.) 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane (bisphenol A), 26.10 kg (105.24 mol.) high purity methylphosphonic acid diphenyl ester (DPP), 49.5 kg (231.31 mol.) diphenyl carbonate, and 55 g tetraphenylphosphonium phenolate (TPPOP) catalyst which is a chemical complex of tetraphenylphosphonium phenolate and phenol consisting of about 70% and about 30% of each, respectively (m.p 145\u00b0 C.).

Specifically, the dripping was reduced in samples including CO35 and Rimar salt (Sample 4) as compared to CO35 alone (Sample 3).","Various polymer compositions including polycarbonate (PC), random copolyphosphonate having 35 mol. % phosphonate (CO 35), and potassium perfluorobutane sulfonate (Rimar salt) or 3-Phenylsulfonylbenzenesulfonic acid potassium salt (KSS) were prepared. The various components were combined in the amounts provided in TABLE 5, and the compositions were compounded in Werner and Pfleider, ZS B25 extruder with regular PC screw configuration. Compounding conditions are set-forth in TABLE 2 above, and molding conditions are provided in TABLE 3 above. Data gathered from testing of these polymer compositions are provided in TABLE 5. Compositions including copoly(phosphonato-carbonate) and PC with KSS and Rimar salt show excellent flame retardancy (V-0 under UL-94), good mechanical properties (not shown), and decreased dripping. As such, these polymer compositions provide an improvement over the prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"16"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"14","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"15","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"16","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 5"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"16","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Ingredient","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"16","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"16"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"14","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"15","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"16","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["PC -
