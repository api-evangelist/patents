title: Method for generating rocket motor data profiles for firings at various temperatures
abstract: A method for generating predictions of rocket motor ballistic performance at specific firing temperatures and for generating data profiles for analysis. The method requires generally available specifications for the rocket motor to be tested and test data from one or more test firings at a known temperature. The method is implemented in software form and generates pressure and thrust versus time data at a selected temperature. The method generates a burnback profile with a correct final web that integrates to the correct final propellant weight as well as a throat area profile and thrust coefficient profile, for the test firing temperature and for the temperature to be predicted.

Field of Invention","The present invention relates to generating rocket motor burnback data, pressure versus time, and thrust versus time data for various firing temperatures, using generally available specifications of the rocket motor and test firing data.","b. Background","In order to simulate the ballistics performance of a particular rocket motor, it is necessary to have a burnback profile. A burnback profile is developed by plotting the burn surface area as a function of the linear web burned. , ,  and  are examples of burnback profiles. The area under the curve equals the volume of propellant burned. The curve is unique for each different rocket motor and is a function of the geometry of the propellant grain. The burnback profiles are generally available only to those personnel intimately familiar with the design and development of the motor. Even when such detailed information is available, correction factors which are often unique for a given temperature must be applied to produce a valid model of ballistics performance. Test data from actual firings can be used to plot the curve and produce a burnback profile but rocket motors are normally tested at extreme temperatures only and actual firing test data is generally not available for temperatures within the normal range of use, for the rocket motor. It would be expensive and impractical to conduct a series of test firings, for each rocket motor, in order to obtain representative data for a spectrum of temperatures, so that curves could be generated from the data, for representative firing temperatures.","Computer models have been developed to take advantage of the available test data, for firings at extreme temperatures, and to produce a predicted curve. U.S. Pat. No. 6,290,505 to Garcia-uses a thrust versus time curve from a test firing and proportionally expands or contracts the base line to an interpolated ending point for a temperature, for which the data is to be modeled. A computer program produces a thrust-time curve having the same basic shape and equivalent impulse (area under the curve). The interpolation approach used in the Garcia '505 patent is more of a graphical re-proportioning of the thrust-time curve.","There remains a need for a method and a computer model which can mathematically develop an accurate curve and data profiles for a temperature different from those temperatures for which firing test data is available.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and implementation by computer model, which can mathematically develop an accurate curve for a temperature different from those temperatures for which firing test data is available.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide the computer model in the form of software which requires only readily available data from the rocket motor specifications and test firing data.","In accordance with the objects, the present invention is a method for predicting rocket motor ballistic performance at a user-selected firing temperature. The method generally involves processing the pressure and thrust data through a number of iterative steps to generate burnback profile data. First the method uses measured pressure data and varies the coefficients of a throat erosion equation so that the calculated final throat diameter matches user input data. Then the method takes the measured pressure data and varies the reference burn rate until the final calculated web burned matches a user input value. Finally, the method uses the measured pressure data, along with the calculated burn rate and throat area data, and varies the characteristic velocity until the area under the burn surface versus web burned curve equals the user input propellant weight. The result is a burnback profile with the correct final web that integrates to the correct propellant weight. This burnback profile, throat area profile, and thrust coefficient profile are useful in and of themselves for many engineering analyses. Moreover, once the input burnback profile has been generated, the temperature dependent variables are adjusted and iterative processes similar to those used to generate the burnback profile are used to generate output pressure and thrust versus time data at the output temperature. A more detailed outline of the foregoing method steps is as follows:","First, the method develops data profiles at a test firing temperature, comprising the following steps:\n\n","Second, the method develops predicted data profiles for a firing temperature selected by the user, comprising the additional steps as follows:\n\n","The foregoing method eliminates the need for knowing the actual geometry of the propellant-grain and makes use of test firing data, such as, pressure and thrust data versus time, and measured throat area, along with general propellant grain and motor design data, such as propellant weight and density, web thickness, propellant pressure coefficient, thermal expansion coefficient, and temperature sensitivity coefficient to develop a burnback profile. Additionally, the method uses the user input information together with the profiles it has generated to build data profiles for temperatures, for which no test firing data is available. The type of input data required is that which is readily available to personnel involved in the analysis on a given rocket motor.","The present invention is a method for using a computer model for generating rocket motor profiles as in , inclusive of throat area profiles and thrust coefficient profiles, all from readily available rocket motor specification data and test firing data. The present method facilitates the generation of burnback profiles and pressure and thrust versus time data at firing temperatures for which no test firing data is available. This data is valuable for predicting the ballistics performance of particular rocket motors at various temperatures.","Typically a user who is engaged in analysis of rocket motors has access to specifications including web thickness, propellant weight, propellant density, initial throat diameter, thermal expansion coefficient, temperature sensitivity coefficient and pressure exponent. The user also has access to the data from one or more test firings, usually at extreme temperatures. This data comprises values for thrust at time increments and chamber pressure at time increments.","The preferred embodiment of the present method is implemented in software form as a computer program comprising a main routine and a number of subroutines, the subroutines each performing an algorithmic calculation for collectively generating rocket motor burnback profiles and pressure and thrust versus time data from the existing data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As seen in , the flowchart verifies the presence of required data elements and calls upon the subroutine calculations of the present invention.","The method then proceeds to a first subroutine which is designated as Private Sub SetErosion that produces a throat area profile at the test firing temperature. This first subroutine accounts for the fact that thrust is influenced by chamber pressure and the area of the throat, through which the products of combustion exit. The area of the throat changes during the operation of the rocket motor due to erosion. The rate of throat erosion is given as a rate of change in the radius of the throat as follows:\n\nEi=aPi\u2003\u2003[Equation #1]\n\n","The coefficient b is set at a constant value of 0.9240 which has been determined from experimental tests of rocket motors. The model varies the coefficient a; however, the difference in the throat area profile is not significant regardless of which coefficient is varied. The throat radius, at a given increment of time is given by the equation:\n\n=(1+(1))\u2003\u2003[Equation #2]\n","Equation #2 incorporates the expression for the rate of change in throat radius due to throat erosion and yields the throat radius at a given increment of time and, when solved repeatedly for time increments over the period during which the motor operates, yields an array of incremental throat radius values.","At a given time increment, \u03c0ryields the throat area at the time increment ti. The incremental throat area is given by the equation:\n\nAti=\u03c0ri\u2003\u2003[Equation #3]\n","As shown derived from the relevant portions of the flowchart of , the subroutine designated as Private Sub SetErosion varies the coefficient a over a range of values and calculates the array of incremental throat radii, repeating the process until the final throat radius matches the final throat radius input by the user. In addition to the value for throat radius, the program can be designed to work with other dimensions of the throat, such as diameter or area. The Private Sub SetErosion subroutine uses the expression for the incremental throat radius, given by equation #2, in equation #3, including the selected value for a and solves equation #3 for each time increment to produce a throat area profile at the test firing temperature.","The variables set forth in the Private Sub SetErosion subroutine derived from  is as follows:\n\n","The incremental linear rate at which the web is burned is given by the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0061"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."},"mi":"i"},"mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."},"mi":"ref"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["P","i"]},{"mi":["P","ref"]}]}}},"mi":"n"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["Equation","#4"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["Where:","{dot over (r)}=Burn rate at reference pressure and motor conditioning temperature","P=Reference pressure (model uses 1500 pounds per square inch)","n=Pressure exponent input by the user"]}}}},"The total linear web burned as of time increment \u201ci\u201d is given by the equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0067"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["wb","i"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"wb","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."},"mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."},"mi":"i"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["Equation","#5"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":"Where: wb=Total linear web burned as of time increment \u201ci\u201d\n\nThe Private Sub SetBurnRate subroutine derived from the flowchart of  uses the expression for the incremental linear burn rate given by equation #4 and solves equation #5 repeatedly, varying the reference burn rate in an iterative process until the total linear web burned at the end of the firing matches the user input value for web thickness.

The results are shown in , and represent a close correlation of the two method outputs for a 70 degree firing temperature as well as a consistent result for a firing temperature between the two extreme temperatures.

The same process was performed using MK 111 rocket motors, with results shown in  and on the MK 75 rocket motor, as shown in .","Having fully described the present invention, it will be appreciated that minor variations in the manipulation of the data may be used to produce the same results, without departing from the essence of the invention disclosed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
