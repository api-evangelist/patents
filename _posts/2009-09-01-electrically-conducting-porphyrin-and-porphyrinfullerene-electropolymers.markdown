No. 60\/892,757, filed Mar. 2, 2007. Both priority applications are incorporated herein in their entirety.","The invention was made with government support under Grant No. DE-FG02-03ER15393 awarded by United States Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This description relates to electropolymerizable monomers with fullerene and porphyrin subunits, polymers produced by electrooxidation of the monomers, and use of the polymers in photovoltaic devices.","One of the major applications of conducting polymers is as a component of an \u201corganic\u201d or \u201cbulk heterojunction\u201d photovoltaic cell for making electricity from sunlight. Organic solar cells generally include a layer of transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass, a layer of hole-conducting polymer mixed with an organic or inorganic electron-conducting phase, and a third layer of a low-work-function metal such as aluminum. Light is absorbed by the polymer in the photovoltaic cell; the resulting excitation then migrates to a phase boundary with the electron-conducting phase, and an electron is injected from the polymer. The electrons migrate to the metal through the electron-conducting phase, and holes migrate to the ITO via the polymer, generating a photocurrent.","Conducting polymers for use in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic conductors (\u201cwires\u201d), some of which may be electropolymerized, have been reported. These polymers include, for example, polyacetylenes, polyphenyleneethynylenes (PPE), polyphenylenevinylenes (PPV), polythiophenes, and polyanilines. The structural variations of these polymers are typically changes in the organic substituent groups attached to the basic polymer backbone. The substituents can change the electrical properties of the polymer, its processing and mechanical properties, and its compatibility\/interfacing with other materials. Typically, it is possible to write delocalized structures for these polymers that allow conductivity through the polymer backbone. Often, some type of \u201cdoping\u201d is required to achieve good conductivity.","Such organic photovoltaic cells have very low efficiencies (i.e., less than about 5%) due to incomplete conversion of excitons to charge separation, recombination of electrons and holes within the organic layer or at the electrodes, and a lack of efficient light absorption throughout the solar spectral range. The lack of electron acceptors covalently bonded to the polymer strands can lead to inefficient conversion of excitons to charge separation, rapid charge recombination, high concentrations of carriers at interface areas (leading to increased recombination), the need to prepare bicontinuous phases of polymer and fullerene or other electron carriers (which adds to processing requirements), and the need to use excessive amounts of the electron transport phase.","In one aspect, a compound has the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"44.11mm","wi":"70.02mm","file":"US08669359-20140311-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Each Ris independently \u2014H, -alkyl, or alkenyl.

Porphyrin-fullerene electropolymers and other polymers made from molecular dyad monomers inhibit incomplete conversion of excitons to charge separation due to recombination during exciton migration by carrying out charge separation at the site of light absorption. The recombination of charges is thought to be inhibited due to the inherently long lifetime of porphyrin-fullerene charge separation, thus reducing the formation of cut-off \u201cislands\u201d of conducting phases, providing an electron-blocking, hole-transport layer attached to a transparent electrode, and eliminating the concentration of charges at a severely limited amount of interface between conducting phases. In addition, a mechanism is provided, via substitution on the porphyrin, for tuning the absorption spectrum of the polymer to better utilize the solar spectrum.","Porphyrin and porphyrin-fullerene electropolymers described herein are electrically conducting and absorb light strongly in the UV and visible spectral regions. These polymers are readily prepared with or without metal atoms in each porphyrin unit, and can be used as materials in solar photovoltaic cells, such as solid film solar cells and redox-solution-containing solar cells, based on organic materials. Embodiments of photovoltaic devices with the described electropolymers are advantageously low cost and easy to fabricate and process. The polymers can be fabricated on flexible materials. They have a wide acceptance angle for light and provide high efficiency conversion of light to electrical power in the absence of rare chemical elements.","Synthesis of porphyrin monomers and metal complexes thereof, electropolymerization of these monomers to form electrically conducting polymers with a porphyrin macrocycle as part of the polymer backbone, and uses of these materials are described herein. Porphyrin macrocycles used to form electropolymers described herein can include aryl ring(s) at porphyrin meso position(s) bearing an amino group in position 4 relative to the porphyrin macrocycle, and at least one unsubstituted (hydrogen-bearing) meso position with the 10-, 15- and\/or 20-relationship to the aryl ring bearing the amino group. As an example, structure 1 shows a metal complex of a standard porphyrin ring and a 5,15 relationship of the substituent-free and aminophenyl-bearing meso-positions. Compound 2 is a non-fullerene-containing embodiment of structure 1, and compound 3 is a fullerene-containing embodiment of structure 1.

The resulting ITO\/polymer electrodes were sandwiched near a platinized FTO conductive glass second electrode at a spacing of 0.25 \u03bcm using heat-seal plastic. Predrilled holes in the FTO electrode allowed introduction of solution into the gap between electrodes. An acetonitrile solution of 100 mM 1,4-benzoquinone and 1.0 mM 1,4-hydroquinone as redox carrier, with 150 mM tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as supporting electrolyte, was introduced into the space between the electrodes.","Photoinduced electrical current was determined using a xenon lamp light source and monochromator. Electrical current was measured under illumination and in the dark, and the dark current was subtracted to obtain the photocurrent.  shows the results of illumination of the cell. Plot  is the absorption spectrum of the transparent electrode as determined on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Plot  is the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) as determined from measurements of the cell, electrode, and light source. The IPCE represents the fraction of photons incident on the electrode that give rise to electrons in the external circuit.","As indicated by , the cell generated photovoltage and photocurrent upon exposure to light, and therefore performed as a photovoltaic or solar cell. The IPCE as a function of wavelength resembles the absorption spectrum of the transparent electrode, showing that the light giving rise to the photovoltage and photocurrent was absorbed by the electropolymerized porphyrinic material on the electrode surface. Photocurrent was generated by light from at least 350 nm to beyond 700 nm, representing a significant fraction of the solar spectrum on Earth. The electrons flowed from the electropolymerized porphyrinic material into the solution by reduction of benzoquinone, into the FTO non-illuminated electrode, through the external circuit, and into the ITO transparent electrode and the electropolymerized porphyrinic material film.","A redox-solution-containing solar cell was constructed with a film grown from porphyrin-fullerene compound 3 (free base). This cell generated greater photocurrent and photovoltage than the cell described in Example 15.","It is understood that the foregoing detailed description and accompanying Examples are merely illustrative and are not to be taken as limitations upon the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.
