Field of the Invention","Methods and apparatuses consistent with the present invention relate to performing an internet protocol television (IPTV) communication service by using plug-in application programming interfaces (APIs) of a web browser, the APIs being independent of an IPTV communication service provider.","2. Description of the Related Art","An internet protocol television (IPTV) communication service denotes a service providing an information service, a video content service, and a broadcasting service to TVs through an IP network, that is, a high-speed internet network. As a communication-broadcasting convergent service is being developed, interest in IPTV services is growing. Activation of the IPTV service may greatly affect not only communication and broadcasting industries but also content manufacturing and home appliance industries.","Conventionally, in order for an IPTV service user to be provided with the IPTV service through an IP network, the IPTV service user may own set-top boxes that are different for each IPTV vendor. Only the IPTV service user who owns an IPTV set-top box manufactured according to the standards set by an IPTV service provider providing an IPTV service may be provided with the IPTV service from the corresponding IPTV service provider. For example, when there are three IPTV service providers A, B, and C, a user who purchases A's set-top box may only use an IPTV service provided from A. Also, in order to use an IPTV service from B or C, a set-top box manufactured by B or C are separately purchased. Due to such a compatibility problem between the IPTV services and the set-top boxes, selection of the IPTV services is limited and consequently, the quality of the IPTV services deteriorates or it is difficult to expand a service base.","In this regard, an open IPTV forum has been recently established and the standardization is under discussion. In this forum, common standards, which are not dependent upon IPTV service providers, are formed and the provision of IPTV services to service users based on the common standards is under discussion.","The open IPTV forum aims to form an interface and a hardware platform which are not dependent upon IPTV service providers and to use IPTV services provided from a plurality of IPTV service providers by users. According to open IPTV forum architecture, even if the user does not own the set-top boxes that are different for each IPTV service provider, the user may use the IPTV services provided from a plurality of different IPTV service providers and thus a range of selection for the services may be expanded.","In order for the user to use the services provided from the plurality of different IPTV service providers, apparatuses for relaying services provided from the plurality of different IPTV service providers are present in a residential network having functional architecture according to the open IPTV forum. The apparatuses may be entities such as Application Gateway (AG), IMS Gateway (IG), and CSP Gateway (CG) according to the functional architecture of the open IPTV forum. These relaying apparatuses receive IPTV services provided from a provider network outside of the residential network and relay the received IPTV services to a terminal included in the residential network.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method and apparatus for performing an internet protocol television (IPTV) communication service by using plug-in application programming interfaces (APIs) of a web browser, the APIs being independent of an IPTV communication service provider, and a computer readable recording medium having embodied thereon a computer program for executing the method.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of performing an internet protocol television (IPTV) communication service, the method including: acquiring an application message providing the IPTV communication service from an external input with respect to a general-purpose web application by using plug-in application programming interfaces (APIs) of a web browser which are independent of an IPTV communication service provider; sending the application message to an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) gateway (IG) functional entity apparatus; and receiving a response message comprising a result of processing the application message as a response to the sending of the application message from the IG functional entity apparatus.","The method may further include: receiving an application message providing the IPTV communication service from the IG functional entity apparatus; sending the application message to the web browser by using the plug-in APIs for processing an event informing reception of the application message; and outputting the application message through the general-purpose web application.","The method may further include: acquiring a session setting request message for the application providing the IPTV communication service from an external input with respect to the general-purpose web application by using the plug-in APIs; sending the session setting request message to the IG functional entity apparatus; and receiving a response message for the session setting request message from the IG entity apparatus.","The sending of the application message and the reception of the application message may be performed during the set session.","The method may further include: acquiring a session completion request message for the application providing the IPTV communication service from an external input with respect to the general-purpose web application by using the plug-in APIs; sending the session completion request message to the IG functional entity apparatus; and receiving a response message for the session completion request message from the IG functional entity apparatus.","The plug-in APIs for acquiring the application message providing the IPTV communication service may include messages to be sent to a remote user and a remote user identifier as input arguments.","The plug-in APIs for processing an event informing reception of the application message may include a received message as a return value.","The plug-in APIs for acquiring the session setting request message may include a session identifier (ID) as return values.","The plug-in APIs for acquiring the session completion request message may include a session identifier (ID) as an input argument.","The plug-in APIs for acquiring the application message providing the IPTV communication service on the set session may include a message to be sent to the remote user and the session ID as input arguments.","The plug-in APIs for processing an event informing about reception of the application message during the set session may include a received message as a return value.","The method may further include: performing at least one of the plug-in APIs providing a list of users who use the IPTV communication service, the length of the list of users, specific user information for a specific index in the list of users, a function of adding a specific user to the list of users, a function of deleting a specific user from the list of users, and a function of modifying a specific user in the list of users.","The method may further include: performing at least one of the plug-in APIs providing the number of user groups formed of the list of users who use the IPTV communication service, specific user group information for a specific index in the user groups, a function of adding a specific user group to the user groups, and a function of deleting a specific user group from the user groups.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an open IPTV Terminal Function (OITF) entity apparatus including: a first plug-in unit acquiring an application message providing the IPTV communication service from an external input with respect to a general-purpose web application by using plug-in application programming interfaces (APIs) of a web browser which are independent of an IPTV communication service provider; an application message sending unit sending the application message to an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) gateway (IG) functional entity apparatus; and a response message receiving unit receiving a response message comprising a result of processing the application message as a response to the sending of the application message from the IG functional entity apparatus.","The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.
