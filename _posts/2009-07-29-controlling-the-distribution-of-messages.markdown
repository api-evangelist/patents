{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","OVERVIEW OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to electronic communications.","Electronic messages such as electronic mail (email), text messaging such as Short Messaging Service (SMS), instant messaging (IM), voicemail, etc. are a popular form of communications. Two popular functions of these types of communication are the capability of sending messages to a group of people and the ability to forward messages. User agents provide user friendly functions to forward and reply to messages. Address books can be employed in order to provide a convenient way to specify the addresses of the recipients and to create and process groups.","The following presents a simplified overview of the example embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the example embodiments. This overview is not an extensive overview of the example embodiments. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the example embodiments nor delineate the scope of the appended claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the example embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with an example embodiment, there is disclosed herein an apparatus, comprising a user interface, a communication interface, and logic coupled to the user interface and communication interface. The logic is responsive to receiving a request via the user interface to send a message to a recipient and to limit distribution of the message to a group of recipients to associate data with the message indicating the message is a private message and data representative of the group into the message. The logic is further configured to send the message to the recipient via the communication interface.","In accordance with an example embodiment, there is disclosed herein an apparatus comprising a user interface, a communication interface, and logic coupled to the user interface and communication interface. The logic is configured to receiving a request via the user interface to forward a message to a recipient to determine whether distribution of the message is restricted to a group. The logic is further configured to determine whether the recipient is a member of the group responsive to determining distribution of the message restricted to a group. The logic is configured to send the message to the recipient via the communication interface responsive to determining the recipient is a member of the group.","In accordance with an example embodiment, there is disclosed herein a method for limiting the forwarding of a message. The method comprises receiving a request to forward a message to a recipient. A determination is made whether distribution is of the message is restricted to a group of recipients. If the distribution of the message is restricted to a group of recipients, a determination is made whether recipient is a member of the group of recipients. If the recipient is a member of the group, the message is forwarded to the recipient.","This description provides examples not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. The figures generally indicate the features of the examples, where it is understood and appreciated that like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements. Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d or \u201can example embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described is included in at least one embodiment described herein and does not imply that the feature, structure, or characteristic is present in all embodiments described herein.","In an example embodiment, when a person is addressing a voicemail or email message, they are given the option to mark it private. If they mark it private, they are also given the option to specify who the recipient is allowed to forward the message to. If the message sender does not specify anyone then the recipient cannot forward that message to anyone.","In an example embodiment, if the sender of the message is using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) client, once they choose to mark the message as private, the User Interface (UI) will then present a list of groups that the sender is a member. These can be voicemail distribution lists, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) groups, mailer lists, and\/or groups that are defined by external social networking applications. Users and administrators can define what groups are presented in this UI. The sender then selects individual people or groups that the recipient of the private message is allowed to forward it on to (if they so choose). If the sender of the message is using the voicemail TUI\/VUI (telephone user interface\/voice user interface), once they choose to mark the message as private, the voicemail system will play a list of groups that the recipient is allowed to forward to. The list of groups is the-same as the ones presented in the GUI client described above. The sender then selects from that list using DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) input or voice commands processed by a speech recognition system. The sender then sends the message. The recipient after receiving the private message can record an introduction to the message before forwarding it on to a member the group that was identified by the original sender.","The following illustrates an example of the operations of a system in accordance with an example embodiment. As a message originator selects the forward option she hears the same prompts as with existing systems plus a new prompt giving her the option of allowing forwarding within a private group. If the user selects this option the user is given the options of entering the addresses (via DTMF input\/speech commands) of the group or the team members who are allowed to hear the message or just enter a group\/\u201cfamily\u201d\/team name or number. It should be noted that if a user does not want to use this new feature, their user interface does not change.","As the message gets forwarded within the group and the overall message chain becomes longer, users may not listen to all of the voicemail chain and forget that the originator requested to keep the information within the group (or \u201cwithin the family\u201d). If that user attempts to forward the message to another user who is not within the group, the system alerts this user with a prompt such as \u201cI am sorry but you cannot forward this private message to people who are not in the group\u201d.","Alternatively, the system may provide a prompt to alert the user if the message is being forwarded to someone who is not a member of the group. The system confirms that the user wishes to proceed with forwarding the message, and if so, the message is forwarded all other recipients that belong to the group, but not the person who does not belong to the group.","Although this example mostly focuses on the voicemail scenario, those skilled in the art can readily appreciate that these principles can be applied to any form of messaging that allows for the sending of private messages (such as email, IM (Instant Message, text messages, Short Message Service \u201cSMS\u201d text messages, etc). Therefore, the principles described herein should not be construed as restricted to a voice mail environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106"]},"In an example embodiment, logic  is responsive to receiving a request via user interface  to send a message to a recipient and to limit distribution of the message to a group of recipients to associate data with the message indicating the message is a private message and data representative of the group into the message. The message may suitably be any type of message. For example the message may be compatible with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), etc. Logic  is configured to send the message to the recipient via communication interface .","In an example embodiment, the message is received via user interface . For example, a user may key in the message using an application such as electronic mail (email), Instant Messaging (IM), Simple Message Service (SMS) text, Multi-Media Message Service (MMS), or the user may employ an audio interface to record a voice mail message, etc. The message may stored in a memory (see e.g. memory  in ) while being processed.","In an example embodiment, logic  is configured to receive group data from user interface . For example, the user may select a predefined group using a pointing device, key in or provide an audio signal indicating the name of the group. In particular embodiments, a user may retrieve social networking data via communication interface  and select individual recipients or groups who are allowed to receive the message. Note that individual recipients or groups who are allowed to receive the message may not be recipients of the message. That is control of the message can be asserted over the message such that a recipient of the message can forward the message to a third party recipient who was not a recipient of the original message provided that the third party recipients is a member of a group allowed to receive the message.","In an example embodiment, a user can employ user interface  to dynamically create a recipient group. For example, a user may select individual recipients to receive the message. Logic  will associate data representative of the individual recipients with the group of recipients allowed to receive forwarded messages. It should be noted that the original list of recipients to which the original message is addressed can either be the same as the group of people to whom the message can be forwarded (with or without additional comments) or to a subset of a broader group of people to whom the message (with or without additional comments) may be forwarded.","In an example embodiment, logic  is configured to insert the data representative of the group into the message. For example the message may suitably comprise a header. The data representative of the group can be inserted into the header of the message. In particular embodiments, the data may be inserted into the message as envelope information and\/or metadata. As another example, the data may be inserted into an X-header added to the message.","In an example embodiment, logic  is configured to send data representative of the group with data identifying the message to an external device via the communication interface. For example, the data may be sent to an email server with information identifying the message so that the email server can control distribution of the message.","In an example embodiment, apparatus  is employed for receiving a message having associated data for controlling distribution and forwarding the message accordingly. For example, logic  is configured to receiving a request via user interface  to forward a message to a recipient. Logic  determines whether distribution of the message is restricted to a group. If distribution of the message is restricted to a group, logic  determines whether the recipient designated to receive the forwarded message is a member of the group allowed to receive the message. Logic  is configured to forward the message to the recipient via communication interface  responsive to determining the recipient is a member of the group.","In an example embodiment , the message to be forwarded is retrieved from a memory  associated with logic  which is illustrated in . For example, when the message is first received, it may be received via communication interface  and stored in memory . When data is received via user interface  to forward the message, logic  retrieves the message from memory , and if forwarding of the message is permitted, the message is forwarded to a recipient via communication interface .","In an example embodiment, logic  determines whether distribution is restricted to a group based on data stored within the message. For example logic  may extract the data from envelope information, meta data, header information and\/or a combination thereof. In another example embodiment, logic  is configured to communicate with an external device via communication interface  to obtain data representative of group members. For example, as will be discussed herein with reference  infra, forwarding data may reside on a server. In an example embodiment, the data is obtained from a social networking website. In yet another example embodiment, data may be employed from a combination of the aforementioned sources.","In an example embodiment, data may be received via user interface  to forward the message to multiple sources. For example, data may be received requesting the message be forwarded to a first recipient and a second recipient (or any number of recipients, two are illustrated in this example merely for ease of illustration). Logic  determines whether the message can be forwarded to each designated recipient (whether the recipient is a group recipient or an individual recipient). For example if the first recipient is allowed to receive a forwarded version of the message but the second recipient is not, the message is forwarded only to the first recipient. If both the first and second recipients are allowed to receive a forwarded version of the message, then both will receive the forwarded message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310","302","304","302","304","302","304","306","308","302","304","304","306","308","306"]},"In another example embodiment, messages and data representative of a group permitted to receive a forwarded version of the message (for example the message may be edited before being forwarded) are stored at message server . When message server receives a request to forward a message, message server  verifies from data associated with the message whether the designated recipients are allowed to receive the forwarded message. In other example embodiments, data representative of a group allowed to receive the forwarded message is stored at user device  while the message is stored at message server , and\/or data representative of a group allowed to receive the forwarded message is stored at message server  while the message is stored at user device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","400","106","400","302","304"]},"Computer system  includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information and a processor  coupled with bus  for processing information. Computer system  also includes a main memory , such as random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor . Main memory  also may be used for storing a temporary variable or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor . Computer system  further includes a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to bus  for storing static information and instructions for processor . A storage device , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions.","Computer system  may be coupled via bus  to a display  such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g. x) and a second axis (e.g. y) that allows the device to specify positions in a plane. Display , input device  and\/or cursor control  may be employed to implement user interface  (). In some related embodiment the input device may include a microphone used for recording voice messages and\/or a DTMF keypad. Similarly in this embodiment the display  may include also a speaker capable of playing out a voice message.","An aspect of the example embodiment is related to the use of computer system  for controlling the distribution of messages. According to an example embodiment, controlling the distribution of messages is provided by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device . Execution of the sequence of instructions contained in main memory  causes processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement an example embodiment. Thus, embodiments described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media and volatile media. Non-volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Common forms of computer-readable media include for example floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASHPROM, CD, DVD or any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system  can receive the data. The instructions received by main memory  may optionally be stored on storage device  either before or after execution by processor .","Computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling computer system  to a network link  that is connected to a local network . For example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. As another example, communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In another example embodiment the communication interface  may be an IP based communication link. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","Network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . ISP  in turn provides data communications through the worldwide packet data communication network, now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d . As another example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to ISP , Internet  to server . For example, computer system  may send and\/or receive messages via host  and\/or server .","In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above, methodologies ,  in accordance with example embodiments will be better appreciated with reference to  respectively. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies of  are shown and described as executing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the example embodiments are not limited by the illustrated order, as some aspects could occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other aspects from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated features may be required to implement methodologies , . The methodologies described herein are suitably adapted to be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["500","502","102"]},"At , it is determined whether forwarding of the message should be allowed. For example, a display may be presented on a user interface prompting a user to indicate whether the message can be forwarded and\/or whether forwarding of the message should be restricted. If the message can be forwarded without any restrictions (YES), at  the message is sent.","If forwarding of the message is not permitted (NO), then at  data indicating that the message is private is associated with the message. The data may be associated with the message using any suitable technique. For example, the data may be stored separately in which case a link between the data and the message would be maintained. As another example, the data may be stored with the message, for example as envelope information and\/or header information such as an X-header. At , the message is sent.","If forwarded of the message is to be restricted to one or more (a group) of recipients (RESTRICTED), at , data indicating that the message is private is associated with the message. The data may be associated with the message using any suitable technique. For example, the data may be stored separately in which case a link between the data and the message would be maintained. As another example, the data may be stored with the message, for example as envelope information and\/or header information such as an X-header. In addition at  data is obtained identifying the group of recipients permitted to receive a forwarded version (for example the message may be edited or augmented with additional context before being forwarded) of the message. The data representative of the group of permitted to receive a forwarded version of the message is associated with the message. This information may be stored with the data indicating the message is private or may be stored elsewhere. For example, data indicating the message is private may be stored within the message while the data representative of the group permitted to receive a forwarded version of the message may be stored in a different part of the message or may be stored at a remote server.

If the recipient is not a member of the group permitted to receive a forwarded version of the message (NO), at , forwarding of the message is denied. In an example embodiment, if the request to forward the message at  comprises a plurality of recipients and distribution of the message is restricted to a group of recipients, then  and where appropriate  or  is performed for each recipient It should be noted that the system described above has the advantage that it continuously updates itself to changes in group dynamics. For example assume that a restricted message is sent with forwarding permission restricted to group A. Also assume that at the time the message is sent Joe is a member of group A. After some time Joe's membership in group A is revoked and he is no longer a member of group A. If someone attempts to forward the message again, the system notifies them that it will not be sent to Joe (who was on the original distribution list) as he is no longer a member of group A.","Described above are example embodiments. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the example embodiments are possible.
