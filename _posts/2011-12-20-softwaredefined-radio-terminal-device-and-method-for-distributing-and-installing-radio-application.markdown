Most radio applications such as LTE (Long term Evolution), WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), WIMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), and the like, are executed on a terminal while interacting with a modem.","In order for these radio applications to control the modem, unique commands, which a corresponding modem has, should be understood depending on modem manufacturer or model, and a module that can achieve this should be developed and applied.
