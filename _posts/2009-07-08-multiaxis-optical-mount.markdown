title: Multi-axis optical mount
abstract: A mounting mechanism is provided for aligning and securing an optical instrument to a platform. The mechanism includes a housing, a trunnion and a base-plate. The housing receives the optical instrument along a longitudinal axis. The housing includes an attach support for the optical instrument, and an interface having vertically-facing cylindrical-fastener orifices. The trunnion supports the housing at the interface. The trunnion has pluralities of vertical slots and horizontal slots. Each vertical slot overlaps a corresponding vertical orifice. The vertical slots provide elevation displacement to vertically translate and pitch the housing. The horizontal slots provide lateral displacement to horizontally translate and yaw the housing. The base-plate supports the trunnion and is mountable onto the platform. The base-plate has a plurality of horizontally-facing cylindrical-fastener orifices. Each horizontal slot on the trunnion overlaps a corresponding horizontal orifice on the base-plate. Each orifice of the vertically- and horizontally-facing orifices receives a cylindrical-fastener that passes through a counterpart slot of the vertical and horizontal slots. Each cylindrical fastener for each orifice corresponds to a helical screw.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to devices for securely mounting and aligning precision optical components. In particular, such mounts are intended to provide precise alignment in multiple axes for instruments, such as a fiber laser collimator.","Optical devices employ mounting mechanisms to provide alignment relative to a platform to be oriented with respect to line-of-sight. Such devices are designed to adjust for pitch, yaw and roll pivoting, as well as lateral and vertical translation.","Precision optical systems require mounting and adjusting of multiple components along the optical path to accomplish a given task. Four (4) adjustments commonly required include tip-tilt and translation in two (2) axes at either end. These adjustments are typically performed by two separate mounts and actuators, one for tip-tilt and one for both translations.","Conventional optical mounts yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a mount with overlapping orifices on either the base-plate or the housing for an optical element and slots on the intervening cradle to receive fasteners that enable horizontal and vertical adjustment.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a mounting mechanism for aligning and securing an optical instrument to a platform. The mechanism includes a housing, a trunnion (or cradle) and a base-plate. The housing receives the optical instrument along a longitudinal axis. The housing includes an attach support for the optical instrument, and an interface having vertically-facing cylindrical-fastener orifices.","The trunnion supports the housing at the interface. The trunnion has pluralities of vertical slots and horizontal slots. Each vertical slot overlaps a corresponding vertical orifice. The vertical slots provide elevation displacement to vertically translate the housing. The horizontal slots provide lateral displacement to horizontally translate the housing.","The base-plate supports the trunnion and is mountable onto the platform. The base-plate has a plurality of horizontally-facing cylindrical-fastener orifices. Each horizontal slot on the trunnion overlaps a corresponding horizontal orifice on the base-plate. Each orifice of the vertically- and horizontally-facing orifices receives a cylindrical-fastener that passes through a counterpart slot of the vertical and horizontal slots. Each cylindrical fastener for each orifice corresponds to a helical screw","The housing and trunnion can include parallel and overlapping ledges to enable jack-screws to pass therethrough to inhibit wobble. In various exemplary embodiments, the housing is unitary. In alternate embodiments, the housing comprises several interfacing components.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Conventional actuators can be unwieldably large and do not usually permit the researcher to lock them securely once the desired adjustment has been made, being laboratory devices. These devices occupy a much greater volume (roughly double) for the same number of axes than provided by various exemplary embodiments. Additionally, conventional methods typically incorporate active drive in only a single direction of an axis, while relying on springs to maintain preload and restrict motion in the opposite direction. This results in a device having stability only in the confines of a laboratory, and therefore not being sufficiently rugged to be suitable for field or military use.","Various exemplary embodiments consist of three major components:","First, a main housing that mounts the optical component, such as a fiber laser collimator shown in the drawings. The housing contains a spherical plastic bearing at one end, and multiple setscrews at the other. By driving opposing screws in opposite directions, the optical device rotates about the spherical bearing, providing tip-tilt motion.","Second, a trunnion that supports the main housing. This mates with the main housing and base-plate and provides vertical translation of the main housing and optical component relative to the trunnion. It incorporates multiple very fine pitch jack-screws (80-threads\/inch) and lock-screws which drive and subsequently lock vertical motion between the trunnion and main housing.","Third, a base-plate that supports the trunnion. This provides horizontal translation of the trunnion, main housing, and optical device relative to the baseplate. It incorporates one very fine pitch jack screw (80 threads\/inch) and lock screws which drive and lock horizontal motion between the base-plate and trunnion.","The incorporation of multiple axes of adjustment in a small volume represents a particular advantage of the exemplary embodiments. Conventional means usually require at least two separate devices to accomplish the same task. In particular, conventional devices separately employ a first mechanical stage to perform tip-tilt adjustment and a second mechanical stage to perform horizontal translation. Each of the two separate devices usually require approximately the volume used in these embodiments to perform both adjustments. Another important advantage and novel capability of these embodiments involves securely locking the device in position after completing the required adjustments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","110","125","130","110","140","125","150","140"]},"The housing  adjustably clamps the optical element  with four (4) tip-tilt opposing adjustment lock-screws  arranged in cruciform pattern at the aft end. In alternative configurations, the housing  can be adjustable or replaced with a cylindrical container to receive another device with a different geometry than the optical element . The interface  and trunnion  connect together by three (3) vertical axis jack-screws . The trunnion  and the base-plate  attach at their corresponding corners with four (4) horizontal axis lock-screws  mounted vertically.","Four (4) vertical axis lock-screws  enable adjustment of tilt alignment between the trunnion  and the interface  of the housing  the four vertical axis lock-screws . Two (2) mount screws  attach the base-plate  to the stationary platform (not shown). The pair of mount screws  connects at fore and aft ends of the base-plate  to the platform.","A compass rose  displays relative orientation axes of the assembly along the longitudinal axis (fore and aft), horizontal lateral axis (port and starboard) and vertical lateral axis (top and bottom). These orthogonal axes further indicate respective roll, pitch and yaw rotation. The optical mount using the lock-screws  and  can adjustably translate the optical element  in two of these: lateral and vertical directions.
