No. 60\/474,453 filed May 31, 2003 which priority is claimed.","This invention was made with government support under grant number BES-01194889 (NSF). The federal government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to improved cyanine and indocyanine bioconjugates; and, particularly to improved site-specific is delivery for optical tomographic, endoscopic, photoacoustic, sonofluorescent, laser assisted guided surgery, and therapeutic purposes.","2. Background of the Prior Art","Several dyes, including derivatives of fluorescein and carbocyanine, that emit light in the visible and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum have in the past and are currently being used for various biomedical applications due to their bioconnpatibility, high molar absorptivity, or high fluorescence quantum yields. This high sensitivity parallels that of nuclear medicine and permits visualization of organs and tissues without the negative effect of ionizing radiation. Most dyes lack specificity for particular organs or tissues and, hence, these dyes must be attached to bioactive carriers such as proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and the like to deliver the dyes to specific regions in the body. Several studies on the use of near infrared dyes and dye-biomolecule conjugates have been published (Patonay et al., 1991; Slavik, 1994 Brinkley, 1993; Lee and Woo, U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,505; Hohenschuh, WO 98\/48846; Turner et al., WO 98\/22146; Licha et al., WO 96\/17628; and Snow et al., WO 98\/48838). Of particular interest is the targeting of tumor cells with antibodies or other large protein carriers as delivery vehicles (Becker, et al., 1999). Such an approach has been widely used in nuclear medical applications, and the major advantage is the retention of a carrier's tissue specificity since the molecular volume of the dye is substantially smaller than the carrier. However, this approach does have some serious limitations in that the diffusion of high molecular weight bioconjugates to tumor cells is highly unfavorable, and is further complicated by the net positive pressure in solid tumors (Jain, 1994). Furthermore, many dyes in general, and cyanine dyes, in particular, tend to form aggregates in aqueous media that lead to fluorescence quenching.","Therefore, to solve these problems, U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,848 disclosed dye-peptide conjugates, including several cyanine dyes with a variety of bis- and tetrakis (carboxylic acid) homologues. The small size of the compounds allowed more favorable delivery to tumor cells, as compared to larger molecular weight imaging agents.","A typical example of the cyanine compounds used to make these conjugates is indoacyanine green (ICG) which absorbs and emits light in the near infrared region (NIR) wavelengths.","However, many drawbacks have been encountered in the use of these recently developed compounds. First, it is difficult to alter their spectral properties to coincide with a desired biological or chemical event, thereby limiting the scope of their functionality as imaging agents. For example, the fluorescence emission and fluorescence lifetime of ICG, in the tissue itself, do not significantly change in situ; and hence, the ICG derivatives cannot be used effectively as a reporter molecules to monitor the functional events such as enzyme activity, and gene expression, as they occur. To circumvent this problem, recent studies have used a \u201cpro-drug\u201d approach, where the fluorescence signal, from a pre-quenched carbocyanine compound, is detected in response to a diagnostic biological event, such as increased local acidity in solid tumors, or high expression of some proteases in metastatic tumors [Bremer C., et al., \u201cImaging of differential protease expression in breast cancers for detection of aggressive tumor phenotypes\u201d, 222, 814-818 (2002); Weissleder R., \u201cA clearer vision for in vivo imaging\u201d, 19, 316-317 (2001)].","Unfortunately, this \u201cpro-drug\u201d approach relies on the stacking of dyes on a polymer backbone to achieve some level of decrease in fluorescence emission. In addition, the large size of the copolymer-probe conjugate used precludes rapid delivery of the probe to solid tumors. Moreover, the delivery method is nonspecific and the major photophysical feature of the dye that was affected was a reduction in the fluorescence emission of the polymeric material, rather than the tissue itself. Thus, availability of intramolecularly-quenched carbocyanine compounds, coupled with specific delivery to target tissue for functional imaging events such as enzyme activity and gene expression remain an unmet need.","Another problem with the recent carbocyanine dye-bioconjugates, is in vivo instability. That is, the bioactive carrier molecule, such as a peptide, is attached to the dye via its N-terminus, where the peptide is susceptible to degradation by exopeptidases via the C-terminus.","Also, the routine use of cyanine bioconjugate compounds in clinical settings as imaging agents is inhibited by the potential for hepatobilliary toxicity resulting from the rapid clearance of these dyes by the liver. This is associated with the tendency of carbocyanine compounds to form aggregates in solution, which could be taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver. Various attempts to obviate this problem have not been very successful. Typically, hydrophilic peptides, polyethyleneglycol or oligosaccharide conjugates have been used but these resulted in excessively long-circulating products that are eventually cleared by the liver.","It would be a welcomed advancement in the industry to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks of the prior art.","The publications and other materials used herein to support the background of the invention or provide additional details respecting the practice, are incorporated by reference, and for convenience are respectively listed in the appended List of Reference.","In one principal aspect of the present invention there is improved ease with which to alter the spectral properties of cyanine bioconjugates as a function of particular biological or chemical events.","In another principal aspect of the invention there is an improvement in the delivery of the bioconjugates to targeted tumors or other biomasses.","Also, an unexpected aspect of this invention is that the macrocyclic bioconjugates have improved stability, as far example, against degradation by exopeptidases, while retaining high receptor binding affinity of peptides, even though carboxyl, alcoholic or otherwise terminal substituents are not free.","Also, although not completely understood, it is believed that a further aspect of the invention may allow solvent-induced aggregation in solution to be disrupted, and allow a unique mechanism for the bioconjugates to more rapidly clear the liver.","These aspects of the invention and others which will become more apparent from the ensuing Summary, Detailed Description, Figures and Examples, are made possible by intramolecularly cross-linked carbocyanine, cyanine or indocyanine bioconjugates including cross-linked bioconjugates of fluorescein, porphyrin,

macrocyclic carbocyanine compounds of the present invention can be utilized in the treatment of pathologic conditions by phototherapy. That is, the compound is activated by light through cleavage of labile bonds or generation of free radicals that are cytotoxic to a target microenvironment.","These macrocyclic bioconjugates have been found to exude a robust nature which enables them to have an improved delivery which is more specific to targeted tissue. The robust nature my stem from the rigid cross-links in the chromophore core, i.e. the intramolecular cyclization. The topology of the molecules makes it possible to alter the spectral properties of the compounds by a choice of the ring size. In addition, the linker group from one segment of the molecule to another can beneficially comprise a bioactive segment capable of directing the molecules to their targets.","The compounds described in this invention are stable against exopeptidase degradation inspite of the head-to-tail macrocyclization formulations. Macrocyclization facilitates elucidation of the bioactive conformations of linear peptides, which is useful to optimize the affinity of the compounds for their targets. Compounds that can minimize peptide degradation by exopeptidase and also retain the affinity of the carrier to its receptor is highly unusual.","The present carbocyanine macrocytic bioconjugates may be inherently excreted by organs other than the liver, such as urinal excretion through the kidneys. But this is not completely understood. The bioconjugates of this invention use hydrophilic units as an integral part of the cyclic chain which may disrupt solvent-induced aggregation in solution.","Herein cyclization has been successfully used as a strategy to improve the binding affinities, selectivities, in vivo stability, and pharmacokinetics of bioactive molecules. The conformational restriction conferred by cyclization facilitates the conformational analysis and bioactive conformation elucidation. In the present invention, the chromophore is flanked by bioactive or chemically useful substituents to achieve the desired molecular or cellular event. Thus, we have disclosed molecular beacons that combine both cyclic and fluorescent features which offer enormous advantages over existing optical probes.","The molecules disclosed can be used in a variety of applications, including detecting and imaging normal and pathophysiologic conditions; monitoring disease status, organ functions, and the efficacy of drugs; performing in vivo, ex-vivo, and in vitro biological and chemical measurements; detecting microorganisms and pathogens; and monitoring or detecting environment pollutants.","The novel bioconjugate compounds of the present invention comprise compounds of Formulas 1 to 18 and can be prepared from any conventional method. Preferably, one integrates peptide and other bioactive molecules into a fluorescent chromophore core.","The so called macrocyclization or intramolecular linking and cross-linking alters the ring size of molecules to modify the biological characteristics of the bioconjugates, such as changing these bioactive compounds from agonist to antagonist after binding to target a receptor. Thus, changing the ring size serves as an avenue to alter the agonist or antagonist properties of compounds without drastically changing its structural framework.","Although it is not completely understood, it is believed that increasing the molecular volume transforms the excretion pathway from the size-dependent glomerular filtration mechanism of the kidneys to tubular filtration, which ensures more rapid elimination of the compound from blood plasma. Consequently, imaging can be performed more rapidly after injection of the imaging agent because the target tissue-to-blood ratio of the macrocyclic compounds can be highly concentrated within hours of post injection.","Macrocyclic compounds also have enhanced affinity to different subtypes of target receptors. Optimizing the selectivity of such compounds to the target receptor will minimize the negative effects of the compounds on normal tissue.","As previously stated, changing the macrocyclic ring size can alter the spectral properties of the macrocyclic compounds. This is particularly important for the simultaneous monitoring of two or more physiological processes simultaneously without using widely different compounds. The spatial distribution of the functional groups within the bioconjugate allows those groups to interact with each other, thereby making it possible to completely quench the fluorescence emission by incorporating in quenchers in shorter ring structures, such as the addition of metal chelates possessing d-orbital lone pair electrons. This characteristic makes these compounds ideally suited for in vivo and in vitro functional imaging. Particularly, cleavage of one or more amide bonds within the cyclic ring will transform the cyclic chain into a linear analogue that minimizes spatial interaction between the quencher and the chromophore, thereby facilitating the detection of fluorescence emission. The macrocyclic bioconjugate then becomes a highly sensitive probe for detecting the in vivo or in vitro expression of diagnostic enzymes.","The macrocyclic compounds of the present invention, are characterized by a fluorescence lifetime altered by the macrocyclization, facilitating the use of the macrocyclic compounds as highly sensitive molecular probes in fluorescence lifetime imaging.","The macrocyclic compounds are useful in various biomedical applications including, but not limited to, tomographic imaging of organs; monitoring of organ functions; coronary angiography; fluorescence endoscopy; detection, imaging, and treatment of pathologic conditions; laser guided surgery, photoacoustic and sonofluorescence methods; and the like. Specific embodiments to accomplish some of the aforementioned biomedical applications are given below.","For example, the compounds of the invention are useful in optical tomographic, endoscopic, photoacoustic and sonofluoresence detection and treatment of tumors and other pathologic conditions. They can be employed for localized therapy and imaging.","The compounds when targeting tumors and other abnormalities, can be detected by monitoring the blood clearance profile of the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds serve during laser assisted guided surgery, to detect micrometastases of tumors upon laparoscopy. In yet another aspect of the invention, the bioconjugates of this invention are contrast imaging agents in the diagnosis of atherosclerotic plaques and blood clots; or for monitoring gene or protein expressions;

S., Lewis, M. R., Srinivansan, A., Schmidt, M. A., Wang, J., and Anderson, C. J. (1999) Comparison of Four Cu-labeled Somatostatin Analogs in vitro and in a Tumor-bearing Rat Model: Evaluation of New Derivatives for PET Imaging and Targeted Radiotherapy. 42, 1341-1347).

The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4\u00b0 C. for 10 min. and the pelleted membranes were re-suspended in ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer. Assays were performed using Millipore FC96 plates and the Millipore Multiscreen system (Bedford, Mass.) (1). Triplicates of 50 \u03bcl membranes (60 \u03bcg\/well) were incubated with 50 \u03bcl radioligand (30-40,000 cpm) and increasing concentration cold competitors in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl, 0.1 mg\/ml BSA) in a total volume of 250 \u03bcl per well at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 h. Following incubation, membranes were filtered on a vacuum manifold and washed twice with binding buffer. The filters containing membrane-bound radioactivity were removed from the assay plate and counted using a Beckman 8000 automated well-typed counter (Fullerton, Calif.). Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the non-specifically bound radioactivity from that of total binding. The best-fit ICvalues were calculated using PRISM\u2122 (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.). Radiolabeling of DTPA-octreotide with In was carried out in 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 6.5, room temperature, 30 min incubation) specific activity of and radiochemical purity was confirmed greater than 98% by radio TLC.
