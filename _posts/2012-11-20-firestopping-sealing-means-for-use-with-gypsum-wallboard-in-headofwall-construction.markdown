Stahl Jr. et al, and assigned to SPECIFIED TECHNOLOGIES INC. of Somerville, N.J.","The above three referenced patent applications are hereby formally incorporated by reference as an integral part of the present application","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention deals with the field of firestop sealing devices positionable between the upper edge of the gypsum wallboard and the lower edge of a floor located thereabove commonly defined as the head-of-wall area of building construction. Many of these floor configurations can have various shapes and designs and a need exists for a means of sealing this area in the event of a fire to prevent passage of unwanted flames, heat and gases therebetween. The present invention is particularly useful when attached with respect to any of the commonly available top of wall constructions. The flexibly resilient intumescent gasket of the present design is very useful for the purpose of replacing the common current practice of utilizing filler materials such as caulk or firestopping mastic materials in the otherwise opened head-of-wall joint areas beneath floor and above the gypsum wallboard therebelow. Use of such materials is labor intensive and the quality of the final fire seal is greatly dependent on the skill level of the on-site worker.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Many patents have been granted for various constructions for the purpose of sealing the opened head-of-wall joint areas between gypsum wallboard and the lower surface of a floor or ceiling construction located immediately thereabove such as shown in U.S. Pat.

Shriver and assigned to Thermafiber, Inc. on an \u201cInterlocking Curtain Wall Insulation System\u201d.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which minimizes cost.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a less labor intensive means for achieving full sealing of the edges wallboard than is currently being used particularly in the open zone area beneath the floor construction thereabove and to provide a planar sealing gasket which is attachable to the edge of the wallboard such that the surrounding sealing means is automatically placed simultaneously whenever the gypsum wallboard itself is placed in position.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which is easily maintained.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which can be attached to one side of the gypsum wallboard prior to installation such that the gypsum wallboard and the firestopping means are positioned simultaneously.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which is flexibly resilient to allow for relative movement between the wallboard and the top-of-the-wall construction immediately thereadjacent beneath a floor thereabove.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which can be made of intumescent paper material.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which will include a structural layer preferably of polyethylene or foil-scrim.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which can include an adhesive layer which may comprise pressure sensitive adhesive tape.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which can be made available in extended long lengths which can be cut to shape as needed.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which can be supplied in extended lengths such that it can be coiled to facilitate providing thereof for being cut into whatever lengths are needed for the particular job.","It is an object of the planar sealing means for gypsum wallboard of the present invention to provide a system which is capable of following the contours of a top-of-the-wall length positioned thereadjacent.","It is an object of the sealing means for gypsum wallboard disclosed in the present invention to provide a system which can be made with an intumescent extruded rubber profile which can attach to only one side of the gypsum wallboard.","It is an object of the sealing means for gypsum wallboard disclosed in the present invention to provide a system which can be made with an intumescent extruded rubber profile which can attach simultaneously to both sides of the gypsum wallboard.","It is an object of the sealing means for gypsum wallboard disclosed in the present invention to provide a system which can be made with an intumescent extruded rubber profile which can be attached to the gypsum wallboard prior to securement thereof to the head-of-wall joint area.","It is an object of the sealing means for gypsum wallboard disclosed in the present invention to provide an extruded profile in the shape of an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cP\u201d which can be adhered to the top edge of the system wallboard prior to placing thereof.","It is an object of the sealing means for gypsum wallboard disclosed in the present invention to provide a sealing gasket that includes a flexible upper rounded section which can be compressed in adjacent with a lower surface of a floor thereabove simultaneously with positioning of the system wallboard in place for attachment to the wall area therebelow.","It is an object of the sealing means for gypsum wallboard disclosed in the present invention to provide a system which can be used with various configurations of building construction including being capable of following the contours of a steel fluted deck floor or roof system.","The present invention provides a sealing means in the form of a firestopping gasket  which is attachable to the edges, preferably the top edges, of gypsum wallboard layers  normally positioned often adjacent to steel studs present in such construction. A steel track  is shown positioned thereadjacent.","The firestopping gasket  will preferably include two sections including a support or mounting leg  and a sealing leg  attached thereto and preferably formed integrally therewith and extending outwardly therefrom. In the configuration shown in  the support leg  and the sealing leg  are at oriented at an obtuse angle  with respect to one another of slightly greater than 90 degrees.","The construction of the gasket  itself includes a base layer of material having an intumescent component such as intumescent impregnated paper  in the  embodiment. This material includes a structural layer  extending thereover, preferably positioned over both sides thereof which provided added structural strength and rigidity and is more aesthetically pleasing. This structural layer, preferably, is of a thermoplastic material such as polyethylene but it can also be formed of foil scrim commonly used for various purposes in the firestopping industry. The structural layer  provides structural integrity to the planar shape of the gasket  as shown best in . In particular, the combination of the structural layer  and the intumescent impregnated paper  provides a combined strength and resiliency to the overall structure of the gasket  such that it can maintain shape and impart an element of flexible resilience thereto such that, as shown in , when positioned between the gypsum board layers  and the steel track , the sealing leg  which extends outwardly from the support leg  will maintain an obtuse angle  to effectively abut with the concrete slab  of the upper floor positioned thereabove for firestop sealing thereadjacent. The intumescent paper  is flexible such that the added structural layer provides resilient and structural strength thereto. The structural layer  is preferably of a thermoplastic material such as polyethylene or other similar material in order to help to maintain the physical orientation between the sealing leg  and the support leg  as necessary.","One of the important advantages of use of the firestopping gasket  of the present invention is in the ease of installation. This advantage is provided by the inclusion of an adhesive layer  which can be formed of pressure sensitive adhesive tape or any other common adhesive material such that the sealing leg  can be attached easily and quickly to the edge of the gypsum board  prior to attachment to the wall at the worksite. Therefore, when the gypsum board layers  are secured to the wall the firestopping gasket  will be also secured in place with the support leg  thereof positioned between the steel track  of the wall and the gypsum board layer  for securement thereof in place without requiring any special separate labor activity. Normally these areas are sealed by mastic materials such as caulking or the like which requires a separate labor step after mounting the gypsum board which requires additional time and expense because of the labor and materials involved. The present invention achieves the placement of a sealing means between the upper edge of the gypsum board layer  and the concrete slab  thereadjacent in the top-of-the-wall joint area without any separate step because of the initial placement of the gypsum board layer  in the proper location with the gasket of the present invention secured along the edge thereof.","One of the most important aspects of the present invention is the flexibly resilience that is imparted to the firestopping gasket  by using a two component material including a layer of intumescent paper  and the structural layer  of polyethylene or foil-scrim or other similar material. This combined structure provides the intumescent characteristic readily apparent from the intumescent component of paper  and it also provides the structural strength and flexible resilience required such that the sealing leg  of the  embodiment extends outwardly and upwardly from the upper edge of the gypsum board layer  into abutment with respect to the concrete slab thereabove. This double layered construction will help maintain the preset shape of the gasket due to the flexible resilience thereof which maintains forcible abutment of the intumescent sealing portion with respect to the lower surface of the concrete slab . In this manner the top-of-the-wall sealing defined below the concrete slab  will be maintained sealed at all times despite relative movement between the top-of-the-wall joint and the gypsum board layer  commonly experienced in such joints because the sealing leg  will flex to accommodate any movement in the relative position due to the flexible resilience in the structure thereof.","Preferably the gasket member of the present invention is provided in extended length and can be coiled to facilitate transport thereof. The providing of this material in such extended lengths will allow the installation personnel to cut the flexibly resilient gasket as needed in sections for fully sealing the open joint area between the top of the gypsum wallboard  and the bottom of the floor assembly . Also it is preferably that a longitudinally extending cut or slot  is defined in the structural layer  at the intersection between the sealing leg  and the support leg . This slot  will facilitate bending of the sealing leg  to the desired oblique angle relative to the support leg . This slot  can be manufactured in the original sealing means as manufactured or can be formed in the field by scoring along the intersection between the sealing leg  and the support leg .","As shown in the embodiments shown in  the use of the sealing means  formed as an extruded sealing member  is particularly usable with steel fluted deck floor systems. With such a fluted shape in the deck floor the extruded sealing member  can be cut to various lengths as needed to provide a full firestopping seal in all areas of the open joint area .","With the present invention the sealing gasket can be formed conveniently as extruded shaped formed from thermoplastic materials. Two preferred shapes for the thermoplastic extrusion have been found to be useful for this purpose.  show the P-shaped profile  whereas  show the A-shaped profile .","The P-shaped profile  for the extruded sealing member  is formed with a leg section  and a rounded section  positioned upwardly with respect thereto. The overall construction is actually formed by a singular linear panel which extends from the bottommost portion of leg section  upwardly through the rounded section  such that it then extends through the area of rounded section  with the end of rounded section  in abutment with the inner leg surface  and the leg section  at an intermediate position therealong. The P-shaped profile extrusion also defines an outer leg surface .","The leg section  provides the means for adherence between the wallboard paper facing  which is included along the outermost surfaces of the gypsum wallboard  and the extrusion . The inner leg surface  is positioned in abutment with respect to the gypsum wallboard  and can be secured thereto in any conventional manner such as by an adhesive or by threaded fasteners or integral barbs or any other conventional means. Normally a mastic connection will be utilized. In this manner the user can easily secure the inner leg surface  of the leg section  of the P-profile  of the extrusion  with respect to the gypsum wallboard  prior to positioning and attachment thereof with respect to an adjacent building structure.","The rounded section  of the P-shaped profile  will include a lower facing rounded section  thus positioned in abutment with respect to the gypsum board upper edge . The rounded section  will also include an upper surface  thereof which is designed to be brought into abutment with respect to the bottom of the floor assembly . As such, when the gypsum wallboard  is placed in abutment with respect to the mounting members to which it is designed to be secured to form a structural wall, the worker will exert an upward force on the gypsum wallboard which urges the upper surface  of the rounded section to be forcibly engaged against the bottom of the floor assembly . Preferably the material from which the extruded sealing member  is made will be a flexibly resilient material such as preferably including a thermoplastic material component such that it will slightly deform and create a resilient bias in firestop sealing between the gypsum wallboard upper edge  and the bottom of the floor assembly . Thus the rounded section  will achieve an effective firestopping seal of the open head-of-wall joint area  between the top of the gypsum wallboard and the bottom of the floor assembly immediately. Preferably the extruded material from which the sealing member  is made will include an intumescent or other firestopping component for enhancing the firestop sealing of this open joint area  when subjected to the heat of a fire.","Another alternative configuration of the profile is shown in  wherein the profile is approximately A-shaped. With this A-profile an arcuate upper section  will be provided closed at the bottom portion by a generally horizontally extending cross member . The combination of the arcuate upper section  and the cross member  will provide an overall closed section when viewed in side profile as shown best in .","The A-shaped is defined by the inclusion of a first leg section  extending downwardly from the cross member . A second leg section  will also extend downwardly from the cross member  at a position spatially disposed from the first leg section . In this manner a mounting channel  will be defined between the first leg section  and the second leg section  adapted to receive the gypsum wallboard  positioned therebetween.","In particular, the first leg section  will include a first inner leg surface  and a first outer leg surface . The first inner leg surface  will be adapted to be positioned in abutment with respect to the wallboard paper facing  on one side of the gypsum wallboard . The second leg section  will include a second inner leg surface  and a second outer leg surface . The second inner leg surface  will be positioned adjacent to the opposite wallboard paper facing  of the gypsum wallboard . In this manner the first inner leg surface  and the second inner leg surface  will grasp therebetween the gypsum wallboard  to facilitate securement therewith. In this manner, if the lateral spacing between the first inner leg surface  and the second inner leg surface  is small enough, a wedged or snug friction gripping will occur of the gypsum wallboard  and the wallboard paper facings  on each opposite side thereof. As such, when using the A-shaped profile  for the extruded sealing member  in some applications no separate means of securement or adhesion between the extruded member  and the gypsum wallboard  will be required. That is, in some configurations the spacing will be small enough that a friction gripping of the gypsum wallboard  between the legs of the A-shaped profile  will be sufficient for securement therebetween. Alternatively, if needed, additional securement means may be included such as adhesives or glues or separate physical fastening means such as screws or nails which can protrude through both the legs and the wallboard can be used.","As such, these two different designs show additional examples of shapes of the extruded sealing members  of the present invention can be utilized to form a full seal in the head-of-wall area between the floor  and the wall  immediately positioned therebelow. When a gypsum wallboard  is placed in position the flexibly resilient material of the extruded sealing member  will be compressed such that the upper facing arcuate section  of the arcuate upper section  of the A-shaped profile  will be urged into abutting engagement with respect to the bottom of the floor assembly  for efficiently creating a firestopping sealing therebetween.","While particular embodiments of this invention have been shown in the drawings and described above, it will be apparent that many changes may be made in the form, arrangement and positioning of the various elements of the combination. In consideration thereof, it should be understood that preferred embodiments of this invention disclosed herein are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to limit the scope of the invention."],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["While the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly described herein, a preferred embodiment is set forth in the following detailed description which may be best understood when read in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
