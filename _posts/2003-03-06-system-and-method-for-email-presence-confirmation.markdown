{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is related to co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 10\/384,206, titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PRESENCE ENABLED EMAIL DELIVERY, filed concurrently herewith.","The present invention relates to telecommunications systems and, in particular, to an improved system and method for delivery of electronic messages.","Electronic messaging, or e-mail, has rapidly become an essential business and personal tool. However, typical e-mail systems are disadvantageous in that they provide no way to ensure that a recipient of an e-mail is actually present to receive it.","In general, e-mail messages may not be of particular importance, and therefore it may not matter much if the message sits unopened on a recipient's computer. However, some messages may be of sufficient sensitivity that there could be a security or other risk in leaving them sitting unopened on a recipient's computer.","For example, a recipient may not necessarily want an e-mail of a personal nature to be available for casual perusal by someone with access to the computer. Similarly, a personnel supervisor may have a secretary monitor his e-mail while he is away. The supervisor might not want the secretary to view an e-mail containing complaints about other personnel. In other cases, the sender may deem an e-mail of sufficient import that wants it to appear prominently at the recipient's mailbox and not \u201cburied\u201d in spam.","As such, there is a need for a system and method for preventing viewing of an e-mail by a third party. There is a further need for a system and method for ensuring that an e-mail recipient is present to receive an e-mail before it is sent.","These and other drawbacks in the prior art are overcome in large part by a system and method according to embodiments of the present invention.","A telecommunications system according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of electronic messaging clients; at least one messaging server having an e-mail presence activation module adapted to receive an e-mail and determine therefrom whether a presence of a recipient is to be determined, and a presence module responsive to controls from the e-mail presence activation module and adapted to determine a presence of a recipient of said e-mail prior to sending the e-mail to the recipient. In one embodiment, the e-mail presence activation module is adapted to read a priority level of the e-mail message to determine whether to check a presence of the recipient.","A telecommunications method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes receiving an e-mail at a server; using an e-mail address of the e-mail to check a presence status of a recipient of an e-mail; sending a presence confirmation message to the recipient responsive to determining that the recipient is present; and delivering the e-mail to the recipient if a response to the presence confirmation message is received. In certain embodiments, the presence confirmation message is an instant messaging message.","A better understanding of these and other specific embodiments of the invention is obtained when the following detailed description is considered in conjunction with the following drawings.","Turning now to the drawings and, with particular attention to , a diagram of an exemplary telecommunications system  according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. It is noted that, while a particular network configuration is illustrated, the present invention is not so limited. Thus, the figures are exemplary only.","As shown, the telecommunications system  includes a packet network such as a local area network (LAN) . The LAN  may be implemented using a TCP\/IP network and may implement voice or multimedia over IP using, for example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Operably coupled to the local area network  is a multimedia server . The multimedia server  may include one or more controllers , which may be embodied as one or more microprocessors, and memory  for storing application programs and data. The controller  implements an instant messaging system . The instant messaging system may be embodied as Microsoft Windows Messenger or other instant messaging system. Thus, according to certain embodiments of the present invention, the instant messaging system  implements the Microsoft.Net environment  and Real Time Communications protocol (RTC) .","In addition, according to embodiments of the present invention, an e-mail message presence activation system  may be provided, which may be part of an interactive suite of applications , run by controller , and typically stored in memory , as will be described in greater detail below. The e-mail message presence system  is used to determine whether a determination of recipient presence is required. The multimedia server  may also implement a presence server or module  in association with or distinct from the instant messaging system .","Also coupled to the LAN  is a gateway  which may be implemented as a gateway to a private branch exchange (PBX), the public switched telephone network (PSTN) , or any of a variety of other networks, such as a wireless or cellular network. In addition, one or more LAN telephones -and one or more computers -may be operably coupled to the LAN .","The computers -may be personal computers implementing the Windows XP operating system and thus, Windows Messenger. In addition, the computers -may include telephony and other multimedia messaging capability using, for example, peripheral cameras, microphones and speakers (not shown) or peripheral telephony handsets . In other embodiments, one or more of the computers may be implemented as wireless telephones, digital telephones, or personal digital assistants (PDAs). Thus, the figures are exemplary only. As shown with reference to computer , the computers may include one or more controllers , such as Pentium-type microprocessors, and storage  for applications and other programs.","Finally, the computers -and specifically, the controllers , may implement e-mail or messaging clients -and Presence Services -according to embodiments of the present invention. As will be described in greater detail below, according to embodiments of the present invention, the Presence Services  allow access to the e-mail message presence activation system  and the presence system  of the server  and thus permit the user to determine if an e-mail recipient is present. The Presence Services  may be implemented in conjunction with Instant Messaging applications and the Presence Server .","Turning now to , a functional model diagram illustrating e-mail message presence activation system  is shown. More particularly,  is a logical diagram illustrating a particular embodiment of a multimedia server . For sake of simplicity, the Instant Messaging system  () is omitted. The server  includes a plurality of application modules  and a communication broker module . The server  also provides interfaces, such as APIs (application programming interfaces) to SIP phones  and gateways\/interworking units . Typically, such application modules are stored in memory  and executed by the controller  ().","According to the embodiment illustrated, the broker module  includes a basic services module , a presence module or server , an advanced services module , an automation module , and a toolkit module .","The basic services module  functions to implement, for example, phone support, PBX interfaces, call features and management, as well as Windows Messaging and RTC add-ins, when necessary. The phone support features allow maintenance of and access to buddy lists.","The advanced services module  implements function such as multipoint control unit (MCU), recording, and the like. MCU functions are used for voice conferencing and support ad hoc and dynamic conference creation from a buddy list following the SIP conferencing model for ad hoc conferences. In certain embodiments, support for G.711 and G.723.1 codecs is provided. Further, in certain embodiments, the MCU can distribute media processing over multiple servers using the MEGACO protocol.","The presence module  provides a user interface for presenting the user with presence information. The presence server  is adapted to determine a presence of an e-mail recipient in response to requests from the e-mail message presence system . It is noted that, while shown as integrated with the multimedia server , the presence server  may also be implemented as a separate unit. Further, in other embodiments, either or both of the multimedia server  and the presence server  may be services provided on or via the PSTN  rather than provided on the LAN . Thus, the figures are exemplary only. An aspect of the presence features may employ Instant Messaging buddy lists to determine a recipient's presence. In addition, the presence features module  may operate in conjunction with the Instant Messaging system  to generate a presence confirmation message.","The presence module or presence features  may additionally provide device context for both SIP registered devices and user-defined non-SIP devices. Various user contexts, such as In Meeting, On Vacation, In the Office, etc., can be provided for. In addition, voice, e-mail and instant messaging availability may be provided across the user's devices. The presence features module  enables real time call control using presence information, e.g., to choose a destination based on the presence of a user's devices. In addition, various components have a central repository for presence information and for changing and querying presence information.","In addition, the broker module  may include the ComResponse platform, available from Siemens Information and Communication Networks, Inc. ComResponse features include speech recognition, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech, and allow for creation of scripts for applications.","Real time call control is provided by a SIP API  associated with the basic services module . That is, calls can be intercepted in progress and real time actions performed on them, including directing those calls to alternate destinations based on rules and or other stimuli. The SIP API  also provides call progress monitoring capabilities and for reporting status of such calls to interested applications. The SIP API  also provides for call control from the user interface.","According to the embodiment illustrated, the application modules include collaboration module , an interaction center module , a mobility module , an interworking services module , and an e-mail presence activation module .","The collaboration module  allows for creation, modification or deletion of a collaboration session for a group of users. The collaboration module  may further allow for invoking a voice conference from any client. In addition, the collaboration module  can launch a multi-media conferencing package, such as the WebEx package. It is noted that the multi-media conferencing can be handled by other products.","The interaction center  provides a telephony interface for both subscribers and guests. Subscriber access functions include calendar access and voicemail and e-mail access. The calendar access allows the subscriber to accept, decline, or modify appointments, as well as block out particular times. The voicemail and e-mail access allows the subscriber to access and sort messages.","Similarly, the guest access feature allows the guest access to voicemail for leaving messages and calendar functions for scheduling, canceling, and modifying appointments with subscribers. Further, the guest access feature allows a guest user to access specific data meant for them, e.g., receiving e-mail and fax back, etc.","The mobility module  provides for message forwarding and \u201cone number\u201d access across media, and message \u201cmorphing\u201d across media for the subscriber. Further, various applications can send notification messages to a variety of destinations, such as e-mails, instant messages, pagers, and the like. In addition, the subscriber can set rules that the mobility module  uses to define media handling, such as e-mail, voice and instant messaging handling. Such rules specify data and associated actions. For example, a rule could be defined to say \u201cIf I'm traveling, and I get a voicemail or e-mail marked Urgent, then page me.\u201d","Further, as will be explained in greater detail below, the e-mail message presence activation module  and the presence module , may be used in conjunction with the user's e-mail system and presence system  to determine if an e-mail recipient is present to receive the e-mail.","It is noted that, while illustrated as a single server, the presence module  may be separate from the multimedia server . In addition, it is noted that other server configurations are possible. For example, the e-mail presence activation module could function in conjunction with a server such as Microsoft Exchange server.","Turning now to , a diagram of an exemplary graphical user interface according to embodiments of the present invention is shown. In particular, shown in  is an exemplary e-mail window . The e-mail window  is typically generated by the e-mail or messaging client  (). The e-mail window  includes a plurality of standard controls , such as FILE, EDIT, SEND, etc. In addition, a priority options window or dropdown  may be provided. Such functionality is known and may be implemented in such e-mail clients as Microsoft Outlook or Netscape Communicator. In the embodiment illustrated, the e-mail may be marked as having LOWEST, LOW, STANDARD, HIGH, and HIGHEST priority levels. It is noted that, in other embodiments, numerical scales or other levels may be provided.","As will be explained in greater detail below, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the user can mark one of the priority levels above a threshold (e.g., HIGH or HIGHEST). The marked priority is read by a destination multimedia server  and indicates that the server is to determine a presence of the recipient prior to delivery of the message. It is noted that a destination multimedia server and a destination presence server may be coupled to the same network as a message sender and a recipient or may be remote from one or the other. In the discussion that follows, intervening gateways and networks are omitted for sake of simplicity.","Turning now to . C, flowcharts illustrating operation of an embodiment of the present invention are shown. In particular,  illustrates a primary method, and  illustrate notice options.","At step , a destination messaging server receives an e-mail from a sender and, in certain embodiments, determines that a priority threshold is above a certain predetermined level. At step , the destination messaging server has the presence server check a presence of the recipient. In step , if the recipient is not present, the server will periodically check again. If the recipient is found to be present, then in step , the destination messaging server will send a message such as an Instant Messaging message to the recipient. The Instant Messaging message indicates that an important message is incoming and asks whether the recipient would like to receive it. If the user responds with a YES, then in step , the message is delivered. If the recipient replies with a \u201cNO\u201d, then the system can respond in a variety of ways, such as those shown in  and .","For example, in , at step , the system can send a notice to the sender that the recipient has declined to receive the message. The server can then delete the message, in step  (The system may also attempt one or more additional re-tries before deleting.). Alternatively, in , the system can send a notice (e.g., either an e-mail or an IM message) to the sender in step  and then wait a predetermined period, in step . The messaging server will attempt to deliver the message again after the time expires, and send a new confirmation message, in step . If the recipient does not respond again with a YES, then the message can be deleted and the user notified, as in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["122","104","215","122","502","502","122","122","215","128","106","504","127","122","122","104","104","114","122","506","104","114","215","215","215","508","104","510","122","104","514","510","512"],"i":["a","b","a ","b","a ","b ","a ","b; ","b","b "]},"In certain embodiments of the present invention, a recipient of an e-mail is not necessarily on the sender's buddy list when the e-mail is transmitted. However, embodiments of the present invention are configured to read the recipient's e-mail and add the recipient to an active buddy list (either the sender's or a \u201cserver\u201d buddy list) to determine a presence of the recipient. This shown with reference to the flowchart of  and the schematic diagram of .","Initially, the sender can compose an e-mail  () and select HIGH PRIORITY , using the e-mail client software  (). The e-mail  arrives at the destination messaging server  in step  (, ). Next, in step , the destination messaging server  checks the message's importance, i.e., reads the priority level. If the priority level is not above a threshold priority, as determined in step , then the message is delivered to the recipient in a standard fashion in step . Otherwise, the messaging server  and, particularly, the e-mail presence activation module , uses the recipient's e-mail address and determines if the recipient is on the sender's buddy list, at step . If not, then in step , the messaging server  and, in particular, the e-mail presence activation module , will add the recipient to either the sender's buddy list or a messaging server buddy list , depending on the embodiment. The buddy list with the recipient is communicated to the presence server , which checks the recipient's presence, for example, by determining if the recipient is signed in the Instant Messaging system. The e-mail message will be delivered using the presence confirmation technique discussed above, at step . For example, as shown in , the presence server  can cause the Instant messaging system  to generate presence confirmation message  to the recipient . Finally, at step  (), the recipient is removed from the buddy list, as shown at in .","The invention described in the above detailed description is not intended to be limited to the specific form set forth herein, but is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications and equivalents as can reasonably be included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4A-FIG","b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
