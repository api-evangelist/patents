Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to information processing units which activate an application, operate according to a user input, and assist various user tasks, control methods for information processing units for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and computer programs, and more particularly, to an information processing unit which provides a work environment provided with a character input and a coordinate designation input, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program.","More specifically, the present invention relates to information processing units structured by incorporating a coordinate input function into a character-input keyboard, control methods for information processing units for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and computer programs, and more particularly, to an information processing unit having an improved operability in cases when keyboard input operations and coordinate input operations are alternately performed, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program.","2. Description of the Related Art","Various personal computers (PCs) have been developed and made commercially available, such as desktop-type PCs, tower-type PCs, and notebook-type PCs, as recent technological innovation has been made. Among them, notebook-type PCs have been designed and manufactured for mobile environments. More specifically, they have been made compact and lightweight, so that the user can carry them outdoors or to any destinations and use them there.","Almost all computers provide a graphical user interface (GUI) function, which implements graphic-based user inputs. In a GUI environment, a desktop space and a great number of icons are prepared on the display screen. All resource objects, such as files, which are handled by the computer system can be represented by the corresponding icons on the desktop screen having the GUI. The user can directly apply an operation (such as clicking or drag-and-drop operation) to a displayed object, such as icons indicating programs, data, folders, and devices, on the screen by using a user input apparatus, such as a mouse, to operate the computer intuitively in an easy-to-understand manner.","To implement such a GUI environment, it is necessary for the computer to have a coordinate designation and input apparatus for specifying a desired location on the desktop screen, such as a mouse, in addition to a conventional user input apparatus, such as a keyboard.","For coordinate designation and input operations, a mouse is connected to desktop computers and other installation-type computers and used. In contrast, a in-keyboard-embedded-type device, such as a track pad (or a touch sensitive pad) is used instead of a mouse for notebook-type computers because of convenience of carrying the computers.","In such notebook-type computers, general mouse operations, such as clicking and dragging, can be implemented by combinations of operations on the track pad and operations on buttons disposed below the track pad.","In this case, however, since the buttons are apart from the keyboard, when the track pad is operated, fingers of the user are separated from their home positions (in usual QWERTY-type keyboards, the user usually places the forefinger of the left hand on the F key and the forefinger of the right hand on the J key as their home positions). Therefore, when typing on the keyboard and mouse operations are alternately performed, it is necessary for the user to look for the home positions visually after a mouse operation is finished, which is an operation problem.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Various methods have been proposed to overcome this problem, such as rendering operations on the touch sensitive pad, including tapping, as button operations. In any of these methods, however, a reduction in operability caused by erroneous recognition occurs as a problem. In addition, moving a mouse while pressing a mouse button, which is a so-called \u201cdrag\u201d operation, cannot be replaced only with recognition of tapping.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an information processing unit which provides a work environment provided with a character input and a coordinate designation input, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an information processing unit structured by incorporating a coordinate input function into a character-input keyboard, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program.","Further object of the present invention is to provide an information processing unit having an improved operability in cases when keyboard input operations and coordinate input operations are alternately performed, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program.","One of the foregoing objects is achieved in a first aspect of the present invention through the provision of an information processing unit for executing predetermined processing in response to a user input, including a key input section provided with a plurality of keys, for inputting data assigned to a pressed key; a coordinate input section for performing a coordinate input according to a user's finger contact operation; and key-assignment control means for changing key assignment in the key input section according to the result of detection of a user's finger contact, obtained by the coordinate input section.","One of the foregoing objects is achieved in a second aspect of the present invention through the provision of a control method for an information processing unit provided with a key input section and a coordinate input section, for performing an operation according to a user input operation, the control method including a step of determining whether a user operation has been performed for the key input section; a step of detecting the contact of a user's finger on the coordinate input section; a step of performing a process according to the position of the contact of the user's finger on the coordinate input section; and a step of interpreting the user operation performed for the key input section according to whether or not the contact of the user's finger on the coordinate input section has occurred.","The coordinate input section described here is a device, such as a \u201ctouch sensitive pad\u201d, for detecting the contact position, the movement direction, and others of a user's finger tip by the capacitance detection method. Alternatively, the coordinate input section may be a device which is provided at a suitable position in the key arrangement of a keyboard and designates coordinates by pressure applied in the directions left and right and back and forth, like a \u201ctrack point\u201d. It may be possible that key assignment for usual key input operations is applied to each key of the key input section while the coordinate input section does not detect the contact of a user's finger, and key assignment to a specific key of the key input section is changed in response to the fact that the coordinate input section has detected the contact of a user's finger.","More specifically, a function for designating an input-coordinate selection operation may be assigned to a home-position key in the key input section in response to the fact that the coordinate input section has detected the contact of a user's finger.","Since the click buttons of a mouse are usually apart from the keyboard, when the track pad is operated, fingers of the user are separated from their home positions. Therefore, when typing on the keyboard and mouse operations are alternately performed, it is necessary for the user to look for the home positions visually after a mouse operation is finished, which is an operation problem. In contrast, in the present invention, the user performs usual keyboard operations, and the user just needs to press home position keys, such as the F and J keys, which are substituted for the mouse click buttons, by the left and right forefingers while placing the left or right thumb on the touch sensitive pad. In other words, mouse operations with the use of the touch sensitive pad are possible while both hands are placed at the home positions on the keyboard. In addition, since such click buttons are usually disposed in front of the touch sensitive pad, that is, a front edge part on the keyboard plane, the left and right click buttons can be omitted in designing the computer, which leads to a more compact computer.","Alternatively, a menu selection function or another function may be assigned to a key in the key input section in response to the fact that the coordinate input section has detected the contact of a user's finger.","In such a case, for example, a menu window is pop-up-displayed on the computer screen in response to the contact of a finger on the touch sensitive pad. When the key is pressed, the corresponding function is activated by this one stroke. Menu items can also be selected by usual mouse operations.","To avoid erroneous detection of the contact of a finger tip, the coordinate input section may detect a user's finger tip by whether the user's finger tip contacted the touch sensitive pad within a past predetermined period (for example, 100 milliseconds).","Designated-area storage means or step may be further provided, of storing the content of a designated area in response to the fact that the coordinate input section designates the area while a predetermined key is being pressed in the key input section and that the predetermined key is then released. Designated-area duplication means or step may be further provided, of duplicating the content stored in the designated-area storage means or step at a designated position, in response to the fact that the coordinate input section designates the position while a predetermined key is being pressed in the key input section and that the predetermined key is then released.","The designated-area storage means or step described here corresponds to a \u201ccut\u201d operation for temporarily storing the content in a designated area designated by the mouse. The designated-area duplication means or step corresponds to a \u201cpaste\u201d operation for copying the temporarily stored content at a designated position.","When a finger contacts the touch sensitive pad, a predetermined key such as the V key functions as a paste button. A cut command copies data in a paste buffer. It is assumed that the paste buffer holds a plurality of data items.","It is assumed that a \u201cpaste\u201d command is assigned to the V key. When the V key is pressed and then released immediately, the last item in the paste buffer is pasted. When the user moves a finger on the touch sensitive pad while pressing the V key, the items in the paste buffer are displayed in a menu. When an item is selected by a pointer operation and the V key is released, the desired data is pasted to the designated position.","In this way, when a key is just pressed, the corresponding \u201cbasic function\u201d is executed, and when a finger is moved on the touch sensitive pad while the key is being pressed, the corresponding \u201cextended function\u201d is executed.","One of the foregoing objects is achieved in a third aspect of the present invention through the provision of a computer program having described, in a computer readable format, an operation performed according to a user input operation, of a computer system provided with a key input section and a coordinate input section, the computer program including a step of determining whether a user operation has been performed for the key input section; a step of detecting the contact of a user's finger on the coordinate input section; a step of performing a process according to the position of the contact of the user's finger on the coordinate input section; and a step of interpreting the user operation performed for the key input section according to whether or not the contact of the user's finger on the coordinate input section has occurred.","The computer program according to the third aspect of the present invention is described in a computer readable format so as to implement predetermined processing in the computer system. In other words, when the computer program according to the third aspect of the present invention is installed into the computer system, cooperative operations are achieved in the computer system, and the same advantages as in the information processing unit according to the first aspect of the present invention and in the control method for the information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, according to the second aspect of the present invention are obtained.","As described above in detail, according to the present invention, an information processing unit structured by incorporating a coordinate input function into a character-input keyboard, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program are provided.","In addition, according to the present invention, an information processing unit having an improved operability in cases when keyboard input operations and coordinate input operations are alternately performed, a control method for an information processing unit for performing an operation according to a user input operation, and a computer program are provided.","In a computer according to the present invention, a keyboard mode is switched according to the determination of a finger contact on a touch sensitive pad to assign mouse buttons to specific keys, such as the F and J keys, on the keyboard. Therefore, the user can use the touch sensitive pad without separating the hands from the home positions. The touch sensitive pad can be used as a shift key, and the function thereof can be temporarily assigned to a key on the keyboard.","In addition, an information processing method, device or program based on this invention would comprise steps or means or etc. Of; receiving key input information according to user's key input operation on key input means; receiving coordinate input information according to user's finger contact operation on coordinate input means; recognizing the user input based on the received key input and coordinate input information; wherein the key assignment of the key input information being changed when the received coordinate input information is in predefined state; and executing the processing in response to the recognized user input.","For this invention, it's noted that the key input and coordinate input means can be implemented in both of unified or separated forms, further both of hardware or software (virtual) forms. The key input operation can be not only press, but also contact, approach, approximate, hit, scratch, or any other operation which can be recognized as user's operation on key input means. The coordinate input can be detected as not only 2D position input, but also 3D coordinate input, orientation input, rotation input, velocity input, acceleration input, or any other coordinate input which can be recognized as user's operation on coordinate input means. The executed processing can be applicable as both of process on host machine like personal computer or peripheral machine like keyboard.","Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become clear by embodiments of the present invention and a detailed description based on the accompanying drawings, described later.","An embodiment of the present invention will be described below in detail by referring to the drawings.","A.

In the keyboard  disposed at the upper surface of the body , alphabetical keys are disposed, for example, in the QWERTY arrangement, and numeric keys and various function keys are disposed.","At the front side of the keyboard , a flat section called a palm rest , where the user can place the palms when performing key inputs, are formed. And, almost at the center of the palm rest , a touch sensitive pad  serving as a coordinate designation apparatus, instead of a mouse, is disposed.","The touch sensitive pad  employs, for example, a capacitance detection method to detect the position, the movement distance, the movement speed, and others of a finger tip of the user, moving on the touch sensitive pad  by a change in capacitance obtained when the finger tip touches the surface of the touch sensitive pad .","At the front side of the touch sensitive pad, left and right click buttons  and  serving as mouse buttons are disposed.","As described later, the determination of a finger contact on the touch sensitive pad switches the keyboard mode to assign mouse buttons to predetermined keyboard keys, such as the F and J keys, in the present embodiment.

For example, an application software (AP), the operating system, device drivers (D\/Ds) for the input and output operations of various hardware, such as the keyboard  and the touch sensitive pad , and others are loaded into the main memory  as programs to be executed. Work data used during the execution of these programs is temporarily stored in the main memory .","A read-only memory (ROM)  is formed of a semiconductor memory for perpetually storing data, and, for example, stores a power-on self test (POST) running at activation and hardware-input-and-output program code, that is, a basic input\/output system (BIOS).","A display controller  is a special controller for processing a picture drawing instruction issued by the CPU . Picture-drawing data processed by the display controller  is written, for example, into a frame buffer (not shown), and is then screen-output to the liquid-crystal display panel . The display screen of the liquid-crystal display panel  generally has the role of visually feeding back to the user the input content of the user, its processing result, or a system message such as an error.","An input-unit interface  connects user input units such as the keyboard  and the touch sensitive pad , to the computer . Interrupt levels are assigned to the keyboard  and the touch sensitive pad , and when a user input operation is applied to either unit, an interrupt request is generated. The CPU  activates the corresponding interrupt handler, such as a keyboard driver or a touch-sensitive-pad driver, in response to the interrupt request to take a user input into the computer .","A network interface  can connect the computer  to a local network, such as a local area network (LAN), and further to a wide area network, such as the Internet, according to a predetermined communication protocol, such as the Ethernet (registered trademark) protocol.","A plurality of host terminals (not shown) are connected on a network in a transparent state to form a distributed computing environment.

Keyboard-Mode Switching Function","As shown in , the notebook-type computer  according to the present embodiment has the touch sensitive pad, an in-keyboard-embedded device, as a substitute for a mouse, for convenience of carrying the computer.
