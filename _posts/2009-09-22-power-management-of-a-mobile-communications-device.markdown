{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Mobile communication devices (e.g., wireless phones) have become an integral part of everyday life. However, the form factor and functionality employed by conventional mobile communications devices is typically limited to promote mobility of the device.","For example, mobile communications devices are powered by batteries that are typically sized to promote mobility of the mobile communications device. Even if the mobile communications device has a relatively large battery, however, the amount of power that may be obtained from the battery is finite. Accordingly, conventional mobile communications devices include an output that indicates an amount of power that is available from the battery, e.g., 40%. However, this indication is typically the sole indication provided to a user of the mobile communications device, which may make it difficult for the user to judge the remaining usefulness of the mobile communications device based on the current amount of power available from the battery.","A user interface for power management of a mobile communications device is described. In an implementation, power consumption used in performance of a plurality of tasks is monitored by a mobile communications device. A determination is made as to an amount of power that remains in a battery of the mobile communications device. A user interface is displayed on a display device of the mobile communications device that describes an amount of time each of the plurality of tasks may be performed based on the determined amount of power that remains in the battery.","In an implementation, one or more computer-readable storage media comprise instructions that are executable by a mobile communications device to provide an operating system that is executable to monitor battery usage of the mobile communications device to perform one or more tasks and expose data generated from the monitored usage via an application programming interface (API) to one or more applications that are executable on the mobile communications device to adjust power consumption by the one or more applications.","In an implementation, a mobile communications device includes a battery, a processor, and memory configured to maintain instructions that are executable on the processor to monitor an amount of power that remains in the battery and if the amount of power drops below a threshold level that is set to enable a telephone call, restrict telephone calls from being performed that are directed at a non-emergency telephone number.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Mobile communications devices typically have a small form factor to aide mobility of the mobile communications device. For example, the mobile communications device (e.g., a mobile phone) may be configured with a relatively minimal amount of display area and limited input devices (e.g., a keypad) so that the device may be easily transported. Additionally, the mobile communications device may have a limited amount of power available to perform tasks due to use of a battery. However, conventional techniques that were used to inform a user as to a current state of the battery had limited functionality. For example, by simply displaying an amount of power that remains in the battery using a percentage forced the user to roughly determine what that meant.","Power management techniques are described for use by a mobile communications device or other device with a battery. In an implementation, a user interface is output that describes a plurality of tasks that are performable by the mobile communications device. The user interface also describes an amount of time that may be used to perform the tasks based on an amount of power that is currently available from a battery of the mobile communications device. For example, the user interface may display an amount of time each application may be executed on the mobile communications device. Further, as applications are booted, the result of this action (e.g., execution of each additional application) may be reflected in the user interface. In this way, a user may make an informed decision as to which tasks may be performed based on a current state of the battery, further discussion of which may be found in relation to . A variety of other implementations are also described in the following sections, including implementations to enable applications to conserve power as further discussed in relation to , implementations to restrict functionality to extend an ability to make emergency telephone calls as further discussed in relation to , and so on.","In the following discussion, a variety of example implementations of a mobile communications device (e.g., a wireless phone) are described. Additionally, a variety of different functionality that may be employed by the mobile communications device is described for each example, which may be implemented in that example as well as in other described examples. Accordingly, example implementations are illustrated of a few of a variety of contemplated implementations. Further, although a mobile communications device having one or more modules that are configured to provide telephonic functionality are described, a variety of other mobile devices are also contemplated, such as personal digital assistants, mobile music players, dedicated messaging devices, portable game devices, netbooks, and so on.","Example Implementations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","102","102","102","102"]},"The mobile communications device  is further illustrated as including a first housing  and a second housing  that are connected via a slide  such that the first and second housings ,  may move (e.g., slide) in relation to one another. Although sliding is described, it should be readily apparent that a variety of other movement techniques are also contemplated, e.g., a pivot, a hinge and so on.","The first housing  includes a display device  that may be used to output a variety of content, such as a caller identification (ID), contacts, images (e.g., photos) as illustrated, email, multimedia messages, Internet browsing, game play, music, video, and so on. In an implementation, the display device  is configured to function as an input device by incorporating touchscreen functionality, e.g., through capacitive, surface acoustic wave, resistive, optical, strain gauge, dispersive signals, acoustic pulse, and other touchscreen functionality. The touchscreen functionality (as well as other functionality such as track pads) may also be used to detect gestures as further described below.","The second housing  is illustrated as including a keyboard  that may also be used to provide inputs to the mobile communications device . Although the keyboard  is illustrated as a QWERTY keyboard, a variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as a keyboard that follows a traditional telephone keypad layout (e.g., a twelve key numeric pad found on basic telephones), keyboards configured for other languages (e.g., Cyrillic), and so on.","The form factor employed by the mobile communications device  may be suitable to support a wide variety of features. For example, the keyboard  is illustrated as supporting a QWERTY configuration. This form factor may be convenient to a user to utilize the previously described functionality of the mobile communications device , such as to compose texts, play games, check email, \u201csurf\u201d the Internet, provide status messages for a social network, and so on.","The mobile communications device  is also illustrated as including a communication module . The communication module  is representative of functionality of the mobile communications device  to communicate via a network . For example, the communication module  may include telephone functionality to make and receive telephone calls. The communication module  may also include a variety of other functionality, such as to capture content, form short message service (SMS) text messages, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages, emails, status updates to be communicated to a social network service, and so on. A user, for instance, may input a status update for communication via the network  to the social network service. The social network service may then publish the status update to \u201cfriends\u201d of the user, e.g., for receipt by the friends via a computer, respective mobile communications devices, and so on. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as blogging, instant messaging, and so on.","The mobile communications device  is also illustrated as including a power management module  that is representative of functionality of the mobile communications device  to manage and assist in management of power consumption of a battery . For example, the display device  is illustrated as outputting a user interface  that includes a representation  of a current power level of the battery , e.g., 40 percent. Selection of the representation  by a user's finger  or other implement causes the power management module  to output a user interface configured to manage power consumption of the mobile communications device , further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following figure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","102","202","202"]},"For example, the power management module  may incorporate functionality to monitor use of the battery  to perform a variety of different tasks. This monitored usage may then be used to store data that describes the tasks and the amount of power consumed to perform the tasks, which is illustrated as a task power consumption list  in this example. A variety of different tasks may be monitored and described, such as applications , network power profiles , data sync , media output , telephone usage , and so on.","For example, the applications  may describe power used during execution of the application as a whole, such as an amount of power typically consumed over a period of time. The applications  may also describe specific tasks performed through execution of the applications , such as to access a network, render video, emulate hardware functionality typically found on a full-feature computing device (e.g., 3D acceleration), and so on. Thus, the applications  may describe how a user typically interacts with the application and thus be used to give an accurate assessment of this usage.","The network power profiles  may be used to describe usage of different wireless networks. For example, the communication module  may include functionality to communicate over a mobile phone network (e.g., as a wireless phone, access point, or so on) as well as over a local wireless network, such as IEEE 802.11, WiFi, Bluetooth, and so on. Because usage of these different networks may consume different amounts of power, the power management module  may track the performance of tasks in relation to the different networks to aid in management of the battery .","Data sync  describes an amount of power used to perform data synchronization. For example, an operating system of the mobile communications device  may provide a utility to synchronize data such email, contacts, to send and text messages, appointments, and so on. Accordingly, the power management module  may track an amount of power used to perform these various synchronization tasks as well as a frequency at which these tasks are typically performed.","The power management module  may also monitor media output , such an amount of power used to obtain and render streaming media, play songs or movies, games, and so on. Telephone usage  may also be monitored by the power management module , such as an amount of power used in a typical phone call placed by a user of the mobile communications device . Although a few examples have been listed of tasks that may be monitored by the power management module , it should be readily apparent that a wide variety of other tasks are also contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, such as to monitor the battery  itself for decreasing amounts of power as time goes on, such as due to a \u201cmemory effect\u201d of the battery .","Additionally, although monitoring by the power management module  has been described, it should be apparent that an amount of power used to perform tasks may be determined in a variety of ways. For example, the power management module  may output a user interface via which a user may pre-enter statistics that describe power consumption, e.g., per minute for a phone call, browser application, and so on. In another example, the power management module  may receive these statistics from an outside source, e.g., downloaded via the network . In a further example, these statistics may be entered by a manufacturer or supplier of the mobile communications device .","The power management module  may then leverage the monitored usage described by the task power consumption list  in a variety of ways to aid power management of the mobile communications device . One such example is illustrated in  by the user interface . As previously described the user interface  was output in response to selection of the representation  of the current power level of the battery  in . It should be readily apparent, however, that the user interface  may be output in response to a wide variety of criteria, such as when the amount of power available from the battery  drops below a threshold.","The user interface  as displayed in  is configured to inform and therefore aid a user as to which actions may be performed to manage power consumption and the effect of those actions. In one illustrated example, the user interface  describes an amount of time the mobile communication device  may continue to function as currently configured. For example, this amount of time may be based on which applications are currently being executed by the device as well as other tasks are currently configured to execute, such as data synchronization.","The user interface  also shows a possible effect of adding additional tasks to be performed by the mobile communications device . For example, the user interface  shows the effect of adding another application (a fifth application to the other four currently executing applications) to an amount of standby time and talk time. The user interface  also shows that media streaming may be performed for 3.5 hours and internet browsing may be performed for 8 hours based on an amount of power that is currently available from the battery . Therefore, the user interface  illustrates a result of an action of selecting performance of these additional tasks and informs the user in a readily understood manner how.","The user interface  also displays an option that is selectable to initiate a battery conservation mode. In the illustrated example, the battery conservation mode promotes conservation by terminating applications, setting data synchronization to manual, reducing brightness of the display, and turning vibrate off. Additionally, the user interface  shows an effect of this mode in which the standby time of the mobile communications device  is increased. Thus, in the example of  the user interface  may be used to increase or decrease \u201cbattery life\u201d of the battery  based on the desires of the user. A variety of other examples are also contemplated, further discussion of which may be found in relation to the following procedures.","Example Procedures","The following discussion describes power management techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to the environment  and systems  of , respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","302","118","204","102"]},"A determination is made as to an amount of power that remains in a battery of the mobile communications device (block ). Continuing with the previous example, the power management module  may also monitor usage of the battery . In an implementation, this monitoring may take into account a decreased ability of the battery  to store power over time, such as due to a \u201cmemory effect.\u201d","A user interface is displayed on a display device of the mobile communications device that describes an amount of time each of a plurality of tasks may be performed based on the determined amount of power that remains in the battery (block ). As shown in the user interface  of , for example, the plurality of tasks may be described along with the effect of performance of the task on the amount of power that is available from the battery . This may be expressed in a variety of ways, such as by displaying an amount of time the task may be performed, an amount of time a mobile communications device  remains operational, and so on. For example, the user interface may describe an amount of time that a Web browser may be used to browse the Internet. In another example, the user interface describes an amount of time that media may be rendered, such as music, video, games, and so on. In a further example, the user interface describes a number of times a task may be performed, e.g., data synchronization. In an implementation, the steps may be repeated at predetermined intervals of time to update the user interface as the amount of power in the battery  decreases or increases, e.g., due to charging.","Although this example described output of the user interface to aid a user in managing power consumption of the mobile communications device, a variety of other functionality may also be employed that does not involve user intervention. Further discussion of power management functionality that may be performed automatically and without user intervention may be found in relation to the following figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404"]},"For example, the power management module  to be part of an operating system that exposes an application programming interface to one or more other applications that executable on the mobile communications device . Data exposed via the API may be used by the application to address performance of one or more tasks by the application.","For example, the mobile communications device  may be configured such that 3-D acceleration functionality is not included. Therefore, the application may be configured to emulate this functionality on a processor of the mobile communications device , which may consume a significant amount of power. Consequently, if the application detects that the amount of power that is available from the battery  is decreased below a certain threshold, the application may restrict this emulation from being performed to conserve power of the battery . In this way, the application may change how hardware resources of the mobile communications device  are used to perform tasks and may do so automatically and without user intervention.","A variety of other thresholds may also be employed by the power management module . In an implementation, a plurality of threshold levels are set (e.g., by a user, a manufacturer, and so on) in terms of a combinatory list of tasks (e.g., execution of applications) that are allowed to be performed at different power levels of the battery . Therefore, when the power management module  determines that a particular power level of the battery  has been achieved, for instance, the power management module  may query the list to determine which tasks the mobile communications device  is permitted to perform, either simultaneously or individually. In this way, the mobile communications device  may use the list to determine a priority of tasks for various power levels of the battery .","A variety of other examples are also contemplated, such as by reducing a frequency at which tasks are performed (e.g., data synchronization), a frame rate used to display content, and so on. For instance, the power management module  may communicate data that causes the application to terminate execution on the mobile communications device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","118","118"]},"An amount of power that remains in a battery is monitored (block ). If the amount of power drops below a threshold level that is set to enable a telephone call, telephone calls are restricted from being performed that are directed at non-emergency telephone numbers (block ). For example, the threshold level may be set to enable a plurality of telephone calls of a specific duration. Therefore, if the power drops below this level, the power management module  may restrict features from being performed that are related to non-emergency tasks, such as data synchronization, media rendering (e.g., playing music), and so on. For example, the power management module  may use a list (e.g., that may be user specified) that indicates a priority for each task to determine whether to interrupt a current activity based on the priority. In this way, the power management module  may interrupt a current task (e.g., terminate execution of an application) based on user priority.","Example Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-2"],"b":["600","600","102","600"]},"Device  includes input  that may include Internet Protocol (IP) inputs as well as other input devices, such as the keyboard  of .

A network interface provides a connection between device  and a communication network by which other electronic and computing devices can communicate data with device . A wireless interface enables device  to operate as a mobile device for wireless communications.","Device  also includes one or more processors  (e.g., any of microprocessors, controllers, and the like) which process various computer-executable instructions to control the operation of device  and to communicate with other electronic devices.
