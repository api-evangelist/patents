{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to a geo-social networking service and, more particularly, to automatic location check-ins for a user based on the user's past location data.","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. A geo-social networking system is a social networking system in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions. User-submitted location data or geo-location techniques (e.g., mobile phone position tracking) can allow a geo-social network to connect and coordinate users with local people or events that match their interests. For example, users can check-in to a place using a mobile client application by providing a name of a place (or selecting a place from a pre-established list of places). The geo-social networking system, among other things, can record information about the user's presence at the place and possibly provide this information to other users of the geo-social networking system.","Particular embodiments relate to a geo-social networking system that includes features directed to automatically checking in a user to a place near the user's current location based on the user's past location data and check-in history. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system. Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.","When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a \u201cuser profile\u201d, in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user. For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example, if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends). Connections may be added explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.","The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information. Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile. Again, such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user's most-recent activities. Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile. For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or remove the user as a friend). A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages\u2014typically known as wall-posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.","A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.","A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events. For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. For example, the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system. Social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it). Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of other users.","The social networking system may also support a privacy model. A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user and\/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information. A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party application) that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections, a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the Internet). A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.","Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places. Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like. Some places may correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places\u2014such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport. In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,171, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device. For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place. In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location. For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client). The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system. In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and, using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place. A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place. The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place. The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place. An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users. For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database. Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place. For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place. U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/858,718, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present invention. The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.","Still further, a special purpose client application hosted on a mobile device of a user may be configured to continuously capture location data of the mobile device and send the location data to social networking system. In this manner, the social networking system may track the user's location and provide various recommendations to the user related to places that are proximal to the user's path or that are frequented by the user. In one implementation, a user may opt in to this recommendation service, which causes the client application to periodically post location data of the user to the social networking system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","102","103","104","101","102","103","104","120","122","121","122","122","122","120","121","122"]},"In particular embodiments, location database  may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments, check-in activity data, and the like). Places may be created by administrators of the system and\/or created by users of the system. For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database . As discussed above, a created place may correspond to a hub node, which an administrator can claim for purposes of augmenting the information about the place and for creating ads or other offers to be delivered to users. In particular embodiments, system front end  may construct and serve a web page of a place, as requested by a user. In some embodiments, a web page of a place may include selectable components for a user to \u201clike\u201d the place or check in to the place. In particular embodiments, location database  may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer's IP address. For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with cellular, Wi-Fi and\/or GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and\/or GPS positioning. In particular embodiments, location database  may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality of places. For example, a place can be a local business, a point of interest (e.g., Union Square in San Francisco, Calif.), a college, a city, or a national park. For example, a geographic location of a place (e.g., a local coffee shop) can be an address, a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), or a reference to another place (e.g., \u201cthe coffee shop next to the train station\u201d). For example, a geographic location of a place with a large area (e.g., Yosemite National Park) can be a shape (e.g., a circle, or a polygon) approximating the boundary of the place and\/or a centroid of the shape. For example, additional information of a place can be business hours, photos, or user reviews of the place. In particular embodiments, location database  may store a user's location data. For example, a user can create a place (e.g., a new restaurant or coffee shop) and the social networking system can store the created place in location database . For example, location database  may store a user's check-in activities. For example, location database  may store a user's geographic location provided by the user's GPS-equipped mobile device. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may calculate one or more routes of a user based on the user's user profile information, check-in activities, and\/or geographic location data reported by a client application (see above) and store the one or more routes in location database . For example, the social networking system can calculate a \u201ccommute route\u201d of a user between the user's home and work (as described in the user's user profile information stored in user profile database ) by using a mapping service application such as Google Map, or by using geographic location data points from the user's GPS-equipped mobile phone while the user is driving to work. Particular embodiments herein describe methods of automated location check-in for a user based on the user's location data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","102","202","203","104"]},"In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may rank the list of places based on distance, relevancy, and a configurable rule set (). For example, the location check-in process can rank the list of places based on a distance between each place of the list of places and the user's current location by arranging the places closest to the user's current location to the top of the list. In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may rank the list of places based on the user's recent activity in one or more places in the list of places. For example, a client application on the user's GPS-equipped mobile phone may periodically update and store the user's geographical location data in location database . The location check-in process can access location database , determine that the user has been within a pre-determined threshold distance (e.g. 300 feet) to geographical coordinates associated with a particular place of the list of places frequently (e.g., more than 3 times) in the past week, and the location check-in process can rank the particular place higher than other places in the list of places. For example, the location check-in process can access event database , determine that the user has multiple events at a location associated with a particular place of the list of places in the past month, and the location check-in process can rank the particular place higher than other places in the list of places. In other embodiments, the location check-in process may rank the list of places based on check-in activity of the user and check-in activity of one or more social contacts of the user, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/858,718, filed on Aug. 18, 2010. For example, the location check-in process can rank the list of places based on how often the user has checked into a place, or how often the user's first-degree contacts have checked into a place, or how recently the user or the user's social contacts has checked into a place.","In particular embodiments, a user or the social networking system may configure one or more rules in place check-ins and store the configuration with a configurable rule set in user profile database . For example, the social networking system may have a system-wide configurable rule for a threshold number of check-ins before automatic place check-in (e.g., to enable automatic place check in if the user has checked in to a place 3 or more times in the past 7 days) is suggested to a user. For example, the user may configure one or more places for future automatic check-ins. For example, the user may allow automatic check-in to a place but always marks the automatic check-ins as private (not viewable by other users in the social networking system). In addition, the user may access social networking system to turn this feature on\/off as desired, and\/or configure times of day when the feature should be de-activated. In some embodiments, the social networking system may store a copy of the configurable rule set in a local storage of a user's mobile device and periodically update the local copy. In one embodiment, a client application hosted on a user's mobile device may access the configurable rule set stored in user profile database  or in the user's mobile device for one or more places configured for automatic check in, and automatically check the user in to a particular place of the place configured for automatic check-in when GPS or other location data sensed by the mobile device is within a threshold proximity to the geographic coordinates associated with the particular place.","In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may access the configurable rule set of the user stored in user profile database  or in the user's mobile device and adjust the list of places accordingly. For example, the location check-in process can rank a place configured for automatic check-in to the top of the list of places. In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may automatically check in the user to the top ranked place from the list of places () provided that the user's current location data, such as GPS coordinates, and historical location provide sufficient confidence that the user is at the corresponding place. For example, if the user's current location is within a threshold distance of a centroid or other region that includes the location coordinates associated with previous check-ins to the same place, the location check-in process may automatically check in the user to the top-ranked place.","The location check-in process may recommend to a user a list of places to check in based on the user's location data, as illustrated in . Similarly to the example method in , in particular embodiments, the location check-in process may determine a user's current location (), access one or more data stores of places (), generate a list of places near the user's current location (), and rank the list of places based on distance, relevancy, and a configurable rule set (). In particular embodiments, if any places from the ranked list of places are configured for automatic check-in, the location check-in process may select a place for automatic check-in (). For example, the location check-in process can select a place for automatic check-in if there is only one place in the ranked list of places is configured for automatic check-in. For example, the location check-in process can select a particular place for automatic check-in among two or more places configured for automatic check-in from the ranked list of places, if the particular place is much closer to the user's current location (e.g., the particular place is within 100 feet from the user's current location, and all other places are at least 1000 feet away from the user's current location). In particular embodiments, if the location check-in process is able to select a place for automatic check-in, the location check-in process may automatically check in the user at the selected place ().","In particular embodiments, if the location check-in process is not able to select a place for automatic check-in, the location check-in process may present the ranked list of places to the user (). In particular embodiments, in response to the user's input, the location check-in process may check the user into a place from the ranked list of places (). For example, the location check-in process can present the ranked list of places to the user on the user's mobile phone, if the user selects a particular place from the ranked list of places, the location check-in process can check the user into the particular place. Additionally, in particular embodiments, the location check-in process may present the ranked list of places to the user, with an option for future automatic check-in for one or more places of the ranked list of places. For example, if the user selects a particular place from the ranked list of places and accepts the option of future automatic check-in for the particular place, the location check-in process can check the user into the particular place, and update the configurable rule set of the user for future automatic check-in for the particular place.","The location check-in process may configure one or more places for automatic check-in for a user, as illustrated in . In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may access location data of a user (). For example, the location check-in process can access the user's check-in activity information stored in location database . For example, the location check-in process can access the user's geographic locations stored in location database . For example, the location check-in process can access event database  and determine location data associated with the user's event data stored in event database . In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may access one or more data stores for one or more places in close proximity to the user's location data (). For example, the location check-in process can identify one or more places (e.g., restaurants, book store) within 1000 feet from a coffee shop that the user recently checked into. For example, the place check-in process can identify a place (e.g., \u201cAT&T Park, San Francisco, Calif.) for the user based on a geographic location (e.g., 37\u00b0 46\u203242.13\u201d N, 122\u00b0 23\u203224.27\u2033 W) reported by the user's GPS-equipped mobile device.","In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may rank the one or more places based on relevancy (). In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may rank the one or more places based on how frequently each place is associated with the user, for example, how often the user has checked into a place, or how often the user has been in close proximity to geographic coordinates associated with a place. In other embodiments, the location check-in process may rank the one or more places based on check-in activity of the user and check-in activity of one or more social contacts of the user, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/858,718, filed on Aug. 18, 2010. For example, the location check-in process can rank the list of places based on how often the user has checked into a place in the list of places, or how often the user's first-degree contacts have checked into a place, or how recently the user or the user's social contacts has checked into a place.","In particular embodiments, the location check-in process may configure the top X ranked places for future automatic check-in for the user (). For example, the location check-in process may configure the top 5 ranked places, or the top 10% ranked places, from the one or more places in close proximity to the user's location data as automatic check-in for the user, and store the configuration in user profile database . The example methods of location check-in illustrated in  and  can access the stored automatic check-in configuration information for a user and incorporate the information accordingly. In other embodiments, the location configuration process may configure the top X ranked places for future recommendation for automatic check-in and store the configuration in user profile database . The example method of recommending location check-in illustrated in  can access the stored recommendation information for automatic check-in for a user and incorporated the information accordingly.","While the foregoing embodiments may be implemented in a variety of network configurations, the following illustrates an example network environment for didactic, and not limiting, purposes.  illustrates an example network environment .
