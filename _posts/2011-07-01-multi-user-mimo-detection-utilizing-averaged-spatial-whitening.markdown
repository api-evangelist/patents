title: Multi user MIMO detection utilizing averaged spatial whitening
abstract: A system and method for decoding a Multi User (MU) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) signal is disclosed. The method comprises receiving a selected symbol in a tone of an MU-MIMO signal at a mobile communication device. A channel response for the selected symbol is identified. Spatial whitening is applied to the tone and the channel response using an average of a co-user interference plus noise matrix that is averaged over a selected number of tones. Maximal ratio combining is performed for the spatially whitened tone and the spatially whitened channel response matrix to decode the selected symbol out of the spatially whitened tone.

These uses have also increased the need for increased communication bandwidth to transmit multimedia, download programs, and stream media from desired sources. However, the increased need for bandwidth comes at a time when substantial new bandwidth is not available. Moreover, the increased processing needs often reduces the power that is available for the communication of data, thereby making it important to minimize the use of power while maximizing the amount of data that can be transmitted in a set amount of bandwidth.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, an object that is \u201csubstantially\u201d enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of \u201csubstantially\u201d is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The increasing use of multi-media and streaming in wireless devices has amplified the demand for bandwidth. One means for increasing bandwidth is through the use of multiple transmit antennas and\/or multiple receive antennas for transmitting a signal. The use of multiple transmit and\/or receive antennas offers significant increases in data throughput and link range without the need for additional bandwidth or transmit power. The increased data throughput can be achieved through higher spectral efficiency and link reliability obtained through antenna diversity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1D"],"b":["110","130","110","140","120","130","120","140"]},"Single User (SU)-MIMO can be configured with two or more transmit antennas in a downlink, which supports the transmission of multiple spatial layers, with up to four layers accessible by a selected mobile communication device. The mobile communication device is referred to by different names, including User Equipment (UE) in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Subscriber Unit (SU) in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard, which is commonly referred to as Wimax. SU-MIMO typically only involves access to the multiple antennas that are physically connected to each mobile communication device.","Multi User (MU)-MIMO can utilize the accessibility of multiple independent mobile communication devices to enhance the communication capabilities of each individual device. MU-MIMO involves the use of Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) which enables a terminal to transmit (or receive) a signal to\/from multiple users in the same frequency band simultaneously. Beamforming allows multiple signals transmitted by different antennas add up constructively to increase the amplitude of the received signal. In addition, the effects of multi-path fading can be reduced since each of the multiple signals that are transmitted typically travel over a different path, thereby each undergoing different fading effects. SDMA can be accomplished through the use of precoding at the transmitter.","Precoding is a generalization of beam forming to allow multi-layer transmission in MIMO communications. In single-layer beam forming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with selected weighting so that the signal power is maximized at the receiver output. When the receiver has multiple antennas, such as receiver  in and , single-layer beam forming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas. In order to maximize the throughput in the plurality of receive antennas, multi-layer beam forming can be used.","In SU-MIMO, precoding involves emitting multiple data streams from the transmit antennas with selected weighting so that the link throughput is maximized at the receiver output. In MU-MIMO, the data streams may be intended for different users. A multi-antenna transmitter  can communicate simultaneously with multiple receivers ,  that each has single or multiple antennas.","Spatial multiplexing in a MIMO system involves splitting a high rate data stream can be split into multiple lower rate data streams. Each of the lower rate data streams can then be transmitted from a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel at the same time. If the signals arrive at the receiver array with sufficiently different spatial signatures, the receiver can separate these streams into substantially parallel channels. The simultaneous transmission to a plurality of receivers using spatial multiplexing is synonymous with SDMA.","Precoding and decoding algorithms for SDMA systems may involve the use of linear and nonlinear precoding algorithms. Nonlinear algorithms can achieve the highest transmission capacities compared with linear precoding approaches. However, nonlinear algorithms typically have significantly increased complexity compared with linear approaches, thereby necessitating increased processing power, memory requirements, and power use at the mobile communication device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","206","208","210","212","202","204"],"sub":["0","1","n "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["0","1","Ns ","T ","s ","S","r ","r ","Ns "]},"In one embodiment, a total of Nusers can share the same OFDM tone. A single received tone, y, in Nantennas at a mobile communication device, where Nis the number of receive antennas (wherein N a positive integer), and x is the number of users in an MU-MIMO system, is given by:\n\n\n\nwhere s=[s, s, . . . , s]is a transmitted Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) symbols vector with sbeing the stream of interest (without losing generality), T represents a transposed matrix, and s=[s, . . . , s]is the co-users interference vector. H is the channel response matrix, with hthe channel response for s, His the channel response matrix for s, with H=[hH]. The noise at the receiver is represented by n. Any type of M-ary QAM symbols can be used, such as M=2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and so forth.\n","The total noise at the receiver plus the noise caused by the interference of the co-users is then v=Hs+n. The autocorrelation of the total noise v is R=E{bb}=HH+R, wherein the superscript H represents the Hermetian transpose and Ris the autocorrelation of the noise n at the receiver. It should be noted that the number of co-users, N\u22121, can be larger than the number of receiving antennas N. Typically, only the constellation of the stream to be decoded, s, is known to the receiver.","From the point of view at the receiver, the MU-MIMO can be regarded as a single stream transmission (SIMO scheme) since only one of the spatially multiplexed streams is to be decoded. The remaining N\u22121 streams are considered as noise. Each receiver may be assigned to receive data at a selected symbol in the received tone y. In the example above, the symbol in each tone that is received is selected as s. However, the receiver may be configured to receive any of the ssymbols in the received tone. The receiver can receive a plurality of tones and decode the selected symbol in each tone to form a stream of symbols. Thus, the symbol index may be referred to as a \u201cstream\u201d, referring to the symbol index that is received from each tone transmitted to the mobile communication device in the MU-MIMO system.","Generally, the objective at the transmitter is to minimize the interference contributed by the N\u22121 co-users for each of the multiplexed users, while maximizing the intended stream's Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) using spatial precoding.","In one embodiment, the receiver for each user can be a Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) type receiver. MRC is a method of diversity combining in which (a) the streams from each channel are added together; (b) the gain of each stream is made proportional to the Root Mean Square (RMS) signal level and inversely proportional to the mean square noise level in that stream; and (c) different proportionality constants are used for each stream.","The MRC receiver can be used to equalize the relevant stream and substantially ignore the interference caused by the co-users (i.e. the remaining streams s. . . sin the received tone y. In some designs, spatial whitening may be used prior to an MRC equalization to mitigate platform noise using some estimated noise statistics. The estimated noise statistics of noise at a receiver is represented by the variable {circumflex over (R)}.","In many cases the noise is correlated between the multiple receive antennas and may be de-correlated (whitened) prior to equalization in order to enhance demodulation performance. A spatial whitening module can be applied to correlated signals. The module can manipulate the signals such that the output vector can be shown to be substantially \u201cwhite\u201d, thereby resulting in spatially uncorrelated noise vectors. Spatially de-correlating the received signal can substantially increase the ability to decode the signal at the receiver.","In one example illustrated in , a received signal vector {tilde over (y)} is input into a spatial whitening module  along with {tilde over (h)}, representing the portion of the channel response matrix for the stream sthat is to be detected at a mobile communication device. The received signal vector {tilde over (y)} and the channel response matrix {tilde over (h)}for stream sare multiplied by a whitening matrix that is derived using the estimated noise statistics at the receiver, {circumflex over (R)}. The post-processed outputs hand y have substantially uncorrelated noise, enabling enhanced detection and decoding of the received signal y at the MRC receiver. The whitening module employing the estimated noise statistics of the receiver combined with the MRC receiver is referred to as Receiver A. The output of Receiver A is the data stream designated \u015c.

The output of a pre-processed value is typically illustrated without a tilda, thereby representing a post-processed value. The symbol \u201c^\u201d over a variable represents an estimate of a parameter.","Practical limitations such as limited feedback (in closed-loop systems), channel dynamics, and a limited number of subscribers that reduce the effectiveness of the transmitter's precoding, result in considerable co-user interference. Consequently, the MRC receiver used in Receiver A can suffer from a considerable performance loss since the co-user interference is not taken into account.","In practical systems, the channel response matrix of the co-users, H, can be estimated using designated transmitted pilots, such as the reference signals in the 3GPP specification or other types of pilots transmitted in an OFDM system. The co-user channel response matrix can be exploited to enhance the post equalization Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) using Minimal Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization.

Accordingly, the use of Receiver B may not be optimal when hardware and power limitations are present in mobile communication devices.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, spatial whitening using the total noise statistics R=HH+{circumflex over (R)}, which also includes the co-user interference, can be used in conjunction with an MRC operation (i.e. an MRC receiver) to achieve a similar result as the more hardware intensive operation of MMSE equalization, as displayed in .","For example,  illustrates Receiver C, wherein an MRC receiver is used in conjunction with a spatial whitening module .

The figure compares the spectral efficiency for N=1, 6, 9, and 18 for a fading channel. When N=1 it is equivalent to the use of an MMSE detector, as previously discussed. The spectral efficiency of an MRC receiver () is also plotted. As can be seen, the spectral efficiency for N=9 decreases, relative to the MMSE detector, from approximately 4.3 bits\/channel to 3.9 bits\/channel, resulting in a decreased spectral efficiency of approximately 10%. However, the complexity is decreased by a factor of 9. Thus, the use of the average co-users interference matrix provides a significant decrease in complexity while resulting in relatively small decreases in spectral efficiency relative to an MMSE receiver. In addition, the use of the average co-users interference matrix provides a significant improvement in spectral efficiency over a traditional MRC receiver. Even an N=18, the spectral efficiency is 3.1, a 35% increase over the spectral efficiency of the MRC receiver at 2.3 bits\/channel.","While the simulation was performed for a closed loop MU-MIMO scheme, the average noise plus co-user interference matrix can also be applied in an open loop MU-MIMO scheme as well.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method  for decoding a Multi User (MU) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) signal is disclosed, as depicted in the flow chart of .
