{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method to measure (or estimate) the complex frequency-dependent dilatational and shear wavenumbers of a single slab of material subjected to large static compressional forces. More particularly, this invention provides a method to determine complex dilatational wavespeed, complex shear wavespeed, complex Lam\u00e9 constants, complex Young's modulus, complex shear modulus, and complex Poisson's ratio.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Measuring the mechanical properties of slab-shaped materials are important because these parameters significantly contribute to the static and dynamic response of structures built with such materials. One characteristic that most elastomeric solids possess is that, when they are subjected to large static forces (or pressure), their rigidity changes. Materials that have one set of mechanical properties at a pressure of one atmosphere can have very different properties when subjected to increased pressure. The ability to determine the pressure dependence of material properties is extremely important for modeling the behavior of systems comprised of these materials.","Resonant techniques have been used to identify and measure longitudinal and shear properties for many years. These methods are based on comparing measured eigenvalues to modeled eigenvalues and calculating the resulting material properties. These methods do not account for static pressure or large compressive forces. Additionally, they typically require long, slender materials to perform the measurement process. Comparison of analytical models to measured frequency response functions are also used to estimate stiffness and loss parameters of a structure. When the analytical model agrees with one or more frequency response functions, the parameters used to calculate the analytical model are considered accurate. If the analytical model is formulated using a numerical method, a comparison of the model to the data can be difficult due to dispersion properties of the materials. These methods do not take into account large compressive forces.","In the prior art, some efforts have been made to measure material properties under large pressures. These methods consist of placing materials in pressurized settings, insonifying them, and then measuring their response. These methods are difficult because they have to be conducted under great atmospheric pressure that can adversely affect the instrumentation. Safety issues can also arise in connection with laboratory testing at extreme pressures. Finally, a mass loaded long thin rod has been studied with respect to the bar wavespeed and corresponding Young's modulus; however, this work does not investigate shear motion.","Accordingly, there is a need for a method of measuring mechanical properties of slab-shaped materials placed under pressure.","Accordingly, in this invention, a method to measure the complex frequency-dependent dilatational and shear wavenumbers of a material under a static compressional force is provided. The material is first vibrated in both vertical and horizontal directions while obtaining transfer functions in each direction. The two transfer functions are combined with a theoretical model to estimate a dilatational wavenumber and a shear wavenumber. The wavenumbers can be combined to give the complex dilatational wavespeed, complex shear wavespeed, complex Lam\u00e9 constants, complex Young's modulus, complex shear modulus, and complex Poisson's ratio.","The test procedure consists of vibrating a mass-loaded, slab-shaped test specimen  with a shaker  in two different directions, vertical A and horizontal B, as shown in , respectively. It is noted that the load mass  attached to the top of the test specimen  must be sufficiently stiffer than the specimen  that it can be modeled as lumped parameter expression rather than a continuous media system. A typical example would be a steel load mass  attached above a rubber-like material test specimen . This example results in a ratio between the two stiffnesses of greater than 100. Lower ratios result in less accurate estimations. Vibrating the combined specimen  and load mass  causes different waveforms to propagate in the specimen . The inverse method developed here allows for the data from the experiments to be manipulated so that the complex dilatational and shear wavenumbers can be measured for the specimen . This test is usually done at multiple frequencies (swept sine) so any frequency dependencies can be identified and measured. Input vibration data is collected from the shaker . A sensor  is mounted on load mass  and another sensor  is mounted on shaker  for collecting transfer function data. In , the test is set up for monitoring the vertical transfer function.  shows the test as set up for monitoring the horizontal transfer function. Sensors  and  should be oriented properly to capture the motion being measured. Other test configurations using directions other than vertical and horizontal are possible; however, the test setups shown are preferred for ease of set up and calculation. These sensors  can be either accelerometers that record accelerations, or laser velocimeters that record velocities. In the swept sine mode, transfer functions of acceleration divided by acceleration or velocity divided by velocity are both equal to displacement divided by displacement. The time domain data collected from the sensors  and  are Fourier transformed into the frequency domain and then recorded as complex transfer functions, typically using a spectrum analyzer .","The motion of the test specimen shown in  is governed by the equation: \n\n\nwhere \u03bb and \u03bc are the complex Lam\u00e9 constants (N\/m);\n\n","The coordinate system of the test configuration is shown in FIG. . Note that using this orientation results in b=0 and a having a value less than zero. The thickness of the specimen, h, is a positive value. Equation (1) is manipulated by writing the displacement vector u as \n\n\nwhere x is the location along the plate (m), y is the location into the plate (m), and z is the location normal to the plate (m), as shown in FIG. . The symbol \u2207 is the gradient vector differential operator written in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates as \n\n\nwith idenoting the unit vector in the x-direction, idenoting the unit vector in the y-direction, and idenoting the unit vector in the z-direction; \u2207is the three-dimensional Laplace operator operating on vector u as\n\n\u2207=\u2207=\u2207=\u2207,\u2003\u2003(4) \n\nand operating on scalar u as \n\n\nand the term \u2207\u00b7u is called the divergence and is equal to \n\n\nThe displacement vector u is written as\n\nu=\u2207\u03c6+\u2207\u00d7{overscore (\u03c8)},\u2003\u2003(7) \n\nwhere \u03c6 is a dilatational scalar potential, \u00d7denotes a vector cross product, and {overscore (\u03c8)} is an equivoluminal vector potential expressed as \n\n\nThe problem is formulated as a two-dimensional system, thus y=0, u(x,y,z,t)=0, and \u2202(\u00b7)\/\u2202y\u22610. Expanding equation (7) and breaking the displacement vector into its individual nonzero terms yields \n\n\nand \n\n","Equations (9) and (10) are next inserted into equation (1), which results in \n\n\nand \n\n\nwhere equation (11) corresponds to the dilatational component and equation (12) corresponds to the shear component of the displacement field. Correspondingly, the constants cand care the complex dilatational and shear wave speeds, respectively, and are determined by \n\n\nand \n\n\nThe relationship of the Lam\u00e9 constants to the Young's and shear moduli is shown as \n\n\nand \n\n\nwhere E is the complex Young's modulus (N\/m), G is the complex shear modulus (N\/m), and \u03bd is the Poisson's ratio of the material (dimensionless).\n","The conditions of infinite length and steady-state response are now imposed, allowing the scalar and vector potential to be written as\n\n\u03c6()=\u03a6()exp()exp()\u2003\u2003(17) \n\nand\n\n\u03c8()=\u03c8()exp()exp()\u2003\u2003(18) \n\nwhere i is the square root of \u2212l, \u03c9 is frequency (rad\/s), and k is wavenumber with respect to the x axis (rad\/m). Inserting equation (17) into equation (11) yields \n\n\nwhere \n\n\nand \n\n\nInserting equation (18) into equation (12) yields. \n\n\nwhere \n\n\nand \n\n","The solution to equation (19) is\n\n\u03a6()=()exp()+(,\u03c9)exp(\u2212)+()exp(\u2212),\u2003\u2003(25) \n\nand the solution to equation (22) is\n\n\u03c8()=(,\u03c9)exp()+(,\u03c9)exp(\u2212),\u2003\u2003(26) \n\nwhere A(k,\u03c9), B(k,\u03c9), C(k,\u03c9), and D(k,\u03c9) are wave response coefficients that are determined below. The displacements can now be written as functions of the unknown constants using the expressions in equations (9) and (10). They are \n\n\nand \n\n\nSpecific boundary conditions are now needed to individually solve for the case of vertical and horizontal motion. These are formulated separately below.\n","For the case of vertical motion, the base at z=a is vibrated vertically using a shaker, as shown in FIG. . Four boundary conditions are necessary to formulate this problem. Because the mass is attached to the material, the tangential (horizontal) motion at the top of the plate (z=b) is zero and this equation is written as\n\n()=0.\u2003\u2003(29) \n\nThe normal stress at the top of the specimen is equal to and opposite the load created by the mass in the z direction.

This involves using the experimental data and equation (59) to estimate the dilatational wavenumber. Equation (59) can be rewritten as \n\n\nwhere the problem now becomes finding the zeros of the right-hand side of equation (60), or, in the presence of actual data that contains noise, finding the relative minima of the right-hand side of equation (60) and determining which relative minimum corresponds to dilatational wave propagation and which relative minima are extraneous. Because equation (60) has a number of relative minima, zero finding algorithms are not applied to this function, as they typically do not find all of the minima locations and are highly dependent on initial starting locations. The best method to find all of the minima locations is by plotting the absolute value of the right-hand side of equation (60) as a surface with the real part of dilatational wavenumber kon one axis and the imaginary part of kon the other axis. In order to do this, the user should start at a low frequency where the aliasing minimum has not yet appeared. In the specific example shown herein, this is below 3850 Hz for the dilatational wave and below 1550 Hz for the shear wave. At these lower frequencies, the minimum furthest to the left will correspond to dilatational wave propagation. As the frequency increases, extraneous minima will appear to the left of the minimum that corresponds to dilatational wave propagation, however, the wave propagation minimum will always be close to the previous test frequency wave propagation minimum provided that the frequency increments are relatively small. At a resolution of 0.5 rad\/m for the materials in the example herein, this requires a frequency increment of 37.3 Hz for the dilatational measurement and 14.4 Hz for the shear measurement. Different test specimens and top masses require different increments. Additionally, the real part of the wavenumber is a monotonically increasing function with respect to frequency, so at each increase in frequency, the new wavenumber to be estimated has to be greater than the old wavenumber that was previously estimated. This process is further illustrated as related to the discussion concerning FIG.  and  below.\n","For the case of horizontal motion, the base at z=a is vibrated horizontally using a shaker, as shown in FIG. . Four boundary conditions are necessary to formulate this problem. Because the mass is attached to the material, the shear (tangential) stress at the top of the plate is equal to opposite the load created by the mass in the x direction. This expression is \n\n\nwhere M is mass per unit area (kg\/m) of the attached mass. The normal motion at the top of the plate (z=b) is zero and this equation is written as\n\n()=0.\u2003\u2003(62) \n\nThe tangential motion at the bottom of the plate (z=a) is prescribed as a system input and this equation is written as\n\n()=exp().\u2003\u2003(63) \n\nand the normal motion at the bottom of the plate is zero.
