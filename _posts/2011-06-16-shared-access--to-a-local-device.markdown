{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","SPECIFICATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to electronic devices, and more specifically, to sharing electronic devices via a network.","Computers and other electronic devices such as tablets, mobile phones, gaming consoles and other comparable devices (hereinafter a \u201ccomputer\u201d) may be configured to be electronically connected to various external devices, for example, and not by way of limitation, printers, cameras, scanners, computers, phones, and the like (an \u201cexternal device\u201d). Many external devices may be configured to be connected to a computer through a network (a \u201cnetwork device\u201d) or locally (a \u201clocal device\u201d). Network devices may be connected to multiple computers through a network, where each computer may individually access the network device. On the contrary, local devices often may only connect to a single computer at any given time. In order to connect the local device to another computer, the local device may need to be disconnected from the first computer. When a local device is locally connected to a computer, it may install (or require the user to install on the computer) a device specific driver. The driver allows the computer to communicate and provide commands to the local device. It is now more common for people to have more than a single computer at home, but many of these devices may be local devices, rather than network devices. For example, a family may have a single printer, but each member in the family may have his or her own computer.","Examples of the disclosure may take the form of a method for providing a local device service over a network, where the local device is not configured for network access. The method includes determining whether the local device is busy, and if the local device is not busy, broadcasting over the network an available first service provided by the local device. Then, if the local device is not busy and is selected by a computer, providing the computer access to the local device.","Other examples of the disclosure may take the form of a method for connecting a computer to a service provided by a local device over a network. The method may include determining by the computer whether there is a service available over the network. If there is a service available, selecting a local device configured to provide the service. Once the local device is selected, communicating with a connection station in communication with the computer and the local device. Then, launching a driver on the computer corresponding to the local device.","Still other examples of the disclosure may take the form of a connecting station for providing network access to a local device. The connecting station may include a network interface configured to receive a service notification from a local device and a selection notification from a computer. The connecting station may also include a processor in communication with the network interface. The processor is configured to broadcast the service notification from the local device over a network to the computer, and provide the computer access to the local when the computer transmits the selection notification to the network interface.","Overview","In some embodiments herein, the disclosure may take the form of a method for providing access to local devices via a network (for example, WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, and other networking topologies). The local device may be a non-networked device or may include at least one non-networked function. For example, the local device may be a multi-function printer, copier, scanner, where the scanner and copying functions may be configured to be locally accessed only. The method allows for the local device (or certain functions of the device) to be provided over the network, without requiring the local device to be specifically configured for network access. In other words, the disclosure provides for \u201cout of the box\u201d components to be available across a network, without substantially modifying a software driver corresponding to the computer and\/or the local device.","Additionally, the disclosure may provide for multiple functions offered by the local device to be used in parallel. For example, the local device may include a printing function and a scanning function and the disclosure may connect the computer to the local device via a printer access, while providing a separate scanning access that may be used by a second computer.","In one embodiment, a connecting station may provide network access to a local device by a computer over a network. Although the connecting station may be placed between the communication of the local device and the computer, the computer and the device may appear (when connected) to each other as being connected locally (e.g., via a direct universal serial bus connection). In this manner, the local device and\/or the computer may not have to be specially configured to appear on or connect to a network. The connecting station may also facilitate and\/or translate the communications between the local device and the computer.","In an exemplary embodiment, a system for providing network access to a local device by one or more computers may include at least one computer, a connecting station, and a local device.  is a block diagram of a system  for providing network access to a local device. The system  may include a computer  in communication with a connecting station  via a network . The connecting station  may then be in communication with a local device . Thus, the connecting station  is in communication with both the computer  and the local device . In this embodiment, communications between the computer  and the local device  may be transmitted via the connecting station . The connecting station  may provide the computer  access to the local device  (or select functions of the local device ) via the network , although the local device  may not be originally configured to be a networked device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","102","140","108","104","104","140","108","104","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"],"b":["104","106","162","164","104","108","102","121","104","102","121","106","162","164","162","164"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","102","102","110","112","116","114","102","118","102"]},"The network\/communication interface  may receive and transmit various electrical signals. For example, the network\/communication interface  may be used to connect the computer  to the network  in order to transmit and receive signals to and\/or from the connecting station , as well as other devices and computers on the network . The network communication interface  may also be used to transmit and send electronic signals via a wireless or wired connection (including, but not limited to, Internet, WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, USB, and Firewire).","The memory  may store electronic data that may be utilized by the computer . For example, the memory  may store electrical data containing any type of content, including, but not limited to, audio files, video files, document files, and data files. Stored data may correspond to one or more various applications and\/or operations of the computer. The memory  may be of any format, including, but not limited to, non-volatile storage, a magnetic storage medium, optical storage medium, magneto-optical storage medium, electrical storage medium, read only memory, random access memory, erasable programmable memory, and flash memory. The memory may be provided local to and\/or remote from the computer.","The processor  may control the operation of the computer  and its various components. The processor  may be in communication with the connecting station . The processor  may be substantially any electronic device cable of processing, receiving, and\/or transmitting instructions. For example, the processor  may be microprocessor or a microcomputer.","The input\/output interface  facilitates communication by the computer  to and from a variety of devices\/sources. For example, the input\/output interface  may receive data from a user (e.g., via a keyboard, touch sensitive surface, mouse, audible input or other device), control buttons on the computer  (e.g., power button, volume buttons), and so on. Additionally, the input\/output interface  may also receive\/transmit data to and from an external drive, e.g., a universal serial bus (USB), or other video\/audio\/data inputs.","Referring again to , the network  provides electronic communication between the connecting station  and the computer . The network  may be virtually any type of electronic communication mechanism\/path and may be wireless or wired, or a combination of wired and wireless. For example, the network  may include the Internet, Ethernet, universal serial bus cables (USB), or radio signals (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth). In one example, the network  may be a local area network (LAN), however in other examples, the network  may be a wide area network (WAN), or network topologies may be utilized as desired for any given implementation.","Referring now to , the connecting station , may be substantially any type of computing device configured to provide communication between two devices. The connecting station  is configured to provide electronic communication to and from the computer  and the local device . The electronic communication between the two devices may utilize any connection topology include wired and\/or wireless topologies. Further, such connection between the connecting station  and the local device  may be direct or indirect. For example, the local device  may be directly connected to the connecting station  and the computer  may be wirelessly connected to the connecting station . However, other setups may be used, e.g., the computer  and the local device  may both be wirelessly connected to the connecting station , and so on. Additionally, the connecting station  may provide router functions. In other words, the connecting station  may receive and send data packets from one device to another.","The connecting station  may include a processor , a network communication interface , memory , and a system bus  that may electrically connect the various components. The processor  may be substantially similar the processor  in the computer ; however, depending on the desired applications, the processor  in the connecting station  may be generally less powerful than the computer . Similarly, the memory  may be substantially the same as the memory  in the computer , although the memory  in the connecting station  may be configured to store (generally) less data. External memory and data storage services can also be utilized, separately or in combination with memory , as desired for any given implementation.","The network\/communication interface  may also be, but need not be, substantially the same as the network\/communication interface  in the computer . The network\/communication interface  may be further configured to provide network  access to certain devices, connect devices to each other, perform networking functions between and amongst multiple, perhaps disparate, computers and local device and perform other network and connectivity management functions. For example, the network\/communication interface  may provide router functions to the computer , local device , and other devices connected, directly or indirectly, therewith.","Still referring to , the local device  may be practically any device that may be electronically connected to a computer. Additionally, the local device  may be a device configured to be locally connected to a computer, that is, connected to a computer directly and not as part of a network. For example, the local device  may be a printer, scanner, camera, video camera, storage, and the like. Further, in some examples, the local device  may be configured to offer multiple services or applications. In these examples, the local device  may be configured so that one, but not all of the services or applications, offered by the device  may be offered through a network. For example, the local device  may be a multi-function device offering multiple services or functions, such as printing, coping, storage, and scanning; however, only the printer function may provide functionality as a networked service. It should be noted, that the local device  may be a multi-function device or a single function device.","In some embodiments, the local device  may be configured to be operably connected to a computer  via connection . The connection  may be wired or wireless connection, such as a cable. If wired, the cable may be substantially any type of cable for supporting electronic communications, and in one example, the cable  may be a USB. As shown in , the local device  may be in communication with the connecting station  via connection .","Referring again to , the system  may provide the computer  network access to the local device , although the local device  may generally be configured to communicate directly through the connection . This may allow, in some embodiments, the connecting station  and computer  to be able to be backwards compatible with the local device . In other words, the local device  may not have the networking capabilities, but the connecting station  can provide network capabilities to the functions offered by the local device . Furthermore, the local device  may be communicatively connected to other devices and computers via the connecting station  and the network , without substantially requiring modifications to either the software of the device (e.g., drivers), or the hardware of the device (e.g., networking cards, modules, and so on).","The connecting station  can provide network capabilities to a number of different devices that may not have been originally configured to provide network capabilities. This allows a local device  to function as a network device, but without the increased expense that a network device may usually require, e.g., acquiring rights to the protocol stacks utilized in conjunction with many networking topologies. Additionally, the local device  may be able to be accessed and used by multiple computers, which may allow multiple users to access the same device at substantially the same time and without concern as to the geographic proximity of the given user's computer and the local device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","200","106","102","102","106","200","202","106","104"]},"Once the local device  is in communication with the connecting station , the method  may proceed to operation  and the connecting station  may determine whether the local device  is in use or otherwise available for use, e.g., the local device  may be in use, but may have a buffer allowing it to receive additional inputs. This operation may determine whether the local device  is busy, or if the local device  provides multiple functions the specific functions that may be currently available. Additionally, in some embodiments, the connecting station  may determine status information from the local device , such as whether the local device  may be available in a certain amount of time. If the local device  is in use or otherwise unavailable, the method  may proceed to operation  and the connecting station  may wait for a predetermined, determined, random or select time until the local device  may no longer be in use or unavailable.","Once the local device  (or the specific function) is available for the given computer to access, the method  may proceed to operation . In operation , the connecting station  may broadcast an advertisement or other alert over the network . For example, the connecting station  may use a service discovery protocol, such as, domain name system service discovery (DNS-SD), to advertise each local device  that may be shared as a service over the network.","The alert or advertisement may include a notice that the local device  is available. In other embodiments, the presence of the alert or advertisement may itself indicate that the local device  is available. In other words, the connecting station  may only provide an advertisement or alert for the local devices  that are actually available. Therefore, if a local device  is busy, it may not have an advertisement or alert. Similarly, any connected devices that are either busy or not capable of being shared may not be advertised. Furthermore, when the local device  is disconnected from the connecting station , the connecting station  may no longer advertise the particular device. In this manner, superfluous advertisements may be avoided and only local devices  that may be shared may be advertised.","The broadcast may be transmitted so that each computer  can be configured to receive the advertisement. For example, the computer  may use the same or similar service discovery protocol as the connecting station  and may receive advertisements, as well as updates to the existing advertisements.","Additionally, it should be noted that the connecting station  may further be in communication with multiple devices, and each device (or select devices) may also be broadcast on the network . Therefore, the broadcast may include multiple different devices that all may be available to the different computers  in communication with the network . It should be noted that in some alternative embodiments, the computer  and the connecting station  may communicate on a challenge and reply basis. For example, the computer  may query the connecting station  to see if there are any available devices prior to receiving a broadcast.","The broadcast or advertisement by the connecting station  may include information regarding the local device . This information may allow user (or computer ) to determine whether or not he or she wishes to connect to the local device . The information may include the vendor information (e.g., brand name), serial number, and other relevant information, e.g., functions offered by the local device .","Once the local device  has been broadcast on the network , the method  proceeds to operation  and the connecting station  determines whether the computer  has requested exclusive access to the local device . The selection process by the computer  is discussed in more detail with respect to . However, when the computer  requests access to the local device , the computer  may place a call to the connecting station  indicating that it wishes to connect to the local device  (or function). Once the local device  is selected, the method  may proceed to operation .","Operation  determines whether the local device  is busy. The connecting station  may determine if a computer  currently has exclusive access to the local device  and\/or whether the desired function of the local device  is in use.","In alterative embodiments, the local device  may also be considered to be busy if the computer  has access to the local device  and is currently communicating with the local device , or may communicate with the local device  in the future. However, these embodiments may be more difficult to implement. This may be because future communication between the local device  and the computer  may be difficult to predict. For example, if the local device  is a printer and it runs out of paper, there may be no communication between the local device  and the computer  until more paper is fed into the device . As viewed by the connecting station , this lack of current communication may be a sign of the end of communications between the computer  and the local device , whereas it may just be a temporary condition. Therefore, generally, the local device  may be determined to be busy simply if a computer has exclusive access to the local device .","It should be noted that in some embodiments, the broadcast in operation  may include a status of the local device , e.g., whether the local device  is busy. However, operation  may be completed for the instances where the local device  may become busy between operation  and operation . But, it should be noted that in some embodiments, operation  may be omitted, as operation  may not be performed unless in operation  the connecting station  determines that the local device  is not in use. In this embodiment, the connecting station  may not broadcast the local device  as being available if the local device  is currently in use\/busy.","If in operation  the connecting station  determines that the local device  is busy, then the method  may proceed to operation . Operation  may deny the computer  access to the local device  (or function). For example, the connecting station  may provide an alert message to the computer  that the local device  (or function) is no longer available.","Once the connecting station  has denied the computer  access to the local device , the method  may proceed to operation . Operation , broadcasts that the local device  (or function) is in use. For example, the original broadcast advertisement from operation  may be altered to indicate that the local device  is busy or the advertisement may simply be removed. Additionally, the in use advertisement may also include information, relating to the computer  accessing the local device , such as an identifier. The method  may then return to operation , and the connecting station  may once again check to determine if the local device  (or function) is in use. If the local device has been detached, then operation  may indicate that the local device  is once again available.","If in operation  the connecting station  determines that the local device  is not busy, the method  proceeds to operation  and the computer  is granted access to the local device . The local device  is then communicatively coupled with the computer . The local device  may then be considered to be \u201cattached\u201d to the computer , but it should be noted that the local device  may be attached \u201cvirtually\u201d and not \u201cphysically\u201d attached to the computer . That is, the local device  may be directly connected, via connection  to the connecting station , and through the connecting station , the local device  may be attached or in communication with the computer .","As discussed in more detail with respect to , once the local device  is virtualized on the computer , the computer  may then view the local device  as local. It should be noted that in some embodiments, attaching the local device  may involve connecting a discrete function of the local device  to the computer . For example, if the local device  has both a scanning function and a printing function, the local device  may be connected to the computer  only with respect to one function, e.g., the printing function, and not for other functions.","In some embodiments, the local device  may not be attached to the computer  until operation . This means that there may not be a connection between the local device  and the computer  until initiated by the user (via the computer ). This may prevent the computer  from monopolizing the function or the entire local device  until the function or the local device  may actually be utilized. Because the local device  may not be configured as a \u201cnetwork\u201d device, the local device  may only be configured to provide a single function or connection at a time. Therefore, by preventing the computer  from connecting to the function or local device  until the function will actually be utilized, the local device  is available to connect to other computers in the downtime between use.","Once the local device  (or discrete function) has been connected to the computer , the method  may proceed to operation . The connecting station  may determine whether there has been a connection break between the computer  and the local device . For example, the local device  or computer  may have died, lost a connection to the network , or otherwise be prevented from communicating. If the connection between the local device  and the computer  has not been broken, the method  may proceed to operation .","In operation  the connecting station  may broadcast, via the network , that the local device  is in use. The broadcast may allow other computers and devices accessing the network  to view that the local device  (or certain functions of the local device ) may be unavailable. The method  may then return to operation  and the connecting station  may determine whether the local device  is in use.","If, in operation  the connection between the local device  and the computer  is broken, the method  may proceed to operation . The connecting station  may notify the computer  (or the local device ) that access is no longer available. The connecting station  may then terminate the computer's  access to the local device  and the method  may end. It should be noted that at substantially any point while the connecting station  is providing the computer  access to the local device , the connecting station  may check to determine if the connection between the two has been broken. This may prevent the computer  from monopolizing access the local device  if the connection between the computer  and the local device  is broken.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["106","106","102","108","300","302","102","108","108","302","102","102","108"]},"In operation , the computer  may scan or search the network  by searching for the broadcast alerts or advertisements, such as the advertisements by the connecting station  in operations ,  in method . The advertisement may include information regarding the local device , e.g., the manufacturer, part number, serial number, product name, and so on.","After operation , the method  may proceed to operation  and the computer , the connecting station , and\/or the user may determine whether the device and\/or function is busy. For example, if the local device  is currently being used by another computer on the network , the connecting station  may transmit another advertisement indicating that the local device  is busy. If the selected or desired device is busy, the method  may return to operation . However, if the local device  is not busy, the method  may proceed to operation . It should be noted that in some embodiments the connecting station  may not broadcast an advertisement if the local device  is busy. Therefore, depending on the desired implementation, operation  may be omitted.","Operation  determines whether the computer  wants to use the local device  advertised over the network . For example, the user may view the information about the local device  such as its available functions (e.g., printing, scanning, and so on) and then may determine that he or she wishes to use the local device  and may configure the computer  to select the local device  (or function). The computer  may then request exclusive access to the local device  (or function) from the connecting station .","If in operation , the user does not wish to use the selected device, the method  may return to operation  and the computer  may once again search for available services. If, however, the user wishes to use the local device , the method  may proceed to operation .","Operation  determines whether a driver for the local device  is installed. The driver may be a software packet to allow the computer  to better communicate with the local device . The driver may include information specific to the local device  and may be configured to interact with one or more components of the computer . The driver may be provided to the computer  via the manufacturer (e.g., via a website) and there may be a specific driver for each local device  and\/or each function of the local device . If the driver is not installed, the method  may proceed to operation  and the driver may be installed. For example, many manufacturers of local devices may provide drivers for each local device on their website, and the computer  may download the required driver.","After the driver is installed in operation , the method  may return to operation  to determine if the local device  is busy. In some instances, installation of the driver may require the computer  to restart. In this case, the local device  may become unavailable and therefore, operation  once again determines if the local device  is available.","In some embodiments, the driver may be installed on the computer , rather than the connecting station . This is because there may be multiple local devices  that may be used and including the software driver on the connecting station  may require the connecting station  have more computing power and\/or memory. Therefore, generally, the connecting station  may interact with both the local device  and the computer  using generally generic operations that may be common to both the local device  and the computer . For example, if the local device  includes a USB connection, the connecting station  may communicate read, write, and device requests to and from the local device  and computer .","However, in other embodiments, the driver may be installed on the connecting station . In these embodiments, the connecting station  may perform a translation between drivers on the computer  versus a driver needed by the local device . In this way the computer  may not have to be compatible with or capable of accepting a particular driver for the local device . For example, the computer  may have an outdated operating system that may not be compatible with a driver for a new local device . In this way, the connecting station  may provide a communicating mechanism to provide at least some of the functional capabilities of the local device  to the computer . It should be noted that in these examples, a communication protocol between the connecting station  and the computer  may have be expanded. The communication protocol may have to include high-level driver operations, such as, endpoints to read\/write, decision order for select decisions, and to which device requests should be issued.","Once the driver is installed, the method  may proceed to operation  and the computer  may request exclusive access to the local device . For example, the computer  may request a local device  based on a network host name, network address, port number or other identifier that may be included in local device  advertisement. In some instances, access may be denied (as described in operation  in ) as the local device  may become busy between the time the request is received by the connecting station .","If the local device  is not busy, the connecting station  grants the computer  access to the local device. The computer  may request access to the entire local device , or a discrete function of the local device  to the computer .","Once access is granted to the computer , the method  may proceed to operation . Operation  initiates a virtual version of the local device  on the computer . The connecting station  is then an intermediary between the computer  and the local device , allowing the connecting station  to facilitate communications between the computer  and the local device .","When the local device  is virtualized on the computer , as viewed from both the computer  and the local device , the connection may appear to be a direct connection. However, both the computer  and the local device  may only be in communication with each other through the connecting station , that is a non-direct connection. Additionally, when the local device  is attached to the computer , the computer  may view the local device  as a local device, such as a local USB.","The connecting station  and\/or the computer  may tag the device information with a metadata tag along with its service broadcast that flags the device  as not being \u201clocal\u201d in the true sense (as viewed from the computer ). For example, all virtual device instances of the local device  on the computer  may be tagged so that they can be matched with the corresponding network service records in the computer  also corresponding to the local device . This may allow the computer  to present a single description of the local device  to the user.","In some embodiments, the computer  may include software that handles both network devices as well as locally attached devices. In these instances, the software may be configured to avoid treating the local device  attached to the connecting station  as two separate entities (a network device and a local device). Therefore, the listing or data corresponding to the local device  as broadcast on the network  and the local device  as appearing to the computer  may be combined together. This may allow the computer  to display a single description of the local device , rather than two separate descriptions (e.g., one as a shared device and one as a locally connected device). This may be done by the computer  and\/or by the connecting station .","The computer  may include a dedicated background process or other software that may communicate with the connecting station  as well as handle aspects of the virtualization of the local device . In some embodiments, a software library may communicate with the background process to provide an application programming interface. The application programming interface may allow an application running on the computer  to use the local device . In this manner, the applications may be able to integrate the virtual \u201cattaching\u201d and \u201cdetaching\u201d of the local device  in a manner that may be consistent with established user experience provided by the application. In other words, the application can connect and disconnect to the local device  via the background process in a way that may allow the local device  to be presented as directly attached (as viewed by the user).","For example, if the computer  includes a scanning application that includes directly connected devices and \u201ctrue\u201d network devices, the application can be made to present the local device  as a network device. When a user selects a particular device (e.g., from a clickable list of available models), the virtual attaching and detaching of the local device  to the computer  may be done via the application, but with help from the software library communicating with the background process.","Once the local device  is attached to the computer , the method  may proceed to optional operation  and other functions of the local device  may be blocked, other than the function being used by the computer . For example, the local device  may include a storage function and a scanning function. Once the computer  is connected to the local device  for a select function (e.g., scanning) other functions available on the local device  (e.g., retrieving stored files) may be blocked to the computer .","After operation , the method  may proceed to operation  and the computer  may launch the driver. Because the local device  may be seen as being attached locally (e.g., directly) to the computer , the driver may be launched and may operate properly, although the driver may not have been modified to allow the local device  to be attached via the network .","Once the driver has been launched, the computer  may be configured to communicate with the local device . The computer  (via the driver) may communicate with the local device  via the connecting station . This is discussed in more detail with respect to . As described above, when the local device  is attached to the computer , the local device  (or the select function) may be unavailable to other computers on the network . This is because as the local device  may not be configured to be a networked device and may only be configured to be directly connected (via cable ) to the computer . Therefore, although the connecting station  may substantially eliminate the need for the local device  to directly connect to the computer , the local device  may only be configured to have a single communication path open to an from an operating device (e.g., computer ). Additionally or alternatively, certain functions of the local device  may only be configured to be used by a single computer  at a time. For example, a scanning function may be configured to scan to a single computer at a time.","In an alterative embodiment, as shown in , the connecting station  may be configured to effectively \u201ctrick\u201d the local device  and\/or the computer  as thinking that either or both are connected to a single other device. For example, the local device  (via the connecting device ) may be \u201cspoofed\u201d into thinking that it is only connected to a single computer , when in fact it may be connected to multiple computers (e.g., one computer utilizing the scanning function and another utilizing another function). In this embodiment, the connecting station  may essentially act as a buffer between one or more computers ,  and the local device .","After operation , the method  proceeds to operation  and the connecting station  and\/or the local device  determines whether the computer  has finished using the local device . For example, the application using the local device  may be completed, the computer  may notify the connecting station  (e.g., via their point-to-point communication protocol) that it is done with the local device . The connecting station  may then update the advertisement of the local device  to reflect the current status of the local device , that is, that the local device  is now available.","If the computer  is not yet finished with the local device , the method  may proceed to operation  and a wait loop may pause the method  so that the computer  may finish. Once the computer  has finished with the local device , the method  may proceed to operation  and the virtual connection between the computer  and the local device  may be \u201cdetached\u201d and the \u201cin-use\u201d flag reset (as appropriate). The connecting station  may terminate the \u201cvirtual\u201d connection between the local device  and the computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["400","104","106","102","108","400","402","104","106","102","106","102","216","314","106","102","104","400","404"]},"Operation  determines whether the local device  and\/or the computer  have a command and\/or data that may need to be transfer to the other. The command or data may include a request such as read, write, retrieve information, reset, and so on. It should be noted that generally the local device  will not issue commands to the computer . Rather, generally, the computer  may exclusively request commands to the local device . Additionally, as discussed below with respect to operation , each request by the computer  is actually carried out by the connecting station .","If the local device  and\/or the computer  has a command for the other, the method  may proceed to operation . If, on the other hand neither the local device  nor the computer  has a command or data request for the other, the method  proceeds to operation .","Operation  determines whether a predetermined wait time has been exceeded. For example, if the computer  becomes unresponsive (e.g., loses a connection to the network , crashes, etc.) the connecting station  may revoke the computer's  access to the local device  after the wait time. As operation  may terminate a connection, it may prevent the computer  from monopolizing an exclusive access to the local device , despite the fact that the computer  may not longer be able to communicate with the connecting station  and the local device .","If neither the local device  nor the computer  have instructions for the other for a set period of time operation  determines whether the wait time has been exceeded, so that the method  may not proceed in an infinite loop. If there are no instructions after a set period of time, the method  may proceed to the end . However, if in operation  the wait time has not yet been exceed the method  may proceed back to operation  to determine whether there are any instructions. It should be noted that operation  may be a wait time period, number of cycles or other check in order to potentially prevent an infinite loop condition.","Additionally, in some instances, keep alive packets may be periodically sent between the computer  and the connecting station  The keep alive packets may alert the connecting station  that the computer  is still responsive and that the connection between the local device  and the computer  is still valid. When the connecting station  receives a keep alive packet it may restart the time out timer and\/or number of cycles before timeout. The keep alive packets may prevent the connecting station  from terminating an idle, but still responsive, connection between the computer  and the local device . For example, a lack of communication between the computer  and the local device  may not signify that the computer  has become unresponsive.","Once a command and\/or data has been received, the method  proceeds to operation , and the command and\/or data from the local device  or computer  is transmitted to the connecting station . Once the connecting station  receives the command and\/or data, the connecting station  may translate the command and\/or data at operation . The connecting station  translates the command and\/or data because commands and\/or data may be configured for a direct connection. For example, the local device  may be configured to communicate directly between the computer  and because the local device  is communicating to the computer  via the network , the commands and\/or data may be translated so as to appear to be locally transmitted.","Once the command and\/or data is transmitted, the method  proceeds to operation  and the command and\/or data may be transmitted to or from the local device . For example, the computer  may issue a read command from the local device  and after the command as been properly translated, the connecting station  may transmit the command to the local device . Similarly, the local device  may send data to the connecting station , which once it has been translated may then be transferred (via the network ) to the computer .","The foregoing description has broad application. For example, while examples disclosed herein may focus on providing access to a local device via a network, it should be appreciated that the concepts disclosed herein may equally apply to other types of devices that may be configured for a specific communication scheme. Similarly, although the network and connecting station may be discussed with respect to a local device, the devices and techniques disclosed herein are equally applicable to specific functions or services provided by multiple devices. Accordingly, the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary and is not intended to suggest that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to these examples."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
