{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","ART BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/825,442, filed May 20, 2013.","This invention was developed under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to photonic devices that perform modulation, switching, and filtering functions and the like through application of electro-refractive effects.","Conventional lithium niobate optical intensity modulators are widely used, not least because they have a relatively large optical bandwidth. The typical linearity of such a modulator is on the order of 122 dB in a 1-Hz bandwidth. There are specialized electro-absorption modulators with better linearity than lithium niobate modulators, but they generally suffer from a relatively narrow optical bandwidth. Thus, there remains a need for modulators that offer the combined advantages of high linearity and high optical bandwidth.","We have provided a new, highly linear carrier depletion optical modulator. The linearity of optical modulators, particularly optical intensity modulators, is a limiting factor in the dynamic range of radio signals sent over optical links. For a typical electro-optic material, the nonlinearity of the device is determined by the optical transfer function of the device. Here, we present a modulator which uses a nonlinear change in refractive index to balance the nonlinearities in the optical transfer function in a way that forms a highly linear optical intensity modulator or optical phase modulator.","The invention offers the potential to significantly improve the linearity of radio over optical links. By having a highly linear modulator, higher dynamic range signals can be sent and detected optically. This is an enabling factor for, e.g., high-performance analog optical systems such as optical analog to digital converters. The invention has applications in various fields including telecommunications, data communications, and RF photonics.","Previous efforts to make electro-optic modulators more linear have relied on engineering of the junction optical transfer function. By contrast, our new approach demands only judicious engineering of the optical mode overlap with the p-n junction. Applications of our new approach can enable operation over a wider range of conditions with less susceptibility to fabrication imperfections.","An exemplary embodiment of our invention in one aspect is a method for operating an optical modulator of the kind that has a bias voltage and a bias phase as operational parameters. According to our method, an operating point is selected that consists of a bias voltage paired with a bias phase, wherein the selection is made from a parameter space of paired bias voltages and bias phases, and wherein the selection is more particularly made from a region of the parameter space that is designated a low-distortion region. The modulator is configured to operate at the selected operating point by setting a base value of the bias voltage and setting at least one other parameter independent of the bias voltage. Examples of such independent parameters are temperature and wavelength of the modulated optical beam.","An exemplary embodiment of our invention in a second aspect is an optical modulation apparatus. The apparatus includes at least one waveguiding path for an optical beam, one or more p-n junction regions traversed by the waveguiding path, and an electrode arrangement for applying bias voltage across one or more of the p-n junction regions. The apparatus further includes a control unit. The control unit is configured to select an operating point for the apparatus from a parameter space of paired bias voltages and bias phases, wherein the selection is made from a region of the parameter space that is designated a low-distortion region.","The magnitude of the electro-optic coefficient for crystals exhibiting the Pockels effect is determined by crystal structure. Because silicon has a centrosymmetric crystalline structure, it does not exhibit the Pockels effect.","However, the effective index of refraction (hereinafter, \u201cindex\u201d) of a silicon optical waveguide can alternatively be modulated by manipulating carrier concentrations by application of a bias voltage. In such an approach, the waveguide, or a portion of it, is made coextensive with at least a portion of a p-n junction. A reverse bias applied to the p-n junction creates a condition of carrier depletion that changes the index.","A further advantage of such an approach is that the magnitude of the effective index change as a function of the bias voltage for the silicon waveguide is not determined by crystal structure. Instead, it can be engineered by control of dopant densities, implant energies, and waveguide design.","According to perturbation theory, the change in effective index of a waveguide, \u0394n, due to the shift of a boundary by \u0394h is given by Eq. (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u0394","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["n","eff"]}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["n","g"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"},{"mo":"\u2146","mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u0394","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03b5","mn":"12"},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":"E","mo":"\uf605"}},"mn":"2"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"\u0394","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msubsup":{"mi":"\u03b5","mn":"12","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":"D","mo":"\u22a5"}},"mn":"2"}}],"mo":"+"}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","*","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u0394","h"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},{"mo":["\u2329","\u232a"],"mrow":{"mi":["E","E"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"\u03b5"}}}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"where |E> is the spatial distribution of the electric field of the optical mode, nis the group index of the waveguide mode, E is the value of the electric field parallel to the boundary taken at the boundary, \u0394\u2208is the difference in dielectric constant across the boundary, D is value of the electric displacement field normal to the boundary taken at the boundary, and \u0394h is the distance the boundary shifts.

As a consequence, a carrier-depletion Mach-Zehnder modulator can be designed in such a way that it is limited by fifth-order, and not by lower-order, intermodulation distortion.","In , we have provided an illustrative plot derived from numerical simulations of a device whose operation is based on a silicon p-n junction. In the figure, we have plotted the bias phase required to completely suppress the IMD3 distortion for each of a continuous range of reverse bias voltages.","It should be noted in this regard that in an optical modulator, the bias phase and the bias voltage can be independently controlled. For example, the bias phase in an MZM is the phase difference between the two optical paths corresponding to the two interferometer arms of the MZM. This phase difference may be controlled through, e.g., the thermo-optic effect, i.e. the thermal modulation of the refractive index, by employing a heater that changes the temperature of one arm relative to the other. In other examples, the bias phase may be controlled through chromatic dispersion by varying the wavelength of the modulated light. The bias voltage, on the other hand, is the voltage applied to the modulator p-n junction and as such is directly controllable.","In an exemplary implementation of the principles described here, a pair of values consisting of a bias voltage and a bias phase is selected, thus defining an operating point for a given modulator. To provide operation with low distortion, the operating point is selected from the points on or near a characteristic curve for the modulator that is similar to the curve of but of course particular to the given modulator.","In analog operation, for example, the selected value of the bias voltage provides a fixed dc offset value, and the bias voltage is oscillated about that dc value to modulate an input light beam. For phase modulation, this procedure may be performed in a single modulation element. For amplitude modulation, this procedure may be performed, e.g., in one or both interferometer arms of an MZI. For example, it may be performed using a pair of complementarily driven modulation elements situated in respective arms of the MZI.","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the selection of an operating point might involve a tradeoff between modulation depth and distortion rejection. That is, the optical power transfer function of, e.g., an MZI amplitude modulator has a shape that is, roughly speaking, proportional to a squared sinusoidal function of the bias phase. For purposes of illustration, we assume here that the transfer function is proportional to cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the bias phase. In that simplified example, the greatest variation in the amount of extinction obtainable by oscillating the bias voltage will be achieved when the dc offset corresponds to a bias phase of \u00b145\u00b0, \u00b1135\u00b0, etc., or in other words, \u00b10.785 radians, \u00b12.356 radians, etc.","It will be evident from the above example that the bias-phase setting that provides the greatest extinction ratio will not necessarily be optimal. That is, the bias voltage with which it is paired to define a low-distortion operating point might be non-optimal for extraneous reasons. Moreover, as will be better understood by reference to and the following discussion, the operating point defined by the bias-phase setting that provides the greatest extinction ratio will generally differ from the operating point that achieves the least possible distortion. Hence, it will generally be desirable to balance several factors in choosing the best operating point for a given application.","Turning now to , it will be seen that we have there provided a contour plot that, like , was derived from numerical simulations. Plotted in is the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the MZM of as a function of bias voltage and bias phase. (The plot of is superposed on the contour plot with a change in shape due to the differences in scale between the two figures.) The SFDR is defined relative to the fifth-order distortion. It will be seen on inspection of the figure that for a bias phase of about 2 radians with a reverse bias voltage of 1.2 V, a dynamic range of 140 dB\/Hzis theoretically achievable.","Analyses similar to that discussed above can be performed, with similar indications for the suppression of IMD3, for alternative types of silicon carrier depletion modulators, such as micro-disk and micro-ring resonator modulators. In such devices, for example, the waveguiding path that traverses one or more p-n junction regions is provided by the optical mode-confining structure of the resonator.","Accordingly, it should be understood that the invention is not limited in scope to Mach-Zehnder modulators, but rather encompasses silicon optical modulators of all designs that can be adapted for carrier-depletion operation. It should also be understood that although the illustrative Mach-Zehnder modulator described here includes a respective modulator element in each of the interferometer arms, alternative arrangements may omit the modulator element from one arm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","309","310","307"],"i":["Optical Interconnects Conference, ","IEEE "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","402","403","404","405","404","405","403"],"sub":"RF "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["501","502","503","504","505","506"]},"Signal generator  provides the signal that drives the time-varying component of the bias voltage and thereby modulates the optical beam.
