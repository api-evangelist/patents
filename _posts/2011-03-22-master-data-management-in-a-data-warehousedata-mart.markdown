title: Master data management in a data warehouse/data mart
abstract: A data warehouse incorporates processing for creating, managing, and otherwise maintaining master data. The data warehouse may communicate with a master data manager to obtain services for handling master data. A surrogate master data identifier may be defined by the data warehouse to reference the master data, thereby decoupling any modifications of the master data identifier that may be made by the master data manager. The data warehouse may export the master data to an application system, and conversely import master data from an application system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to data warehousing, and in particular, to the integration of master data management in a data warehouse.","Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Referring to , a data warehouse  typically comprises a database  containing data that is received from various operating groups in an organization; e.g., marketing, production, sales, customer service, and so on. Typical application systems that the operating groups execute include applications such as PLM (product lifecycle management) , CRM (customer relationship management) , PPS (product production system) , and so on. These applications typically generate the data (referred to as \u201ctransaction data\u201d) that is to be stored in the data warehouse . For example, transaction data may be information relating to the sale of widgets: where the sale occurred, when the sale took place, the sale price, and so on. Transaction data may be information about the production of widgets: how many where produced at a given manufacturing site, information about the raw materials used to make the widgets and so on. Typically, the transaction data generated by the application systems -are transformed by an ETL (extraction, transformation, load) process and then loaded into the data warehouse .","Data marts  are sets of data that can be customized and otherwise targeted for a given group or used within the organization; e.g., business planning for a new product, customer servicing, development of a new manufacturing process, and so on. Data marts  may comprise a subset of the data stored in the data warehouse database  and may or may not include transformation by the ETL process . Data marts  may comprise data collected from the various applications systems -and typically involves transformation by the ETL process ","Another aspect of an organization is its master data. Master data provides a single, unified view of data that may be generated and\/or referenced by the various operating groups and their respective application systems -. Referring to , an MDM system  typically communicates with the other operational systems, for example, via an ETL layer or by way of API (application programming interface) calls executed by their software applications -. The management of such data, referred to as master data management (MDM) is a strategy\/process for creating, managing and maintaining such data. An MDM strategy typically includes components like universal agreement on data definitions, data governance policies to guide the collection and management of data, enforcement of these standards, and technology to reconcile and standardize data from the various operative applications systems of the organization.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a data warehouse integrated with management of master data. In an embodiment, a computer system performs steps of operating as a data warehouse, including receiving transaction data and master data from the application systems of an organization. In embodiments, the data warehouse may create master data. The master data may be assigned information based on information contained in transaction data received from different application systems. The master data may include information based on a business plan. The master data may include one or more master data identifiers.","In embodiments, the master data may be communicated to one of the application systems. Conversely, master data may be imported from an application system.","In embodiments, the master data is initially accessible only to the user who created it. The master data may be designated as being accessible by a group of users. The master data may be designated as being accessible to all members in an organization. The master data may be published to members outside of the organization. More generally, the master data may be subject to a lifecycle that assigns different levels of accessibility at different points in time.","The data warehouse may receive updated master data from the master data management process wherein the first master data identifier is modified. In embodiments, the data warehouse references the master data using the second master data identifier.","The following detailed description and accompanying drawings provide a better understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention.","Described herein are techniques for operating a data warehouse. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein.","In embodiments, such as exemplified in , a data warehouse or data mart  in an organization may receive transaction data  from various operations groups. Going forward, the term \u201cdata warehouse\u201d will be understood to refer to both a data warehouse or to a data mart. Transaction data may be generated by applications software systems (\u201coperations application system\u201d, \u201capplication system\u201d) that are used by the operations groups. Typical application systems  include PLM (product lifecycle management), CRM (customer relationship management), PPS (product production system), and ERP (enterprise resource planning). Each application system  may generate transaction data  which is loaded and stored in the data warehouse . For example, the data warehouse  may define a database for each application system that it receives transaction data  from. Transaction data  received from an application system  may be stored as records in the corresponding database in the data warehouse . The figure shows the various data elements that comprise the transaction data  with the reference numeral . The data elements  may refer to individual pieces of data (e.g., \u201cMr. Miller\u201d), or structures of data (e.g., an Address data structure that comprises various fields such as street, city, country, etc.). The data warehouse  stores each transaction and over time accumulates a history of transactions that have occurred among the various operations groups. The accumulated historical data may be stored (e.g., as key figures) separate from the context that the values are associated with (e.g., customer, time, product). The contextual information itself may be treated as master data.","The data warehouse  may include one or more business plans  that users of the data warehouse may create, define, and refine. A business plan  may be developed from an analysis of the transaction data  stored in the data warehouse . For example, CRM transaction data over a one year period may indicate an opportunity to introduce a new product. A business plan might be created and developed to take advantage of such an opportunity.","In embodiments, the data warehouse  may further include one or more master data . Master data  provide a single, unified reference for the transaction data that may be generated by the various application systems . Each instance of master data , comprises a surrogate identifier (SID), a master data identifier (ID), and one or more attributes. Attributes of the master data  may comprise information specified in a business plan  (e.g., T-shirt size, color) or from data  comprising transaction data . Attributes of the master data  may be derived from information in a business plan  or from data  comprising transaction data . Attributes of the master data  may also comprise information from transaction data  received from different application systems. For example, this aspect of the present invention is illustrated in , where the attributes for master data comprise information from transaction data that is received, say, from a first application system and transaction data that is received, say, from a second application system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["124","106","102","104","106","102","104","106","104","106"]},"The MDM process  typically provides the highest view of all the data of the organization. The MDM process  may contain a set of master data  that reflect that organization level view. Each piece of master data may include a consolidated key (ID) as well as a consolidated set of associated attributes. The MDM process  employs compliance rules and other governing rules to enforce adherence to standards established for representing the myriads pieces of data of the organization. One of the functions of the MDM process  is to ensure consistency between the master data created in application systems  with the master data maintained in the MDM process. In accordance with aspect of the present invention, the functionality of the MDM process  is provided to the data warehouse  to allow the data warehouse to create, develop, maintain, and otherwise manage master data.","Referring to , in embodiments, a computer system  can be configured to operate in accordance with aspects of the present invention. For example, computer system  may be configured as the data warehouse , or an application system , or the MDM process  illustrated in . A data processor subsystem  may comprise one or more data processing units. A memory subsystem  may comprise random access memory (usually volatile memory such as DRAM) and non-volatile memory such as FLASH memory, ROM, and so on. A storage subsystem  may comprise one or more mass storage devices such as hard disk drives and the like. The storage subsystem  may include remote storage systems; e.g., for data mirroring, remote backup and such. The storage subsystem  can provide the data storage for the databases that might be deployed in the data warehouse , the application systems , or the MDM process .","A network interface subsystem  can provide communication between the data warehouse , the application systems , and the MDM process , for example over a telecommunication network. A system of buses  can interconnect the foregoing subsystems, providing control lines, data lines, and\/or voltage supply lines to\/from the various subsystems. The computer system  may include a suitable display(s)  and input devices  such as a keyboard and a mouse input device.","The memory subsystem  may have stored in the non-volatile memory computer executable programs, which when executed can cause the data processing subsystem  to perform various processing steps in accordance with aspects of the present invention.","In embodiments, processing in the data warehouse  may proceed as shown in . First, a discussion of conventional master data processing in an application system  will be given, followed by a discussion of master data processing in the data warehouse  in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.","In an application system , master data processing may begin at step  with the creation of new master data. This may include making remote service calls to the MDM process  to ensure that compliance rules for the new master data are met; for example, identify what are the mandatory fields of the new master data. The master data may include a master data identifier (ID) that is defined by the application system . The master data is deemed to \u201cexist\u201d at this point. In a step , the new master data may be assigned with information from transaction data generated by the application software; this does not change the \u2018existence\u2019 of the master data. The master data can cycle back to step  for the assignment of information from new transaction data generated by the application system . Alternatively, in a step , the master data can be maintained in terms of its constituent attributes; for example, information in the master data (e.g., the color of a T-shirt or its size) might have changed and so the master data may need to be updated to reflect the changed information.","The master data may remain \u201clocal\u201d to the application system  that created it and be accessible only by members of the operating group corresponding to that application system. When it is determined that the master data is ready to be used by entities outside of the application system , then in a step  the master data can be designated \u201cglobal\u201d. For example, the master data may relate to a new product which is now ready to be manufactured. The master data may be published to the various manufacturing groups in the organization. As another example, the master data may relate to a proposal for collaboration with a business which is now ready for presentation to that business. Again the \u201cglobal\u201d use of the master data does not change its \u2018existence\u2019 locally in system .","In step , the master data can be communicated to the MDM process . This may involve various transformations  (e.g., performed by an ETL process) to facilitate the communication of data to the MDM process .","In a step , compliance rules in the MDM process may be applied to the master data created by the application system  to ensure that the master data conforms to the rules set forth in the MDM process . The MDM process  may enhance, adapt, or otherwise modify the master data in accordance with those compliance rules. For example, suppose the master data identifier (ID) assigned by the application system  was a simple running counter that increments from 1 to N. While this ID numbering convention may be suitable for the application system , it may not be suitable at the organization level. The MDM process  may need to map the ID to an organization-level ID (e.g., to comply with the organization's naming standards). Other compliance rules may ensure that all customer names are formatted in consistent manner, identify semantic duplicates in the landscape, and so on. The result may be a revised master data that is compliant with the compliance rules set forth in the MDM process .","In a step , the master data in the MDM process  can be synchronized with the corresponding master data in the application system . This can be used to update the copy of master data in the application system  if the master data was modified by the MDM process  as a result of applying the compliance rules. Thus, in a step , the application system  may import the master data received from the MDM process . The received master data may then be used to update the copy maintained by the application system . Where the MDM process  has changed the ID of the master data, then the application system  can change the ID as well as references to it. In embodiments, a mapping can be used to keep track of the ID used in the application system  and the ID used in the MDM process .","The discussion will now proceed to processing in the data warehouse  in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The discussion begins with a user accessing the data warehouse  to create a new plan . A typical usage scenario might be that an analysis of financial transaction data collected from the application systems  of the organization's operating groups might indicate opportunities for new business. Consequently, a plan  might be developed to introduce a product to exploit such opportunities.","Another usage scenario might arise in connection with the process of new product data introduction. Typically, the process focuses on information provided by a PLM system and a PPS system. However, financial applications may also trigger new product development efforts; e.g., when simulating better or new market penetration, a new product might be relevant. This could be readily accomplished within the data warehouse , where the financial impact can be readily simulated. If the product showed sufficient potential for the organization's future, then it could be introduced to the PLM and PPS systems for subsequent design and manufacture.","A similar usage scenario can be imagined for customer groups. For marketing reasons, it might be relevant to extend the penetration of a product into new customer groups. Such activity can be simulated (e.g., with respect to financial impact) within the data warehouse  before involving other systems such as CRM. If the simulation shows promise, then the plan to penetrate other customer groups can be taken to the subsequent CRM system for implementation; e.g., develop campaigns and so on.","In the above scenarios, the creation of master data within the data warehouse  facilitates such planning activities because forecasts and simulations can be readily compared with actual transaction data collected by the data warehouse from the various application systems . As an initial step then, the user may log onto the data warehouse  via a suitable user interface. The user may access a previously stored plan, or the user may request the creation of a new plan. In a step , a new piece of master data may be created in the data warehouse  in connection with a business plan. Creating the master data may include making remote service calls to the MDM process  to ensure that compliance rules for the new master data are met. For example, the data warehouse  may communicate information to the MDM process  about the attributes and data formats comprising the master data. The MDM process  may return with information that a particular field is mandatory, or that a particular attribute requires a specific data format, and so on. Since MDM processing and communications are known in connection with communication between application systems  and the MDM process , the specific details of such communications with the data warehouse  need not be further elaborated on.","The master data may include a master data identifier (ID) that is defined by the user or MDM process . In a step , a surrogate ID may be defined by the data warehouse  and associated with the master data. The master data created in the data warehouse  is deemed to \u201cexist\u201d at this point.","In a step , one or more key figures (i.e., facts such as sales figures, production quantities and so on) may be assigned to the master data based on information comprising the business plan (e.g., expected revenue figures from a sales projection plan, or expected materials cost from a parts requirement projection plan, and so on). The master data may cycle back to step  for the assignment of additional key figures for the plan. This does not change the \u2018existence\u2019 of the master data.","In a step , attributes in the master data may be maintained. For example, changes in existing attributes (e.g., T-shirt size, color) may need to be made in the master data based on information comprising the business plan. MDM services may be called to ensure that the attribute settings comply to the rules defined in the MDM. (remark: an arrow needs to be added in . From  to ). The master data may cycle back to steps  and  for one or more iterations in order to revise, update, and otherwise maintain the master data.","In embodiments, the master data may be initially designated to be \u201cuser local.\u201d This designation means that the master data is accessible only to the user who created it. The data warehouse  can restrict access to master data that is designated \u201cuser local\u201d to only the creator. This restricted access gives the user\/creator time to develop and modify the master data and assigned key figures for the plan without fear of anyone inadvertently using it before it is ready to be used or examined. The master data may be discarded in case the simulation does not provide the desired results or for any other reason, including the invalidation of the key figures referring to it.","In embodiments, the data warehouse  may allow the master data to be accessible to a wider group of users. For example, a user in a marketing group who created a new master data may be ready to present that master data to the other members of the marketing group for peer review and further development. Thus, in a step , the master data may be designated \u201csystem local.\u201d The data warehouse  may grant access to master data that is designated \u201csystem local\u201d to only those users who are members of a designated group. Typically, the creator of the master data will also be a member of the designated group. However, in an embodiment the designated group may be a group that the creator is not a member of. In an embodiment, the \u201csystem local\u201d designation may include two or more groups. When master data is designated as \u201csystem local\u201d, members of the designated group(s) can collaborate to further refine the master data or assigne key figures to it. The master data may be cycled back to step  for further refinement with the business plan and\/or to step  for further updates with attributes. The master data may be discarded in case the simulation does not provide the desired results or for any other reason, including the invalidation of the key figures referring to it.","In embodiments, the master data may be designated \u201cglobal\u201d; e.g., the master data may be published (step ) to entities outside of the data warehouse . Publishing the master data may involve application of the compliance rules (step ) by the MDM process . The compliance rules can ensure that the master data conforms to the rules that govern all the master data of the organization. The MDM process  may modify the master data. The result of step  may be modified master data that conforms with the compliance rules. In a step , the master data may be redistributed back to the data warehouse , where in a step  the received master data can be imported back into the data warehouse. The received master data may then be used to update the copy maintained by the data warehouse , thus synchronizing the master data between the data warehouse and the MDM process .","In embodiments, the data warehouse  can use the surrogate identifier (SID) of the master data to keep track of the master data instead of using the master data identifier (ID). Thus, if the MDM process  had modified the master data identifier (ID) as a result of applying its compliance rules (e.g., to comply with the organization's naming standards), then data warehouse  can still identify the master data even thought the master data identifier had been modified.","In embodiments, master data created in the application system  can be exported to the data warehouse  by way of the synchronization step  in the MDM process . Thus, for example, if the application system  creates master data and it was desired that the master data should be exported to the data warehouse , then the application system can publish the master data with a suitable indication (e.g. a status of the master data indicating that transactional data relevant for the data warehouse  may be created) to the MDM process . The MDM process  can then apply the compliance rules to ensure compliance with the governing rules of the organization's master data policies, possibly modifying the master data. Then, in the synchronization step , the master data can be synchronized to the data warehouse , where the master data could be imported into the data warehouse in step .","It can be appreciated of course that master data created in the data warehouse  can be exported to an application system  in a similar manner. For example, master data created and refined in the data warehouse  can be published at step  with a suitable indication (e.g. a status indicating that the master data needs to be enriched by engineering data in a PLM system) to the MDM process . The MDM process  can then apply the compliance rules to ensure compliance with the governing rules of the organization's master data policies, possibly modifying the master data. Then, in the synchronization step , the master data can be synchronized to the appropriate application system , where the master data would be imported into the application system in step .","The above description illustrates various embodiments of the present invention along with examples of how aspects of the present invention may be implemented. The above examples and embodiments should not be deemed to be the only embodiments, and are presented to illustrate the flexibility and advantages of the present invention as defined by the following claims. Based on the above disclosure and the following claims, other arrangements, embodiments, implementations and equivalents will be evident to those skilled in the art and may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
