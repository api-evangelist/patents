title: Interacting with a subscriber to a social networking service based on passive behavior of the subscriber
abstract: In an embodiment, an application server is configured to manage privacy settings of a subscriber for one or more social networking services. The application server determines a set of privacy settings (e.g., a manually configured or default set of privacy settings) of the subscriber for the one or more social networking services, and then receives, from the subscriber, permission to dynamically modify the set of privacy settings. The application server monitors, responsive to the received permission, passive behavior of the subscriber that is separate from interactions between the subscriber and the one or more social networking services (e.g., calls, text messages, instant messages made to/from the subscriber, a location of the subscriber, etc.). The application server triggers a modification to the set of privacy settings based on the monitored passive behavior of the subscriber.

Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to interacting with a subscriber to a social networking service based on passive behavior of the subscriber.","2. Description of the Related Art","Due to the complex nature of social relationships and the uniqueness of people, it is very difficult to predict the preferences of subscribers to social networking services. Accordingly, conventional social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc.) typically rely upon subscribers to input information associated with their social interests and desired privacy settings.","This can be relatively burdensome for the subscriber because, after registering to a particular social networking service, the subscriber must either accept default settings that are not customized to the subscriber, or else must enter his\/her privacy settings and social interests (e.g., friends, hobbies, blogs of interest, etc.) before the social networking service can be used or accessed by the subscriber.","Also, managing privacy settings for a social networking service can be confusing for subscribers. For example, while the privacy policies of social networking services are often clarified either in an account-settings section of the service, subscribers are often surprised when their social networking services make certain information public to other individuals (e.g., friends, family, strangers, etc.) or entities (e.g., advertisers, etc.).","In an embodiment, an application server is configured to manage privacy settings of a subscriber for one or more social networking services. The application server determines a set of privacy settings (e.g., a manually configured or default set of privacy settings) of the subscriber for the one or more social networking services, and then receives, from the subscriber, permission to dynamically modify the set of privacy settings. The application server monitors, responsive to the received permission, passive behavior of the subscriber that is separate from interactions between the subscriber and the one or more social networking services (e.g., calls, text messages, instant messages made to\/from the subscriber, a location of the subscriber, etc.). The application server triggers a modification to the set of privacy settings based on the monitored passive behavior of the subscriber.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A10 connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA10 connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA10 connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","1","120","1","3","120","162","160","165","162","188","175","170","180","2","5","120","164","160","165","162","164","188","175","170","180","4","175","175"]},"Referring to , ATs ,  and  . . .

However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system  can connect to any type of AT, and the examples illustrated in  are not intended to limit the types of ATs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the application server  and the social networking server  are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2C"],"b":["170","170","200","205","210","215","220","225","230"]},"Referring to , the protocol and security management module C is responsible for enforcing privacy settings for one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers .","Referring to , the notification and alerts module C is responsible for sending notification or alerts to the one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers .","Referring to , the friend-score and mining module C is determining scores or rankings associated with \u2018friends\u2019 or social contacts (e.g., family members, friends, business contacts, neighbors, etc.) of the one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers .","Referring to , the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C is responsible for tracking information associated with the one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers .","Referring to , the events and tasks scheduler module C is responsible for determining information associated with tasks or events that are scheduled for participation by the one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers .","Referring to , the relationship management module C is responsible for determining information associated with relationships of the one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers . The relationships monitored by the relationship management module C can include relationship to other individuals or social contacts (e.g., friends, family, neighbors, business contacts, etc.) and\/or to groups (e.g., the Democrat or Republican party, a Homeowner's Association, etc.).","Referring to , the places management module C is responsible for tracking locations that are associated with the one or more subscribers to social networking services associated with the social networking servers . For example, the places management module C can track locations in terms of geographic coordinates and\/or addresses, or alternatively can attempt to log landmark-type information. For example, the places management module C can determine that a particular subscriber has traveled to 3401 34Street, Washington D.C., and can then further determine that this address corresponds to a residential address associated with a particular social contact, or alternatively that this address corresponds to a commercial address associated with a particular service (e.g., a McDonalds restaurant, a Starbucks coffee shop, etc.).","As will be appreciated, the modules C through C of the application server  can interact with each other to achieve their respective functionality. The following description represents a few examples of interaction between the modules C through C. In example, the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C may receive information that the places management module C uses to determine locations visited by the subscriber. One of these locations may correspond to a social contact of the subscriber, resulting in the friend score and mining module C increasing the social proximity ranking for that social contact. Also, if the events and tasks scheduler module C is aware of an upcoming event to be attended by the subscriber that is far away from the subscriber's current location, the events and tasks scheduler module C can request that the notification and alerts module C send a reminder to the subscriber related to the upcoming event. Further, if the location of the subscriber corresponds to a commercial entity, such as a plumbing service, the relationship management module C may automatically add the contact information (e.g., business address, phone number, date and time visited, etc.) into the subscriber's address book and\/or contact list.","In another example, assume that the events and tasks scheduler module C determines the subscriber's current location corresponds to a meeting-place. In this case, the events and tasks scheduler module C can request that the protocol and security management module C temporarily augment the privacy settings of the subscriber such that more information can be shared between the subscriber and other subscribers at the same meeting. Thus, if the subscriber is lecturing at the meeting via PowerPoint slides, the subscriber can more easily share the PowerPoint slides (and\/or other supplement lecture information) to the participants at the meeting.","The above-examples of the interaction between the modules of the application server  will be described in more detail below.","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (API)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","To provide context for embodiments of the invention, several conventional social networking access procedures will be described with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["180","400","180","180"]},"In A, the subscriber, via the AT, configures privacy settings of the social networking service. For example, if the access in A corresponds to an initial registration of the subscriber to the social networking service, the configuring of A can include the subscriber manually indicating his\/her desired privacy settings via some type of menu screen. In another example, if the access in A corresponds to an initial registration of the subscriber to the social networking service, the configuring of A can include the subscriber accepting default privacy settings established by the social networking service. In another example, if the access in A does not correspond to an initial registration of the subscriber to the social networking service, the configuration of A can be automatic in the sense that previously established privacy settings are loaded by the social networking server  for the subscriber.","After establishing the privacy settings for the subscriber in A, the subscriber, via the AT, and the social networking server  interact with each other based on the established privacy settings, A. For example, if the privacy settings specify that one or more other subscribers are friends, the interaction can include sharing information associated with the one or more other subscribers (if permitted to do so by the one or more other subscribers' own privacy settings). In another example, if the privacy settings specify that one or more other subscribers are blocked, the social networking server  can ensure that the blocked subscribers receive no information directly related to the subscriber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["180","400","180","180"]},"In B, assume that the subscriber determines to search for content by the social networking service. Accordingly, the subscriber manually enters search criteria into the AT, and the AT sends the manually entered search criteria to the social networking server  in B. In an example, the manually entered search criteria may be the name of a social contact and\/or any other type of input that can be used by the social networking server  to conduct a search.","The social networking server  receives the manually entered search criteria from the AT and performs a content search based on the manually entered search criteria, B. For example, if the manually entered search criteria correspond to the name of a social contact, the social networking server  can search a social networking database to retrieve information associated with the social contact identified by the manually entered search criteria.

The social networking server  then sends any remaining search results to the AT for presentation to the subscriber, C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4D","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D"],"b":"180"},"Accordingly, in D, the social networking server  further determines recommended content for the subscriber based on the manually entered search criteria from B of  or C of  and\/or the search results from B of  or C of . For example, if the manually entered search criteria are for a type of product or service, the recommended content may be related to the particular product or service in some manner. For example, if the particular service is plumbing, the recommended content may correspond to local plumbers in proximity to the subscriber (i.e., targeted advertising). In another example, if the manually entered search criteria includes a social contact that is associated with a given fraternity or sorority, the recommended content may be a notification of other social contacts in the same given fraternity or sorority. After determining the recommended content for the subscriber in D, the social networking server  sends the recommended content to the AT for presentation to the subscriber, D.","As will be appreciated from the description of , conventional social networking services rely upon explicit or implicit requests from subscribers to implement privacy settings and\/or provision and share content between subscribers. Embodiments of the invention are directed to mechanisms for predicting a subscriber's preferences regarding privacy settings and\/or content sharing and provisioning based at least in part upon passive behavior of the subscriber. Thus, instead of relying upon some type of request by the subscriber to perform an action, the social networking service in accordance with an embodiment of the invention will attempt to infer that the action would be desired by the subscriber and then perform the action in advance of any such request (implicit or explicit).","In , the subscriber is described as directly interacting with the social networking server  to establish his\/her privacy settings and to obtain requested and\/or recommended content. In , the subscriber is described as interacting, through an AT, with the application server . While the application server  can be implemented within the social networking server  (e.g., one or more servers supporting Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc.) in one embodiment, it is also possible that the application server  can be a separate entity that is configured to manage the privacy settings and content settings of the subscriber across one (or more) of the social networking services. In the description of , the application server  may be configured as illustrated and described above with respect to , such that the application server  includes the modules C through C. However, it will be appreciated that this is merely representative of one example implementation of the application server , which can include different modular configurations in other embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":"180"},"Referring to , in A, a subscriber performs an initial registration to a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc.) that is supported by the social networking server  via an AT (e.g., a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile phone, etc.). For example, the subscriber can register to the social networking service via a website hosted by the social networking server , or alternatively via a mobile application that is configured to support a mobile version of the social networking service.","In A, the subscriber, via the AT, configures privacy settings of the social networking service. Depending on the implementation of the application server  and the social networking server , the configuration of A can involve communications between the AT and the application server , the social networking server , or both. For example, if the application server  is embedded within the social networking server , then the interaction associated with the configuration of A corresponds to an interaction between both the application server  and the social networking server .","In another example, the application server  can be separate from the social networking server  and can be used as a proxy for establishing the privacy settings of the social networking service supported by the social networking server . In this example, the subscriber, via the AT, can input his\/her desired privacy settings to the application server , which can then instruct the social networking server  with regard to the subscriber's privacy settings.","In yet another example, the application server  can be separate from the social networking server  and the configuration of A can occur between the AT and the social networking server , after which the social networking server  can notify the application server  with regard to the initial configuration of privacy settings for the subscriber.","As noted above with respect to , the establishment of the initial privacy settings upon registration of the subscriber to the social networking service can correspond to (i) an acceptance by the subscriber of default privacy settings for the social networking service, or (ii) a manual configuration of privacy settings customized to the preferences of the subscriber.","Irrespective of how the privacy settings are configured in A, after the application server  determines the privacy settings to be implemented for the subscriber in conjunction with the social networking service, the application server  updates one or more of modules C through C in A. For example, the protocol and security management module C can store the configured privacy settings for the subscriber in association with the social networking service, the places management module C can store a location of the subscriber at the time of the registration (if available), and so on.","In A, as in A of , the social networking server  begins interacting with the subscriber's AT based on the initial configuration of the privacy settings from A. Next, the subscriber determines whether to permit the application server  to dynamically adapt or update the subscriber's privacy settings for the social networking service, A. If the subscriber determines not to permit the application server  to dynamically adapt or update the subscriber's privacy settings for the social networking service in A, the process advances to A of  whereby the social networking server  and the subscriber's AT interact based on the configured privacy settings from A. Otherwise, if the subscriber determines to permit the application server  to dynamically adapt or update the subscriber's privacy settings for the social networking service in A, the AT notifies the application server  of the dynamic-update permission, A.","Referring to , the application server  begins to monitor the subscriber's passive behavior, A.

The subscriber's passive behavior that is monitored by the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C can include locations to which the subscriber has visited (e.g., via GPS tracking or some other type of location tracking) or is intending to visit (e.g., via a destination address input into a navigation application). In another example, the subscriber's passive behavior that is monitored by the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C can include websites that the subscriber has accessed via the AT.

As will be appreciated, the types of passive subscriber behavior that can be monitored in A can include any type of subscriber behavior that is associated with the AT.","The application server  evaluates the monitored passive behavior of the subscriber to determine whether to dynamically adjust or update the current configuration of privacy settings for the subscriber, A. For example, the protocol and security management module C can evaluate the passive behavior that is monitored and logged by the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C to perform the determination of A. As an example, assume that the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C detects that the subscriber is in a scheduled business meeting with one or more other subscribers (e.g., this can be based on coordination between the passive subscriber behavior monitoring module C and the places management module C and events and tasks scheduler module C). In this case, the protocol and security management module C can determine to temporarily (e.g., for the duration of the meeting) augment the privacy permissions of the one or more other subscribers (or vice versa) to permit the meeting participants to more easily exchange information that may assist the meeting, such as presentation slides for example.","Accordingly, if the application server  determines not to adjust the privacy settings in A, the process returns to A and the application server  continues to monitor the subscriber's passive behavior. Otherwise, if the application server  determines to adjust the privacy settings in A, the application server  adjusts the privacy settings for the subscriber in A. The application server  can also, if necessary, notify the social networking server  with regard to the privacy settings adjustment in A.
