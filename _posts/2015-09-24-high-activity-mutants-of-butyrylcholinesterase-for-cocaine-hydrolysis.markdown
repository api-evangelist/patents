The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to butyrylcholinesterase variant polypeptides, and in particular, butyrylcholinesterase mutants having amino acid substitutions.","Cocaine abuse is a major medical and public health problem that continues to defy treatment. The disastrous medical and social consequences of cocaine addiction, such as violent crime, loss in individual productivity, illness, and death, have made the development of an effective pharmacological treatment a high priority. However, cocaine mediates its reinforcing and toxic effects by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake and the classical pharmacodynamic approach has failed to yield small-molecule receptor antagonists due to the difficulties inherent in blocking a blocker. An alternative to receptor-based approaches is to interfere with the delivery of cocaine to its receptors and accelerate its metabolism in the body.","The dominant pathway for cocaine metabolism in primates is butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-catalyzed hydrolysis at the benzoyl ester group (Scheme 1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"201.51mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09415092-20160816-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Only 5% of the cocaine is deactivated through oxidation by the liver microsomal cytochrome P450 system. Cocaine hydrolysis at benzoyl ester group yields ecgonine methyl ester, whereas the oxidation produces norcocaine. The metabolite ecgonine methyl ester is a biologically inactive metabolite, whereas the metabolite norcocaine is hepatotoxic and a local anesthetic. BChE is synthesized in the liver and widely distributed in the body, including plasma, brain, and lung. Extensive experimental studies in animals and humans demonstrate that enhancement of BChE activity by administration of exogenous enzyme substantially decreases cocaine half-life.","Enhancement of cocaine metabolism by administration of BChE has been recognized to be a promising pharmacokinetic approach for treatment of cocaine abuse and dependence. However, the catalytic activity of this plasma enzyme is three orders-of-magnitude lower against the naturally occurring (\u2212)-cocaine than that against the biologically inactive (+)-cocaine enantiomer. (+)-cocaine can be cleared from plasma in seconds and prior to partitioning into the central nervous system (CNS), whereas (\u2212)-cocaine has a plasma half-life of approximately 45-90 minutes (for a relatively low dose of cocaine), long enough for manifestation of the CNS effects which peak in minutes. Under the overdose condition, BChE is saturated with (\u2212)-cocaine and, thus, the plasma half-life of (\u2212)-cocaine will be longer. Hence, BChE mutants with high activity against (\u2212)-cocaine are highly desired for use in humans. Although some BChE mutants with increased catalytic activity over wild-type BChE have previously been generated, there exists a need for mutant BChE with even higher catalytic activity.","The presently-disclosed subject matter meets some or all of the above-identified needs, as will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of information provided in this document.","This Summary describes several embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments.

analogs, regardless of its size or function. Although \u201cprotein\u201d is often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides, and \u201cpeptide\u201d is often used in reference to small polypeptides, usage of these terms in the art overlaps and varies. The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d as used herein refers to peptides, polypeptides, and proteins, unless otherwise noted. The terms \u201cprotein\u201d, \u201cpolypeptide\u201d, and \u201cpeptide\u201d are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product. Thus, exemplary polypeptides include gene products, naturally occurring proteins, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants, and analogs of the foregoing.","The term \u201cvariant\u201d refers to an amino acid sequence that is different from the reference polypeptide by one or more amino acids, e.g., one or more amino acid substitutions. For example a butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) polypeptide variant differs from wild-type BChE by one or more amino acid substitutions, i.e., mutations.","The terms \u201cpolypeptide fragment\u201d or \u201cfragment\u201d, when used in reference to a reference polypeptide, refers to a polypeptide in which amino acid residues are deleted as compared to the reference polypeptide itself, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is usually identical corresponding positions in the reference polypeptide. Such deletions can occur at the amino-terminus, carboxy-terminus of the reference polypeptide, or alternatively both. A fragment can also be a \u201cfunctional fragment,\u201d in which case the fragment retains some or all of the activity of the reference polypeptide as described herein. For example, a functional fragment of a particular BChE polypeptide variant retains some or all of the cocaine hydrolysis activity. i.e., the catalytic efficiency for (\u2212)-cocaine, of the particular BChE polypeptide variant. In this regard, the term \u201cBChE polypeptide variant\u201d is inclusive of functional fragments of the BChE polypeptide variant. Such fragments are typically are at least about 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500, 525, or 550 amino acids long. One or more residues from about 1 to 67 and\/or one or more residues from about 443 to 574 can be removed without substantially affecting the catalytic activity of the BChE polypeptide variant. As such, the term \u201cBChE polypeptide variant\u201d is inclusive of functional fragments wherein one or more residues from 1 to 67 and\/or one or more residues from 443 to 574 is truncated relative to the full-length BChE polypeptide variant.","The BChE polypeptide variant (e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 32) can be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition along with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier known to one skilled in the art.","The present BChE variant polypeptides can be used in treating a cocaine-induced condition by administering to an individual, an effective amount of a BChE variant polypeptides, (e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 32), to lower blood cocaine concentration. The BChE polypeptide variant can be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the BChE polypeptide variant is included with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Treatment of a cocaine-induced condition using one of the aforementioned BChE polypeptide variants can be in a manner that will be understood by those skilled in the art.","The preferred dose for administration of a BChE polypeptide variant or pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the presently-described subject matter is that amount which will be effective in lowering (\u2212)-cocaine concentration in a patient's bloodstream, and one would readily recognize that this amount will vary greatly depending on the nature of cocaine consumed, e.g., injected or inhaled, and the condition of a patient. An \u201ceffective amount\u201d of butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide variant or pharmaceutical composition to be used in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter is intended to mean a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the agent, such that the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect is produced. Thus, the exact amount of the enzyme or a particular agent that is required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, the particular carrier or adjuvant being used and its mode of administration, and the like. Similarly, the dosing regimen should also be adjusted to suit the individual to whom the composition is administered and will once again vary with age, weight, metabolism, etc. of the individual. Accordingly, the \u201ceffective amount\u201d of any particular butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide variant, or pharmaceutical composition thereof, will vary based on the particular circumstances, and an appropriate effective amount may be determined in each case of application by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.","The presently-disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples. The following examples may include compilations of data that are representative of data gathered at various times during the course of development and experimentation related to the presently-disclosed subject matter.","Embodiments of the BChE polypeptide variants of the presently-disclosed subject matter were made and studied using the following experimental procedure.","Site-directed mutagenesis of human BChE cDNA was performed by the QuikChange method of Braman, J.; Papworth, C.; Greener, A. 1996, 57, 5731, incorporated herein by this reference.

R.; Lockridge, O. 1999, 55, 83, each of which is incorporated herein by this reference. The expression plasmid pRc\/CMV was kindly provided by Dr. O. Lockridge, University of Nebraska Medical Center (Omaha, Nebr.).","Using plasmid DNA as template and primers with specific base-pair alterations, mutations were made by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu DNA polymerase, for replication fidelity.

Modified plasmid DNA was transformed into amplified, and purified. The DNA sequences of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The QIAprep Spin Plasmid Miniprep Kit and Qiagen plasmid purification kit and QIAquick PCR purification kit were obtained from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, Calif.).","BChE mutants were expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293T\/17. Cells were grown to 80-90% confluence in 6-well dishes and then transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 complexes of 4 \u03bcg plasmid DNA per each well. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a COincubator for 24 hours and cells were moved to 60-mm culture vessel and cultured for four more days. The culture medium [10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)] was harvested for a BChE activity assay.","Human embryonic kidney 293T\/17 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, Va.). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, N.J.). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the Integrated DNA Technologies and Analysis Facility of the University of Kentucky. 3, 3\u2032, 5, 5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, Mo.). Anti-butyrylcholinesterase (mouse monoclonal antibody, Product #HAH002-01) was purchased from AntibodyShop (Gentofte, Denmark) and Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate from Zymed (San Francisco, Calif.).","To measure cocaine and benzoic acid, the product of cocaine hydrolysis by BChE, sensitive radiometric assays based on toluene extraction of [H]-(\u2212)-cocaine labeled on its benzene ring were used in accordance with Zheng, F.; Yang, W.; Ko, M.-C.; Lin, J.; Cho, H.; Gao, D.; Tong, M.; Tai, H.-H.; Woods, J. H.; Zhan, C.-G. \u201cMost Efficient Cocaine Hydrolase Designed by Virtual Screening of Transition States\u201d, 2008, 130, 12148-12155, which is incorporated herein by this reference. H-(\u2212)-cocaine (50 Ci\/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, Mass.).","In brief, to initiate reactions, 100 nCi of [H]-(\u2212)-cocaine was mixed with 100 \u03bcl of culture medium. Reactions proceeded at room temperature (25\u00b0 C.) with varying concentrations of (\u2212)-cocaine. Reactions were stopped by adding 300 \u03bcl of 0.02 M HCl, which neutralized the liberated benzoic acid while ensuring a positive charge on the residual cocaine. [H]benzoic acid was extracted by 1 ml of toluene and measured by scintillation counting. Finally, the measured (\u2212)-cocaine concentration-dependent radiometric data were analyzed by using the standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics so that the catalytic efficiency (k\/K) was determined, along with the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) described in b Zheng, F.; Yang, W.; Ko, M.-C.; Liu, J.; Cho, H.; Gao, D.; Tong, M.; Tai, H.-H.; Woods, J.

The ELISA buffers used were the same as those described in the literature such as Brock, A.; Mortensen, V.; Loft, A. G. R.; Nergaard-Pedersen, B. 1990, 28, 221-224; and Khattab, A. D.; Walker, C. H.; Johnston, G.; Siddiqui, M. K. Saphier, P. W. 1994, 13, 1661-1667, both of which are incorporated herein by this reference. The coating buffer was 0.1 M sodium carbonate\/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5. The diluent buffer (EIA buffer) was potassium phosphate monobasic\/potassium phosphate monohydrate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.9% sodium chloride and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The washing buffer (PBS-T) was 0.01 M potassium phosphate monobasic\/potassium phosphate monohydrate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% (v\/v) Tween-20. All the assays were performed in triplicate. Each well of an ELISA microliter plate was filled with 100 \u03bcl of the mixture buffer consisting of 20 \u03bcl culture medium and 80 \u03bcl coating buffer. The plate was covered and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. to allow the antigen to bind to the plate. The solutions were then removed and the wells were washed four times with PBS-T. The washed wells were filled with 200 \u03bcl diluent buffer and kept shaking for 1.5 h at room temperature (25\u00b0 C.). After washing with PBS-T for four times, the wells were filled with 100 \u03bcl antibody (1:8000) and were incubated for 1.5 h, followed by washing for four times. Then, the wells were filled with 100 \u03bcl goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate complex diluted to a final 1:3000 dilution, and were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h, followed by washing for four times. The enzyme reactions were started by addition of 100 \u03bcl substrate (TMB) solution. The reactions were stopped after 15 min by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of 2 M sulfuric acid, and the absorbance was read at 460 nm using a Bio-Rad ELISA plate reader.","While the terms used herein are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the definitions set forth herein are provided to facilitate explanation of the presently-disclosed subject matter.","Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the presently-disclosed subject matter belongs.
