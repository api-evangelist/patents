Providing a user with all this information in an unfiltered fashion would confuse users and probably render the electronic systems useless for any user. Furthermore, providing information to user that is not related to any interest of said users would provoke the users to look for alternative sources of information.","In order to provide the user only with information that he is most likely interested in, such modern electronic systems are adapted to provide the user with information that is adapted for example based on the social relations of said user. Therefore, such modern electronic systems can comprise a database containing the social relations of a user. Such social relations could for example be defined as being a friend of another user, as being a follower of another user's publications or as being a fan of another user.","In order to provide a filtered or targeted selection of information to a specific user electronic systems select only that information for display to a user, which is generated by other users that are related (e.g. as friends or their common interest in the same topic) to said user.","Targeting information based on the social relations of a user provides limited targeting options. A user could be a friend of another user but not be interested in that other user's picture gallery. Thus, providing said user for example with the content generated by the other user would not give said user better targeted information.","Accordingly, there is a need for a method and an apparatus for providing a better targeted information.","According to an embodiment, a method for calculating at least one relationship metric of a relationship between objects, the method comprising the steps of a) providing a multi-layered relationship network comprising at least: a first relationship layer derived from potential relations between objects, wherein potential relationships between objects are derived from semantic metrics related to said objects; a second relationship layer derived from interactions between objects, wherein interactions between objects comprise interactions of objects with content generated by other objects; a third relationship layer derived from explicit relations between objects, wherein explicit relations are relations defined by at least one of the objects; and an aggregated relationship layer derived from at least two layers of the first to third relationship layers; and wherein each layer comprises a graph comprising one vertex for every object represented in the multi-layered relationship network and at least one unidirectional and\/or bidirectional edge between at least two of said vertices; b) calculating the weights of the edges of said aggregated relationship layer based on the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers selected from the first to third relationship layers; c) selecting at least one relationship between an object and other objects related to said object from the aggregated relationship layer; d) outputting the calculated weights of the selected relationships as the calculated relationship metrics.","According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the first relationship layer can be calculated using terms and\/or tags and\/or words used and\/or published by the objects. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the second layer can be calculated based on interactions of objects with content generated by other objects. According to a further embodiment, the interactions may comprise commenting and\/or co-authoring and\/or tagging and\/or reading by one user content generated by another user. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the third relationship layer can be calculated based on explicit relationship statuses actively selected by at least one object. According to a further embodiment, the explicit relationship statuses may comprise a friend status and\/or a follower status and\/or a fan status. According to a further embodiment, the weight of an edge may have a fixed value based on the type of explicit relation; or wherein the weight of an edge may be based on the total number of explicit relations of an object. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of at least one layer of the first to third relationship layer can be set to a negative value to penalize a relation. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer can be calculated by arithmetically combining the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers of the first to third relationship layers. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer can be calculated by adding the weights of the edges of at least two layers of the first to third relationship layers. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer can be calculated by multiplying the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers of the first to third relationship layers with correctional factors ant adding the multiplied weights of the edges. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer can be calculated by multiplying the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers of the first to third relationship layers. According to a further embodiment, the weights of the edges of the first to third relationship layers can be normalized before deriving the aggregated layer. According to a further embodiment, the objects may comprise persons and\/or companies and\/or institutional entities.","According to another embodiment, a programmable device for calculating at least one relationship metric of a relationship between objects, especially using the method of one of the preceding claims, may comprise: a memory configured for storing a multi-layered relationship network, the multi-layered relationship network comprising at least: a) a first relationship layer derived from potential relations between objects, wherein potential relationships between objects are derived from semantic metrics related to said objects; a second relationship layer derived from interactions between objects, wherein interactions between objects comprise interactions of objects with content generated by other objects; a third relationship layer derived from explicit relations between objects, wherein explicit relations are relations explicitly defined by at least one of the objects; and an aggregated relationship layer derived from at least two layers of the first to third relationship layers; and wherein each layer comprises a graph comprising one vertex for every object represented in the multi-layered relationship network and at least one unidirectional and\/or bidirectional edge between at least two of said vertices; b) a computing unit configured to calculate the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer based on the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers selected from the first to third relationship layers, c) a selection unit configured to select one relationship between one first object and the objects related to said first object from the aggregated relationship layer; and d) an interface unit configured to output the calculated weights of the selected relationships as the calculated relationship metrics.","According to a further embodiment of the device, the device can be a search engine and the device can be configured to position search results and\/or advertisements based on the calculated relationship metrics. According to a further embodiment of the device, the device can be a server of a social network and the device is configured to filter activity reports of users of the social network based on the calculated relationship metrics. According to a further embodiment of the device, the device can be a server of a content management system and the device can be configured to suggest tags for tagging a first user's content based on the calculated relationship metrics between said first user and other users of said content management system.","According to an embodiment, a method for calculating at least one relationship metric of a relationship between objects may comprise the steps of:\n\n","According to another embodiment, a programmable device for calculating at least one relationship metric of a relationship between objects, especially using the method of one of the preceding claims, may comprise:\n\n","The various embodiments are based on the conclusion that every object provides a major amount of information regarding relationships between said object and other objects when using modern electronic systems.","Therefore, the various embodiments use this knowledge to provide a flexible relationship metric that can easily be adapted to different applications.","Using the method and\/or apparatus provided by the various embodiments it is possible to provide different electronic systems like for example search engines or social network applications with a possibility to specifically target information to specific objects.","In a possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the first relationship layer are calculated using terms and\/or tags and\/or words used and\/or published by the objects. This allows automatic creation of a basis for the relationship metric based on content published by an object.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the second layer are calculated based on interactions of objects with content generated by other objects. This allows to automatically generate a basis for the relationship metric based on implicit relationship details which a user does not actively publish but which a user publishes by acting with or on the content generated by another object.","In another possible embodiment the interactions comprise commenting and\/or co-authoring and\/or tagging and\/or reading by one user content generated by another user. This allows including the most relevant interactions in modern communication applications or internet applications in the automatic calculation of the relationship metric.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the third relationship layer are calculated based on explicit relationship statuses actively selected by at least one object. This allows calculating the relationship metric based on the known relationships of an object.","In another possible embodiment the explicit relationship statuses comprise a friend status and\/or a follower status and\/or a fan status. This allows including the most relevant relationship statuses used in modern communication applications or internet applications in the automatic calculation of the relationship metric.","In another possible embodiment the weight of an edge has a fixed value based on the type of explicit relation. In another possible embodiment the weight of an edge is based on the total number of explicit relations of an object. A fixed weight allows for a fast and simple calculation of the weight of an edge which represents a relationship. Using the weight of an edge that is based on the total number of explicit relations of an object allows to dynamically adapt the weight. The features of this embodiment are based on the assumption that if a user has a low number of relationships that relationships will be of a higher Quality than relationships of a user that has a great number of relationships. If for example an object, which could be a user of a social network, only has  \u201cfriends\u201d, it is very likely that the user will closely follow his \u201cfriends\u201d activities. If a user has  or more \u201cfriends\u201d in a social network it is very unlikely that a user will closely follow all his \u201cfriends\u201d activities. Thus, basing the weight of an edge in a relationship layer on the total number of relations of an object allows to dynamically weight the relationships of users with a high number of relationships as less relevant than the relationships of users with a little number of relationships.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of at least one layer of the first to third relationship layers are set to a negative value to penalize a relation. This allows specifically selecting single relationships that should be penalized. For example, in a social network only those users could be selected, which are no \u201cfriends\u201d of another user by penalising a \u201cfriend\u201d relationship with a negative edge weight.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer are calculated by arithmetically combining the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers of the first to third relationship layers. Selecting at least two relationship layers to arithmetically combine their edge weights into the edge weights of the aggregated relationship layer allows a very flexible calculation of the relationship metric.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer are calculated by adding the weights of the edges of at least two layers of the first to third relationship layers. This allows very simple and effective calculation of the relationship metric.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer are calculated by multiplying the weights of the edges of at least one relationship layer of the first to third relationship layers with correctional factors and adding the multiplied weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers. In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the aggregated relationship layer are calculated by multiplying the weights of the edges of at least two relationship layers of the first to third relationship layers. This allows dynamically modifying the impact of every relationship layer's edge weights on the calculated relationship metric.","In another possible embodiment the weights of the edges of the first to third relationship layers are normalized before deriving the aggregated layer.","In another possible embodiment the objects comprise persons and\/or companies and\/or institutional entities. This allows to adapt the various embodiments to different applications and to use the various embodiments in a variety of different systems.","In another possible embodiment the device is a search engine and the device is configured to position search results and\/or advertisements based on the calculated relationship metrics. This allows specific marketing targeting, wherein the advertisements presented to the objects, for example users, and the order of said advertisements are selected by the search engine based on the relationship metric.","In another possible embodiment the device is a server of a social network and the device is configured to filter activity reports of users of the social network based on the calculated relationship metrics. This allows presenting a user with activity reports of other users of the social network, that relate to the interests of said user independent of the relationship status between the users.","In another possible embodiment the device is a server of a content management system and the device is configured to suggest tags for tagging a first user's content based on the calculated relationship metrics between said first user and other users of said content management system. This provides an effective aid in tagging for example articles of a user because the probability that users which are related one to another will use the same tags is very high.","Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a variety of alternate and\/or equivalent implementations may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown and described without departing from the scope of the present invention. Generally, this application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the specific embodiments discussed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"According to  a first step S of the method consists in providing a multi-layered relationship network MW.
