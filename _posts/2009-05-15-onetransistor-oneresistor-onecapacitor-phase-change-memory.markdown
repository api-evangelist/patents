Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to memory devices based on phase change based memory materials, including chalcogenide based materials and other programmable resistance materials, and methods for operating such devices.","2. Description of Related Art","In general, system-on-a-chip (SOC) technology is the integration of multiple subsystems of electronic system within a single integrated circuit, and may contain digital, analog, mixed-signal, and radio-frequency functions. The various types of subsystems that may be integrated within the integrated circuit include microprocessor and microcontroller cores, digital signal processors (DSPs), configurable logic units, memory blocks, timing sources, external interfaces, and power management circuits, among others. An SOC consists of both the hardware described above, as well as the software that controls the subsystems. The term \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d may be used to describe complex application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), where many functions previously achieved by combining integrated circuits on a board are now provided by one single integrated circuit. This level of integration greatly reduces the size and power consumption of the system, while generally also reducing manufacturing costs.","Phase change based memory materials, like chalcogenide based materials and similar materials, can be caused to change phase between an amorphous state and a crystalline state by application of electrical current at levels suitable for implementation in integrated circuits. The generally amorphous state is characterized by higher electrical resistivity than the generally crystalline state, which can readily be sensed to indicate data. These properties have generated interest in using programmable resistive material to form nonvolatile memory circuits, which can be read and written with random access.","However performance limitations such as a relatively slow set speed, a high reset current, and limited cycle endurance has restricted the use of phase change based memory circuits as high speed random access memory for the integrated circuit.","Thus, integrated circuits employing phase change based memory circuit typically also include other types of memory circuits in order to fulfill the memory performance requirements for the various functions of the integrated circuit. These different types of memory circuits are embedded at various locations in the integrated circuit, and typically include SRAM or DRAM memory circuits in order to provide high access speed memory for the integrated circuit. However, integration of different types of memory circuits for the various memory applications in an integrated circuit can be difficult and result in highly complex designs.","It is therefore desirable to provide a memory cell which can address different memory performance requirements, while also addressing the issue of design integration. It is also desirable to provide methods for operating such devices.","A memory cell described herein comprises a transistor electrically coupled to first and second access lines. A programmable resistance memory element is arranged along a current path between the first and second access lines. A capacitor is electrically coupled to the current path between the first and second access lines.","A memory cell described herein comprising a transistor, a capacitor and a programmable resistance memory element allows for both volatile and nonvolatile modes of memory operation. The capacitor provides fast program\/erase speed, while the programmable resistance memory element provides data retention for nonvolatile data storage. The volatile and nonvolatile modes can provide different operational characteristics such as switching speed, cycle endurance, operational current, and data retention within the same memory cell. As a result, the same memory cell can serve as working memory or nonvolatile memory to address the different memory performance requirements demanded by various functions of an integrated circuit.","Methods for operating memory cells having a transistor, a capacitor, and a programmable resistance memory element are also described herein. The methods include operating the memory cell in a first mode to store a data value in the programmable resistance memory element, and operating the memory cell in a second mode to store a data value in the capacitor.","Methods for operating memory cells as described herein also include storing a data value in one of the programmable resistance memory element and the capacitor in dependence upon a data value stored in the other of the programmable resistance memory element and the capacitor. In embodiments, by applying a bias arrangement to the memory cell the data value stored in one of the programmable resistance memory element and the capacitor can be directly transferred to the other without performing a read operation. For example, the data value stored in the programmable resistance memory element during power off conditions of the integrated circuit can be transferred directly to the capacitor for use during operation of the integrated circuit. As another example, the data value stored in the capacitor during operation of the integrated circuit can be transferred directly to the memory element for nonvolatile data storage during power off conditions of the integrated circuit.","Embodiments of memory cells described herein have a small cross-sectional area which allows for implementation in high density memory arrays. In one embodiment, the capacitor is implemented as a trench capacitor within the substrate, which permits a relatively large capacitance per unit area of substrate. In another embodiment, a floating channel body of the transistor takes the place of a discrete capacitor and utilizes transient charge storage in the floating channel body of the transistor by using the capacitance formed between the floating channel body of the transistor and the underlying substrate.","Other aspects and advantages of the present invention can be seen on review of the drawings, the detailed description, and the claims which follow.","The following description of the disclosure will typically be with reference to specific structural embodiments and methods.

Chalcogens include any of the four elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and tellurium (Te), forming part of group VIA of the periodic table. Chalcogenides comprise compounds of a chalcogen with a more electropositive element or radical. Chalcogenide alloys comprise combinations of chalcogenides with other materials such as transition metals. A chalcogenide alloy usually contains one or more elements from group IVA of the periodic table of elements, such as germanium (Ge) and tin (Sn). Often, chalcogenide alloys include combinations including one or more of antimony (Sb), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and silver (Ag). Many phase change based memory materials have been described in technical literature, including alloys of: Ga\/Sb, In\/Sb, In\/Se, Sb\/Te, Ge\/Te, Ge\/Sb\/Te, In\/Sb\/Te, Ga\/Se\/Te, Sn\/Sb\/Te, In\/Sb\/Ge, Ag\/In\/Sb\/Te, Ge\/Sn\/Sb\/Te, Ge\/Sb\/Se\/Te and Te\/Ge\/Sb\/S. In the family of Ge\/Sb\/Te alloys, a wide range of alloy compositions may be workable. The compositions can be characterized as TeGeSb. One researcher has described the most useful alloys as having an average concentration of Te in the deposited materials well below 70%, typically below about 60% and ranged in general from as low as about 23% up to about 58% Te and most preferably about 48% to 58% Te. Concentrations of Ge were above about 5% and ranged from a low of about 8% to about 30% average in the material, remaining generally below 50%. Most preferably, concentrations of Ge ranged from about 8% to about 40%. The remainder of the principal constituent elements in this composition was Sb. These percentages are atomic percentages that total 100% of the atoms of the constituent elements. (Ovshinsky U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,112, cols. 10-11.) Particular alloys evaluated by another researcher include GeSbTe, GeSbTeand GeSbTe(Noboru Yamada, \u201cPotential of Ge\u2014Sb\u2014Te Phase-Change Optical Disks for High-Data-Rate Recording\u201d, SPIE v. 3109, pp. 28-37 (1997).) More generally, a transition metal such as chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), niobium (Nb), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt) and mixtures or alloys thereof may be combined with Ge\/Sb\/Te to form a phase change alloy that has programmable resistive properties. Specific examples of memory materials that may be useful are given in Ovshinsky '112 at columns 11-13, which examples are hereby incorporated by reference.","Chalcogenides and other phase change materials are doped with impurities in some embodiments to modify conductivity, transition temperature, melting temperature, and other properties of memory elements using the doped chalcogenides. Representative impurities used for doping chalcogenides include nitrogen, silicon, oxygen, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, copper, silver, gold, aluminum, aluminum oxide, tantalum, tantalum oxide, tantalum nitride, titanium and titanium oxide. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,504, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2005\/0029502.","Phase change alloys are capable of being switched between a first structural state in which the material is in a generally amorphous solid phase, and a second structural state in which the material is in a generally crystalline solid phase in its local order in the active channel region of the cell. These alloys are at least bistable. The term amorphous is used to refer to a relatively less ordered structure, more disordered than a single crystal, which has the detectable characteristics such as higher electrical resistivity than the crystalline phase. The term crystalline is used to refer to a relatively more ordered structure, more ordered than in an amorphous structure, which has detectable characteristics such as lower electrical resistivity than the amorphous phase. Typically, phase change materials may be electrically switched between different detectable states of local order across the spectrum between completely amorphous and completely crystalline states. Other material characteristics affected by the change between amorphous and crystalline phases include atomic order, free electron density and activation energy. The material may be switched either into different solid phases or into mixtures of two or more solid phases, providing a gray scale between completely amorphous and completely crystalline states. The electrical properties in the material may vary accordingly.","Phase change alloys can be changed from one phase state to another by application of electrical pulses. It has been observed that a shorter, higher amplitude pulse tends to change the phase change material to a generally amorphous state. A longer, lower amplitude pulse tends to change the phase change material to a generally crystalline state. The energy in a shorter, higher amplitude pulse is high enough to allow for bonds of the crystalline structure to be broken and short enough to prevent the atoms from realigning into a crystalline state. Appropriate profiles for pulses can be determined, without undue experimentation, specifically adapted to a particular phase change alloy. In following sections of the disclosure, the phase change material is referred to as GST, and it will be understood that other types of phase change materials can be used. A material useful for implementation of a PCRAM described herein is GeSbTe.","Other programmable resistive memory materials may be used in other embodiments of the invention, including other materials that use different crystal phase changes to determine resistance, or other memory materials that use an electrical pulse to change the resistance state. Examples include materials for use in resistance random access memory (RRAM) such as metal-oxides including tungsten-oxide (WO), NiO, NbO, CuO, TaO, AlO, CoO, FeO, HfO, TiO, SrTiO, SrZrO, (BaSr)TiO.
