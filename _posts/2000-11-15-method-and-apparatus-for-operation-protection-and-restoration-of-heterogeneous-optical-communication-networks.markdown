title: Method and apparatus for operation, protection, and restoration of heterogeneous optical communication networks
abstract: Techniques for providing normal operation and service restoration capability in the event of failure of terminal equipment or transmission media in a heterogeneous network, such as a hybrid network containing single- and multi-wavelength lightwave communications systems. An optical switching node (OSN) is placed at each node in the ring network to provide the required connections between various fibers and terminal equipment, but having switch states that allow signals on the protection fibers to bypass the terminal equipment at that node. Ring-switched signals propagate around the ring on protection fibers without encountering the terminal equipment at the intervening nodes. To the extent that the protection fiber links between any given pair of nodes are incapable of supporting all the relevant communication regimes, such links are modified to provide such support.

The physical layer in the network, which includes the transmission equipment and the fiber layer used for signal transport, is required to be capable of reconfiguration of facilities in order to support dynamic routing of traffic. While slow reconfiguration of the order of minutes or more may be sufficient for rearranging traffic capacity in response to change in demand patterns across the network, rapid reconfiguration (perhaps 50 ms or less) is required for restoring services in the case of transmission equipment or fiber cable facility failures. Fast restoration is also critical to prevent escalation of the effects of a single point of failure where the affected services (voice and data) attempt to reconnect immediately following the disruption of services and may lead to overloading of facilities adjacent or connected to the point of original failure.","In addition to the critical need for fast restoration, the capacity that needs to be re-routed has increased rapidly with the continuing increase in data rates for optical transmission and the introduction of multi-wavelength channels on a single fiber. For example, the rapid growth in traffic capacities required for long haul telecommunications networks has accelerated the introduction of new technologies for transmission and multiplexing. Transmission links up to bit rates of 10 Gbps (OC-192) are in commercial service and new developments in multi-wavelength component technologies are resulting in increased commercial availability of 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 40-channel WDM (wavelength division multiplex) links (at 2.5 Gbps per wavelength or more).","Transmission of such high data rates over single fibers also results in making the network more vulnerable to failures of larger magnitude. For example, a single fiber link failure can disrupt approximately 130,000 voice channels (DS) when the fiber link is operating at 10 Gbps on a single-wavelength or at 2.5 Gbps on each of four wavelengths. Consequently, redundant facilities provisioned for dynamic restoration of service also need to provide a similar magnitude of capacity on the links used as backup or spare links for ensuring network survivability.","Therefore, routing techniques used for network restoration must provide solutions that are compatible with the twofold requirement of fast switching and high capacity.","International and North American standard bodies have defined various Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) configurations for operation of lightwave networks. \u201cSelf-healing ring\u201d configurations allow for rapid restoration of services in the event of a failure of fiber transmission media. In a four-fiber self-healing ring network, each node is connected to its adjacent nodes through two pairs of fibers (carrying signals in opposite directions). One fiber in each such pair is called the \u201cworking\u201d fiber; the other fiber is termed the \u201cprotection\u201d fiber and may be used when the working fiber facility fails. Each node includes add-drop multiplexer (ADM) terminal equipment that originates and terminates signals traversing the various links in the ring.","When a failure of any working fiber link between any two nodes occurs, the ADM terminal equipment on either side of the failure carries out the required re-routing of signals over protection fibers. Such re-routing of signals to restore all services is referred to as \u201crestoration\u201d of services. If an outgoing working fiber link fails, but the corresponding protection fiber link is intact, the signals intended for the failed working fiber will be diverted to the intact corresponding protection fiber in what is referred to as span switching. In this context, reference to the corresponding protection fiber means the protection fiber coupled between the same two nodes and for use in the same direction (to or from the other node).","If the working and protection links fail, the signals intended for the failed working fiber will be directed to the outgoing protection fiber in the other direction around the ring, being passed from one node to the next, in what is referred to as ring switching.","However, some of these restoration schemes (ring switching) break down in what will be referred to as heterogeneous networks. A heterogeneous ring network is one where different links differ in some material respect such as signal-carrying capacity (bandwidth), number of wavelength channels, modulation scheme, format, or protocol. For example, certain high-traffic links may have been upgraded to provide increased bandwidth, by increasing the bit rate of signals on a given wavelength channel, by providing additional WDM terminal equipment to support additional wavelength channels, or both.","Thus, for a variety of reasons, the network may have a link, with terminal equipment at each end, where the signals on that link are alien or unsupported on one or more other links. Since at least some link in the opposite direction will not support the signals that normally travel on the failed link, ring switching is not possible. A particular type of heterogeneous network, namely one containing single- and multi-wavelength lightwave communication links, is sometimes referred to as a hybrid network.","The present invention provides methods and apparatus for providing normal operation and service restoration capability in the event of failure of terminal equipment or transmission media in a heterogeneous network, such as a hybrid network containing single- and multi-wavelength lightwave communications systems.","In general, this is accomplished by allowing ring-switched signals to propagate around the ring without encountering the terminal equipment at the intervening nodes. To the extent that the protection fiber links between any given pair of nodes are incapable of supporting all the relevant communication regimes, such links are modified to provide such support.","In specific embodiments, an optical switching node (OSN) is placed at each node in the ring network to provide the required connections between various fibers and terminal equipment, but having switch states that allow signals on the protection fibers to bypass the terminal equipment at that node. In the context of a hybrid network where only some nodes have WDM terminal equipment, normal operation and restoration of multi-wavelength signals become possible without disturbing the single-wavelength SONET operation of that ring.","The steps, if needed, to upgrade the protection links depend on the nature of the network heterogeneity, but are generally relatively inexpensive. For example, upgrading the protection links to support multi-wavelength or higher bit-rate operation often entails no more than the addition of appropriate optical amplifiers. Routing or re-routing for restoration of the high-bandwidth (e.g., multi-wavelength) traffic takes place through the OSNs. It is not necessary to provide special terminal equipment capable of terminating the high-bandwidth signals at the nodes that are not normally required to handle such signals, since those nodes are bypassed due to the operation of the OSNs.","A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings.","1.0 Technological Overview","1.1 Network Layers","Discussions of network communications are often with reference to a network layer model, such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. The OSI layers, from the highest to the lowest, include the application layer, the presentation layer, the session layer, the transport layer, the network layer, the data link layer, and the physical layer.","The application layer supports semantic exchanges between applications and provides access to the lower functions and services. The presentation layer deals with representing data to the end user or application. The session layer organizes and structures the interaction between applications and devices. The transport layer is responsible for transparent and reliable transfer of data without regard to the nature and attributes of the transfer medium. The network layer establishes communication between networks and is concerned with addressing, routing, and relaying information. The data link layer provides functions and protocols for transferring data between network resources and detecting errors in the physical layer. The physical layer, in addition to defining the actual mechanicals electrical, or optical characteristics of the communication medium, also defines the functional and procedural standards for the physical transmission of data over the communications medium.","The physical layer is itself often considered to include a number of sublayers including, from top to bottom, the line terminal equipment (LTE) layer, the photonic connectivity layer, and the fiber infrastructure.","1.2 Fiber Technologies","Optical fiber links used in telecommunications are either single-wavelength or multi-wavelength. In a fiberoptic communications network, an electrical signal is converted to an optical signal, typically by modulating a laser diode emitting light at a wavelength suited for propagation along the fiber. The modulated light is injected into the fiber and detected by a fiberoptic receiver that includes a photodiode or other opto-electronic device to retrieve a signal corresponding to the original electrical signal. It is possible to transmit many signals on an optical fiber at the same time using a technique known as wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). Light at a number of different wavelengths is injected into a single fiber using a wavelength multiplexer, and the light at the individual wavelengths are separated at the other end using a wavelength demultiplexer.","Wavelength multiplexers and demultiplexers are often referred to generically as WDM couplers. It is also possible to use WDM couplers to establish bidirectional operation on a single fiber, and WDM couplers optimized for such use are often referred to as bidirectional WDM couplers. Some other optical elements such as isolators and circulators are often used in conjunction with WDM couplers to establish bi-directional communications over a single fiber with reduced cross-talk, back-reflection, etc. Although these elements are not essential in theory, they are useful in practice.","A given optical fiber that supports transmission at a given wavelength is likely to support transmission at a number of closely spaced wavelengths. However, it is typically the case that optical amplifiers are disposed at various locations in the path, say every 30 km, and a typical single-wavelength fiber link is likely to have amplifiers that only operate correctly for the single wavelength that is being transmitted on the fiber. A different optical amplifier may be needed to support multi-wavelength operation.","Prior to the development of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, it was necessary to interpose regenerators (sometimes referred to as repeaters) in order to maintain the signal. A regenerator would convert the optical signal to an electrical signal, amplify the electric signal, and then reconvert the amplified electric signal to an optical signal. The regenerator may also reshape or otherwise condition the electrical signal and resynchronize the electrical signal to a master network clock (if available) before reconverting it to an optical signal. Common wavelengths for use in fiberoptic transmission include wavelengths in the neighborhoods of 1310 nm and 1550 nm. However, the erbium amplifiers operate only in the 1550-nm range, and so as a practical matter, 1550 nm remains the wavelength of choice. In a typical multi-wavelength environment, the wavelengths are spaced by 0.8 nm (corresponding to 100 GHz at 1550 nm) or 1.6 nm, and are typically in the range of 1530-1570 nm. It is noted that a regenerator for multi-wavelength fiber would require that each wavelength be separately regenerated, thus requiring a WDM demultiplexer for sending each wavelength on the incoming fiber to a separate regenerator and a WDM multiplexer to recombine the regenerated optical signals onto the outgoing fiber.","There are two classes of optical fiber, referred to as single-mode and multi-mode. While multi-mode fiber is relatively inexpensive, it is typically used only for short data communications applications (say 50 meters or less). This is because the different modes of propagation have different transit times along the fiber, so dispersion becomes a significant factor over long distances.","1.3 SONET Restoration","In the discussion that follows, the specific type of network is a synchronous optical network (SONET), which uses time division multiplexing (TDM) wherein multiple channels are given different time slots within a frame. Each node includes an add-drop multiplexer (ADM) that interfaces the fibers to the electronic devices that are to communicate with each other over the network. A SONET network provides reliable transport from point to point and has the capability of providing restoration. However, the invention finds applicability with other types of terminal equipment, such as devices for routing ATM, IP, or other types of packet or synchronous data.","The SONET ADM provides two broad functions. The first function is extracting information in one of the time slots from the incoming working fibers and outputting information into that time slot for transmission (along with the information in the other time slots) on the fiber that continues in the same direction. The second function is performing electrical switching to reroute information onto the protection fibers in the event of a failure in one or more of the fiber links. In this application, the term \u201clink\u201d will be used to refer to a communication path between two nodes. The term \u201cspan\u201d is sometimes used to refer the same thing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00064","num":"00064"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["20","25","20","20","20","20","20","25","20","25"],"i":["a, ","b, ","c, ","a ","b ","ab ","b ","ba.

Protection refers to the fact that resources have been committed to carrying the data (e.g., dedicated alternate paths or bandwidth and a mechanism for switching).

The 2\u00d72 optical switches have what are referred to as cross and bar states. In the network's normal mode of operation, the 1\u00d72 switches are set to their primary states so that the working ring is coupled to the ADMs in the normal way.

This would require WDM equipment at each end to separate the optical paths for the two sets of wavelengths. It is also possible to implement the invention in an environment where the working and protection capacity (shown as separate working and protection fibers) is provided on a single fiber having a sufficient number of wavelength channels to replicate the necessary bandwidth.","According to embodiments of the present invention, such restorability is provided by the interposition of optical switching nodes (OSNs) and between the ADMs and the fiber rings, and further by retrofitting the protection fibers in the other links so that they are multi-wavelength capable. For example, the protection fibers in the link between OSN and OSN designated p\u2032 and p\u2032, are multi-wavelength capable. As noted above, the single-wavelength protection fibers are generally capable of supporting multi-wavelength operation, but it may be necessary to change the amplifiers, if present in the link, to amplifiers having a wider gain band to support multi-wavelength operation.","Each OSN includes optical switch elements and control electronics for controlling the optical switch elements. In a specific embodiment, the control electronics is also responsible for determining when any of the optical links from the network has failed, and communicating messages to the OSNs in the adjacent nodes, as will be described in detail below. For the initial discussions, the OSN will be shown with a view to describing the optical paths.

In , working wavelength multiplexer w and working wavelength demultiplexer w constitute a WDM terminal, while protection wavelength multiplexer p and protection wavelength demultiplexer p constitute another WDM terminal. WDM terminals typically include optical amplifiers and transponders (optical-electrical-optical signal conversion units) for each wavelength channel in addition to the multiplexer and demultiplexer.","As noted above in connection with the discussion of , even though the terminal equipment at either end of the multi-wavelength link is multi-wavelength capable (i.e., has WDM terminal equipment and appropriately replicated SONET ADMs), the SONET ring is not capable of restoring multi-wavelength operation in the case of a failure in the multi-wavelength link. Rather, it is the OSNs, deployed and configured according to embodiments of the invention, that provide such restoration capability.","It should be noted that the invention is not limited to hybrid ring networks such as the one illustrated in FIG. . In , at least one of the links carries multi-wavelength traffic and is terminated at both ends by WDM-equipped nodes; other links in the network carry single-wavelength traffic, and are terminated by nodes that are incapable of terminating multi-wavelength traffic. As mentioned above, such a hybrid network is one example of a broader class of heterogeneous networks where the communication regimes on some links differ in a material characteristic such as signal-carrying capacity (bandwidth), number of wavelength channels, modulation scheme, format, or protocol. Thus a heterogeneous network is characterized by a link, with terminal equipment at each end, where the signals on that link are incapable of being transmitted on one or more other links, or are incapable of being terminated by terminal equipment on one or more other links, or both.","The techniques of the present invention are in fact applicable to many types of heterogeneous ring networks. For example, different links could differ in bandwidth due to different numbers of wavelengths supported by WDM terminal equipment at different nodes, even if all the links are capable of supporting more than a single wavelength. Similarly, different links could differ in the bit rate or other electrical characteristics of the signals on a particular wavelength channel, even if the different links had the same number of wavelength channels.","The considerations for upgrading the protection links in the more general case are similar to the notion in the specific example of  of upgrading single-wavelength links to support multi-wavelength traffic by providing optical amplifiers with a wider gain band. For example, protection links that normally carry traffic at a bit rate per wavelength channel that is lower than the highest bit rate in the network might have to be upgraded by providing optical amplifiers with higher gain or providing additional optical amplifiers to support traffic at a higher bit rate per wavelength channel. In some instances, it may be necessary to upgrade different protection links in different ways so that all of the protection links can carry the traffic that is normally carried on all other working links. As will be discussed below, the invention does not require that the terminal equipment be upgraded to accommodate the \u201cforeign\u201d traffic. This is because the OSN has a switching state that allows traffic on the protection fibers to bypass the terminal equipment at the associated node.","2.2 OSN Overview","2.2.1 OSN Network Connections and Port Nomenclature",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00097","num":"00097"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["120","50","50","2","120"],"i":["a.

Further, in many switch technologies, 1\u00d73 and 1\u00d75 switch elements are far easier and cheaper to fabricate than 1\u00d710 or 10\u00d71. Thus the preferred implementation of the OSN offers savings in the number of switches (8 versus 20) as well as the cost per switch. Even though the specific OSN uses a sparse 10\u00d710 matrix (see FIG. B), OSNs for various other network configurations can be designed using the same approach, possibly with a different number of ports or a different desired set of states.","The OSN can use a variety of switch technologies.

In a current implementation, opto-mechanical switches procured from E-TEK Dynamics, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. were used.

These other rings do their normal ring switching as controlled by the ADMs on those rings. When the multi-wavelength link is restored through the OSN switching as described above, these ADMs recover traffic on their original working ports and revert to normal operation.","The SONET switching and the OSN switching can operate without interfering with each other. For example, there is no constraint on the relative speed of ring switching response time. Put another way, the OSN switching time does not need to be faster than the SONET ring switching time (5-50 ms). Thus, if the SONET switching (in the ADMs) occurs faster than OSN restoration, the ADMs revert to their original state after OSN switching. On the other hand, if the SONET switching occurs more slowly than the OSN restoration, the ADMs do not see a (verified) break on the link before traffic is restored through the OSNs. Thus, a racing condition is never created since the switching processes are mutually independent.","3.6 Restoration Software Details",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00205","num":"00205"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A-15C"},"Each OSN communicates with its two adjacent nodes over all four fibers interconnecting the OSNs.

Full protection of multi-wavelength links in a hybrid network is achieved without having to provide WDM terminal equipment at nodes between single-wavelength links in the network. Desired switching can be effected using relatively simple and inexpensive optical switching nodes, typically using only a small number of n\u00d71 and 1\u00d7n switches where n is less than the number of inputs and outputs of the node.","While the above is a complete description of specific embodiments of the invention, various modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents may be used. For example,  shows the OSN and its control electronics as being responsible for implementing the supervisory channel by generating and monitoring messages from adjacent nodes. It is possible, however, to have the terminal equipment implement the supervisory channel for controlling the OSN. Since WDM terminal systems monitor the signals on a link, a WDM-terminal controlled version of the OSN can also be implemented. Such an OSN would be completely controlled by the WDM terminals, which would determine the need for span switching or ring switching through the use of the WDM supervisory channel and other monitoring features. The physical configuration of the OSN would be similar to the particular implementation described above. The WDM terminal control system (Element Manager) would be required to send the required control signals (to set the OSN in one of the valid states for restoration). Such a configuration would have lower loss (since WDM couplers for the supervisory channel would not be required) and lower complexity since less processor capability would be required.","Therefore, the above description should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention as defined by the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["COPYRIGHT NOTICE","MICROFICHE APPENDICES","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00032","num":"00032"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00033","num":"00033"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00037","num":"00037"},"figref":"FIG. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00039","num":"00039"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A-9O"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00040","num":"00040"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10T"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A-11R"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00043","num":"00043"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00044","num":"00044"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00045","num":"00045"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A-15C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A-16C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00047","num":"00047"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A and 17B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00048","num":"00048"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00049","num":"00049"},"figref":"FIGS. 19A-19C"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
