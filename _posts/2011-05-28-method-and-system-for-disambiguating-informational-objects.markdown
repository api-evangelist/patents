title: Method and system for disambiguating informational objects
abstract: The present invention provides a Distinct Author Identification System (“DAIS”) for disambiguating data to discern author entities and link or associate authorships with such author entities. The invention provides powerful disambiguation processes applied across one or more databases to yield a disambiguated authority database of authors. An entire database of publications may be processed by the DAIS to group/link authorships and to identify author entities. The author entities may then be matched or associated with actual authors to establish an authority database of authors. After initial evaluation, the DAIS may be used to reevaluate some or all of the database(s) and/or the authority database established by the DAIS may be used to add or update information. DAIS may use “hierarchical clustering” to link authorships and identify authors based on authorship similarity. DAIS evaluates the likelihood that authorships are from the same author.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation in part of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/799,768, filed May 2, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,953,724 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The field of the invention relates generally to information science and infometrics (or informetrics) and more particularly to the fields of bibliometrics and scientometrics and clustering of information using linking techniques to establish relationships between objects.","With the advents of the printing press, typeset, typewriting machines, and computer-implemented word processing and storage, the amount of information generated by mankind has risen dramatically and with an ever quickening pace. As a result there is a continuing and growing need to collect and store, identify, track, classify and catalogue for retrieval and distribution this growing sea of information and an entire area of study has emerged called \u201cinformation science.\u201d One popular existing form of cataloging and classifying information, e.g., books and other writings, is the Dewey Decimal System. Beyond classifying information, information science involves the study of how organizations and people, e.g., researchers, interact in moving bodies of science and research forward.","In the area of scholarly and scientific writing a sophisticated process and convention for documenting research, supporting materials and organizing fields of study has emerged called \u201cbibliographic citation.\u201d Such scientific writings include, among other things, books, articles published in journals, magazines or other periodicals, and papers presented, submitted and published by society, industry and professional organizations such as in proceedings and transactions publications. To facilitate the widespread distribution of information published in scholarly writings to more efficiently and effectively move bodies of study forward, scholars and scientists use bibliographic citation to recognize the prior work of others, or even themselves, on which advancements set forth in their writings are based. \u201cCitations\u201d included in any particular work or body of work collectively form a \u201cbibliography\u201d and are used to identify sources of information relied on or considered by the author and to give the reader a way to confirm accuracy of the content and direction for further study. A \u201cbibliography\u201d may refer to either of a complete or selective list or compilation of writings specific to an author, publisher or given subject, or it may refer to a list or compilation of writings relied on or considered by an author in preparing a particular work, such as a paper, article, book or other informational object.","Citations briefly describe and identify each cited writing as a source of information or reference to an authority. Citations and bibliographies follow particular formatting conventions to enhance consistency in interpreting the information. Each citation typically includes the following information: full title, author name(s), publication data, including publisher identity, volume, edition and other data, and date and location of publication. However, the author names are most usually in an abbreviated form, such as an initial rather than full first or middle names (e.g., J. Smith), or suffer naturally from commonality with other authors, such as having either a common first or last name or both e.g., John Smith. This is results in a latent ambiguity as to the actual identity of the author. There have been many attempts to disambiguate author information, i.e., to establish a single semantic interpretation for, in this case, author identity. Each writing or paper may have one or more authors and represents an authorship for each author or co-author. As used herein each authorship instance represents the contribution of an individual author. Accordingly, if a paper has three co-authors then there will be three distinct \u201cauthorships\u201d associated with that paper. For purposes of descriptions contained herein, for a paper identified as \u201c1\u201d having co-authors A, B, and C, then the authorships associated, respectively, with the co-authors would be identified as A, B, and C. for linking authorships or citations representing authorships with particular authors and bibliographies of given authors.","Two areas of scientific study directed to measuring and analyzing science and scientific publications are \u201cscientometrics\u201d and \u201cbibliometrics,\u201d which are based on the early works of Vannevar Bush and more recently on the works of, among others, Eugene Garfield, founder of the Institute for Scientific Information Bibliometrics concerns analyzing content and associated information of books and other publications, which may be referred to as informational objects. Such analysis may then be used to identify and\/or quantify, confirm or reject relationships among informational objects, e.g., author entities, or academic journal citations, to create links among the informational objects. Other applications for bibliometrics include: creating word relationships to populate a thesaurus; measuring frequency of terms (individual words, groups of words, or word roots or meanings); identifying relationships of texts using grammar, semantic and syntax rules, and other techniques to create useful tools and resources.","Efforts have been undertaken to define relationships and the evolution of science within particular fields to give some coherent structure to the business of science, for example, see Eugene Garfield, Mapping The Structure Of Science (Chapter 8), Citation Indexing: Its Theory and Application in Science, Technology, and Humanities, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. NY, p. 98-147, 1979; and The Geography Of Science: Disciplinary And National Mappings, by Henry Small and Eugene Garfield, J. Inform. Sci., 11:147-159 (1985). ISI's Science Citation Index (\u201cSCI\u201d) was created as a citation index of the world's leading journals of science and technology and has proven to be a powerful bibliometric resource. SCI has been used to map the progress and development of science by using factors that measure the importance of scientific journals. The study of science based on examining citations and bibliographies to infer associations may be referred to as \u201ccitation analysis.\u201d For instance, SCI has been used to show that certain fundamental journals are central to hard science while in areas such as the humanities or social sciences there is no such relationship.","In support of the pursuits of science and research databases, database management tools, citation management and analysis tools, research authoring tools, and other powerful tools and resources have been used and developed for the beneficial use of researchers and scientists. These tools and resources may be available to users in an online environment, over the Internet or some other computer network, and may be in the form of a client-server architecture, central and\/or local database, application service provider (ASP), or other environment for effectively communicating and accessing electronic databases and software tools. Examples of such tools and resources are Thomson Scientific's Web of Science\u2122 (WoS), Web of Knowledge\u2122 (WoK), and Researchsoft\u2122 suite of publishing solutions including, EndNote\u2122, EndNoteWeb\u2122, ProCite\u2122, Reference Manager\u2122, and RefViz\u2122, as well as solutions such as Scholar One's Manuscript Central\u2122 A longstanding problem associated with these databases and tools has been inaccurate identification and attribution of authorship due to, among other things, author name ambiguity which may be a result of incomplete information (e.g., abbreviated name with initials), incorrect information (e.g., misspellings), and common\/identical information (e.g., same name same spelling). Name ambiguity resulting in incorrect linkage of paper and citation records with author entities result in inaccuracies that diminish integrity, reliability and performance of resources and tools, including document and information search and retrieval, database integration, and research formation.","Techniques used to help build out databases and confirm database information include extraction and sorting, such as parsing of data from sentence or word structures, performed on electronic documents to extract information from papers and citations for further processing. Prior extraction techniques may include linking techniques such as Bayesian-based techniques as described in Automatic Extraction And Linking Of Person Names In Legal Text, Christopher Dozier and Robert Haschart, In Proceedings of RIAO 2000 (Recherche d'Information Assistee par Ordinateur), 12-14 Apr. 2000, Paris, France, pp. 1305-1321. See also HistCite\u2122: A Software Tool for Informetric Analysis of Citation Linkage, Eugene Garfield, Soren Paris, and Wolfgang Stock, Information Wissenschaft & Praxis, 57(8):391-400, November\/December 2006.","Relational links may be established based on \u201ccitations\u201d and such links may be used in searching for materials and analyzing the relative merit of resources. By linking informational objects, such as papers, through citations and citation indices, e.g., WoS, users can search forward using a known article to identify and access more recent publications that cite the known article and are related to the same subject matter.","Citation analysis can applied across databases such as WoS and WoK to determine acceptance, following, and impact of specific publications and authors and may be used, for example, in screening reference materials, validating research, establishing interaction among authors or institutions, and in deliberating an author's tenure review. Although citation analysis has been used for years, ever increasing computing power and information management techniques are making it more useful and widespread. One highly beneficial use of citation analysis is to associate works of authorship with individual authors. Also, integrating new publications into an existing database of papers and other works often starts with an existing list of known authors as a starting point. For example, assume an existing list of authors includes an entry for John Smith, Professor at University of Alabama. And then assume a subsequent article indicating \u201cJ. Smith\u201d from \u201cU. of Al.\u201d as an author or co-author. Known systems might automatically associate the article with the known John Smith at University of Alabama that appears on the existing list of authors. However, the system would not know of or consider the case of a \u201cJane Smith\u201d that recently became professor at University of Alabama. Also, such a system might not have a way of detecting a miss-match or the likelihood of a miss-match, e.g., if the citation has an incorrect abbreviation either in the author name or in the school\/institution name, e.g., typographical error in that the school should have been \u201cU. of Az.\u201d for University of Arizona at which the real author, Jeff Smith, is a professor.","Writings\u201d and \u201cpapers,\u201d as used herein shall refer to both \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d electronic documents, are now widely created, edited, maintained, archived, catalogued and researched in whole or in part electronically. The Internet and other networks and intranets facilitate electronic distribution of and access to such information. The advent of databases, database management systems and search languages and in particular relational databases, e.g., DB2 and others developed by IBM, Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft and others, has provided powerful research and development tools and environments in which to further advance all areas of science and the study of science. There are companies and institutions that have created electronic databases and associated services, such as SCI, WoS, and WoK, that are specifically designed to help organize and harness the vast array of knowledge.","Clustering\u201d is a method of identifying a subset of items sufficiently similar to form a relational link to form a \u201ccluster.\u201d A dendrogram is a graphical representation of links between data objects forming a cluster tree. If the linking of the data objects grows weaker the farther up the cluster tree, then one could assign a threshold degree of relatedness such that the tree is severed at some level resulting in individual groups of connected or linked data objects forming a plurality of clusters of data objects. There are several known techniques for clustering data objects, including single link, average link, complete link For instance, in a database of articles including: Article 1 with author \u201cJ. Smith at Univ. of Ala.\u201d; Article 2 with co-author \u201cJeff Smith at Univ. of Al.\u201d; and Article 3 with co-author \u201cJ. S. Smith at Univ. of Alabama,\u201d a sufficient link may have been formed based off of the name similarity and the school similarity to form a cluster as representing author \u201cJeff S. Smith\u201d of the University of Alabama. This may be in conjunction with a known list of authors or professors including a \u201cJeff Smith\u201d at the University of Alabama. Because papers often do not include full names, because professors do change positions and schools, and because typographical errors do occur, relying heavily on last name and first initial could introduce significant risk for error in the database and bibliographies generated by using such databases and systems. What is needed is a way to more accurately link or associate authorships with individual authors.","The present invention provides a method and system, Distinct Author Identification System (\u201cDAIS\u201d), for analyzing citations of papers and the like and comparing citation information by applying a powerful technique for linking and clustering authorships to disambiguate author information to form an author entity cluster representing an actual person, such as a scientific researcher and author. For instance, the inventive disambiguation processes disclosed herein may be used against a database comprised of over a hundred years of scientific papers. Such papers typically only include first and perhaps middle name initials and the last name of authors. Even in the case of full names, names are usually not unique to one person. The present invention provides a powerful way to extract useful information from the papers in the database, disambiguate author data, cluster authorships into author entities, and associate a unique code for each such entity to establish an authority database of authors to assist further research and other endeavors.","Known methods of associating records or documents with informational objects used metadata record but did not use the cited reference information. Some of these systems use an \u201cauthor list\u201d as a starting point and attempt to associate publications with authors on the list using the author information provided on the publication. However, name ambiguity makes this an uncertain proposition and mistakes existing in the database only compound the error when associating newly added publications. One constant problem facing those interested in accurately identifying and associating scholarly works has been that author names appearing in citations and in references themselves do not necessarily, or even sufficiently, uniquely identify the author data with an actual entity. Moreover, in the areas of research and science authors typically contribute to many publications and often with different sets of co-authors, it is difficult to with a high degree of confidence, much less absolute certainty, associate publications with particular authors. In other words there is inherent ambiguity in the process of extracting information, such as author data, from a reference or citation and associating such extracted information with a known or assigned source, e.g., an author entity or cluster entity and from there with an actual person. The present invention provides novel techniques to extract information selected to yield a high degree of relational linking and to apply novel techniques against such extracted information to yield highly accurate relationally linked clusters to disambiguate records across one or more databases, e.g., WoS and WoK.","One approach the present invention DAIS takes is to identify and extract information considered to be more reliable than incomplete author information and to draw associations not solely with author data but with other data to establish a more accurate relational link. For instance, where a paper includes an email address, this has been determined to be a more reliable piece of information on which to draw relationships and linking of clusters. Rather than associate the email address with an \u201cauthor\u201d, the present invention creates an \u201cauthor entity\u201d or \u201ccluster entity\u201d and assigns such an entity a unique author or cluster code. In addition, where a company or university name is included in and extracted from the document, the DAIS associates the company or university data with the paper or publication rather than the \u201cauthor.\u201d In a separate action the DAIS associates or links the unique author code with an actual person\/author. After associating the author or cluster entity code with an actual author, the process establishes an \u201cauthority database of authors\u201d for operational use.","Once the novel DAIS linking techniques have been applied across the target databases, then the disambiguated author tables from the authority database of authors may be used to more accurately classify and associate subsequently added publications and records to more effectively integrate such information into the operational database for use by researchers, this may be referred to as an. This subsequent integration may be used in conjunction with known linking techniques, e.g., Bayesian rules. Also, the disambiguation process may be subsequently performed on a subset of records. For example based on an event, such as a threshold number of new references identifying \u201cJ. Smith\u201d as an author added to the database, the content management system may use the DAIS process to reevaluate the records associated with all \u201cSmith, J\u201d clusters or it may add an additional cluster for a newly identified author entity or cluster.","One use of the invention is to provide an improved method and system for more accurately linking works of authorship with actual authors. Another use is to disambiguate a universe of papers contained in a database using citation information to identify a universe of author entities each having one or more authorships attributed thereto. Another use of the invention is to link or associate authorships with one or more author entities. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment the invention may allow or require an author to register with a system or operator to prevent ambiguous author issues. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment the invention provides a method or system whereby authors may recognize that not all of their works of authorship are attributed to them or are divided among more than one cluster or author entity by the DAIS and then as presented by and through the WoS or other database. The author may issue a signal, such as by acting on links or buttons provided via a browser, to the CMS or other system or vice versa to notify or inquire to the author. The CMS then receives the request from the author or perhaps a reviewer or administrator indicating that an author is associated with more than one cluster. In this process, the CMS or other system may send to the author or to an administrator a request signal requesting a set of information. The CMS may then receive a response to the request signal and based on the response take some appropriate action. For instance the CMS may associate the response with the author such that the author becomes associated with a single cluster or some reference is then associated with the author's cluster\/author identifier or code.","In another exemplary embodiment the present invention provides a computer implemented method for disambiguating data associated with a set of information. The method comprises the following: selecting a set of electronic information associated with a plurality of publications having one or more authorships; disambiguating, using computer implemented processes, at least some of the set of electronic information based on select data elements, the select data elements comprising at least one of the following: email address; co-citation; bibliographic coupling; self cite; and co-author, the disambiguating step comprising: determining an authorship similarity between publication authorships by processing the select data elements; and linking authorships based on the determined authorship similarity. In addition, this embodiment may include clustering two or more linked authorships to form a first cluster and forming a first author entity associated with the first cluster; and matching the first author entity with a first actual author, the first cluster of authorships being attributable to the first actual author, and wherein the clustering step is repeated to form a plurality of clusters associated with a plurality of unique author entities.","The invention may include establishing an authority database of authors comprising the plurality of unique author entities each associated with a unique actual author and a cluster. The invention may further include establishing a communication link with a client; providing the client with a graphical user interface to query against the authority database of authors; and processing the query terms submitted by the client and presenting the client with disambiguated data. The invention may further include receiving notice of an erroneous match of an actual author with at least one of an authorship, a cluster, or an author entity, and based on the notice disassociating the actual author from the at least one of an authorship, a cluster, or an author entity. Further, the determining step may include arriving at a scored authorship similarity attribute and the linking step may be based on the scored authorship similarity attribute meeting or exceeding a predetermined degree of similarity. The scored authorship similarity attribute is based at least in part on author name data, a commonality of the name data, a frequency of occurrence of the name data, and\/or on co-authorship data comprising the number of authorships associated with publications, wherein as the number of co-authorships increases, the degree of similarity associated with the co-authorship data decreases. Where the co-authorship data comprises co-author name data and matching co-author name data among publications increases the scored authorship similarity attribute. Further, the determining step may result in an authorship similarity insufficient to form a link in the linking step, and the linking step may further comprise processing information derived from the set of electronic information to establish a secondary link between authorships. The invention may further comprise reevaluating at least a portion of the established authority database of authors based on supplemental information, and this may be based at least in part on the supplemental information including data representing a threshold number of publications having common author name data. The select data elements may further comprise at least one of the following elements: address; cited reference paper; cited reference author name; cited by paper; cited by author name; keywords; Publication Discipline Code; and additional author name initial.","In one embodiment the invention provides a computer-implemented method comprising: receiving a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications, each publication in the set of publications comprising at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship; comparing at least a portion of the set of electronic information with authorship data contained in an authority database, the authorship data related to authorship entities represented in the authority database; and associating the set of electronic information with one or more authorship entities. Further, the invention may include linking the at least one authorship to the one or more authorship entities based on determining an authorship similarity between the at least one authorship and the one or more authorship entities. Each authorship entity may be associated with a cluster of authorships and the method may also include adding the authorship to the authority database and associating it with at least one cluster of authorships stored in the authority database.","In keeping, with the DAIS process, the authorship entities may have been previously defined at least in part using a disambiguation process, such as described hereinbelow, and previously stored in the authority database. The set of electronic information may be received subsequent to the disambiguation and storing process with the authorship being linked to a previously defined cluster of authorships. The process may further include: receiving a manual input confirming the linking of the at least one authorship with the previously defined cluster of authorships, and\/or receiving a manual input for confirming an association of an authorship with an authorship entity. The association process may include receiving a manual input concerning associating the set of electronic information with the one or more authorship entities. An additional feature of the process may be sending an electronic communication to an email address associated with an authorship entity. For example, a researcher or other user\/author having an author profile stored on the database may have an email address also stored at the authority database, on a client side management system, or other system. The DAIS process may automatically generate and send an email to the known author (or related user\u2014e.g., publisher, editor) to confirm or verify authorship information. This may include confirming a set of publications (related authorships) that form a cluster around the unique author identifier associated with that known author. The electronic communication may include a link to enable inputting of a signal confirming an association of an authorship with an authorship entity stored in the authority database. The electronic communication may indicate a potential match of an authorship with an authorship entity stored in the authority database. The process may also include storing the set of electronic information in the authority database; receiving a query related to the one or more authorship entities; presenting authorship data in response to the query; receiving a signal confirming author entity data stored at the authority database. In this manner the DAIS system may maintain an author profile record associated with a unique author identifier and a cluster of authorships associated with the author identifier.","The invention may also include: providing a secure account for electronically accessing data associated with a unique author identifier; upon secure account access, presenting author entity data associated with the unique author identifier stored at the authority database in response to receiving a request for information; linking at least one additional authorship to an existing cluster of authorships associated with the unique author identifier in response to a received input associated with the unique author identifier; and storing data representing the linking in an authority database of authors. In keeping with the invention, the authority database of authors may include a plurality of unique author entity records each associated with a unique actual author and a cluster.","In another embodiment the invention provides a computer-implemented method comprising: presenting data representing a set of publications to a user; providing a user interface for allowing a user to input a selection related to authorship of one or more of the set of publications; and updating an authority database to reflect an association of a unique author with the selection related to authorship of one or more of the set of publications. The invention may further include: prior to updating the authority database, verifying the association of the unique author with the selected one or more of the set of publications based at least in part on an authorship similarity between data associated with the unique author and a set of one or more authorship entities; receiving a query from a user and presenting the data representing a set of publications in response to the query; generating an electronic message addressed to an electronic mail address associated with the unique author. The invention may further include presenting a notice of a possible erroneous match of a unique author with at least one authorship and, based on a response to the notice, doing one of associating and disassociating the unique author from at least one of an authorship, a cluster, or an author entity. The invention may be further characterized as follows: wherein prior to presenting, disambiguating authorship data related to the set of publications; wherein disambiguating includes scoring an authorship similarity attribute; wherein the scored authorship similarity attribute is based at least in part on co-authorship data comprising the number of authorships associated with publications, wherein as the number of co-authorships increases, the degree of similarity associated with the co-authorship data decreases; wherein disambiguating comprises processing at least one of the following elements: email address; co-author data; address data; paper title; cited reference author name; cited by paper; cited by author name; keywords; Publication Discipline Code; co-citation; bibliographic coupling; self cite; and author name initial data.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a computer-based system comprising: a computer adapted to process a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications, each publication in the set of publications comprising at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship; software executing on the computer and adapted to: receive a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications; compare at least a portion of the set of electronic information with authorship data contained in an authority database, the authorship data related to authorship entities represented in the authority database; and associate the set of electronic information with one or more authorship entities. The invention may include software further adapted to: link the at least one authorship to the one or more authorship entities based on determining an authorship similarity between the at least one authorship and the one or more authorship entities.","In yet a further embodiment, the invention provides a computer implemented method for maintaining an authority database of authors, the method comprising: receiving from a user data representing a user-defined set of publications each having at least one authorship and related to a unique author; recognizing the received data as being associated with a researcher identifier; using an authority database, verifying the received data to render a threshold confirmation of correctness in association of the set of publications with the unique author; doing one or the other of 1) matching the unique author with an existing unique author profile record stored by the authority database; or 2) creating a new unique author profile record and storing the new unique author profile record by the authority database. The invention may be further characterized as follows: wherein the existing unique author profile record includes a cluster of a set of authorships of a set of publications attributed to a unique author represented by the unique author profile record; wherein the unique author profile record resulted from: receiving publications, each publication containing at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship; and disambiguating the received publications by comparing the at least one cited references with data associated with the authority database of authors to determine an authorship similarity between publication authorships; wherein disambiguating includes: scoring an authorship similarity; and linking authorships based on the determined authorship similarity and clustering two or more linked authorships to form a first cluster and forming a first author entity associated with the first cluster; wherein disambiguating includes: matching the first author entity with a first actual author, the first cluster of authorships being attributable to the first actual author, and repeating the clustering step to form a plurality of clusters respectively associated with a plurality of unique author entities; and incorporating into the authority database of authors the plurality of unique author entities each associated with a unique actual author and a cluster.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a computer-based system comprising: a computer adapted to process a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications, each publication in the set of publications comprising at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship; software executing on the computer and adapted to: receive from a user data representing a user-defined set of publications each having at least one authorship and related to a unique author; recognize the received data as being associated with a researcher identifier; accessing an authority database and verifying the received data to render a threshold confirmation of correctness in association of the set of publications with the unique author; process the received data to do one or the other of 1) match the unique author with an existing unique author profile record stored by the authority database; or 2) create a new unique author profile record and storing the new unique author profile record by the authority database. The invention may be further characterized as follows: wherein the existing unique author profile record includes a cluster of a set of authorships of a set of publications attributed to a unique author represented by the unique author profile record; wherein the unique author profile record resulted from: receiving publications, each publication containing at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship; and disambiguating the received publications by comparing the at least one cited references with data associated with the authority database of authors to determine an authorship similarity between publication authorships; wherein disambiguating includes: scoring an authorship similarity; and linking authorships based on the determined authorship similarity and clustering two or more linked authorships to form a first cluster and forming a first author entity associated with the first cluster; wherein disambiguating includes: matching the first author entity with a first actual author, the first cluster of authorships being attributable to the first actual author, and repeating the clustering step to form a plurality of clusters respectively associated with a plurality of unique author entities; and incorporating into the authority database of authors the plurality of unique author entities each associated with a unique actual author and a cluster.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a content management system in communication with one or more publications databases, each comprising a plurality of publications, and with a plurality of remote users, the content management system comprising: a disambiguation computer; a disambiguation database; an authorship similarity routine; and a clustering routine. The disambiguation database is operatively connected to the disambiguation computer and adapted to receive and store for processing by the disambiguation computer at least a first set of information derived from one or more publications databases, the first set of information including data elements derived from a plurality of publications having one or more authorships. The authorship similarity routine executes on the disambiguation computer and processes at least some of the first set of electronic information based on select data elements to compare the select data elements to determine a degree of authorship similarity, the select data elements comprising at least one of the following elements: email address; co-citation; bibliographic coupling; self cite; and co-author. The linking routine executes on the disambiguation computer and links authorships based on the degree of authorship similarity. The clustering routine executes on the disambiguation computer to cluster two or more linked authorships to form a first cluster and adapted to form a first author entity associated with the first cluster, whereby the clustering routine is executed to produce an authority database of authors operatively stored on the disambiguation database and comprised of a plurality of unique author entities each associated with a unique actual author and a cluster. A plurality of remote users may each access the authority database of authors using a client-based computer and submit queries against the authority database of authors, whereby the query terms are processed and the client is presented with disambiguated data.

Items in such bibliographies may be referred to as \u201creference items\u201d. Some reference items may be items captured as a source item but not necessarily. To get data to build the DAIS database, the description refers to the WoS database and the techniques described herein support the WoS service. However, this is only exemplary and intended to help illustrate the invention and is not meant to be limiting.","The field \u201cut\u201d is an unique identifier for source items. This field is not only used by the WoS database but other of our databases as well. On the other hand \u201crecord id\u201d (in any of the variant forms listed herein) is a reference to the WoS database. WoS takes the union of the set of all source items and the set of all reference items and gives each of these unique items an identifier called record id.","With reference to , a basic dendrogram  is provided showing a clustering of items. Items A , B  and C , are papers, writing or other such publications. Associated with Item A  are three authorships A , A , and A  representing the contributions of three co-authors of the work Item A. Associated with Item B  are two authorships B  and B  representing the contributions of two co-authors of the work Item B. Associated with Item C  are two authorships C  and C  representing the contributions of two co-authors of the work Item C. The lines connecting the authorships to the items A, B and C represent some form of relational link or connection tying the informational objects together. Additionally, relational link  connects Item A with Item B and relational link  connects Item B with Item C. Relational link  connects Item A with Item C, however even without this direct link Item A may be considered linked to Item C by result of the two Items having a common intermediate connection or indirect connection by way of their respective links  and  to Item B. For instance, based on a predetermined threshold of relatedness, link  may be insufficient to independently establish a link between A and C. In addition to or independently of author name data, the threshold is based on a series of factors, such as one or more of the following:\n\n","In a preferred embodiment, the threshold to establishing a link and therefore a cluster is based on one or more of items Item D  is shown connected to Item A  by a dashed line that represents a quasi-link . A quasi-link represents some relatedness but perhaps not based on the techniques of the present invention as-described herein. Quasi-link  may represent a link established by a known technique, such as Bayesian rules or existing author lists, to independently establish a link between items once the inventive process has determined no link exists or that an insufficient relatedness exists to fully establish a link. This technique may also be applied where the inventive technique has established a relatedness between objects but the relatedness falls below or within a predetermined range of a target threshold. Known techniques may also be applied to confirm or otherwise links established using the techniques discussed in detail below.","As used herein the following terms shall have the following meanings. \u201cDAIS\u201d stands for \u201cDistinct Author Identification System\u201d and is a computerized system for disambiguating a database of informational objects, including papers and other writings, authors, authorships, citations, etc. \u201cAuthor Entity\u201d, the DAIS system creates a unique code to uniquely identify a disambiguated author entity identified by a cluster, also called a \u201ccluster entity.\u201d The term \u201cauthor\u201d is used herein to refer to an actual person having a writing credit to one or more papers or items. The DAIS creates an association between an author and a unique code uniquely identifying a disambiguated author or cluster entity. \u201cAuthorship\u201d is a writing credit, an association between an author and a paper, or an instance of an author writing or contribution to a an item, a paper, an article or other publication and where there are more than one person contributing to a work there are \u201cmultiple authorships.\u201d A given paper or item may have zero or many authorships. \u201cInformational object\u201d refers broadly to any object, such an item, an author, an author entity, or an authorship, that contains or represents information useful to the operation of the DAIS and its processes. \u201cSimilarity\u201d is a term that may be used to refer to the degree of relatedness between two items or between an author or author entity and an item where if sufficiently similar the DAIS may establish a link between informational objects. \u201cClusters\u201d are groupings of linked objects and a cluster once formed may be associated with a unique code or identification number and may represent an author entity or cluster entity. \u201cSub-clusters\u201d are tightly grouped objects within a cluster that may have stronger relatedness than other objects included in the cluster to which it is a part. \u201cBreak Clusters\u201d this refers to the disassociation of items or objects in a cluster or otherwise linked based on some data that refutes the link previously established or prevents a link from being established. \u201cClustering\u201d process or operation to \u201cscore\u201d objects and to link sufficiently similar objects; determining how similar objects are by \u201cscoring\u201d or determining some degree of similarity. \u201cThreshold\u201d is an assigned or determined level on which some further action is based or preconditioned, such as level of relatedness or similarity score that may be required before linking and clustering can occur to form author entity. The threshold may be adjustable, e.g., a \u201cslider\u201d or \u201csliding window\u201d, to make the DAIS process more or less inclusive in forming clusters and assigning unique codes to clusters of objects, i.e., determining sufficient relatedness and distinctness to firm a unique entity.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a Distinct Author Identification System (\u201cDAIS\u201d) for disambiguating data to discern author entities and link or associate authorships with such author entities. The disambiguation processes described herein are applied across one or more databases. Each or some of the databases to be disambiguated may comprise, for example, over a hundred years of scientific papers and other items. Applying the DAIS processes on such databases yield a disambiguated database \u201cDD.\u201d In one manner, the DD may represent a database comprising one or more of tables representing associations between authors, author\/cluster entities, papers and other items, and other related data. The data and tables contained in the DD may be used in conjunction with the original databases from which information was used in the disambiguation process but are maintained separate from the DAIS system. In this example, the papers or items contained in the database to be disambiguated include only last name and initials related to authors. Partial name data is not fully reliable and used alone across an entire database would lead to errors. For example, \u201cDOE JD\u201d could represent either of actual authors John David Doe or James Donald Doe or Jane Diane Doe. But even full names are not unique as multiple authors may have the same last name, same first name and\/or same middle initial or name. One purpose of DAIS is to disambiguate author names to the extent that a useful authoritative author database may be established for operational use. It is not necessary, and may be defeating, to have the DAIS render a 100% error free author database. It is desirous to make as many links as reasonable with a tension between accuracy and effectively clustering and linking data together to provide a useful research tool.","In this embodiment, no existing authority database of authors with identifying biographical information is used. Instead, the DAIS is used to group the authorships to represent particular authors, e.g., John David Doe. The DAIS can also be used to determine how many different \u201cJohn David Does\u201d or \u201cJD Does\u201d there are, be it zero, one or many. The DAIS processes are used in an \u201cinitial evaluation.\u201d Because there is no authority database of authors, the entire database is processed by the DAIS to group\/link authorships and to identify author entities. The author entities may then be matched or associated with actual authors. In this manner, the initial evaluation may be used to establish an authority database of authors.","Once the initial evaluation is done, additions to the DD or related databases must be handled going forward. This process amounts to matching new authorships to known authors from the authority database of authors previously established by the initial evaluation. For instance, in the initial evaluation the DAIS may save the key distinguishing data elements that established the links, clusters and authority database. These key elements may be used to do subsequent matching. Also, for those authors who first publish after the initial evaluation process, and because any ongoing evaluation process may not be as thorough as the initial evaluation, it may be desired to update the DD. Yet another option is reevaluation by applying the DAIS techniques on all or a subset of the DD or other database. In one manner, reevaluation involves redoing the initial evaluation on a per-author-name basis as needed, e.g., based on the number of author names added or on the relative frequency of a name or how common the name it.","In one embodiment of the invention, a computer-implemented method includes the steps of: receiving a set of electronic information (e.g., authorship, co-authorship, bibliographic data, title, etc.) associated with a set of publications (e.g., articles, papers, etc.). For instance, once an authority database is established, the system may process further \u201cnew\u201d or additional documents to supplement the information stored in the authority database. Each publication in the set of publications includes at least one cited reference and has at least one authorship. The method compares at least a portion of the set of electronic information with authorship data contained in an authority database. The authorship data relates to authorship entities represented in the authority database. The set of electronic information is associated with one or more authorship entities. Further, the invention may include linking the at least one authorship to the one or more authorship entities based on determining an authorship similarity between the at least one authorship and the one or more authorship entities. Each authorship entity may be associated with a cluster of authorships and the method may also include adding the authorship to the authority database and associating it with at least one cluster of authorships stored in the authority database.","In keeping with the DAIS process, the authorship entities may have been previously defined at least in part using a disambiguation process, such as previously described hereinabove, and previously stored in the authority database. The set of electronic information may be received subsequent to the disambiguation and storing process with the authorship being linked to a previously defined cluster of authorships. The process may further include: receiving a manual input confirming the linking of the at least one authorship with the previously defined cluster of authorships, and\/or receiving a manual input for confirming an association of an authorship with an authorship entity. The association process may include receiving a manual input concerning associating the set of electronic information with the one or more authorship entities. An additional feature of the process may be sending an electronic communication to an email address associated with an authorship entity. For example, a researcher or other user\/author having an author profile stored on the database may have an email address also stored at the authority database, on a client side management system, or other system. The DAIS process may automatically generate and send an email to the known author (or related user\u2014e.g., publisher, editor) to confirm or verify authorship information. This may include confirming a set of publications (related authorships) that form a cluster around the unique author identifier associated with that known author. The electronic communication may include a link to enable inputting of a signal confirming an association of an authorship with an authorship entity stored in the authority database. The electronic communication may indicate a potential match of an authorship with an authorship entity stored in the authority database. The process may also include storing the set of electronic information in the authority database; receiving a query related to the one or more authorship entities; presenting authorship data in response to the query; receiving a signal confirming author entity data stored at the authority database. In this manner the DAIS system may maintain an author profile record associated with a unique author identifier and a cluster of authorships associated with the unique author identifier.","The invention may also provide a secure account for electronically accessing data associated with a unique author identifier. Upon secure account access, an authorized user is presented author entity data associated with the unique author identifier stored at the authority database. This may be in response to receiving a request for information. The system may link at least one additional authorship (or publication) to an existing cluster of authorships associated with the unique author identifier in response to a received input associated with the unique author identifier. The system then stores data representing the linking in an authority database of authors. The authority database of authors may include a plurality of unique author entity records each associated with a unique actual author and a cluster.","In another embodiment of the invention, a computer-implemented method includes: presenting data representing a set of publications to a user; providing a user interface for allowing a user to input a selection related to authorship of one or more of the set of publications; and updating an authority database to reflect an association of a unique author with the selection related to authorship of one or more of the set of publications. The invention may further include the steps of: prior to updating the authority database, verifying the association of the unique author with the selected one or more of the set of publications based at least in part on an authorship similarity between data associated with the unique author and a set of one or more authorship entities; receiving a query from a user and presenting the data representing a set of publications in response to the query; generating an electronic message addressed to an electronic mail address associated with the unique author. The invention may further include presenting a notice of a possible erroneous match of a unique author with at least one authorship and, based on a response to the notice, doing one of associating and disassociating the unique author from at least one of an authorship, a cluster, or an author entity. Further, prior to presenting the system may disambiguate authorship data related to the set of publications. The disambiguating process may include scoring an authorship similarity attribute. The scored authorship similarity attribute may be based at least in part on co-authorship data comprise the number of authorships associated with publications. As the number of co-authorships increases, the degree of similarity associated with the co-authorship data decreases. The disambiguating process may include processing at least one of the following elements: email address; co-author data; address data; paper title; cited reference author name; cited by paper; cited by author name; keywords; Publication Discipline Code; co-citation; bibliographic coupling; self cite; and additional author name initial data.","In one manner of operation, a computer is adapted to process a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications, each publication in the set of publications comprising at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship. Software executing on the computer is adapted to: receive a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications; compare at least a portion of the set of electronic information with authorship data contained in an authority database, the authorship data related to authorship entities represented in the authority database; and associate the set of electronic information with one or more authorship entities. The software may include code adapted to: link the at least one authorship to the one or more authorship entities based on determining an authorship similarity between the at least one authorship and the one or more authorship entities.","In yet a further embodiment, a computer implemented method is used for maintaining an authority database of authors. This method includes: receiving from a user data representing a user-defined set of publications each having at least one authorship and related to a unique author; recognizing the received data as being associated with a researcher identifier; using an authority database, verifying the received data to render a threshold confirmation of correctness in association of the set of publications with the unique author; doing one or the other of 1) matching the unique author with an existing unique author profile record stored by the authority database; or 2) creating a new unique author profile record and storing the new unique author profile record by the authority database. The existing unique author profile record may include a cluster of a set of authorships of a set of publications attributed to a unique author represented by the unique author profile record. The unique author profile record may result from disambiguating processes described elsewhere herein.","In one manner of operation, authorship clusters may be formed manually outside of the DAIS process and manually input into the DAIS system. Verification processes may be performed on such manual inputs to maintain integrity of the authority database. New author entities and\/or authorships and\/or publications may be compared and matched against data existing in the authority database. Upon acceptable confirmation of correctness and integrity, the database may be updated with the additional information. A separate system, such as WoK, WoS, RSS feeds. A research alert system may feed or send lists of publications to the DAIS and allow a user (e.g., an author) authorized to access the system to \u201cclaim\u201d a publication as being authored or co-authored by that individual. Such systems may have users with associated Researcher identifiers or the like. The DAIS may recognize and match up the researcher ID information with author identifiers or profiles stored in the authority database. This may provide an enhanced degree of legitimacy or validity to the information submitted to the DAIS.","An API (Application Programming Interface) may be used to integrate or interface outside systems with the DAIS. Client systems may be entitled to use an API to build a layer around the client user access of the DAIS and authority database and may enable closed system use (e.g., a publisher). A module may integrate a client defined submission and peer review process and provide an enhanced author profile. The API may enable services to allow clients to have their data disambiguated for use in a closed system.","In another embodiment of the invention, a computer processes a set of electronic information associated with a set of publications, each publication in the set of publications comprising at least one cited reference and having at least one authorship. Software executing on the computer includes code sets adapted to: receive from a user data representing a user-defined set of publications each having at least one authorship and related to a unique author; recognize the received data as being associated with a researcher identifier; accessing an authority database and verifying the received data to render a threshold confirmation of correctness in association of the set of publications with the unique author; process the received data to do one or the other of 1) match the unique author with an existing unique author profile record stored by the authority database; or 2) create a new unique author profile record and storing the new unique author profile record by the authority database.","In the process of identifying authors and grouping\/linking authorships, the DAIS in this embodiment uses \u201chierarchical clustering\u201d as the methodology of both linking authorships and thereby identifying authors. Establishing links between authorships is based on authorship similarity. Using whatever data we have that's associated with the authorship or with the authorship's paper, the DAIS evaluates the likelihood that authorships are from the same author. For the great majority of data, only last name and initials are captured and available. A relatively high degree of reliably is attributable to the known last name and first initial. In this scenario, the universe of authorships available for clustering must first have the same last name and first initial.","In this first embodiment, the DAIS uses single-link clustering and a high \u201cthreshold\u201d level of authorship similarity is required to make a link. Additional techniques available for use by the DAIS include one or more of the following four step process. Step 1, first form clusters using single-link clustering technique based on authorship similarity. Next, Step 2, \u201cbreaking\u201d apart clusters by, for example, examining large clusters for instances where cohesive, tightly linked \u201csub-clusters\u201d are weakly connected to a larger cluster and breaking the weak connection link to break out the sub-cluster into a separate cluster. Next, Step 3, \u201ccombining\u201d clusters using, for example, another hierarchical clustering variation and determine if any multi-authorship clusters can me merged into a larger untied, single cluster. Since each cluster has multiple authorships an accumulative weight can be determined and evaluated. With this technique, no single link (between authorships presently in different clusters) needs to reach the high level requirement of the single-link process of Step 1. Step 4, single authorship \u201ccluster cleanup\u201d may be used involving an accumulative point clustering to determine if any loose \u201csingle authorship\u201d clusters can be combined with any multi-authorship clusters or other single authorship clusters. Like Step 3, Step 4 can accumulate weight and not require a high similarity or match level as in the single-link of Step 1.","Authorship similarity starts with identifying data elements that are highly reliable in accurately determining an association or link between authorships and author entities. The following elements provide, to varying degrees, reliable data points which may be used to \u201cscore\u201d the similarity between various authorships so as to cluster together such authorships to form author clusters and entities which may then be associated with actual authors to establish an authority database of authors. The elements include: 1) address elements (address elements are preferably associated with the paper rather than with individual authors or authorships and include organization (institution), sub-organization (such as department name) and city); 2) co-author names; 3) cited reference papers; 4) cited reference author names' 5) cited by papers; 6) cited by author names' 7) self-cite; 8) email address; 9) keywords (author keywords and keywords plus); 10) Publication Discipline Codes; and 11) additional author initials.","In one preferred embodiment, the list of elements was limited to co-author names, cited reference author names, cited by author names, and email address. Limiting the elements reduces the processing effort required of the DAIS. However, care must be given to consider the nature of the database(s) undergoing the disambiguation process to ensure highly effective and reliable results are achieved.","In addition, the DAIS may further process the results for co-author names, cited author names and cited by author names by further considering how relatively common or unique names are. For example J. Smith is a common name and the DAIS may be adapted to discount the significance, weight or level of distinctiveness attributed to this name. Another optional function is for the DAIS to consider whether a paper has many co-authors or cited authors and to attribute a weighting of association based in part on this data. Moreover, these factors may be considered together through logarithmic expressions that use experimentally produced or otherwise assigned weight factors.","Another option to the DAIS or operational DD is to receive and refine the database based on customer or author feedback. For instance, authors or other users can inform a party maintaining the DD when authorships are or are not given proper attribution by the database. The independently input or received author data, preferably once verified in some manner, may then be added to the DD and any errors may be corrected, including breaking or combining of clusters\/author entities. This information may be captured and treated like other data elements in the database.","Additional techniques, such as Bayesian techniques, may supplement the DAIS processes described herein to combine the individual probabilities of separate elements to obtain a combined score. By doing this the list of elements used may be expanded. Elements not strong enough by themselves to establish a link or association may be strong enough in combination with other elements to establish a link.","Now with reference to , the relational link between Item A and Item B, for instance, may be that authorship A has associated with it the author name \u201cSmith, J\u201d and authorship B may have associated with it the common name data \u201cSmith, J.\u201d This seemingly similar author name data may be a part of and help support a link . between Items A and B. However, this incomplete name data in isolation provides a relatively weak link. For instance, if authorship A is actually a result of the contribution of actual author \u201cJane Francis Smith\u201d and if authorship B is a result of contribution by actual author \u201cJeremy Charles Smith\u201d then the link  is a false link, at least with respect to author entities or codes unique to the two authors. If on the other hand authorship A has associated with it an email address jsmith@abc.org and authorship B has associated with it an email address jsmith@abc.org, then there is a much higher degree and much more unique relationship between the two Items A and B and link  is much stronger. One aspect of the present invention is that rather than focus on incomplete name data associated with items, the processes focus on more reliable and more unique information to identify, establish and construct clusters to form author entities. Another instance is the manner in which certain information is linked. For instance, rather than associate company or university data with the author, a stronger and more reliable link is between the university and the paper, e.g., J. Smith, Univ. of Alabama\u2014the paper was co-authored by a J. Smith at the Univ. of Alabama, but there might be several J. Smith's at that university.","In addition, even if the link  is relatively weak and insufficient to reliably tie Item A with Item C, the intermediate links between Items A and C with Item B may be such that that alone or in combination with the data separately linking Items A and C is sufficient to establish a link between A and C.","With reference to , authorships A , B  and C  are linked together via links ,  and  to form cluster . Authorships D , E  and F  are inked together to form cluster . Authorships G , H  and I  are linked together to form cluster  Clusters , , and  are formed using the inventive techniques discussed herein and for each cluster thresholds of relatedness are sufficiently high to establish the links that form the clusters.","Authorship A  of cluster  has two associations or links  and \u2032 with authorship D  of cluster . Without either of these links, the two clusters  and  remain independent of one another. Link  may be sufficient to establish a link between the two clusters to form a unified cluster made up of two sub-clusters  and . For instance, if threshold level X  is the level used to determine linking, then link  is sufficient to link the two clusters. If threshold X  is not sufficient or is merely an intermediate threshold requiring further relatedness linking the two clusters, then more processing is required. A second relatedness link \u2032 may represent a higher degree of similarity or relatedness and may exceed a second threshold level Y  so as to establish a link between clusters  and  to join them into a larger cluster. In a similar manner, links  and \u2032 may establish links between clusters  and  so as to join those two clusters into a unified cluster. Based on one or more of the links , \u2032, , \u2032, a larger unified cluster may be formed that includes sub-clusters ,  and . In this manner, the linking techniques more fully described below may be applied across one or more databases of items and informational objects to form author entities for further use.","In the clustering process, the system may look to the number of matched common Co-authors, the number of co-authorships in a paper where the fewer number of co-authors there are the higher the value or scoring as compared to a high number of co-authors, and may consider the co-author name. For instance, a score or value of a common name, e.g., \u201cSmith\u201d, is lower than the value assigned to an uncommon name, e.g., \u201cKoylouski.\u201d The score or factor associated with a given name may be based on the frequency of occurrence of the name in a database or based on an outside source or reference. The \u201cweighted factors\u201d and the results may be \u201cmultiplied\u201d based on the number of co-authors\/authorships, e.g., X1lnA.times.X2lnB.times.X3lnC, where X1, x2, and X3 are weighted factors associated with term\/name frequency. Given that a goal is to associate as many papers with authors as practical while maintaining accuracy, weighted factors may be set (or may be dynamic) to maximize number of links\/clusters while maintaining sufficient degree of accuracy and data integrity. Factor may be set based on desired purposes, for example if database search or records are not allowed to have incorrect links\/associations, then required level of probability is set at high probability statement, e.g., 100% certain valid link\/match.","As an optional feature, the DAIS may incorporate an Automated Author Feedback mechanism. For instance, the DAIS or system operable with the DAIS may present an author with notice that one or more papers have been linked to a cluster identified with the author, i.e., the unique cluster code or author entity code is assigned to or associated with this particular author, and give the author an opportunity to confirm that the papers are his works or are not his works and to accept\/reject the link. This \u201cfeedback\u201d may be used to correct erroneous links\/associations and confirm determined links.","Another optional feature that may be incorporated into an implementation of the invention is permit for new authors\/data input after clustering or a re-evaluation after an initial clustering. After running the disambiguation process on the database of information, the system renders a known set of author entities and can place the resulting author\/cluster codes in a table and associate the codes with known authors. In this manner an author dictionary or look up is provided and new authors may be detected as new items are loaded into the database. The system may build out a \u201cdictionary of author's\/author entities\/clusters\u201d for further use or reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIGS. 5-6"],"b":"300"},"With reference to , one exemplary embodiment of a Content Management System (CMS), referenced generally with reference number , includes a \u201cDistinct Author Identification System\u201d (DAIS) , also referred to as an Author Disambiguation System, a source of information , e.g., databases ,  and , software and processor driven user productivity suite , a plurality of remote users or clients  and various communications links. CMS users often want to search for, identify and access items, such as papers and other publications, by certain attributes associated with those items. For instance if a user searches using a certain author name often they only have the author's last name and perhaps first and middle initials. This abbreviated and non-unique author information does not uniquely identify the author from the universe of author names being searched. The purpose of DAIS  is to disambiguate records stored in stores  to, among other things, identify distinct authors; assign author identifiers (ids) to them; and tag their authorships with their author ids to facilitate such searching by users .","In this exemplary embodiment of , the stores available for searching include the WoS Database , the WoK Database  and a general reference to other databases of interest , such as OPAC and PubMed databases. The DAIS  communicates with stores  via a communications link  and captures and uses for disambiguation processes instances of all or portions of such databases. The DAIS  applies the DAIS rules and processes, referenced generally by reference number , against the records stored in such databases to arrive at accurate relational links and clusters of links to properly associate with author entities.","For purposes of explaining the overall process and not by way of limitation to the invention, the WoS DB , for example, is an XML database that spans a range of years of data, including scientific papers and citations associated therewith. The WoS DB instance used by DAIS  is separate from the WoS DB , which may be used by WoS customers and which is kept for independent and unaltered research, testing or various special processing. There are two principal unit records in this database. They are <item> (source item) and <ref> (reference item).","Once the DAIS  has applied its processes  against and across the database instances from sources , it may load onto such databases , , and  the disambiguated records and data as a way to improve the integrity of the information stored in such databases and for subsequent use by users. For instance, users, such as remote users  and others, may invoke productivity solutions, such as Thomson Scientific's Research Soft suite, in carrying out the business of science and research and in authoring works associated with those efforts. Such productivity tools may be used by administrators, such as faculty and university administration, in conducting the business of the institutions, for example in reviewing the work of faculty up for tenure and under review. Researchers may keep a personal reference collection  of works of their own, of works relied on and referenced in their works, and of works of interest in their particular fields of study.","With reference to , another embodiment of a Content Management System (CMS)  includes a \u201cDistinct Author identification System\u201d (DAIS) comprised of numerous elements as discussed further below.

The WoS DB instance  used by the DAIS is separate from the WoS DB from which it was derived and as used by WoS customers, which is kept for independent and unaltered research, testing or various special processing. WoS, or other databases, may be updated from time to time in whole or in part using the disambiguation techniques described herein.","In this database example, there are two principal unit records in this database.

The distinguishing file number \u201c2005000050\u201d may be, for example, composed of a year and sequence number. Corrections are not made directly to the XML. A new version of the bad data (item or ref) is written to the latest segment and the old version simply is no longer used. When reading sequentially through a segment there is no way to know which records are no longer used. \u201cDatamap\u201d files are used so that datamap records point to valid data records. In this example, datamap records are 32 bytes consisting of eight four-byte unsigned binary numbers and the following are used for illustrative purposes:","recid\u2014record identifier for data","item file number\u2014file extension number having item data","item offset\u2014byte offset of the item data record","item length\u2014number of bytes in the item data record","ref file number\u2014file extension number having ref data","ref offset\u2014byte offset of the ref data record","ref length\u2014number of bytes in the ref data record","filler\u2014ignore the number","With reference to , DAIS is represented as a multi-step, integrated process involving multiple databases and processing modules.

The section below identified as \u201cDAIS Cluster Authorships\u201d describes this process in detail.","After Author disambiguation, clustering and finalizing and loading the CMS database with disambiguated data, from time to time and upon certain events it may be desired to process new records or data or segments or portions of the database for additional linking. The New Data Processing module  operates as follows. A program \u201cDAIS010\u201d runs post load and processes newly loaded source item authorships, for example. For each authorship, \u201cLast Name+1.sup.st initial\u201d plus each data element (co-authors, cited authors, citing authors and email address) are used in performing lookups to the Author_Data table. If no rows match any of these lookups, then no author id is assigned to the authorship. If at least one lookup returns a row, and all returned rows for this authorship have the same author id value, then use that author id to insert a row into the author id table. If returned rows for the same authorship have different author id values, then no author id is assigned to the authorship. The disambiguated data may also include hyperlink data to associate authorships or author entities, for example, with electronic publications records contained on publications databases.","In the Extraction process , the system extracts from Datafact  to a tagged data file. In this case Author Id is a new field and a new two-character code needs to be assigned to it and the extraction program(s) to extract this field need to be modified accordingly.","Periodically or upon an event, the CMS  may invoke a Reevaluation process , which operates as follows. Reevaluation is the re-processing of an author name \u201clast name+1.sup.st Initial\u201d. For example, Smith, J. and especially for common last names since it is more likely that a larger number of publications and associated records will be added to the database under common author names. In one manner, the Urgency column in the Author_Id_Reevaluation table will determine which author names need to be reevaluated. A triggering event could be a threshold number of papers added to the database with a particular author last name or name sequence. A simplified linking process, such as a Bayesian method, may be used to match new papers and data elements to existing clusters. Reevaluation process  may be performed when author entities not appearing on the author table are added to the database.","Up to this point, the decisions of the DAIS system have been mostly automatic with little manual intervention. But in the case of highly cited author lists with known papers these authors authored, it is likely that once customers start seeing DAIS results they will want to make manual corrections. There are numerous ways to accomplish manual input to edit or add data elements and this is not essential to the invention. One exemplary way to provide manual input  is to tag authorships with \u201cmanual pseudo author ids\u201d. These ids are separate from the real author ids which are automatically derived. When author names undergo reevaluation these \u201cmanual pseudo author ids\u201d may be treated as a 100% reliable data element\u2014like email address. So author ids will still be automatically derived but they will use manual input information in making the decision. The DAIS could also tag authorships with, for example, \u201c-M1234\u201d which means that this authorship is not from the author identified by the manual pseudo author id \u201cM1234\u201d.","For instance, authors may recognize that not all of their works of authorship are attributed to them or are divided among more than one cluster or author entity by the DAIS and then as presented by and through the WoS or other database. The author may issues a signal, such as by acting on links or buttons provided via a browser, to the CMS or other system. The CMS then receives the request from the author or perhaps a reviewer or administrator indicating that an author is associated with more than one cluster. In this process, the CMS or other system may send to the author or to an administrator a request signal requesting a set of information. The CMS may then receive a response to the request signal and based on the response take some appropriate action. For instance the CMS may associate the response with the author such that the author becomes associated with a single cluster or some reference is then associated with the author's cluster\/author identifier or code.","In carrying out the various processes described above, the following routines may be employed. The following are essentially descriptions of things that are described above. They may be referred to from multiple places in the specification. Inclusion here does not mean that library functions exist for doing these, nor is it intended to suggest that such functions are required, but they could be used.","The \u201cIsolate Last Name and Initials\u201d routine assumes starting with an author's name in a particular format, e.g., ISI format, that may or may not involve truncation.

If the last name is longer than 15 characters, only use the first 15. If it's a corporate name then use \u201c1\u201d as the \u201cLast Name Frequency\u201d otherwise use the Last Name to do a lookup in the DB2 table Lname_Freq_Dict described above.

Because one or both of these two authorships may have already been linked with other authorships, the DAIS009 looks beyond just these two authorships and makes a complete pass through both arrays checking their \u201cAuthor Index\u201d values. Upon seeing the value \u201cLarger Author Index,\u201d it is replaced it with the value \u201cSmaller Author Index\u201d.","Within the Pre Authorship Pair Block  is Buffer Link process  is used as follows. Although they passed the rules, it has not yet been decided if the two authorships of the current Authorship Pair Block are from the same author because their initials are not identical. The decision will be based on whether or not the link will cause authorships with conflicting initials to be grouped in the same cluster. This cannot be determined until the clustering is complete. So the current pair or \u201clink\u201d must be buffered in the Initial Mismatch Array until clustering is done. All of the fields come from the Data Matches File record except Bad Link. In this exemplary configuration, Bad Link should always be given the value 0.","Within the Pre Authorship Pair Block  is Flush Author Element Array process  is used as follows. The information for the current Authorship Pair Block was insufficient to make the conclusion that the two authorships are from the same author. For this reason we must flush that information from the Author Element Array. In process 5.2 just before we started processing the information for this Authorship Pair Block the DAIS009 program noted the index of the last entry in the Author Element Array. It now must set it back to that point so that all entries added since then will be ignored. After completing the Per Authorship Pair Block process , the Per Process Block process  includes a Tag Bad Links process , which is referenced in  generally by the reference number  and is more particularly described in . Tag Bad Links process \/ includes the following sub-processes.","The Load Link Bridges sub-process  makes a pass through the Initial Mismatch Array. For each entry (row) two entries are inserted into the Link Bridge Array. The first entry will have the cluster number for the 1st item and the full initials from the 2nd item. The second entry will have the cluster number for the 2nd item and the full initials from the 1st item. Both entries will have the same Link Index value. In this sub-process, the Link Index is an index or pointer to the entry of the Initial Mismatch Array from which the entry was created. The cluster number using the UT and Position to perform a lookup in the Authorship Linking Array. The Author Index is the cluster number. The full initials comes from the Initial Mismatch Array entry.","Next, the Link Bridge Array is sorted by cluster number in the Sort Link Bridges subprocess . In the Identify Bad Links sub-process , a pass is made through the sorted Link Bridge Array and each occurrence (row) is compared to all other occurrences with the same cluster number. If the initials are incompatible, the system uses the link indexes for both occurrences to go back to the Initial Mismatch Array and mark both initial mismatch occurrences as bad by setting their Bad Link flags to 1. Finally a Per Good Link sub-process  is performed to fix author indexes by making a pass through the Initial Mismatch Array by skipping over occurrences where Bad Link equals 1. The remaining good links are processed just like links where the initials were identical.","The per Process Block process  of  includes an Assign Author Ids and Write Output process , which works as follows. For every unique \u201cAuthor Index\u201d value in the Authorship Linking Array the system generates and assigns a new Author Id. The Author_Id_Control table is used to get the last author id; and one is added for each new Author_Id and the table is updated. This program runs against itself so it is important that the row is locked while it is being used and freed as soon as it has been updated. For each entry in the Authorship Linkage Array, the process  writes out a record to the Author Id File. Authorid is the newly assigned Author_Id. Authseq is Position. Use the UT and routine 6.1 to get the issueno and itemno. For each entry in the Author Element Array, the process  writes out a record to the Author Element File. The authorid is the Author_Id that was assigned the entry's \u201cAuthor Index\u201d value. For the Process Block, a single record is written to the Evaluation File. The \u201cEvaluation Auth Cnt\u201d is the total number of entries in the Authorship Linking Array. \u201cPost Eval Auth Cnt\u201d and Urgency should both be set to 0. \u201cLast Evaluation\u201d may be set to a pre-defined default value.","The following is a description of the Full Initials Compatibility routine as used herein. Initials are a string of alphabetic characters. In comparing two sets of initials, e.g., 1st Item Full Inits and 2nd Item Full Inits, DAIS009 determines that the sets of initials are compatible if the shorter character string matches the start of the longer string. If the strings are the same length then the entire strings must match. Table 35 provides examples of initial character strings with resulting compatibility results to illustrate this point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0246","num":"0260"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00038","num":"00038"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 35"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1Item Full Inits","2Item Full Inits","Compatible?"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"WA","W","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},"WA","WB","No"]},{"entry":[{},"W","WAB","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},"WA","WBA","No"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The DAIS may combine the known extraction, sorting and linking techniques or database management techniques, as described above, with the inventive clustering and linking techniques described herein to provide an improved and highly accurate research database and tools. For instance the DAIS can establish an author biography page and associated bibliography for that particular author using the invention as described herein. Each author is associated with a single cluster and cluster\/author entity code or identifier. Once DAIS has been applied across the database(s) of papers, writings, and other publication and citations, and once clustering and author identifier codes have been established, author bibliographies, for example, will include those authorships the DAIS linked or associated with each respective author. Also, papers associated with each authorship may be linked so that a researcher may easily navigate a research tool integrated with an DAIS processed research database to quickly access, such as through hypertext links, papers or other publications displayed to the user as being linked via an author bibliography or other display.","For example, the extraction sorting and linking process may include an extraction module for identifying excerpts or portions of electronic documents that contain information or data of interest, such as author name, author email address, author institution, co-author information, and other citation information. The extraction module may then parse the excerpted information to distribute the information of interest within assigned fields such as for records in a database. This information may be then used to compare the information against known information in database records or against fields in a table or against corresponding fields associated with another paper. A matching module matches extracted information with existing records such as with cluster identifier code or author identifier code. An inserting module may be used to insert hypertext links within bibliographical records or biography records or cluster identifier associated records. A loading module may be included to manage loading of bibliographical and biographical records into one or more relational databases for storage and further management and for retrieval and analysis. The matching module may include Bayesian or other linking algorithms or rules on which matches or links are based. The module, for instance, may select an author or cluster identifier code or record with a particular paper based on its excerpted information or based on citation information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0263"},"figref":["FIGS. 7 through 17","FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["524","620"]},"After launching the author name search for \u201cSmith JA\u201d, the WoK presents the user, as shown in , a screen with the results of the search.
