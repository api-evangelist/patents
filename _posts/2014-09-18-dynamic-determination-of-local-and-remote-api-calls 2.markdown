title: Dynamic determination of local and remote API calls
abstract: Some embodiments provide a system and method for dynamically determining whether to execute a function locally or remotely for an application operating on a first device. The method, while the application is operating, identifies a set of conditions the evaluation of which dynamically determines whether to (i) direct a second device to remotely process a function or (ii) locally process the function on the first device. The method evaluates the identified set of conditions on the first device. When the evaluation of the set of conditions corresponds to remote processing of the function, the method directs the second device to process the function and return a response to the first device. When the evaluation of the set of conditions corresponds to local processing of the function, the method processes the function on the first device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF BENEFIT TO PRIOR APPLICATION","REFERENCE TO COMPUTER PROGRAM LISTINGS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 62\/051,924, filed Sep. 17, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference.","This application incorporates by reference a computer program listing appendix in an ASCII text file having a title \u201c2014_09_18_SLOO_P0002_Appendices.txt\u201d, which includes an Appendix A portion, an Appendix B portion, and an Appendix C portion. The text file \u201c2014_09_18_SLOO_P0002_Appendices.txt\u201d has a size of 56347 bytes and was created on Sep. 17, 2014.","With the proliferation of mobile devices, the need for servers that can process application programming interface (API) requests from the mobile devices has never been greater. There is also a need for robust frameworks that allow developers create programs for processing such API requests on clients and on the server. Ideally, this framework would make the processing of such requests on a client or on a server seamless.","Some embodiments provide a method for dynamically determining whether to execute functions of an application (e.g., application programming interface (API) requests) on either a client device (e.g., a mobile device) or a remote server (e.g., an API server). These functions are application programming interface (API) requests in some embodiments that require the retrieval and\/or manipulation of data accessible through the API. In some embodiments, the application executes on the client device and individual functions of the application are processed either by the client device or the remote server depending on certain conditions assessed by the application at the client device.","In some embodiments, the conditions assessed in order to determine whether to process a particular function locally on the client device or remotely on the server include one or more of (1) the availability of a connection between the client device and the server (e.g., when a connection is unavailable, the client device processes the function); (2) a computational expense of processing the function on the client (e.g., the higher the computational expense of executing the function on the client, the more likely the application is to request that the server process the function); (3) a memory usage required to process the function on the client (e.g., the higher the memory usage on the client, the more likely the application is to request that the server process the function); and (4) local availability of the data required and the freshness of that local data (e.g., the more available and up to date the data cached on the client, the more likely the application is to process the function locally).","In addition to these infrastructure-related concerns (e.g., connection or hardware resource availability, data availability, etc.), the conditions assessed may be also be stored as explicitly defined rules in an object processed by the application. For instance, access control lists or other properties defined for an object may define policies that prevent operations from being performed on the client whenever possible. Such explicitly-defined conditions are also evaluated dynamically by the client device.","Both the server and the client application, in some embodiments, include particular data constructs that enable the functions to be processed either on the client device or on the server. In these embodiments, the client devices may process an API request locally by accessing the local data stores through an object (sometimes referred to as a proxy object) that resides on the client, or by directing the server to process this API request remotely. The proxy object in some embodiments is a JavaScript object that is constructed from a class description that is specified by a JavaScript file and a JSON file on the client. For instance, in some embodiments, the proxy objects on the client device are JavaScript objects when the proxy objects are part of an application that executes on top of a JavaScript engine of a browser on the client device. In such cases, the JavaScript and JSON files on the client device are identical or similar to the two corresponding files that are used to define the object on the remote server in some embodiments.","In other embodiments, the proxy object on a client device can be a non-JS object (e.g., a Java object or an objective C object). For instance, in some embodiments, the proxy objects on the client device are non-JavaScript objects when the proxy objects are part of an application that executes natively on top of the operating system (e.g., on top of an iOS or Android operating system) of the client device. For applications that run natively on top of a device's operating system, some embodiments do not distribute models that are defined by reference to JavaScript and JSON files. In some such embodiments, the client device includes an adapter that has the capability to query the server dynamically for models and then instantiates them as native object equivalent (e.g., as objective C objects in iOS and as Java objects in Android) at runtime.","In some embodiments, the function calls (API requests) on the client and server are identical and hence are referred to as isomorphic function calls (or isomorphic API calls). In some of these embodiments, the format of the API calls is exactly the same. In other embodiments, the format is somewhat different (e.g., when JavaScript objects are being executed on the server, while Java or Objective C objects are being executed on the clients). However, even in these embodiments, the function calls on the server and client can be isomorphic as the same set of parameters are passed along with the function call and returned from the API on the client and the server. In other words, when applications run natively on the client device operating system, the proxy object that is instantiated in the native environment represents and is an isomorphic equivalent of what is specified on the server.","In some embodiments, the remote server is a JavaScript API server that exposes its APIs (i.e., exposes its accessible objects through APIs) to the client device and other devices (e.g., other servers, computers, mobile devices, etc.) through non-proprietary web services. For instance, the server of some embodiments exposes its APIs through Representational State Transfer (REST) web services. Other embodiments expose the APIs through other services. The server of some embodiments also provides an adaptor that translates a function call from an application into an API endpoint exposed as HTTP.","The preceding Summary is intended to serve as a brief introduction to some embodiments as described herein. It is not meant to be an introduction or overview of all subject matter disclosed in this document. The Detailed Description that follows and the Drawings that are referred to in the Detailed Description will further describe the embodiments described in the Summary as well as other embodiments. Accordingly, to understand all the embodiments described by this document, a full review of the Summary, Detailed Description and the Drawings is needed. Moreover, the claimed subject matters are not to be limited by the illustrative details in the Summary, Detailed Description and the Drawings, but rather are to be defined by the appended claims, because the claimed subject matters can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the subject matters.","In the following detailed description of the invention, numerous details, examples, and embodiments of the invention are set forth and described. However, it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed.","Some embodiments provide a method for dynamically determining whether to execute functions of an application (e.g., application programming interface (API) requests) on either a client device (e.g., a mobile device) or a remote server (e.g., an API server).

For instance, access control lists or other properties defined for an object may define policies that prevent operations from being performed on the client whenever possible. Such explicitly-defined conditions are also evaluated dynamically by the client device.","Some embodiments of the invention provide a novel server for processing application programming interface (API) requests. In some embodiments, the API server is written in JavaScript. For examples, in some embodiments, the API-accessible objects of this server are each defined in terms of a JavaScript (JS) file and a JSON file. At runtime, a runtime processor instantiates each JavaScript object from its associated JS and JSON files. In some embodiments, a JS file and a JSON file are associated with each other through their common names.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","190","192","194","196","105","110","115","120","125","135","140","145"]},"The runtime processor  in some embodiments instantiates a JavaScript object  for each model based on the object's description that is contained in its associated JavaScript model (i.e., that is contained in the JS object's associated JS file and JSON file). The Appendix A portion of the incorporated ASCII text file computer program listing appendix provides the source code within a JS framework of some embodiments that can be used to instantiate a JS object from the description of the object in a JS file and a JSON file. Once instantiated, the JavaScript object can be used to process API requests from other devices (such as mobile devices, client computers, and other server computers). These other devices will be referred to below as client devices of the API server.","To process API calls, the JS objects of some embodiments needs to exchange data with (e.g., to read from or to write to) a variety of different backend data storages - that have a variety of different interfaces. The data storage abstractor  and the data storage connector  allow these JS objects to exchange data with the backend data storages. The data storage abstractor  provides a layer of data abstraction between the JavaScript objects and the underlying data in the backend data storages. For instance, in some embodiments, the abstractor  translates the JavaScript object definitions to the object definitions of the underlying data storages. In other embodiments, the abstractor  simply provides a set of functions that allows the JS objects to exchange data with the backend data storages. For instance, in some embodiments, the abstractor  provides create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) functions to connect the JS objects to the backend data storages. In these or other embodiments, the abstractor  can also connect to backend data storages through REST APIs, SOAP web services, and other data storage services.","The data storage abstractor , in some embodiments, is backed by the data storage connector , which implements the data exchange logic using data storage drivers or other client APIs. The JS objects also connect to backend data storages in some embodiments through a replication manager (not shown) that connects the JavaScript object to the data storage connectors and synchronizes the data between the JS object and the backend data storage. Such a replication manager is also used in some embodiments to synchronize the data between two API servers or between an API server and a client. In some embodiments, the replication manager synchronizes the data between the API server and another device (e.g., a server computer or a client device, such as a mobile device or a client computer) by synchronizing a persisted version of the IS objects that are stored on the API server and the other device.","Through the I\/O manager , the API server in some embodiments can handle a large number of concurrent sessions with a large number of devices (e.g., computers, mobile devices, etc.). For instance, in some embodiments, this manager has a non-blocking input\/output (I\/O) interface that can concurrently maintain a large number of concurrent sessions. The I\/O interface of some embodiments is a single-threaded process that does not consume too much of the system resources, which in turn, allows the server to be able to handle a large number of concurrent sessions. This I\/O manager  in some embodiments can also maintain a session with a connecting device (e.g., a connecting mobile device) for a long duration of time and without interruption. In some embodiments, the I\/O manager  can maintain a session for a long duration because it uses a web socket manager to manage the connection session.","The API handler  exposes the API server's JS objects  to the other devices (e.g., other servers , computers , and mobile devices  and ). In some embodiments, the handler  uses non-proprietary web services to expose the APIs. For instance, the handler  of some embodiments exposes the JS object APIs through REST web services. Other embodiments expose the APIs through other services.","The API server of some embodiments processes API requests from client devices (e.g., mobile devices) that have the capability to process some or all of their API requests locally.  presents a conceptual illustration of the API processing modules of one such client device. As shown, this client device  has a runtime processor  that instantiates several proxy objects  that are proxies on the client device for several JS objects that operate on the API server .","Once instantiated, a proxy object  on the client can be used to process an API request from local data storages  that reside on the client device , or by calling a corresponding JS object  that resides on the API server  so that this object  can process this request (e.g., by using backend data storages -). As further described below, the determination of whether the API request should be processed locally on the client or remotely on the server is made dynamically on the client in some embodiments. This dynamic decision is based on conditions that are dynamically assessed on the client in some embodiments.","As shown, the proxy objects  access the local data storages  through a data abstractor  and a data connector , which provide the same operations on the client device  as the data abstractor  and the data connector  provide on the server . In some embodiments, the data abstractor  and the data connector  are not used in some of the client-side environments as the objects  can pull data directly from the client's local storages without going through the data abstraction and connection layers. Also, the proxy object  accesses its corresponding JS object  on the API server through one or more modules that form a server interface . Several examples of these modules will be further described below.","In the discussion below, an object  on the client is referred to as a proxy object, as it can act on the client as a proxy of the object  on the server. As further described below, the proxy object on a client device can be a different type of object (e.g., a JS object, a Java object, or an objective C object) in some embodiments. For instance, in some embodiments, some mobile applications execute on top of a JS engine of a browser on a client device, while other mobile applications execute natively on top of the operating system of the client device. In some of these embodiments, the applications that execute on top of the browser's JS engine instantiate JS proxy objects, while the applications that run natively instantiate other types of proxy objects (e.g., Java objects or objective C objects).","In some embodiments where the proxy object is a JS object (e.g., when the proxy objects are part of an application that executes on top of a JS engine of a browser on the client device), the proxy object is constructed from a class description that is specified by a JavaScript file and a JSON file on the client. In some of these embodiments, the JS and JSON files on the client device are identical or similar to the two corresponding files that are used to define the object on the API server in some embodiments.","When the proxy object on a client device is not a JS object (e.g., it is a Java object or an objective C object that is defined to run natively on the client device's OS), some embodiments do not distribute models that are defined by reference to JS and JSON files. In some of these embodiments, the client device includes an adapter that has the capability to query the server dynamically for an object description, and then, based on the received object description, instantiate a native object (e.g., as objective C objects in iOS and as Java objects in Android) at runtime.","In some embodiments, the API calls on the client and server are identical and hence are referred to as isomorphic API calls. In some of these embodiments, the format of the API calls is exactly the same. In other embodiments, the format is somewhat different (e.g., when JavaScript objects are being executed on the server, while Java or Objective C objects are being executed on the clients). However, even in these embodiments, the APIs on the server and client can be isomorphic as the same set of parameters are passed along with the API and the same set of parameters are returned from the API on the client and the server. In other words, when applications run natively on the client device operating system, the proxy object that is instantiated in the native environment represents and is an isomorphic equivalent of what is specified on the server.","Some embodiments of the invention provide a framework for defining models by defining JS files and\/or JSON files. As mentioned above, a model can be defined by an associated pair of JS file and JSON file in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the framework pre-defines one set of functions for each object that is instantiated from each model. For instance, in some embodiments, each JS object can perform the CRUD functions.","The framework of some embodiments allows additional functions to be written in the JS file in order to augment and override the set of functions of an object that is instantiated from the JS file. These additional functions can be written as hooks (e.g., function calls that are processed before or after a baseline function) that can be processed locally (e.g., on a client device) or remotely (e.g., on the server). The processing of these function calls is quite simple given the isomorphic nature of the API calls in some embodiments. The call can be made identically on a client device irrespective of whether it is going to be processed locally or remotely. The framework can determine whether to process this call locally or remotely based on pre-defined conditions for processing the call or dynamically assessed conditions for processing the call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","310","315"]},"As shown, besides a name key , the JSON file  of some embodiments includes (1) a rich description of properties  and  that relate to data tuples stored on data storages, (2) properties  that have fix values and do not relate to any data tuples stored on data storages, (3) control logics  and  for restricting access to the data tuples, and (4) relationship attributes  that define the relationship between the JSON file's model and other models. In some embodiments, the rich property attributes  and  of the JSON file allow a data storage to be specifically identified in terms of its location, name, and attributes, and also allows one JSON file to pull values for one or more properties from two or more data storages.","In some embodiments, the control logic  and  of a JSON file include validation rules and access control list (ACL) rules. The validation rules  in some embodiments ensure that the data tuples that are gathered from one or more data storages meet a required constraint that is specified for them in the rules. For instance, a validation rule might require that \u201cCar\u201d object have an associated VIN attribute. When a retrieved Car data tuple does not have a VIN attribute, the data tuple is not accepted as a Car because it does not meet the specified constraint for a Car.","ACL rules  in some embodiments ensure that the portion of a retrieved data tuple that is presented on a device satisfies certain access control criteria. For instance, an API to a bank account object might retrieve one set of values on both a computer and a mobile device. However, while the object's ACL rule might allow all of the values to be presented on the computer, the object's ACL rule might prevent some of the data values (e.g., bank account number) from being presented on the mobile device, because mobile devices might be as being inherently less secure than computers. In some embodiments, the ACLs and validation rules are implemented as hooks (i.e., function calls) that are called before or after processing the API.","The relations attribute  of a particular object's JSON file allows one or more links to other objects to be specified when the particular object is being instantiated.","Several examples of JSON files will now be described to further elaborate on the JSON file format of some embodiments. In some embodiments, a model is named as model-name.json, where model-name is the name of the model. For example customer.json for a customer model. The customer model's JSON file may specify the following attributes,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cname\u201d: \u201cCustomer\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cbase\u201d: \u201cUser\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cidInjection\u201d: false,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cstrict\u201d: true,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201coptions\u201d: { ... },"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cproperties\u201d: { ... },"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cvalidations\u201d: [...],"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201crelations\u201d: {...},"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cacls\u201d: [...],"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cscopes\u201d: {...},"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cindexes\u201d : { ...},"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002\u201cmethods\u201d: [...]"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"210pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Attribute","Type","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["name","String","Name of the model."]},{"entry":[{},{},"Required"]},{"entry":["plural","String","Plural form of the model name."]},{"entry":[{},{},"Optional: Defaults to plural of name property using standard English"]},{"entry":[{},{},"conventions."]},{"entry":["base","String","Name of another model that this model extends.

The data source abstractor encapsulates business logic to exchange data between models and various backend systems such as relational databases. REST APIs, SOAP web services, storage services, etc. Data source abstractors, in some embodiments, provide CRUD functions for backend data storages. As mentioned above, the data source abstractors connect the models to the data storages by using data storage connectors that are extensible and customizable.

Once instantiated, the JavaScript object can be used to process API requests from client devices of the API server. To process API requests, the JS object might have to exchange data with one or more backend data storages . As before, JS objects exchange data with backend data storages through the data source abstractor  and connector , which, as mentioned above, allow the JS objects to exchange data with a variety of data storages, such as relational databases from different vendors, REST accessible data storages, SOAP accessible data storages, server memory, etc. JS objects also connect to the replication manager , which connects with replication managers on other servers and client devices.

In some embodiments, this processing simply entails storing the ACL, validation, and relations attributes in data storages (e.g., data storage ), so that the rule processing engine  and object linker  can use these attributes to perform their operations. Each time that an object with validation and\/or ACL rules receives an API request, the rule processing engine  of some embodiments performs the validation and ACL rule check for the object before or after the object processes data in response to this request. Each time an object that has relations key is instantiated, the object linker  creates a link between the object and other objects related to it based on relations key values.","In other embodiments, to process the validation, ACL and\/or relationship attributes during a particular object's instantiation, the runtime processor instantiates a validator, ACL-rule processor, and\/or an object linker for the particular object. The object linker then defines the relationships between the particular object and other objects based on the particular object's relations key values.

For instance, in some embodiments, this handler  uses a non-blocking input\/output (I\/O) process that can concurrently maintain a large number of concurrent sessions. The I\/O process of some embodiments is a single-threaded process that does not consume too much of the system resources, which, in turn allows it to be able to handle a large number of concurrent sessions. In some embodiments, the socket handler  can also maintain a session with a connecting device (e.g., a connecting mobile device) for a long duration of time. For example, in some embodiments, the I\/O manager  can maintain a session for a long duration because it uses a web socket manager to manage the connection session.","The API handler  exposes the API server's JS objects  to the other devices (e.g., other servers, computers, mobile devices, etc.). As shown, the handler  uses REST adapter to expose the APIs to the JS objects. The REST adapter handles the task of processing API requests that are received through REST web services, converting received requests to a format for the API handler  to process, and converting the API responses that it receives from the API handler  to REST web service format for transmission back to the client devices. Other embodiments expose the APIs through other services, and hence use other API protocol processors. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the REST processor is replaced with a protocol processor. This protocol processor in some embodiments can switch protocols dynamically between REST and other formats like websockets, SOAP, webrtc, etc.","As mentioned above, client devices in some embodiments instantiate objects and use these objects to process API requests locally or to direct these API requests to JS objects on an API server. In some embodiments, the client devices store the models and instantiate the objects from these models. The objects on the client devices are referred to as proxy objects, as they act on the client as proxies of the objects on the server. In some embodiments, the proxy objects are JS objects, while in other embodiments, the proxy objects are other types of objects (e.g., a Java object or an objective C object). For instance, in some embodiments, a mobile application executes within a browser on a client device, while another mobile application executes natively on top of the operating system (OS) of the client device. In some of these embodiments, the applications that execute within the browser, execute on top of the browser's JS engine. Hence, in these embodiments, the proxy objects can be JS objects. On the other hand, the application that runs natively on the device's OS, instantiates other types of proxy objects (e.g., Java objects or objective C objects) in some embodiments.","The asynchronous nature of the JavaScript poses unique challenges for traceability and debugging when programming APIs. In some embodiments the API server introduces a new construct called a zone. A zone is a special function that allows parallel execution of statements within function. The parallel execution allows for scope to be controlled and spawned independently. The function will not return a result until all statements have completed in its operation. The statement execution can be traced across the asynchronous callback boundaries within JavaScript so that each asynchronous function can be traced back to its calling parent. In addition, each functional call can carry context in the form of global data. The global data for each statement can be aggregated to the parent zone function and returned as part of the result set.","The API server uses a zone as a means to service API requests and responses across the entire lifecycle of the API invocation. This means that the zone can carry contextual information passed by the caller and have it propagated throughout all functional boundaries invoked within the API. The same zone can carry contextual information from a responding source back to the API requester as well accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0210"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 2","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","200","600","205","210","215","275","275","605","610","205","615","250","600","620","625","630","635","640"]},"The runtime processor  instantiates several proxy objects  that correspond to JS objects running on the API server. In some embodiments, the proxy objects are objects that can be processed in the native OS environment. Examples of such proxy objects include objective C object (e.g., for Apple iOS environment) and Java objects (e.g., for Android environment). To instantiate these proxy objects, the client device includes an adapter that can query the API server dynamically at runtime for an object description, and then, based on the received object description, instantiate a native object (e.g., as objective C objects in iOS and as Java objects in Android). In some embodiments, this adapter is part of the REST adapter , which acts as a bridge between client and the server. The Appendix C portion of the incorporated ASCII text file computer program listing appendix provides the source code for an adapter of some embodiments that can be used in a native client environment to pull an object's description from a server.","In some embodiments, the client device dynamically queries the API server (through the above-described adapter) for an object description when it receives an API request that it does not know how to handle. The API server in these embodiments then notes the type of client device that is making the query (i.e., notes the operating system of the client device) and then provides the object description to the client device. Once the native object is instantiated on the client, the native client can then process the API request locally, or it can direct the API request to be processed remotely by the server. In some embodiments, the API server can provide the response to the API request with the provided object description or before providing this object description.","As mentioned above, once instantiated, a proxy object  on the client can be used to process an API request from local data storages  that reside on the client device , or by calling a corresponding JS object that resides on the API server  so that this object  can process this request (e.g., by using backend data storages). As shown, the proxy objects  access the local data storages  through the data abstractor  and the data connector , which were described above. In some embodiments, the data abstractor  and the data connector  are not used in the native client-side environment as the proxy objects can pull data directly from the client's local data storages without going through the data abstraction and connection layers.","The proxy object  accesses its corresponding JS object  on the API server through the remote API handler , the REST adapter , and socket handler . The API handler  is part of the client-side framework that allows the proxy objects to send out API requests to the API server and to receive responses to the API requests from the API server. In some embodiments, this handler dynamically determines whether the object's API request should be processed remotely or locally. This dynamic determination is based on conditions that the handler  assesses dynamically in some embodiments. The dynamic decision making of the handler  is further described below.","The REST adapter  establishes REST web services between the client  and server , in order to allow these two devices to exchange API requests and responses by using the REST defined protocols. In other words, the REST adapter reformats the API requests of the proxy objects  to a REST-compliant format for transmission to the API server, and reformats the server's API responses from the REST-compliant format to a JS format that the JS objects can process. As mentioned above, other embodiments use other API protocol processors. The socket handler  maintains the communication socket(s) between the client device  and the API server . In some embodiments, the socket handler  establishes web sockets with the socket handler  of the API server .","While instantiating an object, the runtime processor  also processes the validation, ACL, and relationship attributes that are defined in the object's JSON files via the hooks that are inserted in the JS file. This processing is different in different embodiments.

Each time that an object with validation and\/or ACL rules receives an API request, the rule processing engine  in some embodiments performs the validation and ACL rule checks for the object before or after the object processes data in response to this request. Each time an object that has relations key is instantiated, the object linker  creates a link between the object and other objects related to it based on relations key values.","To process the validation, ACL and\/or relationship attributes during a particular object's instantiation, the runtime processor of some embodiments instantiates a validator, ACL-rule processor, and\/or an object linker for the particular object. The object linker  then defines the relationships between the particular object and other objects based on the particular object's relations key values. Each time that the particular object receives an API request, the object uses its validator and\/or ACL rule processor  to process the validation rule(s) and\/or ACL rule(s) for the particular object before or after the object processes data in response to this request. In this manner, the validator and ACL rule processor are modules that are hooked into the particular object. In some embodiments, the validator, rule processor and object linker are modules within the runtime processor. In still other embodiments, the validator and rule processor are simply functions performed by the runtime processor, while the object linker is a separate module with the runtime processor.","As shown in , the JS objects also connect to the replication manager , which connects with replication manager on the API server.

The object instantiator  instantiates each JS, proxy object based on the object description contained in an associated pair of JS file and JSON file. In some embodiments, a JS file and a JSON file are associated through their common name.","In , the proxy objects  are shown to directly access the local storage of the browser without having to using the data abstractor  or the data connector , which were illustrated in  for the native client environment.

The zone library dynamically modifies framework's asynchronous APIs at runtime. Similar to how a scope of a function defines where it may be used, the extent of a call represents the lifetime that it is active. The Zone library of some embodiments also provides execution context that can persist across the lifecycle of one or more asynchronous calls. This concept is similar to the concept of thread-local data in Java. In some embodiments, the Zones library provides a way to group and track resources and errors across asynchronous operations. In addition zones (1) enable more effective debugging by providing better stack traces for asynchronous functions, (2) make it easier to write and understand asynchronous functions for the applications, (3) make it easier to handle errors raised asynchronously and avoid resulting resource leaks, and (4) enable the developers to associate user data with asynchronous control flow.","In some embodiments, in order to use the zones that are provided in the Zone library, the developer should add the \u201crequire(\u2018zone\u2019).enable( )\u201d as the very first line of the developer's program. By doing so, the zone library exports a global variable, zone. The zone global variable always refers to the currently active zone.

These functions are application programming interface (API) requests in some embodiments that require the retrieval and\/or manipulation of data accessible through the API. In some embodiments, the application executes on the client device and individual functions of the application are processed either by the client device or the remote server depending on certain conditions assessed by the application at the client device.","In some embodiments, the conditions assessed in order to determine whether to process a particular function locally on the client device or remotely on the server include one or more of (1) the availability of a connection between the client device and the server (e.g., when a connection is unavailable, the client device processes the function); (2) a computational expense of processing the function on the client (e.g., the higher the computational expense of executing the function on the client, the more likely the application is to request that the server process the function); (3) a memory usage required to process the function on the client (e.g., the higher the memory usage on the client, the more likely the application is to request that the server process the function); and (4) local availability of the data required and the freshness of that local data (e.g., the more available and up to date the data cached on the client, the more likely the application is to process the function locally).","In addition to these infrastructure-related concerns (e.g., connection or hardware resource availability, data availability, etc.), the conditions assessed may be also be stored as explicitly defined rules in an object processed by the application. For instance, access control lists or other properties defined for an object may define policies that prevent operations from being performed on the client whenever possible. Such explicitly-defined conditions are also evaluated dynamically by the client device.","In some embodiments, as mentioned, an application operating on the client device implements one or modules that enable this dynamic determination as to whether to execute a function locally or remotely (a feature sometimes referred to herein as \u201cstrong remoting\u201d).  illustrates a client device  that runs an application that utilizes this strong remoting feature.

As mentioned, the JavaScript and JSON files  and  are present for applications that execute on top of a JavaScript engine of a browser on the client device in some embodiments. However, for applications that operate natively on the client device, the JavaScript\/JSON files are not present, and the objects are instantiated at runtime as native object equivalents of the JavaScript\/JSON objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0220","num":"0258"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["832","834","836","838","830","830","832","824","800","850"]},"In some embodiments, the application layer  implements an application (or applications) based on JavaScript files  and JSON files . In some embodiments, the application layer  is a JavaScript runtime processor that parses JavaScript and JSON code in these files in order to implement the application functions defined by these files. The runtime processors of some embodiments were described above. In some embodiments, the application layer includes an object linker that links the functions in the JavaScript files to the object descriptions in the JSON files. This allows the functions, which may include functions that determine whether to call a different function on the client or the remote server, to be automatically bound to the objects (i.e., the JSON objects) at runtime. Examples of such an object linker were described above.","The application layer also includes an object instantiator to generate objects from the JavaScript and JSON files in some embodiments. The object instantiators of some embodiments were described above. In some embodiments, the application layer  is a module in a different programming language\/system (e.g., objective C for mobile devices running the iOS\u00ae operating system from Apple Inc.\u00ae, Java for mobile devices running the Android\u2122 operating system, etc.).","The application layer  may use the data storages  when performing functions locally in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the data storages  include database records or other information previously retrieved from an API server (e.g., the server ) and cached locally. When performing a local API call (e.g., when the condition detector specifies to invoke a function locally), the application layer  retrieves the requested data from the local data storages . In addition to the JavaScript files , the application layer  of some embodiments may access one or more additional modules  in order to perform various actions on the client device not specified in the JavaScript\/JSON models (i.e., functions that do not relate to the objects instantiated based on the JavaScript\/JSON models). In some embodiments, the application layer  connects to the data storages  through a data source abstractor and\/or a data source connector.","As indicated, the JavaScript\/JSON models may specify API function calls that can be executed locally or with a remote call to an API server. In some embodiments, the models include hooks before some of these API calls that specify to determine whether the function should be performed locally or remotely by using the condition detector . In different cases, the hook may frame the function call to the condition detector  in different ways. For instance, an application may prefer to execute a particular function remotely in order to request data from an API server, and therefore effectively ask the condition detector  whether a remote call is possible. On the other hand, for a different function, the application (or a different application) may prefer to execute the particular function locally using the locally cached data, and therefore effectively ask the condition detector  whether a local call is possible. Still other functions may not have a preference built into the application, and instead ask the condition detector  to determine whether a local or remote call is better. In some embodiments, the call to the condition detector  specifies conditions required for either sending a remote API call or executing a function locally. In some embodiments, the condition detector  is a module of a remote API handler (e.g., remote API handler  of ).","The condition detector  of some embodiments compares the conditions specified by the application (i.e., conditions specified by the JavaScript\/JSON model) with the actual state of the client device. In some embodiments, these conditions may be specified by a JavaScript file or by a JSON file linked to the JavaScript file. The condition detector  determines whether these specified conditions are met, and therefore, whether the application should execute the function call remotely via a request to the API server or execute the function call locally. In some embodiments, the condition detector  returns a decision (i.e., execute remotely or execute locally), while in other embodiments the condition detector  returns a yes\/no answer as to whether a specified set of conditions are met. Though shown separately, in some embodiments the condition detector is actually part of the application layer, as it is another function called by the application as defined in the JavaScript\/JSON files (or, for natively operating applications, in the dynamically instantiated native object equivalents).","In some embodiments, the condition detector  uses the set of modules  and\/or data from the data storages  to determine whether the specified conditions are met. The modules , in some embodiments, provide the condition detector  with data indicating one or more of (1) the status of a connection to the server (e.g., available or unavailable, and\/or the speed and\/or quality of the connection if available), (2) the processing load of one or more processors of the client device, and (3) the amount of free memory of the client device. In some embodiments, the condition detector determines whether the data needed by the API call is present and\/or updated recently enough. In some embodiments, the condition detector  connects to the data storages  through the data source abstractor and\/or a data source connector, as indicated above for the application layer .","Upon receiving the response from the condition detector , the application layer  (e.g., implementing a JavaScript\/JSON model) either invokes the API call in question locally on the client device  or remotely on the server . In some embodiments, the server interface  handles the actual interactions with the API server  (and other API servers to which the application(s) may connect for other requests). Examples of one or more modules (e.g., the REST adapter, socket handler, I\/O handler, etc.) that form the server interface  of some embodiments were described above.","The client device  connects to the server  through a network  (e.g., one or more of a local area network, cellular network, the Internet, etc.). The server  provides REST APIs  that allow the server to interpret remote calls to have the server implement function as requested by the client device . The REST APIs  access the models  which in turn may access various data storages  to retrieve data in response to the remotely-called API request. Several examples of API server of some embodiments were described above.","The operation of the application layer  and its use of the condition detector  in some embodiments will be described by reference to .  conceptually illustrates a process  of some embodiments for determining whether to process a function on either a server or a client device. In some embodiments, the process is performed by the client device, and thus the process determines whether to execute the function locally or remotely. In some embodiments, the function is an API call for an object that requests or modifies data about the object in one or more data storages, which may have both local and remote (e.g., on an API server) incarnations. Examples of client devices include smart phones, tablets, laptop computers, desktop computers, other servers, etc.","As shown, the process  receives (at ) an instruction on a client device to invoke a function of an application locally or remotely. In some embodiments, the function is an API request that is invoked by an application. The application code (e.g., a JavaScript file or JavaScript\/JSON model) may include a hook, or interceptor call, that requests a dynamic determination on whether to invoke the API request locally or remotely. That is, the application makes a first call to determine whether to invoke the function locally or remotely (based on, e.g., a set of current operating conditions), then dynamically uses the result of this determination to invoke one of two function calls embedded in the code.","The process  then identifies (at ) a set of conditions that determine whether to remotely invoke the function on a server (e.g., an API server). One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this is merely a conceptual example process, and in some embodiments the process instead identifies a set of conditions for invoking the function locally. For example, in some embodiments, the hook that results in the dynamic determination as to whether to process the function locally or remotely passes a set of conditions for performing the function remotely. If these conditions are met, then the application will send a remote function call to the server, whereas if the conditions are not met, then the application invokes the function with a local call. Similarly, in some embodiments, the hook passes a set of conditions for performing the function locally, and only if these conditions are met will the application invoke the function with a local call; otherwise, the application sends a remote function call to the server. In some embodiments, this set of conditions (for either remotely or locally processing the function) is stored in a JSON file, or is part of a JavaScript program (e.g., as parameters passed by a function call to the condition detector).","In some embodiments, the conditions that determine whether to process a function on the client device or the server may include conditions relating to data availability, as well as operating conditions such as software conditions, hardware conditions, or network conditions. One such condition in some embodiments is an availability of a connection between the client device and the server. In order for such a connection to be available, the client device must be able to connect to a network, the network conditions must be such as to allow data to pass between the client device and the server and the server must be operating and able to use the network, etc. In some embodiments, when a connection between the client device and the server is unavailable, the client device processes the function to the best of its ability. However, processing the function may result in incomplete data when necessary data is not available on the client device.","Some embodiments examine the computational expense of processing the function on the client device as a condition for determining whether to remotely call the function or locally invoke the function. In general, high computation cost functions (e.g., when processing the function requires a very large number of mathematical calculations) will be offloaded to a server, if possible, rather than run on a mobile device (e.g., a device in which high computational costs may cause the device to drain its battery too quickly). Thus, some embodiments use a preference for a remote call for such functions, so long as certain minimal other conditions are met (e.g., that the network connection to the server is available).","Some embodiments include as testable conditions certain aspects of the current operating conditions on the device. For example, in some embodiments the current processing load of the client device CPU (e.g., from other applications, etc.) and\/or the current memory usage. The client device, particularly mobile devices, often have less CPU power and\/or memory available than a server, especially when sharing those hardware resources with other applications running on the device. When the current CPU usage and\/or current memory usage on the client device is higher, the application will be more likely to use a remote function call rather than further taxing the client device. This threshold for when to make a remote function call may be lower, in some embodiments, for functions that are known to be more computationally expensive or which will use more memory.","In some cases, even when other conditions are favorable to implementing a function on a device (e.g., low computational cost, low memory usage, etc.) the data necessary or desirable for implementing the function might be unavailable on the client device. When such a condition exists, the application is more likely to command the server to process the function rather than the client device. Similarly, even when a version of the data is available in a local data cache of the client device, the data may be out of date. Therefore in some embodiments, freshness of the data can be a condition that determines whether to implement a function on a server or a client device. In such cases, most applications will be biased toward implementing the function on the server if cached data on the device is stale (see e.g., , below).","In addition, in some embodiments the JSON file (or the native object equivalent) may include properties that specify that certain actions should be performed on either the client or server. For instance, the properties specified in the JSON file for an object might specify that certain actions may only be performed on the server for security purposes, and thus the condition detector effectively dynamically determines whether the function may be performed at all (i.e., if the function cannot be performed remotely, then do not call the function).","The process  determines (at ) whether the conditions for calling the function on the server are met. As mentioned above, in other embodiments the conditions to be met may be those for calling the function locally. In some embodiments, the determination is made by comparing the set of conditions (e.g., defined in a JSON file) against data about the current operating conditions provided by one or more data storages and\/or one or more modules (as shown above by reference to ). For example, if a condition depends at least partly on whether certain data is cached locally on the client device, then the process would determine whether that data is cached (e.g., in a data storage) on the client device and the newness of the cached data. Similarly, if a condition depends on an analysis of available computing resources on the client device, or whether there is an available connection to the server, the process  of some embodiments uses one or more modules to determine the actual state of the client device to compare to the set of conditions provided in the JSON file. , below, provide examples of conditions that result in an application calling a remote function on a server. , on the other hand, provide examples of conditions that result in an application invoking a function on a client device.","When the conditions are met, the application makes (at ) a remote call to the function on the server. In some embodiments, the remote call to the function on the server is performed over a network and through REST APIs on a server (e.g., network  through REST APIs  on server  of ). , below, provide examples of remote calls to a server. When the conditions for making a remote call to a function on a server are not met, the application invokes (at ) the function on the client device. In some embodiments, invoking the function on the client device includes accessing modules on the client device and\/or data storages on the client device (e.g., modules  and\/or data storages  of ).  provide examples of invoking a function on a client device. In some embodiments, the function calls performed are isomorphic (i.e., the same parameters are passed in the API call and the same data returned by the API) regardless of whether they are called locally on the client or remotely on the server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0239","num":"0277"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A-B","FIG. 10","FIGS. 10A-B","FIGS. 10C-D","FIG. 11","FIGS. 11A-B","FIGS. 11C-D"],"b":["10","11","11"]},"As mentioned,  illustrate the local execution of an API call by a browser-based application.

In some embodiments, the JSON and\/or JS files include code that identifies conditions under which a function should be implemented remotely (e.g., on a server) or locally (e.g., on a client device).","After receiving the input , the application layer  sends a set of conditions  for the condition detector  to test. In some embodiments, this is implemented as a function call (e.g., implemented as a hook in the JavaScript\/JSON model) that calls a condition detector\/determination function and passes the set of conditions as parameters.

In other embodiments, the application layer  modifies the conditions specified by these files under some circumstances. For example, in some embodiments, a setting of the device may automatically add a condition (e.g., a condition specifying that functions should always be executed locally when the client device is using a cellular network for data, but may be executed remotely when the client device is using a wireless LAN). The condition detector  determines whether the conditions have been met and sends a condition decision  to the application layer. In , the decision is to invoke the function locally, because there is no connection available between the client device and the server. In some embodiments, the condition detector actually just returns a determination as to whether the conditions specified in the hook are met, rather than whether to perform the function call locally (using the proxy object) or remotely (using the object on the API server).

Typically, this involves requiring users to login to access protected data, or requiring authorization tokens for other applications to access protected data.","Applications of some embodiments access data through models, hence controlling access to data means putting restrictions on models. That is, specifying who or what can read, write, or change the data in the models. In some embodiments, the general process to implement access control for an application is first to define the user roles that the application requires. For example, the developer might create roles for anonymous users, authorized users, and administrators.","Next, the developer can define access for each role and model method. For example, the developer might enable anonymous users to read a list of banks, but not allow them to do anything else. In some embodiments, the models have a set of built-in methods, and each method maps to either the READ or WRITE access type. In essence, this step amounts to specifying whether access is allowed for each role and each model in addition to the access type. Lastly, the developer implements the authentication, i.e., in the application, by adding code to create (register) new users, login users (get and use authentication tokens), and logout users.","In order to control data access, the application developer specifies the application's users' roles. The first step in specifying user roles is to determine what roles the application needs. Most applications will have un-authenticated or anonymous users (those who have not logged in) and authenticated users (those who have logged in). Additionally, many applications will have an administrative role that provides broad access rights. Applications of some embodiments can have any number of additional user roles as appropriate.","The next step is specifying the user access types. The framework in some embodiments provides a built-in User model with a corresponding REST API that inherits all the \u201cCRUD\u201d (create, read, update, and delete) methods of the data access object. Each data access method on the User model maps to either the \u201cREAD\u201d or \u201cWRITE\u201d access type, as follows:\n\n","For other methods, the default access type of some embodiments is \u201cEXECUTE\u201d. For example, a custom method maps to the \u201cEXECUTE\u201d access type. The table below is an example of the access control specification for an access control application of some embodiments.

This enables the developer to create a static definition for the application before runtime. The Yeoman generator prompts the developer for all the necessary information as explained below. In some embodiments, the basic process for an application to create and authenticate users is first to register a new user with the User.create( ) method, inherited from the generic model object. The next step is to call User.login( ) to request an access token from the client application on behalf of the user. The developer can create his own access tokens to customize authentication. User.login( ) is a good example of doing that. The developer needs to do verification on the server though to prevent someone from creating tokens even though they don't belong to them. The last step is then to invoke an API using the access token. The developer can provide the access token in the HTTP header or as a query parameter to the REST API call.","In order to create users, an application developer can create (register) a new user with the User.create method as follows (on a client side with calling a REST API and on the server side writing in JS):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0354","num":"0426"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00098","num":"00098"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"REST"]},{"entry":[{},"curl -X POST -H \u201cContent-Type:application\/json\u201d \\"]},{"entry":[{},"-d \u2018{\u201cemail\u201d: \u201cme@domain.com\u201d, \u201cpassword\u201d: \u201csecret\u201d}\u2019 \\"]},{"entry":[{},"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/api\/users"]},{"entry":[{},"Node.js"]},{"entry":[{},"User.create({"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002email: \u2018me@domain.com\u2019,\u2003\/\/ required by default"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002password: \u2018secret\u2019\u2003\u2003\/\/ required by default"]},{"entry":[{},"}, function (err, user) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002console.log(user.id);\u2003\u2002\/\/ => the user id (default type: db specific |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002number)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002console.log(user.email);\u2002\/\/ => the user's email"]},{"entry":[{},"});"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Typically, the developer might want to add methods to use as a part of the registration process to determine whether a given username is available or if an email address is already registered.

There are two different ways to change ACL definitions at runtime: (1) call the data source method createModel( ) and provide an ACL specification (in JSDL) as an argument, and (2) call the ACL.create( ) method. A user can also control access to a model by passing a JSDL specification when creating the model with the data source createModel( ) method:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0370","num":"0445"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00106","num":"00106"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"var Customer = loopback.createModel(\u2018Customer\u2019, {"},{"entry":"\u2003name: {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002type: String,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002\/\/ Property level ACLs"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002acls: ["},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003{principalType: ACL.USER, principalId: \u2018u001\u2019, accessType:"},{"entry":"ACL.WRITE, permission: ACL.DENY},"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003{principalType: ACL.USER, principalId: \u2018u001\u2019, accessType:"},{"entry":"ACL.ALL, permission: ACL.ALLOW}"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002]"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2002\u2009}, {"},{"entry":"\u2003\/\/ By default, access will be denied if no matching ACL entry is found"},{"entry":"\u2003defaultPermission: ACL.DENY,"},{"entry":"\u2003\/\/ Model level ACLs"},{"entry":"\u2003acls: ["},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002{principalType: ACL.USER, principalId: \u2018u001\u2019, accessType:"},{"entry":"ACL.ALL, permission: ACL.ALLOW}"},{"entry":"\u2003]"},{"entry":"\u2002\u2009});"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"ACLs defined as part of the model creation are hard-coded into the application. The framework of some embodiments also allows the user to dynamically define ACLs through code or a dashboard. The ACLs can also be saved to and loaded from a database in some embodiments.","In general, some client applications (e.g., mobile applications) need to be able to operate without constant network connectivity. This means the client application must synchronize data with the server application after a disconnection period. In order to achieve synchronization, (1) the client (browser) application should replicate changes made in the server application, and (2) the server application should replicate the changes made in the client (browser) application. The synchronization (sync) process replicates data from the source to the target, and the target calls a replication API. The replication API of some embodiments is a JavaScript API, and thus works with a JavaScript client. The replication API of other embodiments can be other non-JS APIs that can run on non-JS clients.","Replication means intelligently copying data from one location to another. The framework copies data that has changed from source to target, but does not overwrite data that was modified on the target since the last replication. So, the sync process of some embodiments is a bi-directional replication. In general, there may be conflicts when performing replication. For example, while disconnected, a user may make changes on the client that conflict with changes made on the server. When an object or field is modified both locally and remotely and there is a risk of generating conflicts, the framework of some embodiments handles the conflict resolution for the users, and enables the developers to easily present a user interface in the application to allow the end user to make informed decisions to resolve conflicts when they occur.","The framework of some embodiments implements synchronization using the browser API that provides the same client JS API as for the server. Thus, the framework in the browser is sometimes referred to as isomorphic, because a user can call exactly the same APIs on the client and server. The framework in the browser of some embodiments uses Browserify to handle dependencies and gulp to generate the client API based on the backend models and REST API.","In addition to basic client-server replication, the framework of some embodiments also supports replicating data (1) from a server application to another server application and (2) from one database to another database. Synchronization as described above to handle offline operation is called offline sync in some embodiments. The framework also provides the ability to consolidate (or \u201cbatch\u201d) data changes the user makes on the device and send them to the server in a single HTTP request. This type of synchronization is called online sync in some embodiments.","A conflict occurs when a change to a model is not based on the previous revision of the model. The callback of Model.replicate( ) takes err and conflict[ ]. Each conflict represents a change that was not replicated and must be manually resolved. The developer can fetch the current versions of the local and remote models by calling conflict.models( ). The developer can also manually merge the conflict by modifying both models. Calling conflict.resolve( ) will set the source change's previous revision to the current revision of the (conflicting) target change. Since the changes are no longer conflicting and appear as if the source change was based on the target, they will be replicated normally as part of the next replicate( ) call.","The model object provides a number of methods to support sync, mixed in via the DataModel object. Some of these sync methods are as follows:\n\n","In some embodiments, the change list and replication can be used against existing data sources with large sets of data. This is made possible by using the revision semantics described above. The changes made without the framework API, however, will be treated as \u201ccreated\u201d or \u201cdeleted\u201d change list entries. The Changes made to a data source that supports replication will be tracked as revisions in that data source's change list. A data source's change list is stored like any other model data. Each model has its own \u201cChange\u201d model. The \u201cChange\u201d model may be attached to any data source. This allows the user to store the change lists in any data source.","During replication a user may supply a filter in some embodiments. The less data the user tries to replicate, the faster and more memory efficient the replication will be. If the user is manually implementing the replication algorithm, the user should run as many steps in the replication process in parallel as possible. This is usually called the \u201cbulk update\u201d step(s).","As discussed above, the framework in the client machine is sometimes referred to as isomorphic framework, because it provides the exact same API as the server framework. A user can create models and use the memory adapter and have his application fully running in the browser machine. The user can seamlessly connect models using the Remote Connector to connect different devices (e.g., browser to server or server to server). Some embodiments accomplish this by enhancing remoting to be able to accept and return ModelTypes in addition to the JSON and its JSON primitives. Because the models do not need to know where they are being run, the developer can share the same API regardless of where developer's code is running, thus making the API isomorphic. Models are referenced through one way\u2014\u201clocal\u201d versus \u201cremote\u201d. This is a foundation for how the replication API for data synchronization between browser and server is built in some embodiments.","In the browser, the main application file calls the function exported by the boot module to setup the application by executing the instructions contained in the browser bundle:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0382","num":"0472"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00107","num":"00107"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"browser-app.js"]},{"entry":[{},"var loopback = require(\u2018loopback\u2019);"]},{"entry":[{},"var boot = require(\u2018loopback-boot\u2019);"]},{"entry":[{},"var app = module.exports = loopback( );"]},{"entry":[{},"boot(app);"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0383","num":"0473"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00108","num":"00108"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"index.html"]},{"entry":[{},"<script src=\u201capp.bundle.js\u201d> <\/script>"]},{"entry":[{},"<script>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002var app = require(\u2018loopback-app\u2019);"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002var User = app.models.User;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002User.login({"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003email: \u2018test@example.com\u2019,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003password: \u201812345\u2019"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002}, function(err, res) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003if (err) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2002console.error(\u2018Login failed: \u2019, err);"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003} else {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2002console.log(\u2018Logged in.\u2019);"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002});"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/script>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium).
