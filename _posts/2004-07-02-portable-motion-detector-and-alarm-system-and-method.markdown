{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to an improved motion detector and alarm system for actuating an alarm device in response to movement of an object, and more particularly to a portable motion detector and alarm system which is easy to install and operate and is capable of detecting motion relative to a variety of predetermined positions.","2. Prior Art","The problem of protecting homes, businesses and other premises against unauthorized intrusions is becoming increasingly important due to the increase in vandalism, theft and even physical attacks upon the inhabitants. Various prior art systems have been developed to address the problem and numerous examples exist of alarm or warning devices. One commonly used protective system involves wiring doors and windows in such a manner that an unauthorized opening of the door or window activates an electric circuit which in turn produces an alarm.","For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,271,405 to Kitterman discloses an alarm control system for protecting a premises including a four conductor bus line leading from a master control station and extending about the interior perimeter of the premises. Sensors positioned near each port of entry to be monitored are connected in parallel relationship to the bus line. Each sensor carries a biased reel carrying line secured to a window, door, screen or the like. Disturbance of a sensor causes a magnetically responsive switch therein to generate a pulse triggering circuitry within the control station to activate the desired alarm device.","While effective, this system requires extensive wiring of the premises as a bus line must be routed about the interior perimeter of the premises between a master control station and the ports of entry at which the motion sensors are to be located. Hence, this system is time consuming and complicated to install, and installation may require expertise beyond that of the average home or business owner. Once installed, the, sensors of this system are not easily relocated. Further, the system may be defeated by cutting the wires extending between the sensors and the master control station.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,781,836 to Kruper et al discloses an alarm system including a magnetic pulse generator for producing an output pulse in response to a change in magnetic flux in response to an intrusion of a designated area. A radio transmitter circuit responds to the pulse from the magnetic pulse generator by transmitting a signal to a remote receiver circuit which in turn generates a pulse for actuating an intrusion alarm circuit. The system requires a complex linkage assembly to translate motion of the object to motion of a magnet. In addition a relatively bulky pick-up coil assembly is necessary to generate the pulse to be applied to the transmitter circuit.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,696,380 to Murphy discloses a portable alarm device with a battery or low voltage operated sound signal triggered by a magnetic reed switch which is closed to complete the circuit by a magnet attached to a movably mounted arm, the poles of the magnet being positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal dimension of the contact strips of the reed switch to cause the reed switch to close when the magnet is in either of two positions relative to the switch.","A need remains for a motion detection and signal generating system which is small in size, easily transportable, easy to install and which can sense motion relative to any desired initial position of an object. An additional desirable capability of the foregoing system would be to provide information about the detected motion to the owner of the object, or a remote location such as a law enforcement or other security agency. It would likewise be desirable to provide identification information about a specific object whose motion has been detected in the event that the motion detection and signal generating system is implemented to detect motion at multiple locations (e.g., doors, windows) within a larger security area (e.g., a residence, an office or otherwise).","Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide a system for detecting the movement of an object comprising: an object whose movement is to be detected, movable magnet means coupled to the object such that movement of the object results in movement of said movable magnet means, and means for detecting movement of the movable magnet means and providing an indication of the movement. The means for detecting is in communication with the movable magnet means.","The system further includes radiating means for wirelessly transmitting a predetermined signal in response to the indication of movement, the radiating means being coupled to the means for detecting. The object whose movement is to be detected may be coupled to the movable magnet means by a wire means which can also serve as the radiating means.","The system further includes means for receiving the predetermined signal, the means for receiving being separate from and located at a distance from the radiating means. The system preferably includes means for generating an alarm signal security response when the predetermined signal is received by the means for receiving. The alarm signal thus generated may be audible, visual or electronic and may include speakers, warning horns, lamps and the like.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a method of detecting movement of one or more objects comprising the steps of: a) coupling each object whose movement is to be detected to a corresponding movable magnet such that movement of any object results in movement of the corresponding magnet; b) detecting the motion of the corresponding magnet; c) transmitting a predetermined signal in response to the detected motion, and, d) receiving the predetermined signal at a distance from the object, or objects, whose motion is to be detected.","The method may include the further step of providing an alarm signal security response when the predetermined signal is received by the receiver means. The alarm signal may be audible, visible, or may be an electronic alarm signal which is transmitted to a remote alarm center via a telecommunications means such as a telephone line.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system which may be affixed to a wide variety of objects including inside doors, outside gates, garage doors, children's barriers such as \u201cbaby gates\u201d, valuable wall hangings and paintings, and countless other objects.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system which is portable and is easily packed in a suitcase and transported with a traveler to be later installed on motel or hotel room doors, windows and\/or any objects within the room, whenever additional protection is desired by the traveler.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system that provides movement information to a remote location, such as a law enforcement or security agency.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system wherein the movement information includes an indication of the distance that is moved for measuring purposes.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system that provides object identification information either locally at or near the site of the object or remotely to a designated location such as a telephone number, email address, etc.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system wherein the object identification information is locally or remotely programmable.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a movement detection and alarm system wherein the movable magnet means and the radiating means are part of a remotely controllable trigger unit having both a radio transmitter and a radio receiver.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a security network that includes a security administration system operating in conjunction with an alarm system to provide security notifications to entities specified by network subscribers, and to optionally download security alerts and other information to the alarm system, where it can be accessed by the subscribers.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a sensor for detecting movement that does not rely on wire means to detect the movement of an object.","The present invention relates to a portable security alarm system which can be installed on a temporary basis and removed from an object whose movement is to be detected comprising a motion detecting and radio signal transmitting member, means for selectively coupling and decoupling said motion detecting and radio signal transmitting member relative to said object whose movement is to be detected, and a combined radio signal receiving and alarm generating member for receiving a signal from said combined motion detecting and radio signal transmitting member and producing an alarm. The alarm system also preferably includes a remote control member for selectively actuating and deactuating said combined radio signal receiving and alarm generating member. The alarm system also preferably includes an information gathering device for gathering movement information and a remote notification device for providing the movement information to a remote location. As an optional feature, the alarm system can be implemented such that the signal from the combined motion detecting and radio signal transmitting member includes an identification code that is used to provide object identification information either locally or to a remote location. Local or remote programmable means can be provided for selectively associating the object identification information with the identification code. As an additional optional feature, the combined motion detecting and radio signal transmitting member can be adapted to provide distance information representing a distance moved by an object whose movement is to be detected. The combined motion detecting and radio signal transmitting member can also include radio signal receiving means and control logic means to facilitate remote control of the device for polling or programming purposes.","In additional embodiments of the invention, the alarm system of the invention is part of a security network that includes a security administration system for receiving security information from the alarm system and for notifying designated entities specified by network subscribers. The security administration system may be further adapted to download security alerts and other information, including advertising or other commercial information, to the alarm system, where it can be accessed by the subscribers.","In further embodiments of the inventions, a novel inertial sensor construction is provided that may be used in the alarm system of the invention or to perform other functions, such as activating or deactivating a device that may or may not be associated with a security function.","The following detailed description of the embodiments of the present invention, as represented in , is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention. The presently preferred embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","22","30","40"]},"More than one movement detecting and signal transmitting means  may be utilized in implementing the system of the present invention. One movement detecting and signal transmitting means  may be placed on each object whose movement it is desired to detect. For example, in a room with four windows  and two doors , six movement detecting and signal transmitting means  may be utilized, one on each window and one on each door. However, only one receiver means  is necessary regardless of the number of movement detecting and signal transmitting means  used. There is no limit to the number of movement detecting and signal transmitting means  which may be used with one receiver.","Each movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is coupled to one object, such as a door , or window , whose movement is to be detected. In a preferred embodiment, the coupling means is a retractable wire  which extends from movement detecting and signal transmitting means  to the object,  or , whose movement is to be detected. One end of retractable wire  is affixed to the object and the other is coupled to movable magnets (best illustrated in ,  and ) located inside casing  of movement detecting and signal transmitting means . Typical means of affixing the end of retractable wire  to an object include VELCRO tabs, glue, removable tape, and the like.","Receiver means  is configured to receive a predetermined signal which is wirelessly transmitted by movement detecting and signal transmitting means  whenever the object whose movement is to be detected, is displaced from a predetermined position. The object whose movement is to be detected need not be in any particular position when the end of retractable wire  is affixed thereto. If the object is a window, such as depicted at , the window may be closed, or it may be partially or fully open, when retractable wire  is affixed. Any displacement from its position when retractable wire  is affixed will be detected and alarmed.","Accordingly, a window may be left in a partially open position, as for example, to provide fresh air to a room, while the occupant attends to other matters, or sleeps. Any displacement from the partially open position will cause the alarm signal to be generated. Even in a situation wherein an intruder reached into the window and removed movement detecting and signal transmitting means  from the window, the predetermined signal would be transmitted and the alarm signal generated, thus warning the occupant of an intrusion.","Receiver means  can be any receiver known in the art capable of receiving the signal transmitted through retractable wire . In response to the transmitted signal, receiver means  initiates a local alarm signal security response which can be audible or visual. In addition, as a further security response option, the receiver means  may initiate contact with police, medical, rescue or other emergency facilities or agencies. Receiver means  can be AC powered and may be equipped with an on\/off switch. Receiver means  need not be co-located with movement detection and signal transmitting means  and can be positioned anywhere within reception distance of the transmitted signal. Receiver means  may be positioned anywhere about the room or the area to be protected and may be placed up to a distance of 150 ft. to 200 ft. or greater from movement detecting and signal transmitting means .","In a preferred embodiment receiver means  is powered by alternating current (AC). Therefore, it must be located such that a power cord, or an extension thereof, can be extended to the nearest AC outlet. Alternate embodiments of receiver means  may be powered by battery, or may include battery backup means to supply power to receiver means  in the event of a power failure.","In a preferred embodiment, receiver means  is a commercially available BLACK WIDOW receiver unit, or similar units, which may be purchased off-the-shelf from various electronics supply companies such as Whitney Electronics or Holsfelt Electronics. An AC adapter such as that depicted at  in  may be used to provide the correct operating voltage for receiver means . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a BLACK WIDOW RF receiver Model #2.CL manufactured by LCD Co. of California was used as a receiver.  shows a schematic diagram, of a type well understood by those of ordinary skill in the electronics arts, of a receiver unit suitable for use in the present invention.","Returning to , the system of the present invention may also include a remote control unit  which may be purchased from the same source as receiver means . Remote control unit  controls the operating state of receiver means , That is, the remote control unit  may be used to electronically enable or disable receiver means  such that the security response of receiver means  to the signal transmitted by retractable wire  can be controlled. The remote control unit  preferably includes a panic button which, when depressed or otherwise enabled, transmits a signal which instantly activates the alarm function of receiver means . The means for activating can be a switch  which may be operated by hand to cause the remote control unit  to activate the alarm signal, or to discontinue the alarm signal after it has been activated by either the predetermined signal or the remote control unit  itself.","This feature serves as a \u201cpanic\u201d button, i.e., a means of triggering the alarm signal security response within receiver means  to attract attention or call for aid in the presence of other emergencies. When it is desired to discontinue the alarm signal, switch  may be set to a position which causes the previously activated alarm signal to stop. Such remote control units and receivers are well known in the electronic arts and are commonly used in other electronics applications. Accordingly, the remote control unit  is also readily available from commercial sources and may be purchased and utilized in the system of the present invention \u201coff-the-shelf.\u201d The transmitter circuit of the remote control unit  may be used as a model for transmitter  () of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  of the present invention such that both transmit the proper signal for receiver means .","This feature may also serve as a means of testing the system  to determine its operational status, i.e., ready to operate (or armed), or malfunctioning. If switch  is manually set by the operator to a position designed to activate the alarm signal within receiver means , and no alarm signal is produced, a malfunction condition is present. If the alarm signal within receiver means  is produced, the system  may be considered \u201carmed\u201d or ready to operate.","Once system  is configured as desired, i.e., each movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is positioned on a corresponding object whose motion is to be detected, and receiver means  is armed, any movement of window  or door  will cause a predetermined signal to be radiated from movement detecting and signal transmitting means  and wirelessly transmitted to receiver means . Receiver means  will receive the transmitted predetermined signal and provide its alarm signal security response. In the embodiment shown, the alarm signal is an audio signal provided through one or more speakers located within receiver means .","Turning now to  there is shown a perspective view of movement detecting and signal transmitting means , including casing , switch , retractable wire affixing means  and retractable wire . Casing  may include an opening  for allowing visible light, as from a lamp or an LED , to be seen by the naked eye. The illumination of such a lamp, or light emitting means, gives an operator a visible indication of the operational status of movement detecting and signal transmitting means .","Casing  further includes a slotted opening  through which retractable wire  and retractable wire affixing means  may be disposed. This allows flexibility in positioning retractable wire  on an object relative to the position of movement detecting and signal transmitting means .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 8","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["3","3","31","20","52","62","54","34","66","62","64","22","62","58","22","22","31","60"]},"As shown in  retractable wire means  is in communication at one end with rotatable frame . Rotatable frame  includes one or more movable magnets , preferably opposite pole magnets which are spaced from each other and disposed within rotatable frame . The preferred embodiment includes  such magnet means  spaced equidistantly from each other around rotatable frame . Magnet means  may be of a type commonly available commercially from sources such as Radio Shack. One such magnet means suitable for use in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a common \u215b\u2033 diameter earth magnet available from Radio Shack, part number 64-1895.","Rotatable frame  is preferably a circular supporting frame which is provided with a central opening \u2032 (see ) about which rotatable frame  rotates. Rotatable frame  is adapted to include a channel  for receiving retractable wire . Channel  extends about the circumference of rotatable frame  and allows retractable wire  to be wrapped about rotatable frame  in a manner similar to that of a string wrapped around a yo yo. The end of retractable wire  that is in contact with rotatable frame  may be affixed to rotatable frame  by traditional means such by knotting the end of retractable wire  and inserting it into a notch within channel , or by wrapping and tying one end of retractable wire  securely around channel . Retractable wire  must be secured such that slippage of retractable wire  within channel  is avoided. Other means of securing one end of retractable wire  within channel  will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","Magnet means  may be inserted into openings (not shown) in rotatable frame  and held in place by means of glue, or other suitable affixing means. The openings into which magnet means  are inserted should provide a snug fit for magnet means  such that movable magnet means  will remain securely in place throughout the life of system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8","b":["20","31","66","20","33","44","52","44","31"]},"Electronic circuit board  includes means  for detecting movement of movable magnet means . Means  for detecting movement of movable magnet means  may be a magnetic field sensor such as a KMZ10B available from Phillips Semiconductors. A schematic diagram of a type readily understood by those skilled in the electronics arts illustrating a preferred circuit connection for means  for detecting movement, is provided in .","The circuit depicted in  operates generally as follows. When the object whose movement is to be detected moves in any direction, retractable wire  either extends or retracts (as best depicted in ). When the object moves toward movement detecting and signal transmitting means , retractable wire  recoils toward movement detecting and signal transmitting means , and vice versa.","As retractable wire  moves, movable magnets  rotate. When movable magnet means  are displaced from their resting position, a change in the magnetic field surrounding movable magnet means , with respect to magnetic field sensor  occurs.  shows two rotatable magnet means  in one possible resting position with respect to magnetic field sensor .  shows movable magnet means  as they move in direction , as shown by the arrow, past magnetic field sensor . It is the change of the position of movable magnets relative to magnetic field sensor  which is detected by magnetic field sensor .","Returning to , magnetic field sensor  senses the change in the magnetic field and provides a signal representing the change, to comparator , in this case a common LM . The output of comparator  causes relay  to energize closing contact  and enabling battery power to operate radiating means, i.e., transmitter . The circuitry of transmitter  can be any available transmitter configuration known in the art which is capable of transmitting a signal through retractable wire  and which can be configured to fit on transmitter circuit board .","Transmitter  generates a predetermined signal which is in turn radiated and wirelessly transmitted to receiver means . In a preferred embodiment, the output of transmitter  is coupled to wire means , which serves as a transmit antenna. Retractable wire  can be a suitable length of wire, cable, or any other electrically conductive material.","As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, electronic circuit board , as embodied in the circuit diagram circuit of  has many equivalents. It is not intended that the invention be limited to the particular circuit depicted in .","Returning now to  electronic circuit board  may also include a lamp  which illustrates when switch  is turned to the \u201con\u201d position and power from battery  is applied to the electronic components residing on circuit board . Electronic circuit board  is adapted to include openings  through which fastening means , which may be conventional screws, are passed as shown.","Rotatable frame , including retractable wire channel  and magnet means  is located beneath electronic circuit board .

Beneath rotatable frame  lies supporting base means  which is adapted to include a central threaded opening \u2032 for receiving the threaded end of central fastening means . Threaded nuts  receive fastening means , and act as spacers to hold electronic circuit board  sufficiently distant from supporting base means  to allow rotatable frame  to rotate. In this manner circuit board , rotatable frame , and supporting base means  are coupled together such that rotatable frame  may rotate freely about central fastening means .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["58","62","58","34","48","58","22","62","58","22"]},"In accordance with the portability aspect of the present invention, the above-described structure has been modified as follows. First of all, rear panel  of casing  () has pressure-sensitive adhesive strips  thereon which can be pressed into firm engagement with a window sill or door jamb () and which will leave no marks when removed. Strips  are marketed under the trademark COMMAND of the 3M Company. The 3M COMMAND strips  have pressure-sensitive adhesive on both surfaces. One surface adheres to rear panel  and the other surface adheres to the fixed surface proximate the object whose movement is to be detected. Tabs  of strips  extend outwardly beyond panel  and they do not have any adhesive on their opposite sides. After the panel  has been adhesively secured to a surface and it is desired to demount the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , it is merely necessary to grasp each tab  and pull it away from panel  in the direction of the longitudinal axis of each strip and substantially parallel to the surface of panel . This will release the strips  from the surface on which the means  is mounted and it may also release them from panel . Strips  preferably are applied to the rear panel  every time the means  is to be mounted. Any other suitable pressure-sensitive adhesive may be used. The main objective is that the mounting causes the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  to be firmly mounted in a manner such that it will not move while mounted but which permits it to be removed so that it can be transported to another location.","In accordance with the present invention, the retractable wire-affixing means of  includes a disc  affixed to the outer end of wire  and an anchor member in the form of cup member  having pressure-sensitive adhesive  mounted on its underside which is covered by release paper . Cup member  also includes a cover  which is connected to cup member  by a molded hinge . The cover has a disc-like protrusion  having an outer edge which fits in tight engagement with the inner wall  of cup-like member  when the cover is in a closed position. The cup member  is a commercial product sold under the trademark CROWN BOLT of the Crown Bolt, Inc. company of Cerritos, Calif., except that it does not have the pressure-sensitive adhesive thereon, which has been added in accordance with the present invention. It will be appreciated that other types of anchor members can be used instead of a cup member . Such devices may include a small hook or post mounted on a base having pressure-sensitive adhesive thereon in an analogous manner similar to adhesive . Also, as an alternative, disc  may have a hole therein so that it is essentially a ring which may be mounted on a simple post having a base with pressure-sensitive adhesive thereon, as noted above. Also, the post may have a bulbous outer end so that it looks like a collar button. Also, if desired, the outer end of wire  may be formed in a loop which may be placed on a post or hook. In fact, any suitable arrangement can be used wherein a small unobtrusive member, such as the foregoing anchor members, may be securely fastened to the member whose movement is to be detected and an attachment member may be formed on the end of the wire  which can be removably fastened to the small unobtrusive member.","In use, the cup anchor member  is securely adhesively affixed to an object whose movement is to be detected, such as a window or door, as shown by wire-affixing means  of , after the release paper  has been removed from pressure-sensitive adhesive . Thereafter, while the cover  is in the position shown in , the disc  at the end of wire  is inserted into the cavity of cup  and the lid  is closed. The other types of anchor members can be used as alternates to the cup anchor member. Thus, the system is in a position to operate as described above.","When the person who has temporarily used the portable system desires to leave the place where the system has been installed and take the portable system with him, he need merely deactivate the system and thereafter open lid  to remove disc  and permit wire  to retract disc  back to a position wherein it abuts the casing . The cylindrical cup  is merely left in position on the window or door jamb, and it is substantially unobtrusive inasmuch as its overall diameter is only about \u215c\u2033 and its height is about \u00bc\u2033. The other types of anchor members described above may also be left where they were adhesively secured to the movable member.","As noted above, the system of the present invention can be carried in a brief case, purse or overnight case from place to place. In this respect, the total weight of a preferred embodiment is approximately 20 ounces, and it has a volume which occupies a very small portion of a brief case, suitably sized purse or a suitcase.","While the foregoing portion of the specification has designated wire  as being an antenna, it will be appreciated that a suitable antenna may be incorporated within housing  and the element  may be a suitable high strength string-like member made of suitable plastic or any other suitable material.","Turning now to , an enhanced version of the alarm system  is shown wherein motion detection information is collected in response to the detection of movement and provided to a remote facility, such as a law enforcement or security agency.  functionally illustrates several of the components discussed above relative to ; namely, the above-described movement detecting and signal transmitting means , the retractable wire , the retractable wire affixing means , and the receiver means .  further illustrates an information gathering device  and a remote notification device . Also shown is an optional computer platform . A remote network computer host is further represented at . It will be seen that the remote notification device  communicates with the network computer host , either directly or through the optional computer platform , via communication links .","In preferred embodiments of the invention, as shown in , the information gathering device  comprises a D.C. power supply , a camera , an RF transmitter , and an RF receiver . The power supply  can be constructed using any suitable constant voltage source, including a rechargeable battery or an AC\/DC transformer.

The camera  preferably has low lumen capability and the ability to capture live video images or sequential still images at a selectable frame rate. The camera , moreover, should be small and unobtrusive. For video images, the camera  will typically be an analog device. For still images, the camera  can be implemented as a digital device. In that case, the camera will include a memory implemented using a conventional RAM (Random Access Memory) or flash memory chip (or plug-in card).

If the camera  is an analog device, such as an analog video camera, the RF transmitter  will transmit analog RF signals. If the camera  is a digital device, such as a digital still camera, the RF transmitter  will transmit digital RF signals or analog RF signals following digital-to-analog conversion of the camera images.","It will be appreciated that there are a number of commercially available surveillance products that can be used to implement the power supply , the camera  and the RF transmitter .

The interface might alternatively comprise a Bluetooth or Home RF (e.g. Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b)) device that communicates over an air interface with another local device (e.g., a computer or cellular telephone) containing any of the foregoing network interface devices.","In a third embodiment of the remote notification device , shown in , the device, referred to by reference numeral C, comprises various functional devices that plug in as modules to a suitable base interface . If the base interface  is a computer, the plug-in modules could be implemented as PC or PCMIA cards. Other base interfaces include the DVi family of set top devices from Motorola Corporation. In either case, the plug-in modules could include a memory module , an RF receiver module , and a network interface module . Power for these modules would be typically provided by the base interface . The memory module  can be implemented using a conventional RAM or flash memory chip (or plug-in card). A memory capacity of about 4 to 16 MB, expandable to 256 MB or more, should be sufficient for the remote notification device C. The RF receiver module  operates at the frequency of the RF transmitter  in the information gathering device . It is adapted to receive and process either analog or digital transmissions, depending on the nature of the RF transmitter . The network interface module  can be implemented using a conventional analog or digital modem, an Ethernet card, or any other suitable device.","Referring now to , the operation of information gathering device  and the remote notification device  will now be described. In step , the information gathering device  is notified of a movement event by receiving (at the RF receiver ) a predetermined signal from the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . The information gathering device then activates its camera  to begin acquiring pictures in step . The camera  is preferably aimed at the vicinity of the retractable wire affixing means , such that the cause of the movement will be viewable. In step , the RF transmitter  begins sending image information to the remote notification device . If the information gathering device also includes a microphone, the RF transmitter  will also send audio information to the remote notification device .","In step , the remote notification device  receives the information transmitted by the information gathering device at its RF receiver \/\/ (see , B, and C, respectively). If the remote notification device is implemented according to , it forwards the received information to the computer  in step A. The computer  then establishes a network connection, as necessary, and forwards the information to the remote host  in step A. If the remote notification device is implemented according to  or C, it buffers the received information in its memory \/ in step B. In step B, the remote notification device establishes a network connection, as necessary, and forwards the information to the remote host .","The remote host  can be implemented as an Internet host that responds to the information received from the remote notification device  as either an information processing point or a store-and-retrieval point. For example, the host  might be a server at a security agency that displays the received information on a monitor for viewing by a security agent. Alternatively, the information could be forwarded, via email or the like, to the owner of the premises where the system  is located, or elsewhere. Still further, the host  might itself be an email server that receives the information from the remote notification device  as an attachment to an email addressed to the owner of the premises under surveillance, or elsewhere.","Turning now to , an additional optional aspect of the invention will be described that allows object identification information to be provided locally and\/or remotely to a designated location, such as a subscriber's forwarding telephone number, a law enforcement agency, or a security agency. In this way, when a subscriber's movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is triggered, a meaningful description of the object to which the device was attached can be provided as part of the security response implemented by the receiver means .","In , the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  of  is shown with additional components that allow it to store a unique identifier, such as a digital code word, and then wirelessly transmit the identifier to the receiver means  (see ) whenever the object whose movement is to be detected is displaced from a predetermined position. In the exemplary design of , the unique identifier is stored in a data store  of suitable size. By way of example only, the data store  can be implemented using a flash ROM or RAM memory chip (or plug-in card) whose size is based on the required size of the unique identifier. For example, if the unique identifier is a product serial number comprising \u201cn\u201d ASCII characters, the data store can be implemented as an \u201cn\u00d78\u201d memory array, as an \u201cn\/2\u00d716\u201d memory array, as an \u201cn\/4\u00d732\u201d memory array, and so on. Note that the term \u201cunique identifier\u201d does not necessarily require that the identifier be unique relative all other movement detecting and signal transmitting means  owned by all subscribers. Rather, in view of certain programmability features described in more detail below, the unique identifier need only be unique with respect to the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  owned by one subscriber.","Closure of the switch  (as a result of displacement of the object whose movement is to be detected) activates the transmitter  and also provides a sense input to a control logic circuit . The latter can be implemented in fairly straightforward fashion as a data selector with clocking to facilitate selective (e.g., sequential) output from one or more array locations in the data store . Alternatively, to provide a more feature-rich design, the logic circuit  could be implemented as a programmable processor. In that event, the data store  will preferably contain the processor's control programming code in addition to the unique identifier. A programmable processor implementation of the logic circuit  would also facilitate the implementation of other useful functions in the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , such as the ability to control the device from the receiver means  or some other remote location. Thus, assuming a radio receiver  (see ) is added to the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , or combined with the radio transmitter  as a transceiver, the control logic  could be remotely programmed via radio control to facilitate a variety of operations, such as polling the device to determine operating conditions, battery states or other useful information, and programming the device to set and\/or reset its various operational characteristics.","When the control circuit  is activated upon closure of the switch , the unique identifier in the data store  is transferred to a D\/A (Digital-to-Analog) converter  and converted to a corresponding analog signal. The analog signal is used to modulate the RF output of the transmitter  (see ), such that the unique identifier is wirelessly transmitted to the receiver means  as an encoded RF signal. Alternatively, the unique identifier could be transmitted in digital form without D\/A conversion.","In , the receiver means  of  is shown with additional components that allow it to process the encoded RF signal received from the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  and convert it to digital form (as necessary) to recover the unique identifier. The unique identifier is then processed (either locally, remotely or both) for conversion to object identification information identifying the object to which the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is attached. Regardless of where the unique identifier is converted, the object identification information can be output locally at the receiver means and\/or it can be provided remotely to a forwarding telephone number designated by the subscriber, or to another location such as a law enforcement or security agency.","In the exemplary design of , the receiver means  includes the antenna and the receiver of . The receiver is tuned to the frequency of the transmitter  in the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . It demodulates the encoded RF signal. If the unique identifier is received in analog form, it is forwarded to an A\/D (Analog-to-Digital) converter  for conversion to digital form. The unique identifier is then provided to a control logic circuit . The control logic circuit  is preferably implemented as a programmable processor that is associated with a related data store  that contains programming code for the control logic circuit. The data store  can be implemented using a conventional memory component, such as a flash ROM or RAM memory chip (or plug-in card) whose size is minimally based on the required size of the programming code.","The memory used for the data store  may further contain an optional look-up table  if it is desired that the receiver means  convert the unique identifier locally into object identification information. An exemplary implementation of the look-up table  is shown in . This implementation features one or more row entries  for matching the unique identifier received from the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  with a descriptive word or phrase. Each entry  comprises a data set that contains a unique identifier field  and a descriptive word or phrase field .","By searching the unique identifier field  for an entry that matches the unique identifier received from the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , the control logic circuit  can rapidly correlate the unique identifier with a descriptive word or phrase that identifies the object to which the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is attached. As shown in , the control logic circuit  can then output this information locally in visual form to a visual display device  (e.g., an LCD), or audibly to a speech synthesizer (e.g. wavetable) device , or both. This will permit a person who is physically present within visible or audible range of the receiver means  to promptly determine the location of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  that set off the alarm system .","The control logic circuit  can also be implemented to forward the unique identifier received from the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  as part of an alarm alert to a remote security administration system (not shown in ) so that an object identification look-up can be performed remotely. As described in more detail below, the security administration system can be programmed to respond to the alarm by sending an alert to a subscriber-designated contact location (e.g., a forwarding telephone number), advising that the alarm system  has been triggered and specifying the location of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  that triggered the alert. Additionally, or in the alternative, the security administration system can download the object identification information to the receiver means  for output via the visual display device  or the speech synthesizer . This feature could be used in implementations where the receiver means  does not perform local conversion of the unique identifier to object identification information.","A modem  in the receiver means  can be used for transmittal of the unique identifier via a telephone line to a remote computer host implementing the security administration system. Alternatively, the receiver means  could be equipped with a data network interface for connection to the remote computer host via a computer data network, such as the global Internet. The connection could further include any of a cable interface, an Ethernet interface, a radio\/cellular interface, etc. that physically interconnects the receiver means  to the remote computer host.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 10","FIG. 1"],"b":["222","30","240","222","20","242","222","20","20","244","246","220","248","220","30","30","250","220","252","222","40","30","254"]},"In , an exemplary security administration system  as described above is shown. The security administration system  includes a computer host  and a modem pool  containing plural modems that allow simultaneous connections with multiple alarm systems  associated with multiple subscribers. Although not shown, the security administration system  may also include a data network interface for communicating with multiple alarm systems  via a computer data network, such as the public Internet. It will be appreciated that other types of communication interfaces (e.g., cellular telephone) could also be provided.","There is also connected to the computer host  a large capacity data storage resource  (such as a storage array, a storage network, etc.) that stores a subscription database containing subscriber information for multiple subscribers. The subscription information includes data sets that may correlate the unique identifiers associated with each subscriber's movement detecting and signal transmitting means  with object identification information specified by the subscriber. The subscription information preferably further includes contact information for use in forwarding the object identification information.","The computer host  further includes a memory  that stores a security monitoring control program  for implementing the functionality required to receive and respond to incoming alarm alerts from the receiver means  of the multiple alarm systems . In addition, the memory  preferably further stores a subscriber registration and provisioning program  that allows subscribers to register for security service and provision profile information such as user-specified object identification information to be associated with the unique identifiers associated with their movement detecting and signal transmitting means . Subscribers are also able to provision contact information that allows the security administration system  to contact them or other designated security notification recipients in the event of a security breach.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["260","30","270","260","30","272","261","30","30","20","274","30","276","30","261","278","264","280","261","282","261","30"]},"The computer host  then initiates a security alert sequence based on the subscriber's contact information. This sequence includes step  in which communication is established as necessary to the forwarding location and step  in which the object identification information corresponding to the activated movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is delivered. For example, if the forwarding location is a voice telephone number, the object identification information can be delivered as a live or synthesized voice message. For telephone, IRC, email or any other interactive media, the computer host  can prompt and hold for a response. For a telephone, the computer host  can prompt and hold for a response that represents the call recipient pressing various buttons on his or her telephone in order to connect to a designated emergency service agency or other entity. For example, the number \u201c1\u201d could be used to connect the call recipient to a police department, the number \u201c2\u201d could be used to connect the call recipient to a fire department, and the number \u201c3\u201d could be used to place a custom call. Some other number, such as the number \u201c4,\u201d could be used to reset the alarm via the computer host .","If the forwarding location is a telephone or facsimile number, the object identification information can be transmitted via the public switched telephone network to a remote telephone or facsimile machine. If the forwarding location is an email or IRC address, the object identification information can be transmitted via a data network for delivery to a remote computer host. If the forwarding location is the receiver means , the object identification information can be transmitted via the modem pool  to the receiver means.","Following delivery of the object identification information, the remote computer host  terminates the security alert sequence in step . This step preferably includes logging the date and time of the security alert into the subscriber's account records, along with the object identification information. The logging operation can be used to create a security record and also for billing purposes.","As a result of the security alert sent by the security administration system , the subscriber will be provided with very specific information about the nature of the security breach. In particular, because the object identification information is provisioned by the subscriber, it can be personalized in a way that allows the subscriber to gauge their response to the security alert according to the information provided. For example, a young mother on a warm summer day may wish to attach one movement detecting and signal transmitting means  to the baby's crib during nap time, and another movement detecting and signal transmitting means  to a partially open window in the baby's room. Upon receipt of the security alert, the mother will know from the object identification information that the alert is either the result of the baby waking up and jostling the crib or a potentially serious security breach due to an intruder attempting to raise the baby's window.","As will now be described with reference to the flow diagram of , it is very simple for a subscriber to provision each of their movement detecting and signal transmitting means  as these devices are attached to different objects. A network-attached computing device and a few moments of time to fill in an online form are all that is required. In step  of the provisioning process, the subscriber initiates contact with the computer host  and the latter establishes a communication session. In step , the computer host  prompts the subscriber for registration information (e.g., user name and password) if they have an existing account, or to set up a new account if the subscriber is not yet registered. If, in step , the subscriber indicates that they need to set up a new account, the computer host  engages the subscriber in an account setup dialog in step . This will establish a record of such information as the subscriber's name, billing address, login name, password, and an authentication identifier associated with the subscriber's receiver means . The subscriber will preferably also be requested to accept a subscription agreement. The computer host  will then create one or more account records in the subscriber database of the data storage resource , and if necessary, reserve storage space for the subscriber's provisioning information.","Following registration in step , or if the subscriber previously provided a registration number in step , the computer host  initiates a provisioning session in step . The provisioning session can be implemented in a variety of ways, but preferably involves the subscriber filling in fields in an on-line graphical form. Thus, in step , the computer host  presents the subscriber with a web page or the like containing a listing of one or more movement detecting and signal transmitting means  that can be provisioned. Each line of the listing will include a field specifying the unique identifier associated with the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , an optional field containing the device's object identification information, an optional field for entering contact information. When the subscriber first registers for service, the listing will be blank. For registered subscribers who have previously provisioned their movement detecting and signal transmitting means , the listing will show the subscriber's current provisioning information. The subscriber then updates the listing to suit their current needs.","In step , the subscriber signifies that they have finished updating their provisioning information by submitting the online form. The computer host  then implements a CGI script or the like to process the form information in step  and update the subscriber's database information. Thereafter, the computer host  can terminate the provisioning session in step . Alternatively, an optional step  can first be performed in which the computer host  initiates a communication session with the subscriber's receiver means . The purpose of this session is to download the subscriber's provisioning information to the look-up table  in the receiver means  so that local conversion of unique identifiers to object identification information can be performed.","It will be appreciated that step  could be eliminated in implementations of the alarm system  where the receiver means  is configured to allow the subscriber to provision the look-up table  by hand. In particular, the receiver means  could be provided with a data entry interface, such as a keypad and a display (not shown), that allows the subscriber to program object identification information into the look-up table  (see ) via the control logic . The receiver means  could also be provided with an audio recording system (not shown) that allows the subscriber to record object identification information as a series of audio messages that are each associated with a unique identifier in the look-up table .","Having now described various security functions of the alarm system set forth in the embodiments above, it is important to note that the alarm system could be adapted for additional purposes, such as industrial process monitoring and measurements. This functionality could be provided by modifying the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  so that it produces an output indicating a distance that the retractable wire means  moves relative to the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  once the device has been set (see ). This measurement feature could be for such functions as industrial tank expansion measurement, and the like. The measurement feature could be readily implemented with relatively minimal modification of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . For example, the field sensor  and the closing contact  of  could be implemented as a reed switch that will open and close as the magnets  pass by. Either the control logic  of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  or the control logic  of the receiver means  can be programmed to count the number of pulses represented by each magnet  passing by the field sensor . Each pulse would be associated with a distance that the retractable wire means  moves relative to the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . The total number of pulses would thus correspond to the total distance moved. The distance could be reset to zero when the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is set, following which distance monitoring would begin. Another implementation option would be to use optical counting by installing an optical source\/detector pair in the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  and an optical signal modulator. The optical signal modulator could be an optical medium that is encoded with alternating light\/dark bars, bar codes, etc. and which moves relative to the source\/detector pair in response to motion of the retractable wire means , so as to thereby modulate the optical signal. The components used in a computer mouse pointing device represent one optical technology that could be used. The measurement information can be output locally by the receiver means  in audible or visual form, or it can be sent to a remote location using any of the communication modalities discussed above, including telephone, network, cable, radio\/cellular communication, etc. Once the receiver means  outputs its message to the remote location, the remote location can respond to the message in various ways, including (1) messaging response instructions back to the receiver means  for forwarding to the signaling movement detecting and signal transmitting means  or any of its counterparts, (2) forwarding a customized message to a designated forwarding location, (3) taking any other appropriate action.","It should further be noted that a process measuring implementation of the invention may require consideration of environmental factors that lead to a change in the materials used to construct the various components of the alarm system. For example, it may be desirable to water-proof the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  for outdoor use. Similarly, will be understood that the retractable wire means  can be made from a variety of materials, including thread or string, synthetic line (e.g. fishing line), or more durable materials such as steel, tungsten, or the like for high heat use.","Thus far in the description of the alarm system , the motion sensing function of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  has been implemented using a retractable wire means. Among the several advantages of this design relative to conventional security devices is that objects being sensed do not have to be placed in a home or reference position in order to arm the system. A typical home security system requires that all doors and windows be closed before the system can be armed. In contrast, the present alarm system  allows objects to be in any position at the time of arming. One simply extends the retractable wire means as necessary to reach the object's current position. In further exemplary embodiments of the invention, the foregoing and other advantages are provided by way of a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  that can be implemented without the use of retractable wires. In particular, a gyroscope sensor or an accelerometer sensor (or an array of such sensors) may be used for inertial sensing by incorporating the sensor in a suitable housing that is adapted to be removably secured, as by way of adhesive strips or other attachment means, to an object whose movement is to be sensed. Incorporating inertial sensing means that the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  can be more compact and less expensive than other designs. Moreover, the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is more versatile because it can be mounted directly to an object while it is in any position and used to detect movement in any direction (x, y and z axis), and in many cases rotation and tilt as well. Inertial sensing thus holds promise for a myriad of potential applications in which sensing intelligence is applied to inanimate objects of all shapes and dimensions, such as position sensing for various structures, process monitoring of volatile liquids or the like, location detection, safety and security, and other uses.","Gyroscopes have been used to detect the yaw, pitch and roll of airplanes, boats and space craft for many years. In the context of the present invention, one or more gyroscope sensors incorporated in the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  can be used to generate a signal corresponding to motion of an object to which the means  is attached. Once motion is applied to the object, the gyroscope sensor's output will change. The degree of change can be compared to the gyroscope sensor's last memory state and an algorithm may be used to determine the significant difference of the degree of movement. This facilitates determination of the type of event that disturbed the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . For example, the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  can now distinguish between a knock on a door or window and the opening thereof. If the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  vibrates, but is otherwise stationary, the algorithm will produce an output having one set of characteristics (e.g., a high frequency signal pattern). If the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is translated in space, the output will have a different set of characteristics (e.g., a low frequency signal pattern).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["20","20","400","400"]},"The gyroscope sensors A and B are mounted on a first component board , along with a communication module  and a battery pack  that comprises one or more batteries preferably producing about 3 volts DC or better. The gyroscope sensors A and B can be implemented using a Micro Gyro 100 gyroscopic sensor available from Gyration, Inc. of Saratoga, Calif. The communication module  may be implemented using the RF transmitter  of  or equivalent. It may also include the RF receiver  of  or equivalent. An integrated RF transmitter\/receiver may also be used, such as the RFM TR100 916.5 MHz hybrid transceiver (up to 1 Mbps data rate) available from RF Monolithics, Inc. of Dallas, Tex. Alternatively, instead of an RF transceiver, the communication module  could be constructed as an Infrared (IR) transceiver for \u201cline-of-sight\u201d communication with the receiver means . The battery pack  can be implemented using two 1.5 volt \u201cAA\u201d size batteries or equivalent.","A second component board  carries a patch antenna . The first component board  is overlaid onto the second component board , and the combination is mounted into a suitable housing (not shown) that may be similar in shape to unit shown in  comprising the casing  and the rear panel , albeit of smaller size insofar as there is no need for the retractable wire and magnet components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0149"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 23"],"b":["400","400","404","406","20","414","416","406","414","418"]},"In particular, the microcontroller  includes a memory for storing a unique identifier that uniquely identifies the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  during security operations. When an object to which the means  is attached is moved, the ASIC  passes coordinate values associated with the gyroscope sensors A and B to the microcontroller . The microcontroller  provides the coordinate values together with the unique identifier associated with the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  to the communication module  for transmission to the receiver means . The receiver means  is preferably implemented according to the configuration shown in  to include the control logic  and the data store . In addition to storing the unique identifier for the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , the data store  preferably maintains a set of last-known coordinate values for the movement detecting and signal transmitting means. The control logic  compares the received coordinate values against the stored last-known coordinate values. If a threshold coordinate change has occurred, signifying translation or rotation of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , the receiver means initiates an appropriate response. For example, if the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is attached to a back door with coordinates X, Y, Z, a slight movement of the door will change the coordinates to X, Y, Z. The movement detecting and signal transmitting means  will transmit these coordinate values to the receiver means . If the change in any of the x, y or z coordinates exceeds some movement threshold, the receiver means  can initiate a security response that may include the audible announcement \u201cBACK DOOR!\u201d.","It will be appreciated that the coordinate value comparisons could also be made by the microcontroller  within the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  itself. In that case, the receiver means  would only be contacted when the movement threshold is exceeded. Moreover, instead of forwarding coordinate information to the receiver means , any suitable alarm indicating signal could be sent to trigger a security response. This signal could be nothing more than the unique identifier for the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , or could include additional status information, such as a status code indicating the type of movement (e.g., vibration, translation, tilt, etc.).","As indicated above, the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  may also be implemented using accelerometer sensing. This approach is typically less sensitive than gyroscopic sensing, but the sensor requires less power and is generally more durable. There are various accelerometer designs that may be used in the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . One design is based on a conventional MEMS (Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems) accelerometer, such as the ADXL202E product from Analog Devices, Inc. This accelerometer is commonly used in automotive alarms. It measures acceleration along two geometric axes and outputs analog voltage or digital signals whose duty cycles are proportional to acceleration. The duty cycle outputs can be directly measured by a microprocessor counter, without an AID converter or glue logic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0153"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["20","450","450","452","452","454","30","452","30","454"]},"Another type of accelerometer that may be used in the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is a piezoelectric film accelerometer. The advantage of this construction relative to MEMS accelerometers is that it requires no power, is more durable, and usually has a lower cost. A piezoelectric film accelerometer is conventionally constructed as a flat plate shear (FPS) system in which a mass is bonded to one surface of a film of piezoelectric material while the other surface of the piezoelectric film is bonded to a fixed mounting surface. This configuration is shown in the accelerometer sensor  of . In this sensor, element  is the mass, element  is the piezoelectric film, and element  is the fixed surface. As the mass  is acted upon by a uniaxial acceleration (shown by the double-headed arrow ill ), its momentum shears the crystal matrix of the piezoelectric film  between the mass and the mounting surface . This causes a corresponding voltage to be generated by the piezoelectric film .","In , an alternative sensor  is shown that applicants have constructed using a conventional piezoelectric audio transducer (e.g., buzzer)  of the type used in personal computers to generate audible beeps. Such transducers have been used in the past as vibration sensors. To make the transducer  sensitive to inertial movement, a mass  is added to the brass diaphragm portion  thereof, on the opposite side to which the piezoelectric element portion  of the transducer is mounted. The sensitivity of the sensor  to accelerating force is primarily normal to the plane of the diaphragm , as shown by the long double-headed arrow in  (out-of-plane acceleration). In addition, because the center of gravity of the mass  will be spaced from the center of gravity of the piezoelectric element  (depending on the out-of-plane height of the mass), the sensor  is also sensitive to acceleration parallel to the plane of the diaphragm , as shown by the short double headed arrow in  (in-plane acceleration). Acceleration of the mass  in this direction causes it to cantilever relative to the piezoelectric element , causing distortions therein that produce an electrical output.","The mass  can be added to the sensor  in various ways. For example, it can be formed as a quantity of glue, solder or other material that is applied as a drop, or deposited as a film, to the diaphragm . The mass  can also be added by securing a solid object, such as a flat disk or washer (or any other suitable shape) made from steel or other material to the diaphragm . This approach is shown in  in which the mass  is a steel disk that is glued to the diaphragm . Note that the mass  is concentrically mounted relative to the piezoelectric element  and that the diameter of the mass is selected to coincide with the diameter of the piezoelectric element. Although not shown, the bond between the mass  and the diaphragm  extends under the entire surface area of the piezoelectric element . This construction maximizes the distortional effect that the mass  has on the piezoelectric element  as it cantilevers (shearing force) relative thereto. If the mass  is made smaller than the surface area of the piezoelectric element , it may tend to distort a smaller portion thereof, thus reducing the electrical output. It will be further appreciated that if the dimension of the mass  is increased the direction normal to the plane of the diaphragm , its center of gravity will be moved further away from the piezoelectric element . This will tend to increase the cantilever (shearing force) effect of the mass  on the piezoelectric element  and increase the sensitivity of the sensor  to in-plane acceleration.","In tests conducted by applicants using a conventional piezoelectric audio transducer, model number CEP-1126 from CUI, Inc. of Beaverton, Oreg., adding 9-15 grams of mass to the sensor  (a steel washer bonded to the diaphragm ) was found to be effective, with better performance being obtained as the mass is increased. The actual mass amounts that will be suitable for other types of piezoelectric transducers will no doubt vary, but may be determined through routine experimentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 27","FIG. 28"],"b":["520","510","514","522","522","524","522","524","522","524","520","522","522","520"]},"Advantageously, the sensors  and  are relatively immune to noise. Additional noise resistance can be obtained by performing double integration (with respect to time) on the output signal to transform the acceleration signal first to a velocity signal and then to a displacement signal. By sampling both the displacement signal and the raw acceleration signal, it is also possible to make determinations as to whether the sensor  was triggered by vibration (e.g., a knock on a door) or long wave motion (e.g., the door is opening). In particular, the presence of an acceleration output without a displacement output would signify vibration only. The presence of an acceleration output and a displacement output would signify long wave motion. Note that the velocity signal could also be sampled for applications such as process monitoring wherein monitoring the rate of movement is important.","One advantage of the sensor  is that its sensitivity to acceleration is two dimensional. It will be appreciated, however, that even though the sensors  and  sense acceleration in one primary direction, either sensor can be oriented in a manner that allows it to sense an object's movement in two or even three directions. This can be done by orienting the sensor obliquely to the directions of interest. Movement in any one of the directions will then produce an acceleration component in the sensor's primary sensing direction. For example, if sensing in the x, y and z directions is desired, the sensor could be oriented so as to lie at 45 degrees in the x-y plane and 45 degrees in the y-z plane. Of course, an array of multiple sensors can always be used to measure acceleration in multiple directions.","Turning now to , a schematic illustration of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is shown with an inertial sensor unit  incorporated therein. The sensor unit  can be implemented with one or more of the piezoelectric sensors ,  or  described above, or with any other suitable accelerometer or gyroscope sensor.  also illustrates a microprocessor , an RF transceiver , and a battery\/power supply module . The microprocessor  is shown by way of example only to be implemented as an MSP430F148 mixed signal microcontroller IC from Texas Instruments, Inc. of Dallas Tex.

These values can be forwarded by the RF transceiver  to the receiver means , for comparison with corresponding last-known coordinate values in the manner described above. A unique identifier for the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is also sent. As described above, the comparison can be performed alternatively by the microprocessor . In that case, the receiver means  is only notified if a threshold change in position has been detected. No coordinate data needs to be sent. The movement detecting and signal transmitting means  only needs to send its unique identifier, and possibly optional status information, such as status code that specifies the type of motion (e.g., vibration, translation, rotation or some other external condition that triggered the sensor.

This double integration of the acceleration signal from the sensor ,  or  provides the desired output that corresponds to displacement. A sensing threshold circuit can be provided by the two operational amplifiers UA, UB and two resistors R, R, which can be variable if it desired to allow manual threshold adjustments. The output of the sensor unit  is delivered to the jack J, which is used to connect the sensor unit to the microprocessor .","The threshold circuits allow positive and negative displacement thresholds to be set for any given sensor of the sensor unit  so that no output from that sensor is produced until an object's movement reaches a specified level. Note that positive and negative displacement thresholds can be set independently of each other in case it is desired to have the displacement threshold in one direction be different from the displacement threshold in an opposite direction. The displacement thresholds can be used to prevent insignificant noise outputs from being sent to the microprocessor . They can also be used to distinguish between small amplitude vibrations (e.g., a knock on a door) and large amplitudes displacements (e.g., a door opening). If it is desired to sense both vibrations and displacements, an additional pair of threshold circuits (not shown) could be provided along with a second output jack (not shown). One threshold circuit could be set to respond to vibrations while the other is set to respond to displacements. Alternatively, the single threshold circuit of  could be used, with the signal into the threshold circuit being compared with the signal out of the threshold circuit. If there is an input signal but no output signal, it may be concluded that the object being monitored is experiencing low amplitude vibration. If the input signal is the same as the output signal, it may be concluded that the object is experiencing large amplitude displacement. Another way to distinguish between vibrations and translations would be to provide frequency dependent circuitry for selectively sensing short wave motion (vibrations) from long wave motion (translations).","An optional light emitting diode D may be incorporated in the circuit to provide a visual indication that the sensor unit  has been disturbed by a motion in excess of the established thresholds. It will be seen that  also shows components of the power supply  that are used to provide the voltages \u201cVA\u201d and \u201cVREF\u201d used by the components of the sensing unit .","Turning now to , a modified version of the alarm system  is illustrated with additional wireless components not shown in .

The information gathering device  of  is assigned to one or more of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . When any of such devices sense motion and transmit their unique identifier to the receiver means , the information gathering device  will also receive the message. The information gathering device  will begin transmitting images\/video (and possibly audio information) to the receiver means , which is preferably configured to act as a remote notification device  as shown in . Note that the information gathering device  can also be activated by the receiver means , for periodic monitoring or if it is desired to have the receiver means  act as an intermediary between the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  and the information gathering device . In the latter scenario, the movement detecting and signal transmitting means would pass its unique identifier to the receiver means , which would then communicate with the information gathering device , instructing it to commence its information gathering function.","Two new components are also added to the alarm system  of ; namely, a remote speaker system , and an environmental monitor . Both of these devices can be removably mounted at a desired location, as by adhesive strips or the like.  also shows an embodiment of the remote control unit  (which can be implemented as a key fob) in which there are three function buttons.","The speaker system  is adapted to produce an audio output in response to a wireless signal sent by the receiver means .

The audio output of the speaker system  may include any combination of tones, speech or otherwise. Although one speaker system  is shown in , there could be any number of such systems placed at any desired location within range of the receiver means  (e.g., RF range for radio signals, line of sight for IR signals, etc.). One or more of these speaker systems could be activated at any given time.

The receiver means  can also send a code word that specifies a message to be played, such as \u201cBACK DOOR!,\u201d depending on which movement detecting and signal transmitting means  was activated. The word code could also specify one of several languages to be used for the output (e.g., English, Spanish, German, etc.). The microprocessor  uses the word code to instruct the audio processor  to select the appropriate sound file, e.g., \u201cBACK DOOR!\u201d, from the audio file storage . Note that the number of words associated with each word code is limited only by the storage capacity of the audio file storage . However, a six-word audio message (optionally stored in several languages) should be sufficient for most purposes.","A security state code can also be sent by the receiver means  to indicate how the audio output should be generated.

The microprocessor  in the speaker system  uses the security state code to modify the speaker system's audio output according to the corresponding security state. For example, assume a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is mounted on the back door of a premises. When the back door opens, the speaker system  might announce \u201cBACK DOOR!\u201d a single time if the movement detecting and signal transmitting means is currently assigned the \u201cANNOUNCE\u201d state.

The output of the sensor unit  is provided to the microprocessor , which is programmed to interpret the sensor's output and produce environmentally-related status information for transmission to the receiver means  via the RF transceiver . This could include one or more status codes representing information about an external condition being sensed, such as elevated temperature, smoke level, carbon monoxide level, hydrocarbon level, etc. A unique identifier for the environmental monitor  is also sent.

If desired, the environmental monitor  could also implement a local audio alert system, such as a beeper as used in a conventional smoke detector.","It should be noted that the functions provided by the environmental monitor  could also be provided by any or all of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . For example, if a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  is constructed according to , it would be relatively easy to incorporate one or more additional sensors for detecting smoke, heat, carbon monoxide, etc. When a sensing event occurs (e.g., vibration, long wave motion, smoke, heat, carbon monoxide, etc.), the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  could send an appropriately coded message to the receiver means containing status codes for the sensors that were triggered.","The remote control unit  is shown in  to have three switches A, B and C. The switch A can be used to provide the \u201cPANIC\u201d button described above in connection with . In particular, the alarm system  will immediately initiate an alarm response. The switch B can be used as a \u201cHOLD\u201d button that disarms the alarm system  for some period of time. For example, activating the switch B once could delay alarm activation for sixteen seconds, activating the switch B twice could delay alarm activation forty-eight seconds, and so on. The \u201cHOLD\u201d button can thus be used to allow entry into a premises without immediately triggering an alarm, and allowing sufficient time to disable the alarm system .

This circuit becomes activated when the remote control unit  is brought into proximity with one of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means . It can thus be used when a person wishes to disturb a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  without generating a security response. When activated in this manner, the RFID circuit will provide the remote control unit's unique identifier (as an RFID tag) to movement detecting and signal transmitting means . If the latter is thereafter triggered within some period of time, it will append the RFID tag to its own transmission to the receiver means . The receiver means  can test the RFID tag to determine what response should be made (e.g., according to whether the remote control unit  is \u201cRESTRICTED\u201d or \u201cUNRESTRICTED,\u201d as described in more detail below).","The receiver means  of  acts as a central base station when used in the alarm system . Its primary function is to wait for coded messages transmitted wirelessly from the various components of the alarm system . In , this would include both of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means , the environmental monitor , the remote control unit , and the information gathering device . All of these components may be referred to as \u201ctriggers\u201d because they communicate events to the receiver means  that cause a security response to be triggered. The security response may include playing prerecorded announcements and initiating a notification sequence that reports security information to the security administration system , or to any other specified endpoint (e.g., telephone number, IP address, email address, etc.). How the receiver means  responds is determined by the security state of the triggering device (see above) and the operating mode of the receiver means.","These modes include a \u201cHOME\u201d state, an \u201cAWAY\u201d state, and a \u201cPANIC\u201d state. The \u201cPANIC\u201d state has been referred to above. It causes the receiver means  to immediately initiate an alarm response that results in appropriate security alert measures being taken, such as generating audio alarm messages and sending a security notification to a remote location, such as the security administration system . The \u201cHOME\u201d state means that the receiver means  responds to the various triggers based solely on their programmed security state, i.e., \u201cANNOUNCE,\u201d \u201cALERT\u201d or \u201cALARM.\u201d The \u201cAWAY\u201d state means that all triggers are set to the \u201cALARM\u201d state.","An additional alternative for the receiver means  is to provide a \u201cQUIET\u201d mode as part of any or all of the \u201cHOME,\u201d \u201cAWAY\u201d and \u201cPANIC\u201d states.

How the \u201cQUIET\u201d mode changes the audible alerts can be programmed independently for each trigger and each security state thereof (i.e., \u201cANNOUNCE,\u201d \u201cALERT\u201d or \u201cALARM\u201d), or can be set collectively for all triggers and security states. Note that if the \u201cQUIET\u201d mode is set for a trigger's \u201cALARM\u201d state, the trigger will act as a silent alarm.","The coded messages from the triggers will preferably include a unique identifier or \u201cTrigger ID\u201d and a status code that indicates the cause of the event that occurred. For the remote control unit , the status code will represent activation of the \u201cHOLD,\u201d \u201cAWAY\u201d or \u201cPANIC\u201d buttons described above. For other triggers the status code will usually represent some external condition, such as a sharp short vibration, a long waved motion, a temperature reading, a smoke reading, a temperature reading, a carbon monoxide reading, a hydrocarbon reading, etc. As described above, all triggers can also sense and report internal conditions. The status codes may thus represent a \u201cLOW BATTERY,\u201d condition, a \u201cHEART BEAT\u201d signal, a time, date, or temperature condition, etc. A \u201cLOW BATTERY\u201d status code can be sent by a trigger to advise the receiver means  that the trigger's battery needs to be replaced. A \u201cHEART BEAT\u201d status code can be sent periodically by each trigger to advise the receiver means  that it is fully operational. If the receiver means  stops receiving an expected \u201cHEART BEAT\u201d status code due to some problem at a trigger (low battery, hardware or software failure, etc.), a security response can be taken. This could include playing an announcement (e.g., \u201cCOMMUNICATION WITH BACK DOOR HAS ENDED\u201d) and\/or reporting the event to the security administration system . A time, date or temperature status code can be sent by a trigger when reporting some external event to provide additional information that may be useful in interpreting the event, maintaining event statistics, etc. Note, that as an alternative to a trigger providing time and date information, the receiver means  could be programmed to record a time and date stamp as each external event is reported by a trigger.","The receiver means  can be programmed to equate the status codes with event response actions and with human recognizable events and conditions, such as knocking on a door (short vibration status code), opening a door or window (long wave motion status code), fire (temperature status code), smoke (smoke status code), an improperly vented furnace (carbon monoxide status code), a gas leak (hydrocarbon status code), nonfunctional trigger, etc. This allows the receiver means  to report conditions in human recognizable form.

Once the receiver means  has completed servicing that trigger\/status code, its associated ATTRIBUTE bit is reset. This prevents the receiver means  from taking multiple response actions for what is essentially the same trigger event. Note that other status codes from the same trigger are not precluded. Thus, even though a vibration status code received from a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  (e.g., there is a knock on a door) will be ignored when the corresponding ATTRIBUTE bit is set for that trigger, a translation status code received from the same trigger (e.g., the door is now opening) will not be ignored.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0187"},"figref":["FIG. 34B","FIG. 29A","FIG. 34B"],"b":["802","802","554","20","802","600","30","802","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0188"},"figref":"FIG. 34C","b":"804"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0190","num":"0189"},"figref":["FIG. 34D","FIG. 17"],"b":["806","30","600","807","800","800","614","600","807","236","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0191","num":"0190"},"figref":["FIG. 34E","FIG. 20","FIG. 21"],"b":["808","808","800","809","809","809","260","30","260","30"]},"Although the telephone connection circuit  shown in  implements a POTS line interface, it will be appreciated that a cellular telephone module could be provided in lieu of or in addition to the POTS interface, as could an ISDN interface, a cable interface, a DSL interface, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 34F","b":["810","810","2","30","800","30","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0194","num":"0193"},"figref":"FIG. 34G","b":["812","812","1","30","800","30","90"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 34H","b":["814","814","5","815","815","814","30"]},"Except for the manner in which the microprocessor  is programmed, all of the above-mentioned components of the receiver means  of  are conventional in nature.

Alternatively, the ACS  could wait for a timeout period while the receiver means  attempts to resend, and then hang up. In either case, the receiver means  will retransmit one or more times. If repeated retransmissions (e.g., three times) fail to produce a successful result and the ACS  terminates communication, the event can be reported to an ACS administrator. If the transmission is validated in step , the transmission stream is accepted in step . In step  the data received in the transmission is sent to the database in the data storage resource  (see ). This could be in the form of an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) document, an SQL (Sort Query Logic) statement or any other suitable query technique. In step , the database engine matches the Base Station ID to a corresponding entry in the database. If, in step , there is no such entry, step  is performed and an ACS administrator is notified.","If a match is found for the Base Station ID in step , a test is made in step  (see ) to determine if the customer's account is up to date. If it is not, appropriate processing is performed in step  to notify the customer of the delinquency. If the customer's account is up to date, step  is performed and the Trigger ID is sent to the database to obtain a customer profile, including a list of telephone numbers (or other contact information) to be called to deliver notification of the security event to specified recipients. Note that a customer profile can include a telephone number listing for each trigger. This reflects the fact that triggers will be attached to different objects and the notification recipients may differ for each object. Thus, the notification recipients for a dwelling door may be completely different from the recipients associated with a jewelry box. The dwelling door notification recipients might be a neighbor, a family member and the customer's work telephone. The jewelry box notification recipients could be the customer's work telephone, the customer's cellular telephone, and the police. Note that the customer profile information may also include a language code for each recipient specifying a language (e.g., English, Spanish, German), to use for contacting each recipient.","In step , the customer profile information, together with the Base Station ID, the Trigger ID, the status code(s) and the word codes are used by the ACS  to initiate a notification sequence to the recipients in step . Three options are available. The first option, as shown at step , is to initiate a call attempt to each designated recipient (e.g., four) until a successful call completion and security notification is achieved. If all call attempts fail, a default action may be invoked, such as notifying an emergency response agency or handing off security notification responsibility to a human operator. The second option, as shown in step , is to call all recipients simultaneously. This may be desirable for PANIC situations. The third option, as shown in step , is to conference all recipients together for joint determination as to what response should be taken.","For each of the above three call options, the call sequence could begin with a greeting (in a specified language) that announces the ACS  followed by a prompt (e.g., \u201cPress 1\u201d) to confirm to the ACS that a human has answered the call. For the first option of step , the ACS  can prompt for a password from the first person called. If the password is not entered, signifying that an unauthorized individual has answered the call, or that a possible hostage situation exists, the ACS  can hang up and try the remaining call recipients (with or without requiring a password). Assuming a human answers the call from the ACS, and provides a password if requested to do so, the ACS will play a security notification to the call recipient, such as: \u201c123 Happy Dale Lane\u201d (the customer's address), \u201cKnock at Back Door\u201d (status code and word codes). The ACS  can then provide a series of response options, such as \u201cPress 1 for Police; Press 2 for Fire Department; Press 3 for [Other]\u201d. Again, the language used for the notification can be specified as customer profile information.","Step  represents the termination of each of the calls according to the three options of steps ,  and . For the options of steps  and , the ACS will direct the call to the designated recipient after receiving the inputs ,  or , and then terminate the call. For the option of step , the ACS  will terminate the call after the last member of the conference has disconnected.","An additional function that may be provided by the ACS  is to download security or other information to the receiver means . This information would typically not involve any specific events taking place within the alarm system , but would pertain to outside events, such as security notifications from a governmental agency like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. By way of example, only, a color-code warning in accordance with the Homeland Security Advisory System could be sent to all receiver means  served by the ACS . On a more general note, the ACS  could also be used to provide commercial information, such as promotional offers, advertisements and the like, to the receiver means . Such information could be coded by category and users of the receiver means  could input a unique subscriber code that is linked to one or more category codes. In that way, each person could receive information content that is of personal interest to them from receiver means .","Turning now to , a piezoelectric inertial sensor  is shown that may be used in a further embodiment of a movement detecting and transmitting means according to the invention. The sensor  is similar to the sensor  of  except that the mass  is replaced with a mass  that is inherently unstable and unbalanced. The mass  is mounted to a conventional piezoelectric audio transducer  that includes a flexible, free moving brass diaphragm  carrying a piezoelectric element  on one side thereof. Electrical leads  and  are respectively connected to the brass diaphragm  and the piezoelectric element . Although the mass  is shown to be secured to the brass diaphragm  in , it could be alternatively secured to the piezoelectric element .","The mass  is comprised of a primary mass element  and a secondary mass element . The primary mass element  is spherical in shape and can be implemented as a steel ball bearing that, by way of example only, is approximately 9-15 grams in weight. The primary mass element  is secured to the transducer  to provide a coupling connection . The coupling connection  can be implemented by way of adhesive bonding or using any other suitable securement technique. Preferably, the coupling connection  has a small surface area. This makes the mass  inherently unstable because any slight acceleration in the principal plane of the transducer  will impart a rolling motion to the mass  due to inertial effects. The arrows \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d in  illustrate the directional plane of acceleration that causes the aforementioned rolling motion.  is a top plan view of the sensor  looking down on the mass . It further shows the periphery of the brass diaphragm  being mounted to a conventional support ring housing  of the type usually associated with piezoelectric audio transducers. This ensures there will be adequate clearance for distortional movement of the brass diaphragm  that will not be constrained by a surface or other structure on which the sensor  would be mounted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0217","num":"0216"},"figref":["FIGS. 41A","FIG. 41C"],"b":["41","41","1112","1118","1102","1104","1112","1104","1118","1106","1108","1118","1108","1118","1114","1118","1102","1104","1106","1108"]},"Although not shown, another shape that could be used to provide an unstable mass for the sensor  is a pyramid with its apex attached to the transducer. Still another shape that could provide an unstable mass would be a large diameter cylinder or disk mounted to the transducer  by way of a small diameter post. Additional shapes will no doubt become apparent to persons skilled in the art in view of the teachings herein, and all such shapes should be considered to be included within the scope of the present invention.","As shown in , the sensor  is also sensitive to motion in the direction shown by the arrows \u201cZ\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d due to the fact that the brass diaphragm  can be readily flexed in this direction to strain the piezoelectric element . As additionally shown in , there is also good sensitivity to rotational motion (in the direction shown by the arrows \u201cR\u201d). This is due to fact that the mass  is not only unstable by virtue of the coupling connection  to the transducer , it is also unbalanced due to the secondary mass element . The secondary mass element  can be implemented using a steel ball bearing that is secured to or integrated with the primary mass element . The secondary mass element  is located on one side of the central orthogonal axis that extends through a center of gravity of the primary mass element (i.e., along the arrows \u201cZ\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d in ), preferably at or near the equator (widest diameter portion) of the primary mass element. As shown in , when the sensor  is rotated in direction of the arrows \u201cR\u201d, the secondary mass element  tends to inertially resist rotation of the primary mass element , creating a shearing force at the coupling connection  where the latter is affixed to the transducer . It will be appreciated that there are other shapes which be used in lieu of the spherical secondary mass element , just as there are other shapes that may be used to implement the primary mass element . All such shapes are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, insofar as production implementations of the presently described inertial sensor may feature a single integrated mass that combines the functions of the primary and secondary mass elements, it will be appreciated that any number of integrated shapes could be selected and used for this purpose. These shapes will preferably be non-symmetrical to provide unstable\/unbalanced masses, but unstable\/balanced masses could also be used. Many different material choices exist.","Turning now to , the sensor  is shown to be implemented in a movement detecting and signal transmitting means arranged in a compact button-shaped construction . In the construction , the sensor  is mounted in the support ring housing . The latter includes mounting tabs  that are secured onto conventional mounting clips  extending from a circuit board . The circuit board  mounts circuit components of the type described above in previous embodiments for processing the output signal of the sensor . The circuit board  can also mount transceiver components for communicating with the receiver means . Alternatively, transceiver circuitry could be eliminated if stand-alone sensing is desired with a local sensing output only, or if the sensor  is being used as a switch to control a device (see below).","A battery  is mounted on the opposite side of the circuit board  to power the circuitry thereon. The circuit board  and all of its mounted components are placed within a main housing . The main housing  includes an upper cover , and a lower cover . The lower cover  is removable to allow access to the batter  for replacement thereof. The upper cover  can also be configured for removability, i.e., by virtue of threads , if desired. An adhesive member  is mounted to the outer side of the lower cover  to facilitate affixation of the construction  to an object whose motion is to be sensed.","Note that miniaturization of the construction  could be achieved by using the support ring housing  of the sensor  as a main housing. In that case, however, the circuit and battery components would have to be small enough to fit within the available footprint.","Turning now to , the present invention may be embodied in a portable security kit . The kit  includes a receiver means , a remote control unit  implemented as a key fob or the like, and plural movement detecting and signal transmitting means  implemented using the construction  (or any other suitable construction). The foregoing components are seated in a portable carrying case , along with product instructions .","Accordingly, a portable security alarm system has been shown and described. While the invention has been described in conjunction with various embodiments, they are illustrative only, and it will be appreciated that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to persons skilled in the art in light of the foregoing detailed description. For example, the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  could be provided using another alternative implementation based on a magnetic field sensor, such as the KMZ51 Magnetic Field Sensor available from Philips Semiconductors of Eindhoven, Netherlands.","The KMZ51 sensor can be used for electronic compass applications or to sense local magnetic fields. In a compass application, the KMZ51 sensor is oriented parallel to the Earth's surface and produces a signal output when its rotates relative to the Earth's magnetic poles. If two KMZ51 sensors are placed in orthogonal relationship to each other, a precise azimuth measurement can be obtained. A KMZ52 sensor, also from Philips Semiconductors, may also be used insofar as it incorporates two mutually orthogonal magnetic field sensors.","The foregoing sensors would be ideal for a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  mounted on an object that is expected to undergo rotational or pivotal movement, such as a door.  illustrates such a movement detecting and signal transmitting means  constructed as a modified version of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  shown in . In particular, there is a microprocessor , an RF transceiver , a battery\/power supply module , and a magnetic field sensor unit . The microprocessor  is shown by way of example only to be implemented as an MSP430F148 mixed signal microcontroller IC from Texas Instruments, Inc. of Dallas Tex. The RF transceiver  is shown by way of example only to be implemented as a TRF6901 RF-transceiver IC from Texas Instruments, Inc. Other like-kind devices could also be respectively used to implement the microprocessor  and the RF transceiver .","The magnetic field sensor unit  could be implemented using a single magnetic field sensor (such as the KMZ51) to detect rotational movement without necessarily quantifying the amount of rotation. Alternatively, the magnetic field sensor unit could be constructed more elaborately using two KMZ51 sensors, or a single KMZ52 sensor, to both detect and quantify rotational movement. Again, all of the components of the movement detecting and signal transmitting means  of  can be housed in a case that can be removably mounted at a desired location using adhesive strips or other means.","Additional advantage can be obtained if a magnetic field sensor is combined with an inertial sensor (e.g., a gyroscope sensor or an accelerometer sensor) in a single movement detecting and signal transmitting means  mounted on an object that is capable of pivotal or rotational movement, such as a door.  shows this construction in which the inertial sensor unit  of  is combined with the magnetic field sensor unit . In this configuration, the magnetic field sensor can be used to verify events being sensed by the inertial sensor, and visa versa. Following are scenarios in which these sensor properties can be used to characterize the cause of a sensing event on a pivotable or rotatable object:\n\n","Note that the foregoing scenarios can be performed with a gyroscopic sensor, or an accelerometer sensor or some other type of inertial sensor being used in lieu of a magnetic field sensor, in combination with another inertial sensor adapted to sense vibrations (vibration sensor). By way of example only, the vibration sensor could be implemented using a piezoelectric audio transducer without any additional mass being added thereto, and with the transducer preferably being enclosed in a vacuum environment to screen out spurious influences, such as wind. Associated circuitry would then be programmed to look for signal patterns from the vibration sensor that are indicative of a significant vibration event being experienced by object being monitored, such as a knock on a door. The control circuitry would additionally be programmed to interpret the signal output of the other inertial sensor (e.g., the gyroscope, the accelerometer, etc.) to make a determination about the object's long wave motion.","A further modification according to the invention would be to use an inertial sensor as a switch that activates or deactivates a device. Instead of sending a signal to the receiver means , the inertial sensor would activate or deactivate the device. A wide variety of devices could be activated using an inertial sensor in accordance with the invention, for security purposes or otherwise. These include but are not limited to another sensor within a trigger (such as a power-draining gyroscopic sensor), circuit components with a trigger, as well as handheld tools or other implements that could be conveniently powered on when picked up, etc. Devices that could be deactivated using an inertial sensor would include fire-hazardous equipment that is desirably powered off when excessive motion is present, such as a furnace, hot water heater or the like. The excessive motion could be due to a hurricane, a tornado, an earthquake, or other catastrophic event. It will be appreciated that a sensor used as a switch could communicate wirelessly with the device controlled by the sensor, or by way of a wired connection.","The invention is intended to embrace all such modifications, as well as all other alternatives and variations falling with the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING","p":["The foregoing and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
