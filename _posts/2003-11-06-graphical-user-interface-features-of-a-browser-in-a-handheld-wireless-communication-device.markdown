title: Graphical user interface features of a browser in a hand-held wireless communication device
abstract: A microbrowser in a mobile telephone or other hand-held mobile device generates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) having features that make the device more user-friendly. In one mode, the GUI includes a softkey indicator indicating a corresponding softkey action and an input field for receiving a user-input character string, such as a telephone number. In response to typing in the input field, a softkey action previously associated with the input field, such as a dial action, is automatically selected, and the softkey indicator is automatically changed to indicate the selected action. In another mode, the GUI displays an input field and a menu listing performable actions. In response to a user input representing a single action by the user and designating one of the performable actions, the designated action is selected and the input field is activated, enabling the user to input characters associated with the designated action.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/940,265, filed on Aug. 27, 2001 and entitled, \u201cGraphical User Interface Features of a Browser in a Hand-Held Wireless Communication Device, now abandoned.\u201d","The present invention pertains to wireless communication devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to Graphical User Interface (GUI) features of a microbrowser in a hand-held wireless communication device.","For people and businesses requiring instant access to information, the Internet and intranets have provided a vehicle for near real-time delivery of information from an enormous number of sources. For many of those same individuals, mobile devices such as cellular telephones, two-way pagers, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) have provided a way of communicating regardless of locality. In recent years, Internet technology and mobile computing and communications technologies have begun to merge, to the point where mobile devices such as mobile telephones, PDAs, and pagers are now common entry points to the Internet and intranets.","Devices used to access the Internet (or intranets) generally have certain features in common, whether they sit on a desktop or are held in the palm of the hand. One such feature is that they may be used to display and navigate hypermedia content, such as World Wide Web pages. Such devices normally include software known as a browser, which allows the user to access and navigate hyperlinked content. In a mobile device, this software is sometimes referred to as a microbrowser or minibrowser, because the software consumes much less memory than a conventional PC browser, but it is nonetheless simply a particular type of browser and may be referred to as such.","To access the Internet, network servers and network personal computers (PCs) normally use standard web protocols and mark-up languages, such as hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) and hypertext markup language (HTML), respectively. Mobile devices generally use wireless protocols, such as wireless access protocol (WAP) or handheld device transport protocol (HDTP), and wireless markup languages, such as wireless markup language (WML) and handheld device markup language (HDML), to accomplish the same tasks.","One problem with using mobile devices to access the Internet is the lack of user-friendliness of their user interfaces. Because these devices are designed to be mobile, they normally have very small displays, limited memory, compact keypads and, commonly, only a limited provision for pointer\/cursor movement. These restrictions exist on mobile devices because the mobile devices are designed to be relatively inexpensive and small so as to fit into the palm of the hand. What is needed, therefore, is a mobile device which provides a more user-friendly interface for accessing the Internet or other remote data networks.","In a mobile (e.g., cellular) telephone, because of the small amount of device memory, it is difficult to fit in memory a browser with code for one user interface for browser functions and another, completely separate set of code for a second user interface for telephony functions (e.g., dialing telephone numbers, accessing the telephone's internal address book, and accessing the telephone's settings). It is also difficult for many users to learn two user interfaces if these user interfaces have different end-user features. Therefore, it is desirable on some mobile telephones to leverage the browser's user interface to implement the telephone's user interface, in order to save memory (only one set of user interface code is needed in the telephone) and to reduce end-user confusion (only one user interface is presented to the user).","The present invention includes a method and apparatus for operating a hand-held mobile device. In one embodiment of the method, a softkey indicator indicating a corresponding softkey action is displayed on a display of the hand-held mobile device. An input field is also displayed on the display with the softkey indicator, for receiving characters input by a user using an input device of the hand-held mobile device. In response to detecting activation of the input field, a softkey action previously associated with the input field is automatically selected, and the softkey indicator is automatically changed to indicate the selected softkey action.","In another embodiment of the method, an input field and a menu including a number of actions that can be performed using characters input to the input field are displayed on the display. A user input representing a single action by the user and designating one of the actions in the menu is then received. In response to the user input, the designated action is selected and the input field is activated to enable the user to input characters associated with the designated action.","In another embodiment of the method, the hand-held mobile device communicates with a remote processing system over a wireless network and acquires information associated with a current location of the hand-held mobile device. The hand-held mobile device then displays a hyperlink indicating the location of the device to the user on the display, based on the acquired information.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","A method and apparatus for providing a microbrowser with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in a hand-held, wireless, mobile device are described. Note that in this description, references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d mean that the feature being referred to is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Further, separate references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d in this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment; however, neither are such embodiments mutually exclusive, unless so stated and except as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, a feature, structure, act, etc. described in one embodiment may also be included in other embodiments. Thus, the present invention can include a variety of combinations and\/or integrations of the embodiments described herein.","A microbrowser in a hand-held mobile device can be designed to provide a (Graphical User Interface) GUI that is more user-friendly than those of prior mobile devices, as described below. As used herein, \u201chand-held\u201d means designed to be held in the palm of the hand. A \u201cwireless\u201d device is a device designed to communicate across a wireless network.","One type of hand-held mobile device is a mobile (e.g., cellular) telephone. A problem with current mobile telephones that include browsers is that, to make a telephone call while the browser is running, the user is required to perform an undesirably long sequence of actions. This problem also occurs when using the browser to implement the mobile telephone's phone user interface for making calls. With a current browser, the user must first select a displayed text box, then type a telephone number into the text box using the telephone's keypad, then use a key to de-select the text box, then select a hyperlink labeled \u201cCall\u201d or \u201cTalk\u201d (or something similar), and finally, activate the hyperlink to initiate the call. This sequence of actions is tedious for many users and, in any event, is undesirably longer and more complicated than placing a telephone call on a telephone that has no browser or in which the browser is not running as the telephone's user interface. It is desirable, therefore, to simplify making a telephone call from the context of an active browser, so that it is more like making a telephone call from a more conventional or non-browser-enabled telephone.","Accordingly, as described in greater detail below, the browser of the present invention provides a mode which facilitates making a telephone call, in a manner which is much easier for the user than in prior browsers. Specifically, the browser provides a GUI that includes a softkey indicator indicating a corresponding softkey action and an input field for receiving a user-input character string, such as a telephone number. In response to activation of (e.g., typing a number into) the input field, a softkey action previously associated with the input field, such as a dial action, is automatically selected, and the softkey indicator is automatically changed to indicate the selected action. This allows the user to initiate the call simply by typing the telephone number and then activating the softkey.","In another mode, the GUI displays an input field and a menu listing performable actions. In response to a user input representing a single action by the user and designating one of the performable actions, the designated action is selected and the input field is activated, enabling the user to input characters associated with the designated action. This allows easier selection from among multiple menu items along with associated text entry.","Another problem to be addressed herein is that, when the user of a mobile device is traveling, there may be instances when the user is lost or is unsure about his current location. Sometimes the user may need information that is particularly relevant to the user's current location, such as the locations of nearby gas stations, restaurants, stores, automatic teller machines (ATMs), or points of interest. Accordingly, the browser of the present invention provides an efficient way of indicating the user's current location and of enabling the user to quickly and easily access information and location-dependent services that are relevant to that location. Other advantageous features of the browser will be apparent from the description which follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","116","120","116","120","100","102","103"]},"Mobile device  also includes and executes a microbrowser, which is software that allows the user of mobile device  to access and navigate content on the Internet or other network, including browsing the World Wide Web or any other \u201cweb\u201d of hypermedia content. One example of a microbrowser that may be used for this purpose is the UP.Browser from Openwave Systems Inc. of Redwood City, Calif. The microbrowser may be stored in memory within the mobile device . The microbrowser generates a GUI via display  to enable the user of the mobile device  to access and retrieve hypermedia information from network servers  and . Various features of the GUI which make the microbrowser more user-friendly are described below.","The communication path between mobile device  and network servers  and  includes a wireless communication network , a proxy server , and a wireline network . The wireless network  is a wireless telecommunications network such as a cellular digital packet data (CDPD) network, a global system for mobile (GSM) network, a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, or a time division multiple access (TDMA) network. The communications protocols used by wireless network  may include, for example, WAP and\/or HDTP. The wireline network  is a land-based network that may be or include the Internet, an intranet, or a data network of any private network, such as a local area network (LAN). The communication protocol supporting wireline network  may be, for example, transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP), HTTP, or secure HTTP (sHTTP).","Proxy server  acts a bridge between wireless network  and wireline network . Proxy server  may be, for example, a conventional server-class computer or PC. Although shown as a physically separate device, proxy server  may be implemented in a network server (e.g. network servers  or ) with hardware and software well known in the art providing the connection between wireless network  and wireline network . Proxy server  may also provide gateway functions, such as translation\/conversion between the language(s) and protocol(s) used on the wireless network  and those used on the wireline network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","102","103","102","208","212","216","220","220","216","102"]},"Referring still to , keypad  includes alphanumerical keys  (such as for dialing a telephone numbers and entering links), function keys  and , Up arrow key A, and Down arrow key B. Arrow keys A and B are used to navigate through information displayed on display , such as to move a selection indicator (e.g., highlighting), cursor, pointer, or other indicator, or to scroll the display.","The hypermedia information  shown in  includes a list of selectable identifiers (e.g. \u201cUP Home\u201d) having corresponding Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Hypermedia information  may be generated from a WML file or \u201cdeck\u201d, for example, including one or more WML cards. In certain modes of operation, activating function key  while a displayed item is selected (e.g., highlighted) causes mobile device  to retrieve and display a WML card associated with a URL of that item. In addition, using the alphanumerical keys , the user may enter a URL manually to access hypermedia content. To facilitate this operation, the microbrowser may provide several different input modes, such as a number input mode, an alphabetic input mode, a symbol input mode, and a URL input mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","100","301","100","313","104","316","313","100","108","100","108"]},"In addition, mobile device  includes memory  that stores data and\/or software for performing many of the processing tasks performed by mobile device , including the microbrowser (or \u201cbrowser\u201d) , when executed by processor . These tasks include: establishing a communication session with a proxy server device via wireless network ; receiving user inputs from keypad ; requesting and receiving data from the wireless network ; and displaying information on the display . Hence, memory  may represent one or more physical memory devices, which may include any type of random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM) (which may be programmable), flash memory, non-volatile mass storage device, or a combination of such memory devices. Memory  is also coupled to WCP interface  for the establishment of a communication session and the requesting and receiving of data.","The mobile device  also includes voice circuitry  for inputting and outputting sound during a telephonic communication between the user of mobile device  and a remote party. Voice circuitry  includes circuitry to process telephony signals and may include, for example, sound transducers, analog-to-digital (A\/D) and digital-to-analog (D\/A) converters, filters, etc., such as are well-known in the art. An encoder\/decoder  is coupled between the processor  and the voice circuitry  for encoding and decoding audio signals.","The mobile device also may include a conventional global positioning system (GPS) location device  or another, similar type location device, which precisely determines the geographic location (latitude and longitude) of the mobile device . As described further below, the location of the mobile device  may be used to provide an indication of the location to the user and\/or to provide location-dependent information or services for the user. Alternatively, the location of the mobile device  may be determined by a device or system external to the mobile device , such as a remote location server on the wireless network .","What follows is a description of certain features of the GUI generated by the microbrowser (hereinafter \u201cbrowser\u201d)  of the mobile device , which may be implemented in a given embodiment, to make the mobile device  more user-friendly. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art how to implement these GUI features in program code, from the following description of the user-perceivable characteristics of these features. A browser that incorporates these features may be implemented in any programming language that is currently used to write browsers for mobile devices. Note that as an alternative to the browser  generating the following GUI features, these features can instead be provided by a remote device (e.g. proxy server  or servers  or ), such that the mobile device only receives and displays these features to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A through 4F","FIG. 4A"],"b":["320","100","320","320","320","320","320","401","402","403","404","405","401","402","403","404","405"]},"As shown in , the \u201cDial\u201d input field  is selected by default in the idle screen, as indicated by the bold highlighting around that field. The user begins dialing by typing any numbers on the keypad  of mobile device . The first number typed will automatically activate the \u201cDial\u201d input field . In the example of , the user has pressed the first digit (\u201c8\u201d), such that the \u201cDial\u201d input field  becomes activated (a blinking cursor appears to indicate this) and the digit is inserted automatically. In addition, the first digit causes the primary softkey indicator  to change from \u201cInbox\u201d to \u201cTalk\u201d to indicate the change in the corresponding softkey function. Referring to , the user has completed inputting the telephone number and can now activate the primary softkey (\u201cTalk\u201d) or the hard \u201cSend\u201d key to make the telephone call. Thus, making a telephone call from the context of the active browser is much simpler than in prior browser-enabled mobile telephones: the user simply inputs the telephone number and either presses the \u201cTalk\u201d softkey or the hard \u201cSend\u201d key.","The hyperlink  is used to access information or services relevant to the location of the mobile device . In the illustrated embodiment, hyperlink  (hereinafter \u201ccity link\u201d ) indicates the name of the city in which the mobile device  is currently located; another embodiment, it may refer to another type of geographic area in which the mobile device  is located or nearby, or a nearby point of interest. The location of the mobile device  may be determined by the GPS device  within mobile device , or it may be determined by a remote location server or other similar device and then transmitted to the mobile device  over the wireless network . Note that the specific manner in which the location of the mobile device is determined is not important for purposes of understanding the feature now being described; any of various conventional techniques may be used.","In one embodiment, the location of the mobile device , once determined, is used by the browser to select one of multiple hyperlinks previously stored within the mobile device, each corresponding to the different geographic region. These hyperlinks may have been stored in the mobile device  by the manufacturer, or they may have been previously provisioned in the mobile device . The selected hyperlink is then displayed as city link . In another embodiment, the location of the mobile device  is used by the browser to request, via the wireless network , a hyperlink for accessing information or services relevant to the location of the mobile device . The location-dependent information or services may be accessed by the mobile device remotely via the wireless network . In yet another embodiment, the location of the mobile device is determined by a remote server and used to push the hyperlinks or the location-dependent information or services to the mobile device  via the wireless network . Alternatively, some or all of the location-dependent information or services may have been previously provisioned in the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 4D through 4F","FIG. 4A","FIG. 2","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4E"],"b":["105","221","405","405","405","320","406","406","100"]},"The first menu item, \u201cDirections\u201d, is highlighted by default and allows the user to request directions using a conventional route-finding service.  shows the display screen that appears when the user selects the \u201cDirections\u201d item. The display screen includes a menu  of different types of destinations, to which the user may request directions from the current location. As shown, the user may request directions to a particular contact (e.g., person), nearby airports, nearby subways, or a specific address.","The following described feature enables easier selection from among multiple menu items than is possible with current browsers. Note that a numeral appears to the left of each item in pop-up menu  in  and to the left of each item in menu  of . For example, to the left of \u201cDirections\u201d in menu  is the numeral \u201c1\u201d; to the left of the \u201cGas Stations\u201d is the numeral \u201c2\u201d; and so on. When viewing pop-up menu  or menu , the user can select any of the displayed choices simply by typing the number of the user's choice on the keypad . In response to such action, the indicated choice is automatically selected by the browser. Referring to , when a number corresponding to an item in menu  is pressed on the keypad , text input field  is also automatically activated to allow the user to input a destination of the selected type. This feature, therefore, enables easier selection from among multiple menu items than is possible with current browsers.","Thus, a method and apparatus for providing a microbrowser with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in a hand-held mobile device have been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.
