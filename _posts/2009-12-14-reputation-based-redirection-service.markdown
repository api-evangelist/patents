title: Reputation based redirection service
abstract: A reputation based redirection service is usable to build URL wrappers for un-trusted and unknown URLs. Such URL wrappers can be used to protect Web users by, for example, redirecting traffic to interstitial Web pages. Additionally, reputation decisions can be made by the service to further protect users from malicious URLs.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Today for many World Wide Web users (Web users), the Internet can be a dangerous place full of malicious and abusive websites. By clicking on a hyperlink, a Web user is directed to a Web document (e.g., a website) residing somewhere on a Web-enabled server. Unfortunately, the website requested may often lead to abuse, and with the ability to cheaply disseminate abusive hyperlinks, abuse cases are on the rise.","The location of a website is described by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which defines the precise network location of the resource. However, a URL does not indicate the characteristics or reputation of the resource or of the network (or website) where the resource resides. Additionally, a URL can easily disguise the actual location of the resource, such that a Web user may be tricked into accessing a website different from what they intended.","In virtually all abuse cases, the intended victim is directed to an abuse website where they are attacked. The victim's personal credentials may be stolen, the victim's machine may be infected with malware or some other virus, or the victim may be subjected to spam. In any case, serious damage may be inflicted on an innocent and unsuspecting user.","Unfortunately, adequate tools do not exist for checking the reputation of a URL prior to accessing a website. Redirection services, while available, are used in a small subset of instances. When used, existing redirection services merely redirect a Web user to alternate websites, and lack the ability to avoid abuse through reputation lookup. Accordingly, there is a need for a service that can further aid Web users in avoiding abuse websites.","This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts for a reputation based redirection service, which is further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Generally, the reputation based redirection service described herein involves building a URL wrapper to allow for the avoidance of abusive websites by redirecting Web users to interstitial pages.","In one aspect, a URL wrapper may be built by combining a received URL, a determined characteristic of the URL, and a created security hash. The determined characteristic may be a unique identifier of a user who originally posted the URL and\/or a location on a network where the URL was originally posted. The URL wrapper my also determine if a URL is trusted, in which case it may output the original URL. The URL wrapper may output an error message when the URL is invalid or based on an un-supported Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schema, or it may point to a redirection service.","In another aspect, a redirection service may be configured to receive a request for handling a wrapped URL, verify the authenticity of the wrapped URL, determine the reputation rating of the wrapped URL, and output a redirection decision based on the validity and\/or the reputation rating of the wrapped URL. The wrapped URL may contain a destination URL, a security hash, a unique identifier of a user who originally posted the destination URL, and\/or a location where the destination URL was originally posted. The redirection service may also be configured to handle shortened and\/or previously redirected URLs by unraveling a shortened and\/or previously redirected URL to determine and output a final destination URL. The redirection service may also be configured to receive and process click-through telemetry information in the form of a telemetry report, store redirection action data and the telemetry reports to a log file, and maintain system configuration settings. Additionally, the redirection service may determine, based on the reputation rating of the wrapped URL, when to display one of the interstitial pages. Interstitial pages may be, but are not limited to, abuse information pages, unknown information pages, and\/or error information pages.","In yet another aspect, a URL reputation based redirection service may be implemented as a Web service call which may be configured to receive a Web service call for a URL, determine a redirection decision for the URL, and output the redirection decision. The redirection decision may be based on a reputation rating of the URL. Additionally, the URL may be wrapped to include the destination URL, a security hash code, a unique identifier of the user who originally posted the destination URL, and\/or the location where the destination URL was originally posted.","This disclosure describes a reputation based redirection service. In particular, systems and methods are presented for wrapping a URL with its characteristics, checking and logging the reputations of destination URLs, and redirecting users to interstitial Web pages when destination URLs lead to known or suspected abuse websites or have unknown reputations.","As discussed above, Web abuse cases are potentially damaging to Web users and their equipment, and are becoming more prevalent as the size of the Internet and the relative ease of distributing abusive hyperlinks increases. These issues could potentially lead to more distrust and less use of the Internet by casual Web surfers, and could even have detrimental effects on the economy.","The techniques described in this disclosure may be used for effectively avoiding abuse websites by creating URL wrappers, checking destination URL reputations, and redirecting Web users away from the abuse. The URL wrapper allows the characteristics of the URL to be stored with redirection information to convert URLs into safe hyperlinks. Thus, a user need only select a hyperlink in a Web document (i.e., a URL) without being concerned for the safety of the intended destination.","URL wrapping entails appending data to a URL to add functionality and\/or for redirection purposes. In one example, as discussed below, the URL to which data may be appended may be the URL of a redirection service. A system for reputation look-up is also disclosed that allows for redirection only when appropriate, and gives the user click-through options. Additionally, the ability to receive and handle Web service calls for reputation look-up and redirection is disclosed that allows various Web applications to access the system.","For creating wrapped URLs, an illustrative URL wrapping component is described that receives destination URLs (e.g., hyperlinks selected by users) and may convert them to wrapped URLs that can be processed by the redirection service. Prior to wrapping, an enhanced URL may be created by appending the destination URL's characteristics, and possibly additional parameters, to the destination URL itself. A security hash, created based on the enhanced URL, may then be appended to the enhanced URL to form a wrapped URL.","In some examples, the redirection service may provide the user with an interstitial Web page indicating that the intended destination is a known or suspected abuse website. In other examples, the interstitial page may indicate that the reputation of the intended destination is unknown or that an error occurred. Alternatively, the redirection service may send the user directly to the destination site indicating that the website is known to be non-abusive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","105","102","104","100","106","108","110","114","116"]},"A URL  may be selected by a Web user (not shown) from at least one of many possible locations. URL  may reside in various applications  and\/or websites , or it may be entered into applications  and\/or websites  (e.g., typed by the user). After URL  is recognized by the URL wrapping component (A) of application(s) , either by user selection, user creation, or some other method, the URL may be wrapped with various appropriate characteristics for processing by the URL redirection service  or by the URL wrapping component (B) of website(s) . Alternatively, URL  may be recognized directly by URL wrapping component (B) of websites  and then sent to URL redirection service .","The URL redirection service  may determine that the URL  describes a website that is safe, abusive, unknown, or inaccurate. The redirection service  may make use of a reputation backend  to determine a reputation decision for the URL . Reputation backend  may make the decision for the URL redirection service  or it may supply reputation data to URL redirection service  so that the URL reputation service  can make the reputation decision. Reputation backend  may make a redirection decision based on the reputation of the URL, the reputation of the user who posted the URL, the reputation of the website or application where the URL was originally posted, or based on the traffic to the URL. By way of example, and not limitation, reputation backend  may decide to block low reputation URLs posted by users with low reputations or by users in a low account tier, it may decide to block all URLs posted by users with low reputation or by users in a low account tier, or it may decide to block traffic to low reputation URLs after a certain traffic threshold (e.g., more than 10 visits to the URL in one day) is met. Redirection may also be based on configurable business rules applied to other data stored in the wrapped URLs, such as characteristics, site, user, URL, hash, etc. Additionally, traffic thresholds may be used for real-time throttling of unknown URLs. For example, when a traffic threshold is met for a particular URL, reputation backend  may flag that URL as abusive even if no reputation information exists for that URL. In this way, potential abuse sites can be avoided prior to obtaining a reputation.","Once a reputation decision has been determined the URL reputation service  may direct or redirect the Web user to at least one of several types of Web pages. For example, in one aspect, the reputation decision may instruct URL reputation service  to send the user directly to the destination Web page  because the URL  was deemed safe. In another aspect, the URL  may be deemed abusive, in which case the URL reputation service  may redirect the user to an \u201cabuse\u201d interstitial Web page . The abuse interstitial Web page may, for example, inform the user that the URL  is attempting to direct them to a known abuse website. In another aspect, the URL  may point to a website for which the reputation is unknown. In this case, the URL reputation service  may redirect the user to an \u201cunknown\u201d interstitial page  which may inform the user that the URL  is pointing to a website with little or no known reputation data. By way of example, and not limitation, the \u201cabuse\u201d interstitial page  and\/or the \u201cunknown\u201d interstitial page  may provide the user with options for reporting the abuse, ignoring the recommendation to avoid, or avoiding the abusive\/unknown website and returning to the user's original Web document. In yet another aspect, the URL redirection service  may determine that an error occurred and redirect the user to an \u201cerror\u201d interstitial page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["108","106","118","102"]},"Illustrative Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"In one illustrative configuration, the computing environment  comprises at least a memory  and one processing unit (or processor) . The processor  may be implemented as appropriate in hardware, software, firmware, or combinations thereof. Software or firmware implementations of the processor  may include computer-executable or machine-executable instructions written in any suitable programming language to perform the various functions described.","Memory  may store program instructions that are loadable and executable on the processor , as well as data generated during the execution of these programs. Depending on the configuration and type of computing device, memory  may be volatile (such as random access memory (RAM)) and\/or non-volatile (such as read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, etc.). The computing device or server may also include additional removable storage  and\/or non-removable storage  including, but not limited to, magnetic storage, optical disks, and\/or tape storage. The disk drives and their associated computer-readable media may provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the computing devices. In some implementations, the memory  may include multiple different types of memory, such as static random access memory (SRAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), or ROM.","Memory , removable storage , and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer-readable storage media. Computer-readable storage media includes, but is not limited to, volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Memory , removable storage , and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer storage media. Additional types of computer storage media that may be present include, but are not limited to, phase change memory (PRAM), SRAM, DRAM, other types of RAM, ROM, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory or other memory technology, compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the server or other computing device. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable storage media.","The computing environment  may also contain communications connection(s)  that allow the computing environment  to communicate with a stored database, another computing device or server, user terminals, and\/or other devices on a network, such as applications  and\/or websites  of .","The computing environment  may also include input device(s)  such as a keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc., and output device(s) , such as a display, speakers, printer, etc.","Turning to the contents of the memory  in more detail, the memory  may include an operating system  and one or more application programs or services for implementing the reputation based redirection service system . Reputation based redirection service system , however, may be implemented via either a Web service host or a client application. For example, when implemented by a Web service host, the memory  may include a URL wrapping module . The URL wrapping module  includes, but is not limited to, logic configured to build a URL wrapper containing a received URL, characteristics of the URL, and a security hash code. In one aspect, the URL wrapping module  is located in the memory  as shown in . Alternatively, however, the URL wrapping module  may be located onboard the processor . As discussed in further detail, URL wrapping module  includes, but is not limited to, logic configured to wrap a received URL with a redirection service URL, the received URL itself, determined characteristics of the received URL, and a created security hash code.","The memory  may further include a URL redirection service  and a URL Web service calling module . The URL redirection service  may be configured to redirect a user to informational interstitial Web pages in lieu of directing them to the intended destination. The URL Web service calling module  includes, but is not limited to, logic configured to allow Web applications to utilize the URL redirection service  much like an Application Programming Interface (API) without first using the URL wrapping module . That is, a Web application may make a call to the URL Web service calling module  with an unwrapped URL, based on the protocol set out by the URL Web service calling module , and receive a redirection decision or an interstitial Web page in return. In other words, the URL Web service calling module  may expose the methods of the URL redirection service  for use by Web applications.","Alternatively, as discussed above, the reputation based redirection service  may be implemented entirely by a client application, rather than a Web service host as previously described. In this aspect, memory  may include operating system  and URL wrapping module ; however, it may not include URL redirection service  and URL web service calling module .","Illustrative URL Wrapping",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306","306","308","302","302","306"]},"In one aspect, wrapped URL  may contain data received from an input device (not shown), data determined to be a characteristic of the received data, additional optional data, hash code data, and redirection service data. By way of example, and not limitation, wrapped URL  contains enhanced URL  containing the URL of URL redirection service , the received intended destination URL (i.e., the URL selected by the user that may or may not be abusive), several characteristics of the received intended destination, and optional additional parameters. Examples of optional additional parameters may, but need not, include informational identifiers for looking-up wrapped URL information at the reputation backend  of . In one example, this informational identifier may be used in combination with the received intended destination URL and other wrapped elements. In another example, the informational identifier may be used in lieu of the enhanced URL elements, and may direct the URL redirection service  to look-up the additional elements at the reputation backend .","Additionally, wrapped URL  may also contain a security hash code. In this example, the URL for URL redirection service  is http:\/\/Redirection_Server.com\/ and the destination URL selected by the user is http:\/\/www.gogators.com (however, the wrapped URL may not include the http identifier for the destination URL). Additionally, by way of example, and not limitation, wrapped URL  contains the unique user identifier of the user who originally posted the destination URL (www.gogators.com), the particular website or document where the destination URL was originally posted, optional additional parameters relating to URL reputation based redirection, and a security hash code.","In one aspect, the redirection service URL points the wrapped URL to URL redirection service  for processing. The redirection service  may then determine, based on the destination URL, the unique user identifier, and the data describing the particular site where the URL was rendered, whether the destination URL is abusive, unknown, or safe. In another aspect, the redirection service may determine whether the destination URL is abusive, unknown, or safe, based on data known, or retrievable, by the reputation backend . By way of example, and not limitation, reputation backend  may do a Domain Name System (DNS) look-up to determine what Internet Protocol (IP) address is hosting a particular URL. In another example, the reputation backend  may already have reputation information about a particular URL stored within its memory. Optional additional parameters may be used for any other features that may be found to be helpful, and the security hash code may be used by URL redirection service  to validate, or authenticate, that the wrapped URL  has not been maliciously, or unintentionally, tampered with.","In one aspect, the security hash code is created based on the enhanced URL  prior to completing wrapped URL . For example, the URL wrapping component  may generate a security hash with a secret key based on the characteristics of the URL seen in enhanced URL . This security hash may then be appended to the query string to form wrapped URL  that contains the characteristics of enhanced URL  plus the security hash code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","100","400","402","400","404","400","406","400"]},"If the URL is not valid, method  will terminate at block  by displaying an error message on an interstitial Web page to the user. If, on the other hand, the URL is valid, method  will continue to block  and apply a configurable policy. By way of example, and not limitation, the policy may be configured to exclude all in-network URLs or all trusted URLs. At decision block , method  determines whether the URL is excluded by the policy. If the URL is excluded (e.g., the URL belongs to the redirection services own network), method  will terminate by returning an unwrapped URL, thus allowing the user to proceed directly to the intended destination URL. However, if the URL is not excluded from the policy, method  will generate a query string for the wrapped URL  at block . The query string generated at block  may contain many different parameters. As one example of a possible query string, method  may encode the received URL at block , append the unique user identifier (CID) of the person or application which originally posted the URL at block , append the unique website identifier (site ID) where the URL was posted at block , sanitize optional parameters at block , append the sanitized optional parameters at block , and generate and append a security hash code at block . In this example, the encoded URL, CID, site ID, sanitized parameters, and generated hash code are all appended to the query string; however, other query strings are possible. As discussed above, the security hash code may be generated at block  based on the enhanced URL. In this example, the enhanced URL may include the contents of the query string prior to the generation of the security hash (or after block , i.e., the encoded URL, CID, site ID, and sanitized parameters).","Once method  has completed the generation of the query string (including appending the generated security hash), blocks -, method  will add the query string to the redirection server URL (e.g., http:\/\/Redirection_Server.com of ) at block  to form wrapped URL . Method  may then terminate by returning the wrapped URL as output at block .","Illustrative Redirection Service",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","504","506","508","510","512","506","506","514","516","518","520","522","524","526","508","528"]},"Redirection service  may be communicatively coupled with application  or website  and may receive wrapped or unwrapped URLs as input from application  or website . By way of example, and not limitation, application  or website  may be communicatively coupled directly to redirection service interface . In turn, the redirection logic component  may include, but is not limited to, logic configured to output, through the redirection service , a redirection decision . Redirection decision  may be sent directly back to the application  or website  that input the wrapped or unwrapped URL, or it may be sent to another website or application. Additionally, by way of example, redirection logic component  may also include logic configured to output a numerical confidence score based on reputation data. Redirection service  may also be communicatively coupled with informational interstitial page , or a plurality of interstitial pages, by way of the redirection service interface . Through the communication link, informational interstitial page  may transmit click-through telemetry report  for processing and logging by the redirection service .","Redirection service  may also be communicatively coupled with a URL reputation system (URS)  and a report abuse control integration system . By way of example, and not limitation, reputation lookup module  of redirection logic component  may contain logic configured to create a URF  to be transmitted to URS  for lookup. URF  may contain the parameters of a wrapped or unwrapped URL for reputation lookup by URS . In turn, URS  may return URF  to reputation lookup module  to be handled by report processing module . Report processing module  may contain logic configured to use the data found in URF  for determining and outputting redirection decision . Additionally, and only by way of example, when redirection service  returns that a destination URL is bad, redirection decision  may direct a user to an abuse interstitial page  (as seen in ) and report abuse module  may contain logic configured to call the report abuse control integration system . The report abuse control integration system  may work in conjunction with the URS  for storing data about known abuse cases.","Turning again to the contents of the redirection logic component , telemetry service module  may include, but is not limited to, logic configured to receive click-through telemetry report(s)  of the informational interstitial page(s)  by way of the redirection service interface . Click-through telemetry report  may contain data about the particular user (e.g., the user's CID) that is viewing informational interstitial page . It may also contain data associated with the wrapped or unwrapped URL that led to the informational interstitial page  (e.g., the URL poster's CID, the origination website, etc.). Telemetry service module  may include, but is not limited to, logic configured to process this data and make use of the logging module  to log appropriate data in the log and click-through telemetry reports . URL validation module  may be configured to implement business logic for verifying the validity of a wrapped URL. This verification may be done by checking the security hash code of the wrapped URL to ensure that it has not been tampered with. If the wrapped URL has been tampered with, the URL validation module  may send URL attributes to the logging module  and the report abuse module . Additionally, the report processing module  may be configured to make a redirection decision  without using the reputation lookup module .","The shortened\/redirected URL handling module  may include, but is not limited to, logic configured to be used to process URLs that are themselves redirected, or have been shortened by a URL shortening service. By way of example, and not limitation, URL shortening services often shorten overbearingly long URLs. When redirection service  receives a wrapped URL that contains a shortened URL, shortened\/redirected URL handling module  may have to first unravel the shortened URL to determine the final destination URL. Once the shortened\/redirected URL handling module  finishes unraveling the shortened\/redirected URL, it may pass the final destination URL to the reputation lookup module  for processing.","Logging module  may contain logic configured to log redirection actions to log files which may be contained in log and click-through telemetry reports . Redirection actions may contain data related to a redirection decision  that may have been sent by the report processing module  after receiving URF  from URS  by reputation lookup module . Additionally, as discussed above, logging module  may also contain logic configured to process and send data from the click-through telemetry report  of the informational interstitial page  to the log and click-through telemetry reports  of the redirection service .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","600","100","600","602","600","604","600","600","606","600","608","600","612","520","502","610","600","610"]},"At block , the redirection decision may be returned by the redirection logic component  based on the URL reputation looked-up at block . Method  then may log the redirection action at block  which may entail storing the redirection decision  in the log and click-through telemetry reports . At block , method  may return the redirection decision  to the client via the redirection service interface . At decision block , method  determines if the URL is trusted. By way of example, and not limitation, a URL may be trusted because it resides on the same network as the redirection service. In another aspect, the URL may be trusted because the user who posted the URL, or the URL itself, is on a trusted list (e.g., a whitelist).","If the URL is determined to be trusted, method  may terminate by displaying the destination site (i.e., the intended destination that the user originally selected) to the client at block . On the other hand, if the URL is not trusted, method  may display an interstitial page to the client at block . As detailed above, the interstitial page may be in the form of an abuse information interstitial page, an unknown information interstitial page, or an error information interstitial page. At block , method  may receive a click-through telemetry report with data about what action the user chose after being presented with the interstitial page and what results occurred if, and when, the user proceeded to either a known abuse site or an unknown site.
