title: Telecommunications provider agent
abstract: The invention is a provider agent product and method that operates as a software interface between a telephony card and a session manager in an advanced communications network. The provider agent receives event messages from the telephony card indicating on-hook events, off-hook events, and digit events. The provider agent instructs the telephony card to provide dial tone, ring current, ringback, and busy signals to the telephones. The provider agent also exchanges messages with a session manager in the network. These messages include: invite messages, reply messages, join messages, and terminate messages. In response to the above processing, the provider agent instructs the telephony card to interwork telephony signals on a telephony channel with ATM signals on an ATM virtual channel. The provider agent is comprised of a plurality of software objects that are stored on a software storage medium and that include: a controller object, port objects, and event objects. The provider agent objects are executed by a multithreaded processing system and each object has a separate processing thread. The provider agent and the telephony card communicate through an application programming interface that is specified in an Interface Definition Language (IDL) of a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).

No. 6,229,803, filed Aug. 5, 1998, and which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.","The invention is related to the field of telecommunications, and in particular, to a software interface product and method utilized between a telephony card and a digital communications network.","Advanced communications networks are being developed to support a vast array of communications services. These networks are controlled by complex hardware and software platforms referred to as session managers. Users requiring communications sessions from these advanced networks must interface with the session managers to request and receive communications services. Session managers operate using various messages, such as invite messages, reply messages, confirm messages, join messages, and terminate messages.","A class 5 telephone switch communicates with an analog telephone using the analog telephony signals in the well-known analog telephony format. The class 5 telephone switch provides power to the telephone. The class 5 telephone switch detects off-hook current caused by the telephone and provides the telephone with dial tone. The caller generates Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals. The class 5 telephone switch detects the DTMF signals and initiates the call in the network. When the far-end telephone is ringing, the class 5 telephone switch plays a ringback tone to the caller. If the far-end telephone is busy, the class 5 telephone switch plays a busy tone to the caller. On incoming calls, the class 5 telephone switch provides ring current to the telephone.","Telephony cards are being developed to manage multiple telephones in the home. The telephony cards are typically plugged into communications hubs or computers in the residence, and telephones are connected to the telephony card. The telephony cards connect these telephones in the home to a network element in the advanced communications network. This connection between the telephony card and the network element is much different than the traditional analog line to the local switch. This connection is typically an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) connection to an ATM device. ATM signals do not traditionally support analog telephony signals, such as off-hook, dial tone, and busy signals. The telephony cards detect off-hook conditions, on-hook conditions, and digits. In addition, the telephony cards provide the telephones with dial tone, ring current, ringback, and busy signals.","At present, there is not an acceptable software interface method or product for use between the telephony card and the session manager in the network. There is a need for software that can provide an interface between the telephony card and the session manager.","The invention overcomes these problems with a provider agent that operates as a software interface between the telephony card and the session manager.

The telephony card is operational to provide dial tone, ringback, and busy signals in response to tone instructions. The session manager is operational to transmit and receive invite messages, reply messages, join messages, and terminate messages.","The provider agent receives an off-hook event message for a first channel from the telephony card, and in response, transmits a dial tone instruction for the first channel to the telephony card. The provider agent receives a plurality of digit event messages for the first channel from the telephony card, and in response, transmits an invite message indicating a dialed number for the first channel to the session manager. The provider agent receives a reply message for the first channel from the session manager indicating an alerting condition, and in response, transmits a ringback tone instruction for the first channel to the telephony card. The provider agent receives a join message for the first channel from the session manager, and in response, transmits an add stream message for the first channel to the session manager. The provider agent receives a confirm message for the first channel from the session manager, and in response, transmits a first interwork instruction for the first channel to the telephony card to interwork a telephony signal on the first channel with an ATM signal on a selected virtual channel for the first channel.","In some embodiments of the invention, the provider agent receives an on-hook event message for the first channel from the telephony card, and in response, transmits a terminate message for the first channel to the session manager and transmits a second interwork instruction for the first channel to the telephony card to stop interworking the first channel and the selected virtual channel. In other embodiments, the provider agent receives a termination message for the first channel from the session manager, and in response, transmits a second interwork instruction for the first channel to the telephony card to stop interworking the first channel and the selected virtual channel.","In some embodiments of the invention, the provider agent receives an off-hook event message for a second channel from the telephony card, and in response, transmits a dial tone instruction for the second channel to the telephony card. The provider agent receives a plurality of digit event messages for the second channel from the telephony card, and in response, transmits an invite message for the second channel to the session manager. The provider agent receives a reply message for the second channel from the session manager indicating an alerting condition, and in response, transmits a ringback tone instruction for the second channel to the telephony card.

Some examples of network elements  are ATM switches and multiplexers, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) equipment, Internet Protocol (IP) routers and servers, and enhanced services platforms. The session manager  controls the set-up and delivery of communications services in the network . The session manager  receives user service requests and invokes the desired services through network elements .","Version 0.8 of the \u201cRetailer Reference Point Specification\u201d issued by the Telecommunication Information Network Architecture Consortium (TINA-C) specifies the session manager  and the connection and messaging between the session manager  and the provider agent . The interface between the session manager  and the provider agent  is compiled into CORBA IDL. The interface transport is via Transaction Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) using Logic Link Control\/Sub-Network Access Protocol (LLC\/SNAP) encapsulation and ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) to provide Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) connectivity.","The telephony card  includes channels for the phones - and an interface to the network . In some embodiments of the invention, the channels to the phones - are conventional telephone ports, and the interface to the network  is an ADSL\/ATM port. The telephony card  includes circuitry to interwork analog telephony signals from the phones - with the digital signals to the network . One example of such a digital signal is an ADSL\/ATM signal. The telephony card  includes circuitry that generates dial tones, ring-back tones, busy tones, fast-busy tones, and ring current for the phones -. The telephony card  includes circuitry that detects Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) digit events, off-hook events, and on-hook events, and that provides messages indicating these events. The telephony card  also includes software control systems that control the circuitry and interface with the API . One example of the telephony card  is the telephony card product provided by InnoMedia Logic (IML) of Quebec, Canada.","The phones - represent any communications devices supported by the telephony card . Some examples are conventional analog telephones, wireless phones, computers, modems, and fax machines. Additional phones could be connected to channels A and B, or additional phones could be connected to additional channels on the telephony card . Only two channels with one phone each is shown for the sake of clarity.","Those skilled in the art are familiar with the telephony card  and the network . A description of these elements is found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/826,641, entitled \u201cTelecommunications System\u201d, filed on Apr. 7, 1997, assigned to the same entity as this Patent Application, and that is hereby incorporated by reference into this Patent Application.

The provider agent  accepts event messages from the telephony card  through the API  and provides instructions back to the telephony card . For example, the provider agent  might receive information through the API  that the phone  has gone off-hook. In response, the provider agent  might provide a control instruction through the API  to the telephony card  to provide dial tone to the phone . In some embodiments of the invention, the API  is specified in CORBA IDL.","The provider agent  responds to event messages for the phones - with instructions for the telephony card  to interact with the user. User interaction includes dial tone, digit collection, ring, ringback, and busy signals. The provider agent  also exchanges messaging with the session manager . Messages include invite messages, reply messages, join messages, confirm messages, and terminate messages.","Both the provider agent  and the API  are comprised of software that is stored on a software storage medium. Examples of a software storage medium include magnetic disks, optical disks, or integrated circuits.

Both the provider agent  and the API  are executed by a microprocessor system. The microprocessor system could be comprised of a single microprocessor or a configuration of related microprocessors. The microprocessor system could be housed in many devices with a few examples being a residential communications hub, a computer, or the telephony card . In some embodiments of the invention, the provider agent is comprised of objects written in C++ code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","150","151","152","161","100","200","201","202","203","204","205","201","203","202","204","200","205"]},"The controller object  communicates with the session manager  and the port objects -. Communications with the session manager  are comprised of the following messages:\n\n","The controller object  encapsulates call related information by generating call record objects that are identified by session ID and channel ID. The controller object  stores data indicating the idle or busy status of each channel. The controller object  includes an internal data structure for any desired call-handling policies. Call handling policies include rules for call waiting, voice mail, call blocking, and the internal routing of incoming calls to particular phones, such as idle phones. These policies can be varied based on the caller's number, the time of day, or other factors.","The port objects - are state machines.  depicts one example of a state machine for the port object  in block diagram form. The initial state is Idle. An off-hook event for channel A moves the port object  to the dial tone state and an instruction to provide dial tone is provided to the telephony card . A digit event for channel A moves the port object  to the collect digits state and an instruction to stop dial tone is provided to the telephony card . The port object  creates a digit collection object. Digits that are collected by the telephony card  are provided to the digit collection object for analysis. The digit collection object determines the type of number dialed, such as emergency numbers, seven-digit numbers, ten-digit numbers, and international numbers. The digit collection object instructs the port object  when digit collection is complete. A digits complete event for channel A moves the port object  to the call proceeding state and the port object  instructs the controller object  to send Start Service and Invite messages to the session manager . An alerting indication from the controller object  moves the port object  to the ringback state where a ringback instruction is provided to the telephony card. The alerting event is based on a reply message from the session manager . A join event from the controller object  moves the port object  to the active state where the session is conducted. The join event is based on a join message from the session manager . An on-hook event for channel A moves the port object  back to the idle state and results in a termination message being sent by the controller object  to the session manager .","A few deviations from the above-described state machine should be appreciated. If the reply message had a busy indication, a busy state would be entered instead of the ringback state, and a busy tone instruction would be provided to the telephony card . If the reply message had a reject indication, a fast-busy state would be entered instead of the ringback state and a fast-busy tone instruction would be provided to the telephony card . In both of the above cases, an on-hook event moves the port object  back to the idle state.","When receiving a call, the state machine is much simpler. In the idle state, an invite indication from the controller object  moves the port object  to the ring state where the telephony card is instructed to ring channel A. The invite indication is based on an invite message from the session manager . An off-hook event for channel A moves the port object  to that active state, until an on-hook event moves the port object  back to the idle state.","Referring back to , the event objects - track the events for each respective channel and indicate the events to the respective port objects -. The event object  can process events using a different thread than the port object , and the event object  can process events using a different thread than the port object . Multi-threaded processing in this manner has advantages. Multi-threading simplifies system design and is more efficient than a single-threaded system. Multi-threading allows multiple threads to be processed in various states at the same time without the entire system waiting for a single input.","The API  utilizes a messaging format comprised of an instruction followed by variables in parentheses. The primary instructions are:\n\n","In the above messages, the channel ID identifies the relevant channel of the telephony card . The tone types are dial tone, ringback, busy, and fast-busy. The event types are off-hook, on-hook, and digit. The value is the value of the digit. The VPI\/NCI identifies the Virtual Path and Virtual Channel used by the telephony card  for the session.","The thread manager object  provides fault tolerance for software failures and certain hardware failures. The thread manager object  continuously receives heartbeat messages from the objects -. If a heartbeat message is not received as expected, the thread manager object  identifies and attempts to restart the affected thread. If the heartbeat is still absent, the thread manager object  instructs the telephony card  to use conventional fail-over analog telephone service for the channel with the malfunctioning thread.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-6","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["151","201","150","151","150","203","150","203","201","110","203","201","201","150","201"]},"The user inputs a called number using the telephone . The telephony card  detects the digits and forwards the values to the event object . For a called number of 1-800-555-2222, the messages \u201cevent (A, digit, 1)\u201d and \u201cevent (A, digit, 8)\u201d would be used for the first two dialed digits, and the message \u201cevent (A, digit, 2)\u201d would be used for the last dialed digit. The event object  provides a digit indication to the port object . After the first digit, the port object  moves from the dial tone state to the digits state and sends \u201cstop tone (A, dial)\u201d to the telephony card . In response, the telephony card  stops the dial tone on channel A. The port object  also processes the digit values with the digit collection object.","The digit collection object determines that the formatting of the called number is correct and that digit collection is complete. The digit collection object indicates to the port object  that digit collection is complete and provides the called number. In response to the digits complete message, the port object  moves from the digits state to the call proceeding state and indicates a request for telephony service with the dialed number to the controller object .","The controller object  generates and transmits a Start Service message requesting telephone service to the session manager . The session manager responds with reference information such as the session ID, the party ID, and a secret ID. On , the controller object  generates and transmits an invite message with the dialed number to the session manager . The session manager  typically sets-up the session and returns a reply message to the controller object  indicating that the called party is being alerted. Alternatively, the called party might be busy or might reject the session.","If an alerting indication is received in the reply message, the controller object  indicates the alerting condition to the port object , and the port object moves to the ringback state. The port object  sends \u201cstart tone (A, ringback) to the telephony card . In response, the telephony card  puts a ringback tone on channel A to emulate a ringing phone at the far end.","When the party at the far end accepts the invitation, the session manager  sends a Join message to the controller object . In response, the controller object  generates and transmits an add stream message to the session manager  with the terminal ID, the party ID, and the VPI\/NCI. The session manager  sends a Confirm message to the controller object  and the controller object  sends a confirm indication to the port object . In response to the confirm indication, the port object  sends \u201copen voice channel (A, VPI\/NCI)\u201d to the telephony card . In response to the open voice channel message, the telephony card  stops the ringback tone and interworks the analog telephony signal on channel A with the ATM signal on the VPI\/NCI. At this point, the session is in progress and the telephone call can proceed.","The session ends when the user places the phone  on-hook. The telephony card  sends \u201cevent (A, on-hook)\u201d to the event object  which indicates the on-hook to the port object . The port object  indicates the termination status to the controller object  and sends \u201cclose voice channel (A, VPI\/NCI)\u201d to the telephony card . The telephony card  ceases to interwork channel A with the VPI\/NCI.

The port object  sends \u201cstop ring (A)\u201d to the telephony card  which stops the ringing. The port object  informs the controller object  that the user has joined the session and the controller object  sends a join message to the session manager .","The session manager  sends reference information to the controller object  indicating the session ID, party ID, and secret ID. The session manager  also sends a Join Stream message to the controller object . In response, the controller object  generates and transmits reference information to the session manager  with the terminal ID, the party ID, and the VPI\/NCI. The session manager  sends a Confirm message to the controller object  and the controller object  sends a confirm indication to the port object . In response to the confirm indication, the port object  sends \u201copen voice channel (A, VPI\/NCI)\u201d to the telephony card. At this point, the session manager  has the information to set-up the connection. Subsequently, the session is in progress and the telephone call can proceed.","The session ends when a termination message is received by the controller object  from the session manager .

The telephony card  ceases to interwork channel A with the VPI\/NCI.","It should be appreciated that various combinations of call origination and termination can occur in the context of the invention. For example the phone  can originate a call or receive a call. Likewise, the phone  can terminate a call or the called party can terminate a call. It should also be appreciated that the port object  and the event object  operate in a similar fashion to the port object  and the event object  respectively. Using these objects, the provider agent can handle multiple sessions at the same time. A provider agent can have numerous such objects, but only two groups are shown for purposes of clarity.","Race conditions exist when improper events occur given the current state of the port objects -. This typically occurs when calls are incoming and outgoing at the same moment. One example is where an invite message is received by the controller object , and the controller object  determines that the status of channel A is idle, but in reality, the port object  is already in the dial tone state due to an off-hook event. The port object  will receive an invite indication from the controller object  when it expects to receive digit indications from the event object . In this case, the port object  must instruct the controller object  to reply busy or reject, and to set channel A status to busy.","In another example, the controller object  may receive an invite message from the session manger , but before the phone  rings, the phone  goes off-hook. The port object  will receive an invite indication from the controller object  and an off-hook event from the telephony card . In this case, the port object  instructs the telephony card  to open the voice channel and VPI\/NCI for the incoming call as if the phone was answered for that call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["721","721","721","701","702","721","711","712","721","722","713","722","723","730"]},"The telephones  and  are conventional communications devices that use the analog telephony format. The connections  and  are any medium operational to carry analog telephony signals, and the connections  and  are typically twisted pairs of copper wires. The connection  is also capable of carrying signals using the ATM\/DSL format. The ATM\/DSL format is a DSL signal that transports ATM cells as the high-bandwidth data.","The residential hub  is located at a residence. A residence is a conventional dwelling where people reside, such as a house, duplex, apartment, or condominium. The residential hub  provides an analog telephony interface to the telephones  and . The residential hub  provides an ATM\/DSL interface to the DSL mux . The residential hub  executes provider agent software that directs system operation.","The DSL mux  is a device that interworks the ATM\/ADSL format with an ATM\/broadband format. The ATM\/broadband format is a broadband signal that transports ATM cells. Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) is a popular broadband format, and the ATM\/SONET format is well known. Preferably, the DSL mux  includes redundant OC-3 network interfaces and handles up to 255 residences on the access side. The DSL mux  should be able to differentiate data from voice. In some embodiments, the DSL mux  could be adapted to provide Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) to the ATM switches . The DSL mux  could be adapted from the DSL product provided by Westell.","The ATM switch  is able to establish SVCs and Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs). The ATM switch  is conventional such as the Vector switch supplied by Nortel. The connection  carries the ATM\/broadband format. In some embodiments the connection  carries the ATM\/SONET format. For example, the connection  could be comprised at least in part of a Broadband Metropolitan Area Network (BMAN) that uses a 4-fiber, bi-directional, line switched, self-healing, OC-3 SONET ring.","There are various ATM connectivity options between the ATM switch  and the residential hub . ATM connections could be provisioned as PVCs from the residential hub  directly to the ATM switch . PVCs tend to waste bandwidth in the SONET rings comprising the connection . ATM connections could be provisioned from the residential hub  to the DSL mux , and the DSL mux  and the ATM switch  could establish SVCs to communicate. The entire connection between the residential hub  could be established with SVCs as needed. Combinations of PVCs and SVCs could also be used. For example, low bandwidth control channels could be provisioned directly from the residential hub  to the ATM switch , but higher bandwidth user channels could be established on an SVC basis.","The residential hub  includes an ATM\/DSL interface , an ATM backplane , a telephony card , and other cards . The telephones  and  are connected to the telephony card  by connections  and . The ATM\/DSL interface  is connected to the DSL mux  by connection . An uninterruptable power supply (UPS) may be included if desired in order to provide power during an outage to the residence.","The ATM\/DSL interface  provides smoothing and shaping for the ATM signals. The ADSL\/ATM interface  converts control and communications ATM cells into the ATM\/DSL format for transport to the DSL mux . The ATM\/DSL interface  also receives control and communications ATM cells from the DSL mux  and provides these to the appropriate components of residential hub  using the ATM backplane .

The telephony card  is controlled by a provider agent that is resident in the residential hub . The telephony card  provides power and dial tone to the telephones. The telephony card  detects on-hook, off-hook, and DTMF tones. The telephony card  provides ringback and busy tones to the telephones  and . The telephony card  interworks analog telephony signals with ATM signals. In some embodiments, the telephony card  provides echo cancellation or other digital signal processing functions. The telephony card  could be adapted from the telephony card product supplied by Innomedia Logic of Quebec, Canada.","The other cards  represent a number of different cards that can be plugged into the residential hub. Empty slots for additional cards are also shown on the ATM backplane. Some examples of other cards  include a Java card, ATM card, MPEG card, utility card, or LAN card. The cards provide communications services to the end users as discussed below.","The Java card includes a processor and memory and is operational to receive Java applets from the service node. Java applets can support a wide variety of tasks. In particular, Java applets can be used to provide the intelligence to support class 5 features, such as call waiting and call forwarding. The Java card also exerts control over the cards and DSL\/ATM interface . This could include ATM virtual connection assignments for communications to the mux or a service node. The Java card may also communicate with the service node to request numerous other communications services. The ATM card provides an ATM interface to devices within the residence. If the ATM card exchanges ATM signaling with resident devices over VPI=0 and VPI=5, then the ATM card may use virtual path associated signaling to exchange control information with the service node. The MPEG card provides an MPEG interface to devices within the residence. MPEG is a video formatting standard. Typically, the MPEG card will receive MPEG formatted video in ATM cells through the ATM\/DSL interface  and provide video signals to devices in the residence. The utility card is coupled to utility metering devices in the home. The utility card is programmed to collect the metering information and forward it to the utility companies through ATM\/DSL interface . The LAN card supports a LAN that is internal to the residence. For, example, the LAN card could support ethernet connections to multiple computers. The computers could access the Internet through the LAN card and ATM\/DSL interface .","The invention is not restricted to basic telephone service. A subscription\/configuration service could also be deployed. The provider agent would analyze the called number to determine if telephone service or the subscription\/configuration service is requested. The provider agent would then direct the telephony card to couple the call to the requested service. Other services could be implemented in a similar fashion.","Those skilled in the art can appreciate variations of the above-described embodiments that fall within the scope of the invention.
