{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field relates generally to information processing, and more particularly to techniques for supporting utilization of software and other products by tenants in an information processing system that may comprise cloud infrastructure.","An increasing number of companies and other enterprises are reducing their costs by migrating portions of their information technology infrastructure to cloud service providers. For example, virtual data centers and other types of systems comprising distributed virtual infrastructure are coming into widespread use. Commercially available virtualization software such as VMware\u00ae vSphere\u2122 may be used by cloud service providers to build a variety of different types of virtual infrastructure, including private and public cloud computing and storage systems, which may be distributed across hundreds of interconnected computers, storage devices and other physical machines.","In cloud-based information processing system arrangements of the type described above, enterprises in effect become tenants of the cloud service providers. Thus, a given tenant may share hardware or software resources or other products with other tenants. However, not all products that are sold into the cloud service provider space are configured to support such multi-tenancy.","This lack of multi-tenancy support creates difficulties for the cloud service provider, in that the provider may have to avoid usage of certain products not configured for multi-tenancy, or face an increase in its product costs by adding separate instances of such products for each tenant.","It is also problematic for the product manufacturer, in that the manufacturer may have difficulty selling products that are not configured for multi-tenancy, or may face increased development costs to adapt each of its products to support multi-tenancy. More particularly, making significant changes to the internal working of products to support multi-tenancy requires a substantial skills and resource commitment on behalf of the product manufacturer. Furthermore, making changes natively within each product poses a time-to-market challenge, delaying the ability of the product manufacturer to compete in cloud service marketplaces where multi-tenancy is an important feature.","Illustrative embodiments of the invention provide service composition based multi-tenancy adaptation techniques for use in information processing systems to facilitate sharing of a service provider product by multiple tenants. For example, such techniques allow a product that is not otherwise configured to support multi-tenancy to nonetheless be shared by multiple tenants of a cloud service provider.","In one embodiment, a multi-tenancy adapter is configured to provide an interface between a plurality of tenants and a product that is provided by a service provider and shared by those tenants. The multi-tenancy adapter comprises a plurality of tenant-specific mashup functions or other service composition functions associated with respective ones of the plurality of tenants. In conjunction with receipt of a service request from a given one of the plurality of tenants, the multi-tenancy adapter generates a corresponding request directed to the product, applies the particular service composition function associated with the given tenant in order to filter response information received back from the product in a manner specific to that tenant, and provides the filtered response information to the given tenant.","The multi-tenancy adapter in an illustrative embodiment may comprise a plurality of tenant-specific portals for respective ones of the plurality of tenants, with each of the tenant-specific portals implementing a corresponding application programming interface (API) proxy for converting product-specific information from the product into tenant-specific information for the corresponding tenant using a corresponding one of a plurality of tenant-specific service composition functions.","One or more of the illustrative embodiments may advantageously avoid the need for cloud service providers to choose to deploy only products that support multi-tenancy or to excessively duplicate single-tenant products by adding separate instances of those products for each tenant. Moreover, one or more such embodiments may allow product manufacturers to better market their single-tenant products to cloud service providers, while also avoiding the increased development costs, time-to-market challenges and other issues associated with reconfiguring products to support multi-tenancy.","Illustrative embodiments of the present invention will be described herein with reference to exemplary information processing systems and associated computers, servers, storage devices and other processing devices. It is to be appreciated, however, that the invention is not restricted to use with the particular illustrative system and device configurations shown. Moreover, the term \u201cinformation processing system\u201d as used herein is intended to be broadly construed, so as to encompass, for example, private or public cloud computing or storage systems, as well as other types of processing systems comprising physical or virtual processing resources in any combination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","110","1","110","2","110","104","110","110","1","2"]},"The product  may comprise, for example, a software product running on a processing platform of the service provider , although other types of products, including service products, hardware products or virtualized products, may additionally or alternatively be shared by at least a subset of the tenants . It may be assumed for purposes of illustration that the product  is not itself configured for multi-tenancy. Also, the product  may comprise a particular combination of multiple distinct products, such as a designated combination of multiple services available from the service provider.","The service provider  may comprise a cloud service provider having cloud infrastructure, with the cloud infrastructure comprising physical infrastructure and associated virtualization infrastructure running on the physical infrastructure. The term \u201cservice provider\u201d as used herein is also intended to be broadly construed, so as to encompass, for example, any entity that makes one or more available software functions invokable over a network. The product  may therefore comprise software products in the form of application programs or other types of programs running on virtual machines that are implemented using cloud infrastructure.","An example of a processing platform suitable for providing these and other types of information technology infrastructure suitable for implementing at least a portion of the system  will be described in more detail below in conjunction with .","With continued reference now to , the multi-tenancy adapter  comprises a plurality of tenant-specific portals -, -, . . . -N for respective ones of the plurality of tenants . Each of the tenant-specific portals  implements a corresponding tenant-specific proxy element  for converting product-specific information from the product  into tenant-specific information for the corresponding tenant  using a corresponding one of a plurality of tenant-specific service composition functions. The proxy elements  in the present embodiment more specifically comprise respective application programming interface (API) proxies.","As a more particular example, one or more of the proxy elements may comprise model supplier adapter (MSA) proxies for converting product-specific MSA information from the product  into tenant-specific MSA information for the corresponding tenant  using a corresponding one of the tenant-specific service composition functions, where MSA is a particular style of representational state transfer (REST) API defined by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass.","In such an arrangement, multi-tenancy functionality can be layered on top of any product that exposes its data and behavior using the MSA standard. This tenant-specific MSA proxy looks to the tenant like an MSA, but it is configured to invoke the MSA implemented by the product and to filter responses back to the tenant such that those responses involve only resources that are relevant to that tenant. The filtering mechanism in an arrangement of this type may be implemented, for example, by a mashup combining full feeds of resources coming from product MSAs with a mapping of which resources are relevant to the given tenant. It should be appreciated, however, that use of an MSA proxy or other particular type of API proxy is not a requirement of any particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, other types of REST APIs or more generally other types of proxies may be used in the respective tenant portals  in other embodiments.","In operation, the multi-tenancy adapter  receives incoming service requests from the tenants , generates corresponding outgoing service requests directed to the product , and filters the resulting responses using tenant-specific service composition functions. Thus, for a given one of the tenants , the multi-tenancy adapter  via the corresponding tenant-specific portal  applies a tenant-specific service composition function in order to filter response information received back from the product  in a manner specific to that particular tenant. The multi-tenancy adapter  then provides the filtered response information to the given tenant. Similar operations are performed by the multi-tenancy adapter  for each of the other tenants .","For a given incoming service request, the multi-tenancy adapter  may identify the particular tenant associated with the request through the use of authentication mechanisms or other request processing techniques. As one more particular example, the multi-tenancy adapter may comprise an input filter or router configured to provide authentication directed request routing across a differential set of tenant portals.","The multi-tenancy adapter  thus provides an interface between the tenants  and the product  in a manner that permits the sharing of the product by the tenants even though the product itself is not configured to support multi-tenancy. The multi-tenancy adapter  may comprise a service composition manager, not explicitly shown in the figure, to manage the tenant-specific composition functions of the tenants .","The service composition function in the present embodiment may more particularly comprise a mashup function, and such a mashup function may be configured in accordance with standards established by the Open Mashup Alliance. For example, one or more of the mashup functions in the present embodiment may be implemented using Enterprise Mashup Markup Language (EMML). Additional details regarding EMML are described in \u201cEMML Changes Everything: Profitability, Predictability & Performance through Enterprise Mashups,\u201d 2011, available from the Open Mashup Alliance.","The tenant-specific proxy elements  in the present embodiment each more particularly comprise a tenant filter  and a set of mapping information . The tenant filter  for a given tenant filters response information from the product  before that information is delivered to the tenant. The tenant filter  operates using the mapping information  which may be configured, for example, to characterize which of a plurality of resources of the product are relevant to the given tenant. Thus, the tenant filter  utilizes mapping information  to ensure that the filtered response information provided back to the given tenant responsive to a service request from that tenant to the product  comprises only information associated with those product resources that are relevant to the given tenant, as determined from the mapping information.","At least a portion of the filtered response information and corresponding unfiltered response information may be archived under control of the multi-tenancy adapter  to facilitate demonstration of filtering policy compliance. The filtered response information may encompass, for example, transformed vocabulary, response normalization, supporting analytics, as well as a variety of other types of information for facilitating the use of product  by the given tenant.","The service composition functions associated with the tenant portals may be implemented using mashup middleware as illustrated in . As shown, a given one of the tenant portals -, i=1, 2, . . . N, comprises mashup middleware  that may be utilized to provide at least a portion of the corresponding API proxy -. The tenant portal -comprising mashup middleware  provides an interface between tenant-specific APIs  and product-specific APIs  as shown in the figure. The mashup middleware may comprise one or more mashups each implemented using a suitable mashup platform, such as the JackBe Presto platform. Other mashup platforms that may be used in embodiments of the invention include, for example, Yahoo Wires, Corizon, Microsoft Popfly, Kapow and Nexaweb. Also, one or more mashups can be built as web applications, for example, using Javascript programming in a browser application.","The multi-tenancy adapter  may be implemented on a common processing platform with the product , or alternatively these elements may each be implemented on separate processing platforms. Also, although shown in  as being part of the service provider , the multi-tenancy adapter can be implemented in other parts of the system, and need not share any infrastructure with the service provider. It is also to be understood that a given embodiment of the system  may include multiple instances of the elements ,  and , although only single instances of such elements are shown in the system diagram for clarity and simplicity of illustration.","The operation of the multi-tenancy adapter  will now be described in greater detail with reference to . In this figure, two of the tenant-specific portals - and - of the multi-tenancy adapter  are shown. These portals include respective central authentication service (CAS) elements - and - for use in authenticating communications from respective tenants - and -. It should be noted, however, that any of a wide variety of other authentication techniques may be used in place of CAS in order to ensure that each tenant is able to access its corresponding portal but not the portals of the other tenants.","The Tenant  portal - includes a plurality of topology service components -, an event service component , and an alert service component , and may include additional or alternative components for other services. Other embodiments need not include the particular illustrative portal components shown in  or any other components for particular combinations of services or other types of products. The portal components -,  and  correspond generally to actual services ,  and  implemented in product . Thus, in the present embodiment, the topology service , event service  and alert service  should be viewed as examples of sub-products of product  for which multi-tenancy support is being provided in this embodiment.","The Tenant  portal - further comprises a database  for storing at least the tenant-specific mapping information -. The Tenant  portal - includes a plurality of topology service components -, and may include other components not explicitly shown in the figure, such as a database for storing tenant-specific mapping information -.","The product  in this embodiment exposes full APIs for the plurality of topology service components , the event service component , and the alert service component , and may include additional or alternative components for other services or, more generally, for other types of products.","As illustrated, the Tenant  portal - includes tenant filter - and tenant-specific mapping information - stored in database . It is assumed that the Tenant  portal - includes tenant filter and tenant-specific mapping information, although those elements are not explicitly shown.","The arrangement illustrated in  also shows a number of processing steps, designated as steps  through . It is assumed that each tenant  is provided with a uniform resource locator (URL) or other identifier that allows it to access its corresponding tenant-specific portal . Service requests from a given tenant are delivered to the corresponding portal, subject to authorization using the CAS . For example, each tenant portal may be specified by a unique tenant-specific base URL, such as\n\n","In step , a service request is received at portal - from an administrator or other staff member associated with Tenant .","In step , the service request is processed using CAS element - in order to ensure that the request originates from an authorized entity associated with Tenant . Service requests from other tenants will be denied access to the Tenant  portal. Thus, a service request from Tenant  will be denied access to the Tenant  portal as indicated at , but will be granted access to the Tenant  portal as indicated at ","In step , the particular service components needed to process the service request are indentified.","In step , a mashup function is invoked in order to provide the tenant filter -. As previously described, this tenant filter is responsible for filtering out resource information that is not associated with the tenant, so that all responses back to that tenant will contain information related to tenant relevant resources.","In step , the tenant filter invokes the full request to the product  via one or more of the full APIs that the product exposes for its service components ,  and . The tenant filter sends the service request to the product. In other embodiments, other components of the multi-tenancy adapter  may be used to direct the service request to the product.","In step , the tenant filter - issues a request to a database containing the tenant-specific mapping information -. This request is used to determine which resources of the product  are associated with the given tenant. This request or portions thereof may make use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or other types of indicators. For example, the request may comprise one or more database queries of the form \u201cis resource URI {uri} relevant to the tenant, yes or no?\u201d","In step , the database retrieves the requested tenant-to-resource mapping information - and makes it available to the tenant filter -.","In step , the tenant filter - filters the response information from product  based on the mapping information -, such that the response provided back to the tenant via platform component - contains only resources that are relevant to the tenant. The tenant filter is therefore configured to ensure that feeds back to the tenant are properly and fully populated with the appropriate tenant-specific information.","It is to be appreciated that the particular process steps shown and described in conjunction with  are exemplary only, and that additional or alternative steps may be used in other embodiments. Also, the ordering of the steps may be altered in other embodiments. Thus, for example, steps that are shown as being performed in one order in the figure may be performed in other orders in other embodiments, or steps that are performed serially may be performed at least in part in parallel with one another.","The illustrative embodiments described above advantageously allow existing products that are not otherwise configured to support multi-tenancy to nonetheless participate in the service provider marketplace, where multi-tenancy is often a key \u201cmust have\u201d feature. The multi-tenancy functionality is provided in an efficient and non-invasive manner, and with little or no impact on product development schedules.","It is to be appreciated that the particular sets of modules and other components as implemented in the system  as illustrated in  are presented by way of example only. In other embodiments, only subsets of these components, or additional or alternatives sets of components, may be used, and such components may exhibit alternative functionality and relationships.","As indicated previously, the system  may be implemented using one or more processing platforms. An example of such a processing platform is processing platform  shown in . The processing platform  in this embodiment comprises a portion of the system  and includes a plurality of servers, denoted -, -, -, . . . -M, which communicate with one another over a network .

One or more of the processing modules of system  may therefore each run on a server or other processing device.","As illustrated in , such a server or other processing device generally comprises at least one processor and an associated memory, and implements one or more functional modules or other components for controlling certain features of the information processing system . Again, multiple ones of the processing modules of system  may be implemented by a single processing device in a given embodiment. Also, it should be noted that a given processing device may comprise one or more virtual machines.","The server - in the processing platform  more particularly comprises a processor  coupled to a memory .
