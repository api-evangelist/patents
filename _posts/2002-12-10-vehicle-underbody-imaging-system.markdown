title: Vehicle underbody imaging system
abstract: A system and method for imaging underbodies of moving vehicles have a stationary source of radiation to radiate energy upwardly on underbodies of moving vehicles. A stationary video camera adjacent the radiation source on a roadway has an upwardly facing field of view for creating image signals representative of sequential portions of each underbody as each moving vehicle passes overhead. A control station activates the camera and radiation source to create the image signals and creates mosaic signals of all of each underbody from the image signals. A display screen provides a mosaic image of each underbody from its mosaic signals. A virtually real-time inspection or a comparison can be made with previously taken underbody images of the same moving vehicle or with vehicle manufacturers' data for the same vehicular models. Moving cars, trucks, marine vessels, aircraft, can be quickly imaged for inspection and/or comparison by fewer security personnel.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to devices and methods for imaging a moving vehicle. More particularly, the imaging device and method of this invention provides mosaic images of the undersides of moving vehicles on a roadway.","Presently, vehicles entering a secure area are randomly selected for inspection. During the inspection, a designated vehicle is stopped, a mirror is rolled beneath the underside, and security personnel make visual inspections. This procedure usually requires several inspectors, is time consuming, and may not enable a full view of all portions of the underbody. At best, this hit-or-miss procedure has questionable value, and, as fiscal and personnel resources become even more strained, the effectiveness of this course of action is further compromised.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a system that provides security personnel a mosaic image of the entire underside of each moving vehicle entering a secure area or going past an inspection checkpoint.","An object of the invention is to provide a method and system for imaging the underbodies of vehicles.","Another object is to provide a method and system for uninterrupted imaging and inspection of the underbodies of all vehicles traveling on a roadway, marine passageway, or taxiway without stopping the vehicles.","Another object is to provide a method and system for imaging the underbodies of moving vehicles and storing the mosaic images of the underbodies for future reference.","Another object is to provide a method and system for imaging moving vehicles and storing mosaic images of the underbodies for comparison or cross-referencing to vehicle manufacturers' data of the same vehicular models or images of the same vehicles taken at an earlier time.","Another object is to provide an imaging system and method that are cost effective by speeding up the imaging-inspection process and increasing the number of inspections while reducing personnel requirements.","Another object is to provide an imaging method and system for mosaicing image portions to build a complete image of a vehicle's underbody with a minimum stationary video cameras.","Another object is to provide a method and system for quickly imaging underbodies of many moving cars, trucks, marine vessels, and\/or aircraft traversing a roadway, marine passageway, and taxiway, respectively for inspection and\/or comparison by reduced numbers of security personnel.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the invention provides a system and method for imaging the underbody of a moving vehicle. A stationary source of radiation radiates energy upwardly onto an underbody of a moving vehicle. A stationary video camera adjacent the radiation source on a roadway has an upwardly facing field of view for creating image signals representative of sequential portions extending the width of the underbody as the moving vehicle passes overhead. A control station activates the camera and radiation source to create the image signals and creates mosaic signals of all of the underbody from the image signals. A graphic display screen provides a mosaic image of the underbody from the mosaic signals. A virtually real-time inspection or a comparison can be made with previously taken underbody images of the same moving vehicle or with vehicle manufacturers' data for the same vehicular model. The underbodies of many moving cars, trucks, marine vessels, aircraft, can be quickly imaged for inspection and\/or comparison by reduced numbers of security personnel.","Referring to , vehicle underbody imaging system  of the invention permits security personnel  to visually inspect the undersides of vehicles  moving in the direction indicated by arrows A on their roofs as they travel on a roadway  past a checkpoint . Checkpoint  may be anywhere along roadway  or could be at an entrance to a secured area. Imaging system  creates a complete mosaic image of the underside, or underbody of each vehicle  from partial images. These mosaic images can be gathered from all or selected ones of vehicles  on roadway .","Vehicle underbody imaging system  includes a portable protective housing  on roadway  that has at least one stationary video camera  to provide image signals  that are representative of portions of the underbody of each vehicle . These image signals  are transmitted over a coaxial cable  extending from camera  to a control station  at or remote from checkpoint  for observation on a display screen . Imaging of each vehicle  by stationary camera  is done while vehicle  is moving between about ten to thirty miles per hour so all vehicles  traveling on roadway  can be imaged by at least one camera ; only a few personnel at control station  and display screen  are needed to monitor the images; and the occupants of the vehicles are not alerted that their vehicles are being imaged.","Protective housing  is intended to be placed on the center portion  of roadway  between the areas where tires of vehicles  normally roll. However, since some traffic may wander on roadway , protective housing  is robustly constructed to withstand anticipated pounding from tires of vehicles  that might roll along center portion  and onto housing . Housing  is fabricated from steel and has an up-ramp part  on the incoming traffic side and a down-ramp part  on the departing traffic side. Several elongate ridges  and adjacent elongate channels  extend the length of protective housing , and an elongate hinged lid  covers or exposes elongate channels . Elongate hinged lid  has a long-lived urethane hinge  that permits lid  full freedom of movement from the closed, or covering position on channels  to the open, or exposing position near channels .","Protective housing  resembles a widely used portable cable protector that protects cables extending across a street from damage by traffic. Like the portable cable protector, protective housing  is man-portable and can be picked up and moved from one roadway , or location to another. Appropriate handles and conspicuous end boots (not shown) can be added to make relocation easier and make housing  more visible.","Urethane hinge  can hold lid  in the open position as shown in . Tires from a moving vehicle that strays onto center portion  will ride up up-ramp part , strike, and rapidly close lid  to impact and abut ridges  and protect the contents of elongate channels . As a moving vehicle moves off of lid  and onto off-ramp part , the inherent biasing force of hinge  rotates lid  to the open position once again. Optionally, a rotary mechanism  (electric motor or solenoid) can be connected to lid  and can have a control conductor  extending to control station . Appropriate control signals  from control station  selectively activate motor\/solenoid  to rotate elongate lid  to expose channels  or to cover channels  as lid contacts ridges .","At least one stationary camera  is centrally located in one of elongate channels  and is not exposed to hazards created by tires of vehicles  passing overhead or elongate lid  as it is quickly closed shut. Camera  is oriented to face upwardly toward the underbody of each vehicle  passing overhead on roadway . Fish-eye-like, or other wide angle lenses  can be mounted on camera  to assure field-of-view and focal properties for acceptable video images that extend across the width of each vehicle . Stationary camera  could be fitted in channel  and pointing in a direction other than upward. In this case, a suitable arrangement of lenses could be arranged to assure that the sequential images that are taken are of the underbody taken from below the underbody. Camera  creates sequential video images extending across the width that in the aggregate are representative of the entire underbody of each vehicle  as it passes overhead. Image signals  representative of the sequential video images are connected to control station  over coaxial cable . Many different models of camera  can be selected so long as it creates a National Television System Committee (NTSC) composite-video industry-standard output.","Some inspection applications might require more than one camera  to assure, for examples, that the width of vehicle  can be positively accommodated to create clear image signals  of representative video images, different resolution properties in the video images might be desirable, or different radiations could be sensed by different cameras having different radiation responses. More than one camera  can be spaced apart side-by-side in the same elongate channel  or in adjacent channels. The plurality of cameras  can be appropriately activated, time or frequency division multiplexed, and has image signals  fed over cable  to control station  for creating sufficient video images of the underbody.","One camera A can be oriented facing through an opening A in lid  toward vehicles approaching checkpoint  on roadway . Camera A can take a frontal image A of each vehicle  that includes its license number, and another camera B can be oriented in the opposite direction facing toward vehicles departing checkpoint  on roadway  to take a rear image B of each vehicle  that includes its license number. Frontal and rear images A, B can be used in control station  to identify each vehicle  for comparison or cross-referencing to vehicle manufacturers' data of the same vehicular models or images of the vehicles taken at an earlier time.","Each camera  is stationary in housing  and a stationary lighting strip  is disposed in an adjacent elongate channel  to illuminate the underbody, or underside of each vehicle . Lighting strip  can be a single elongate light source or series of interconnected bulb-like structures that is activated by a control\/power lead  that extends to control station . Lighting strip  illuminates the underside of each vehicle  as it passes overhead. Lighting strip  can be any of many high intensity light sources in the art and can be activated to be continuously on over a sufficient period while video camera(s)  provides sequential video images of the entire underside of each vehicle . Lighting strip  also can be pulsed like a strobe light to coincide with the activation sequence of camera(s)  for the sequential video images.","Each video camera  can be selected to produce images of visible energy, such as light, or energy outside of the visible spectrum or in other energy bands imperceptible by a human observer, e.g. but not limited to infrared, ultraviolet, etc. When such cameras or sensors are selected, lighting strip  can be a continuous or pulsed source that radiates the energy that the selected camera or sensor is responsive to (visible or imperceptible) and selective images can be generated. Image signals  representative of imperceptible radiation can be connected to control station . Creating selective images of the underbodies with the imperceptible energies can further increase the effectiveness of vehicle underbody imaging system  of the invention.","Control station  can be at a convenient, permanent or mobile roadside location where security personnel can monitor images from passing traffic on roadway . Appropriate power\/control conductors  and  extend from control station  to transmit suitable power\/control signals , A to rotate elongate lid  to the open position to expose upward facing stationary camera  and to activate lighting strip  and camera . Control station  is connected to coaxial cable  that receives sequential analog image signals  from camera  and couples them to an analog to digital converter  that digitizes them into digital video image signals . Control station  has a standard desktop computer  receiving the digitized image signals  from analog to digital converter .","Computer  has mosaicing software to mosaic the sequential digitized image signals  of the underside of each vehicle  into a single composite, or mosaic image  of each entire underside. Such mosaicing procedures are known in the art, and a typical procedure is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,905 by Joshua Randy Harding et al. and assigned to Sarnoff Corporation of Princeton, N.J. Real-time mosaic construction, or putting together of sequential digital image signals  of the underside of each moving vehicle  into a single mosaic image  of the entire underside on display screen  can be accomplished by computer . One way such construction in computer  can be done is by including firmware and mosaicing software of the single board vision system marketed as Part # AVA-PCI under the trademark ARCADIA 1\u2122 by Pyramid Vision Technologies of Sarnoff Vision Corporation, P.O. Box 6957, Princeton, N.J. 08543. The associated software and ARCADIA 1\u2122 PCI can process sequential digital image signals  such as those generated by one or more stationary cameras  into a single mosaic image  of the underbody of each vehicle  for display on screen  and\/or storage in computer . This capability permits present or subsequent comparison or cross-referencing to vehicle manufacturers' data of the same vehicular models or previously taken images of the same vehicles that also are stored in memory of computer .","Display screen  can be an LCD panel and\/or projector-and-screen  large enough for viewing mosaic images  of underbodies. Additional graphic display screens  (not shown) can be located at other remote locations to apprise other observers for appropriate action.","In operation, vehicle underbody imaging system  of the invention can provide virtually real-times images of complete undersides of moving vehicles  on roadway . As one vehicle  approaches up-ramp  of housing  at speeds between ten to thirty miles per hour, camera A facing the oncoming vehicle  is activated to create front image signals A and couples them to computer  of control station  for identification.","As vehicle  continues to move forward on roadway , it drives over, or passes over housing . Control\/power signals A on lead  from control station  activate stationary lighting strip  to turn it on in coincidence with activation of the imaging sequences of camera(s) . At least one upwardly facing stationary video camera  in housing  is activated to begin taking and sending sequential image signals  of analog video of overhead passing vehicle  over cable  to control station . If a single camera and lens ,  can create sequential image signals  of acceptable clarity and resolution that span the width of vehicle, only this single camera  is used. If, however, a plurality of cameras  (and lenses ) are needed to provide acceptable sequential images, then the plurality of cameras  are activated and multiplexed in frequency or time division format to create collective sequential image signals  that collectively span the width and sequential portions of the underbody of the moving vehicle. Other camera B facing toward vehicles departing down-ramp part  take a rear image B of each vehicle . Analog-to-digital converter  digitizes the analog signals of the front and rear images A, B and collective sequential image signals  into representative digital vehicle identifying signals AA, BB and digital sequential image signals  and couples the digital signals to computer .","The analog video images from cameras  on cable  are standard NTSC (standard TV images with approximately 30 frames per second). The incoming digitized sequential image signals  from A\/D converter  are processed in computer  with the ARCADIA 1\u2122 PCI and software to build the mosaic image of the entire underside with the digitized image signals . In other words, the mosaicing process of the ARCADIA 1\u2122 PCI and software electronically places each digitized frame  of the analog image signals  together into the mosaic image much like the process of manually putting the pieces of a puzzle together. When the scanned vehicle  has passed by housing , the analog data stream stops, lighting strip  turns off, and control station  sends a completed mosaic image  of the entire underbody of the scanned vehicle to display screen . A copy of the completed image is copied and stored to disk of computer  and\/or sent to other data collection and evaluation stations of a large security system.","Security personnel  at control\/processor  and display screen  at checkpoint  can view the entire underbody of the scanned vehicle . Computer  can compare the completed mosaic image or cross-reference it to vehicle manufacturers' data of the same vehicular models or images of the same vehicle taken at an earlier time and stored in memory of computer . Any possible discrepancy can be noted. The entire procedure can be quickly accomplished as the imaged vehicle is moving, and the vehicle's occupants are not alerted.","Vehicle underbody imaging system  allows inspection of vehicles' undersides without requiring the vehicles to stop. Copies of mosaic images of vehicles can be stored in hard drives for future reference or cross-referenced to a vehicle manufacturer's database. Vehicle underbody imaging system  is cost effective since it speeds up the imaging\/inspection process and reduces manpower while increasing the number of inspections.","The constituents of vehicle underbody inspection system  are man-portable and can be used where needed. Housing , camera(s) , lighting strip , control station , display screen  and their interconnecting leads and cables are readily unpacked, interconnected, and deployed by only one or more technicians at one location. When underbody imaging may be more beneficial at another location, vehicle underbody inspection system  can be packed, transported, and redeployed at the other location quickly without attracting undue attention.","Housing  as described above can be modified in accordance with this inventive concept and still provide sequential underbody images. Another design for housing  could be a permanent or recently dug cavity covered by a protective steel grate (not shown) in roadway . Although the design of this housing is not portable, camera(s)  and lighting strip  could be placed and properly oriented in the cavity for taking underbody images through openings in the grate. Camera(s)  and lighting strip  could be removed from the cavity and relocated to another protected place. For example, lenses or mosaics (bundles) of optical fibers could be made to extend to center  of a roadway  to create an optical path extending to the cameras located at roadside. The lenses and fibers and\/or cameras could be quickly placed in the open or somewhat camouflaged on center  of roadway  to function until disabled by passing traffic.","Several housings  each containing camera(s)  and lighting strips  could be placed on several adjacent roadways, or lanes of a highway and could be suitably connected to one or more control stations  and screens . Many or all vehicles  could be monitored as they move on the highway. Vehicle underbody imaging systems  could be located on different roadways that lead into a city for example. Each of these imaging systems  could have a radio transmitter  connected by a coaxial cable  to its control station  associated with camera(s)  to transmit the imaged data to one or more remote locations where monitoring, comparisons, and responsive actions are initiated. The imaging systems  of the invention could thereby create and store several mosaic images of the complete underbody of the same vehicle (or vehicles) under surveillance as an area is traversed. Comparisons of the stored mosaic images with later developed mosaic images will help assure more responsive actions.","Referring to , vehicle underbody imaging system  of the invention can be used for imaging and inspection of the underbodies, or undersides of hulls of water born vehicles B such as boats and ships as they proceed along a waterway or marine passageway A. Appropriate measures for water-proofing, pressurizing and locating connections and components referred to above that are contained in housing  of imaging system  to make them ready for reliable underwater operation beneath the undersides of the hulls can be done by one skilled in the art in accordance with the scope of this invention. Control station  and display  can be located on nearby land or another vessel and are coupled to the components in housing .","Aircraft C (air traffic vehicles) can be accommodated on taxiways B by imaging system . However, consideration must be given to possibly offset housing  to avoid damaging camera(s)  and strip lighting  by aircraft tires mounted on the centerline of aircraft C. Station  and display  are appropriately located near taxiway B and are coupled to the components in housing . Operation of imaging system  for marine and aircraft applications is substantially the same as described above with respect to roadway . Visible and imperceptible radiation sources and cameras responsive to these radiations also can be used for marine and aircraft applications.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, different applications, modifications and alternate embodiments of this invention may be adapted. Vehicle underbody imaging system  can be made in larger or smaller sizes or fabricated in different shapes to meet different operational scenarios.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Vehicle underbody imaging system  is a portable, cost-effective means to take complete underbody mosaic images without alerting others to reveal the nature of the activity. Therefore, vehicle underbody imaging system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
