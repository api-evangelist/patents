abstract: A method is disclosed for providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type of authentication for a client in communication with an authorization server over a network. One or more authentication request packets compliant with an authentication protocol are sent to the client. Each of the packets comprises a type value that specifies multiple authentication, and a data field having a value that is structured in compliance with the authentication protocol. Each of the packets is associated with one of a plurality of different authentication conversations with the client. A plurality of responses is received from the client for each of the authentication conversations. The sending and receiving steps are repeated until results are determined for the authentication conversations. The client is authenticated based on results of each of the plurality of authentication conversations. Embodiments provide multiple Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication methods.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to data processing in the field of user authentication in networks. The invention relates more specifically to a method and apparatus for providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type.","The approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","A user authentication process is normally used in networks that carry data, voice or other information to determine whether a user or client seeking to access a network actually is who the user purports to be. Numerous message protocols have been developed to specify how to perform authentication with network devices such as switches, routers, gateways, and gatekeepers. Typically, an authentication protocol requires a client to prove its identity by offering a data credential that is verified in a secure manner by an authentication server. Some such servers also perform network access control and accounting functions and therefore are termed authentication, access and accounting (AAA) servers. A commercial example is CiscoSecure Access Control Server, from Cisco Systems, Inc.","The emergence of numerous diverse authentication protocols spurred a movement toward developing a generalized authentication protocol that could be extended to support various platforms and purposes. Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), as described in IETF RFC 2284, is becoming the preferred user authentication protocol for most types of network sessions across different network devices. In large part, this popularity stems from the extensible nature of EAP, which allows any device that provides generic support for the protocol to transparently support new authentication protocols, known as EAP methods.","Although EAP provides flexibility to choose a different authentication type or EAP method for any single authentication, the protocol inherently limits each authentication to use a single method for each individual authentication request. Each authentication transaction under EAP is effectively atomic, and the outcome of each transaction may be one of only two states, namely success or failure.","As defined in RFC 2284, each EAP message includes a \u201cType\u201d field, which indicates the EAP method being used for the authentication of the session. The Type field is required regardless of which encapsulation type is used to transport the EAP message, such as Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), which is defined in IETF RFC 2138; point-to-point protocol (PPP), as defined in RFC 1661; EAPOL, etc. As stated in RFC 2284, \u201cNormally, the Type field of a Response message is the same as the Type of the Request. However, there is also a Nak Response Type for indicating that a Request type is unacceptable to the peer. When sending a Nak in response to a Request, the peer MAY indicate an alternative desired authentication Type which it supports.\u201d The RFC can be interpreted as if EAP prohibits changing the EAP method during an authentication session. As a result, network elements cannot run multiple authentication methods sequentially or in parallel.","When EAP was designed, this limitation was not problematic, because the authentication protocols it replaced had the same limitation.","As the requirements for network usage become more sophisticated and security of sessions become more critical, a protocol that provides only a binary result, success or failure, from a single authentication method, seriously limits the treatment that the network may apply to each request.","One approach to this problem is to abandon or modify the EAP protocol and replace it with a new protocol that does not suffer from the deficiency described above. However, this approach would require a significant investment in modifying or installing updated EAP supplicants (clients), EAP authenticators (network devices) and AAA servers, also requiring significant third party co-operation. Therefore, it is desirable to adopt an approach that utilizes the existing EAP infrastructure without modification.","Based on the foregoing, there is a clear need for an approach for performing multiple authentication methods within an authentication protocol that provides for a single authentication type. There is a need for a mechanism that provides for the use of an arbitrary number of authentication methods or types for each individual authentication request.","It would be useful to have such a mechanism that is compatible with existing protocol infrastructure in general, and compatible with unmodified EAP in particular.","A method and apparatus for providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type of authentication is described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Embodiments are described herein according to the following outline:\n\n","The needs identified in the foregoing Background, and other needs and objects that will become apparent for the following description, are achieved in the present invention, which comprises, in one aspect, a method for providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type of authentication for a client in communication with an authorization server over a network. One or more authentication request packets compliant with an authentication protocol are sent to the client. Each of the packets comprises a type value that specifies multiple authentications, and a data field having a value that is structured in compliance with the authentication protocol. Each of the packets is associated with one of a plurality of different authentication conversations with the client. A plurality of responses is received from the client for each of the authentication conversations. The sending and receiving steps are repeated until results are determined for the authentication conversations. The client is authenticated based on results of each of the plurality of authentication conversations.","Particular embodiments provide multiple Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication methods, and are compatible with network access servers, AAA servers, and any suitable encapsulation protocol, such as PPP, RADIUS, etc. According to one embodiment, a new EAP method, termed \u201cEAP-Multi,\u201d is defined. The EAP-Multi method is used for encapsulating single or multiple EAP conversations for different types of authentication (different EAP methods). Complex policy rules may define how to apply multiple authentication types to a particular client or user. As a result, a network can apply multiple levels of network access to a client or user based on whether the client or user succeeds in one, all, or multiple authentication processes.","In other aspects, the invention encompasses a computer apparatus and a computer-readable medium configured to carry out the foregoing steps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","110","104","108","110","120","108","120"]},"Client  is any network-compatible end station, such as a personal computer or workstation. Network  may be any local area network, wide area network, or one or more internetworks. Enterprise network  is any network, including a WLAN, that holds one or more network resources  that client  is seeking to access. In certain embodiments, networks ,  may be the same; thus,  is intended to broadly encompass any network arrangement in which an untrusted client  is seeking access to a resource  that is held in a secure network.","Access server  is, in one embodiment, a network router that is configured to perform access control functions. An example is Cisco Access Server AS5300, commercially available from Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, Calif. The EAP-compliant embodiments described herein may be implemented using any EAP-capable platform, including switches, routers, network elements that support VPN, wireless gateways, firewalls, etc.","Authentication server  is a server-class computer that is configured to securely store user authentication information such as usernames and passwords, and to perform authentication protocols, algorithms, and supporting processes, such as one-time password (OTP) validation, encryption and decryption, message digest evaluation, etc. In one embodiment, authentication server  communicates with access server  using a secure protocol that is optimized for use in authentication. An example of a suitable protocol is RADIUS.","In this arrangement, client  must successfully authenticate itself to access server , in cooperation with authentication server , to gain access to resource . Any of several authentication protocols may be used to perform authentication. An example of a suitable authentication protocol is PEAP, which is an EAP-compliant protocol that is performed as part of establishing a PPP connection between client  and access server . In an object-oriented environment, logic that defines messages and actions performed as part of the authentication protocol can be structured as an authentication method A that client  accesses or calls using an application programming interface (API) A. A compatible authentication method B is callable by authentication server  using API B.","In general, under EAP . . . Accordingly, client  and authentication server  effectively establish a logical connection B until the authentication protocol terminates.","2.0 Providing Multiple Authentication Types within an Authentication Protocol that Supports a Single Type of Authentication","2.1 Process and Message Flow",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},"Referring first to , in block , one or more authentication request packets for multiple authentication conversations are created. Each of the packets comprises a type value that specifies multiple authentications, and a data field having a value that is structured in compliance with the authentication protocol. Each of the packets is associated with one of a plurality of different authentication conversations with the client. In block , the packets are sent to the client.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306","304","306","306","310","312","314","316","318","320","312","314","316"]},"Unlike conventional PEAP or other EAP-compliant protocols, according to an embodiment, the Type field  carries a value specifying that multiple authentications is in use. Any value that uniquely identifies multiple authentications may be used. IETF RFC 2284 defines Type values 1 through 6, and other later RFCs may define other Type values; thus, a Type value other than those previously defined should be selected.","Further, unlike conventional PEAP or other EAP-compliant protocols, according to an embodiment, the Type-Data field  carries a value that is structured as an EAP-compliant packet . Thus, the Type-Data field  effectively carries a nested EAP-compliant packet. The packet  comprises Code field , Identifier field , Length field , and Data field . Packet  may conform to any EAP-compliant format. Thus, as defined in RFC 2284, Section 2.2, Code field  identifies the type of packet , and may signify a Request, Response, Success, or Failure. Identifier field  carries a value that aids in matching responses with requests. Length field  specifies the length of packet  including all fields. Type field  indicates the EAP-type of the internal conversation in a manner similar to Type field  of packet . Data field  carries data that may vary in format according to the type of the packet .","Using packets having this structure, a plurality of different packets  may be nested within successive EAP-Multi request or response packets . All of the packets  have the same Type value that signifies the Multi authentication type. As a result, the restriction of the EAP protocol that requires one authentication type per conversation is observed; however, packets  may have any desired Type value. Therefore, a plurality of conversations having any number of authentication types may occur simultaneously, either in parallel or in series, within the context of a Multi authentication conversation. In this description, a Multi type authentication conversation is termed an \u201couter\u201d conversation and a conversation involving packets  of a particular type is termed an \u201cinner\u201d conversation.","Referring again to , in block , a client response message is received in response to one of the authentication request packets that was sent in block . When the response is received, in block  a test is performed to determine whether a particular inner authentication conversation is complete. If not, then control returns to create additional request packets, send the request packets, and receive client responses as part of the ongoing inner conversation.","If an inner conversation is complete, then in block , a result of the inner conversation is determined. Block  may involve determining whether a response packet  from client  comprised a Success or Failure message. If a response packet  having a Code value  indicating Success or Failure has been received, then block  may involve determining a Success or Failure outcome for the inner conversation with which the packet is associated. Alternatively, block  may involve determining an outcome based on information other than Code value , such as values passed in Data field  that are specific to the particular inner conversation.","In block , a test is performed to determine whether all inner conversations are complete. If not, then control returns block , in which other request packets are created if necessary. The term \u201cif necessary\u201d is provided to account for the following possibilities. An EAP authentication conversation may include more than one request\/response exchange; thus, after block  the process may need to create another request packet at block . Alternatively, at block  the process could determine that no new information needs to be sent, and the process only needs to wait for another packet from the client for a different conversation.","If all inner conversations are complete, then in block , a responsive action is selected or performed. Examples of responsive actions include granting or denying network access, initiating other inner conversations, generating event messages or notifications, or any other action that can be performed by authentication server , access server , or other elements of network .","Thus, a plurality of responses is received from the client for each of the authentication conversations. The sending and receiving steps are repeated until results are determined for the authentication conversations. The client is authenticated based on results of each of the plurality of authentication conversations.","Referring now to , which illustrates a second example method of providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type of authentication, identity information is received from a client or supplicant at block . The identity information may consist of a username, network address, device identifier, or other information that specifies which user or client is attempting network access. The EAP-Identity response carries a displayable string, which usually is a user name, and which can be used as the identity information. Other parameter values important for choosing an authentication method could be extracted from a RADIUS request that encapsulates the EAP message, or from the IP address of the access server that is sending a request, etc. In block , a test is performed to determine whether multiple authentications are needed for the client that is identified by the identity information. If so, then steps  to  of , inclusive, are performed. If not, then conventional authentication is performed, as indicated by block .","Thus, block  and block  indicate that the process of  may be augmented by receiving and considering identity information, and initiating multiple authentication types only for particular users or clients.","Further, the process of  may be augmented by applying decision rules. In one embodiment, after all authentication conversations are complete (, block ), one or more decision rules that apply to the then-current user or client are selected, as shown in block . For example, a database or policy repository may store a collection of rules that apply to different users, clients, or roles of users or clients. Based on the identity information, a username look-up is performed or a role is identified. One or more rules are retrieved from the database or repository based on the lookup.","In block , the decision rules are evaluated using the results of the authentication conversations, and in block , a responsive action is performed. For example, assume that the authentication server  performed three (3) different inner authentication conversations with client  using three different types of authentication, and assume that results of Success occurred for two (2) of the conversations but Failure occurred for a third. The decision rules that are evaluated at block  may include conditional logic that specifies different operations to perform based on the results of the different inner authentication conversations. For example, Success-Success-Failure may result in granting a particular class of restricted network access. Alternatively, Success-Failure-Failure may result in initiating a fourth authentication type.","Use of decision rules is described further below with respect to  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 1","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["402","404","406","402","104","404","108","406","120"]},"In block , peer  and access server  perform the PPP link establishment phase as defined in RFC 1661. In PPP, an optional authentication phase follows link establishment. In  and , blocks  through , inclusive, represent an authentication phase. PPP concludes with a network-layer protocol phase, as indicated by block  ().","After the Link Establishment phase is complete, in a conventional authentication phase, the authenticator sends one or more Requests to authenticate the peer. The Request has a type field to indicate what is being requested. Examples of Request types include Identity, MD5-challenge, One-Time Passwords, Generic Token Card, etc. Typically, the authenticator will send an initial Identity Request followed by one or more Requests for authentication information. However, an initial Identity Request is not required, and may be bypassed in cases where the identity is presumed based on the network context. The peer sends a Response packet in reply to each Request. As with the Request packet, the Response packet contains a type field that corresponds to the type field of the Request. The authenticator ends the authentication phase with a Success or Failure packet.","As defined by EAP, the access server  acting as authenticator typically sends an EAP-Request\/Identity packet to the client  acting as supplicant, as indicated by block . The client responds with an EAP-Response\/Identity packet to the authenticator, containing the supplicant's user identifier, as shown by block . Such an initial Identity Request\/Response exchange is optional.","At block , the access server  encapsulates and forwards the identity response, and all subsequent EAP packets, to the AAA server , as indicated by arrow . Thus, while nominally the EAP conversation continues to occur between the authenticator and the peer, the authenticator acts as a pass-through device. All EAP packets received from the client are encapsulated for transmission to the authentication server.","In block , a first authentication type is selected. For example, having received the client's Identity, and determined that multiple authentications need to occur, the AAA server  creates and sends a nested EAP packet, as indicated by block  and block . In one embodiment, the nested EAP packet is an EAP-Request packet with the Type value set to EAP-Multi. The data field of the packet can include any EAP messages that could be sent by the EAP peer acting as an authentication server. Examples include an Identity request, Notification, EAP-type request, Success, and Failure.","In block , the client (supplicant) supporting EAP-Multi extracts the inner EAP message. Referring now to , in block , the client acts on the nested EAP packet according to its content, as in a normal EAP conversation. For example, in block A, a nested EAP-Multi\/Response packet is created and sent. Thus, all messages related to the inner conversation are encapsulated into an EAP-Multi\/Response packet. Further, the EAP same Type value (Multi) is specified in all packets exchanged by the supplicant and authenticator, and the inner conversations are transparent for the authenticator, which observes only the EAP-Multi session.","Alternatively, if the client does not support the inner EAP type, it encapsulates an EAP negative acknowledge (NAK) message into an EAP-Multi\/Response packet, as shown by block B.","Blocks , , , , A, and B iterate until the inner authentication conversation is complete, as indicated by block . Thereafter, the AAA server  ends the inner EAP conversation with a Success or Failure message that is encapsulated into an EAP-Multi\/Request packet, as indicated by block . However, the end of an inner conversation does not necessary terminate the entire PPP authentication phase. As shown by block , the AAA server may decide to start another inner authentication session in order to check different type of credential. The client (supplicant) does not cancel or shut down the EAP-Multi conversation upon completion of an inner EAP session.","After a single or multiple inner EAP conversation, the AAA server  ends the whole authentication session by sending an EAP-Multi\/Success or EAP-Multi\/Failure message, as indicated by block . Under PPP, the network-layer protocol phase may then proceed, as shown by block .","Thus, the EAP-Multi protocol described in this application provides a solution for complex authentication procedures, which could involve different authentication protocols and different credential types.","Logic for implementing an EAP-Multi authentication type as described herein may be implemented by defining a new EAP method. For example, authentication methods A, B of  may define or implement the EAP-Multi method. In this arrangement, any authenticator that is compliant with EAP automatically supports EAP-Multi. Thus, it is possible to implement a sophisticated authentication system without upgrading an existing network device infrastructure.","EAP-Multi as described herein is a lightweight protocol. The computational and network overhead of using EAP-Multi as a wrapper for inner EAP conversations is minimal. Almost no operational overhead is involved in deploying beyond any efforts required to deploy specific EAP-type client software on each supplicant. The Microsoft EAP API, client software, and supporting methods can be used. In this arrangement, the EAP-Multi authentication type defined herein can be implemented as a method that is callable using the Microsoft EAP API from either client  or authentication server . API A, B may be the Microsoft API.","2.2 Using Multiple Authentication Types and Policy Rules","The EAP-Multi authentication type is extensible. The EAP-Multi authentication type may be used in an inner protocol within other tunneling EAP protocols, e.g. PEAP, or within another EAP-Multi session. By using EAP-Multi, the system administrator can define a complex hierarchical or nested rule set for different types of credential validations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["502","502"]},"In block , the AAA server performs a test to determine whether the certificate-based authentication resulted in success. If not, then network access is declined, as shown in block . If success occurred, then in block , one-time password authentication is performed. Block  may be implemented by performing a second EAP-Multi inner conversation, consecutively or in parallel with respect to the first inner conversation, in which nested EAP packets have a Type value that specifies one-time password authentication. As a result, in the second inner conversation, the AAA server causes the client to prompt the user to enter a one-time password from a token card or similar device, and the AAA server receives the one-time password and verifies it.","In block , another test is performed to determine whether the one-time password authentication was successful. If so, then unlimited network access is granted in block . If the one-time password authentication failed, then in block  only outbound Internet access is granted.","The process of  could be practiced in a situation where a corporate user is attempting network access from an unknown machine within a campus network. With the ability to enforce multiple authentication methods, the enterprise administrator can choose to enforce a certificate based authentication and one-time password authentication. If the user succeeds in both, thus providing a high level of confidence about his authenticity, the administrator could choose to operate a policy that granted access to sensitive areas of the network. Conversely, if the user passes just the first test, his access could be constrained to outbound access to the Internet, as less confidence in the user's authenticity is justified.","As another example, the process of  may be used to implement a policy rule that may be expressed informally as: \u201cFirst, check client digital certificate. If the certificate is valid, then check for the version of a virus checker that is installed on the client; if the version is acceptable, then accept the client; else reject the client. If the virus checker is properly updated, then check whether the personal firewall settings of the client are acceptable; if so, accept the client, else reject the user.\u201d","In block , certificate-based authentication is performed, in the same manner described above for . If failure occurs, as tested in block , then in block , network access is declined. If success occurs, then in block  a second inner authentication conversation is initiated to verify that the client has an acceptable virus checker that is properly updated. Block  can be performed, for example, using packets of an inner conversation that specify an EAP Type associated with verifying a virus checker, and using a compatible EAP method that is accessible to the client using an API. Thus, performing checks such as virus checker verification and checking other credentials assumes that the client has access to a software method that can implement such verification or checks.","In block , a test is performed to determine whether the virus checker is acceptable or fully updated. If failure occurs, then in block  a first class of limited network access is granted. Thus, if the client passes the first test (block ) but fails the second test (block ) then a different level, degree, or \u201cquality of access\u201d (\u201cQoA\u201d) may be applied.","Alternatively, if success occurs, then in block  a third test is applied to verify that the client has an acceptable personal firewall configuration. Block  may involve initiating a third inner authentication conversation that invokes a client-side method to determine the client's personal firewall settings and return the settings to the AAA server. If the third inner authentication conversation results in success, as tested at block , then unlimited network access is granted, as shown in block . Alternatively, a second quality of access is applied at block .","The logic of  or  may be represented in a policy rule that is retrieved and applied as part of block  of , or block  of . Thus, unlike conventional EAP or PEAP, which provide for only two possible authentication outcomes (Success or Failure), embodiments of multiple authentications as described herein can use complex policy rules that provide for any number of authentication outcomes. In the example of , there are three (3) outcomes, represented by block , , , respectively.  has four (4) outcomes represented by block , , , , respectively.","Granting multiple different types of access as indicated at block , , , , , can be implemented using an access server that supports multiple different VLANs. For example, CiscoSecure ACS can download, to a device, a particular VLAN number that indirectly indicates a type or level of access; the device becomes part of the specified VLAN and can only access resources that permit access by the specified VLAN. Alternatively, granting access may involve specifying the name of an access control list (ACL) that limits user access in a particular way.","The foregoing examples present relatively simple scenarios. Much more sophisticated approaches can be practiced using the techniques herein, particularly as new EAP methods are developed to provide information on other credential types. Thus, the techniques herein allow the development of much more capable and sophisticated network behavior, because more granular information relating to each user request is obtained at authentication time. Additionally, new capabilities, such as networking quarantining and access policies based on authentication method are enabled with EAP-Multi.","4.0 Implementation Mechanisms\u2014Hardware Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","602","600","606","602","604","606","604","600","608","602","604","610","602"]},"Computer system  may be coupled via bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (\u201cCRT\u201d), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type. According to one embodiment of the invention, providing multiple authentication types within an authentication protocol that supports a single type is provided by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory  causes processor  to perform the process steps described herein.

Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus .","Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium from which a computer can read, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium from which a computer can read, punchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes from which a computer can read, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus  carries the data to main memory , from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions.

For example, communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (\u201cISDN\u201d) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented.
