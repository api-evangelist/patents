The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","A. Technical Field","The present invention pertains generally to data processing, and relates more particularly to management of data between a plurality of services.","B. Background of the Invention","Recently, a number of competing and complementary social network services have been created. These social network services are generally available through web sites on the Internet. To compete, these social network sites offer different types of services or focus on different market segments. For example, some sites are more suited for connecting with personal friends, while other sites are more business-oriented. Each of these social network services typically requires a user to provide user-specific profile information. All of the sites require or store some amount of personal profile information, such as, for example, a personal summary statement, status, past experience, qualifications, interests, contact information, and the like.","In addition to services offered through Internet web sites, private sites (intranets) also provide social networking or interactive services. For example, a company may provide one or more intra-company services that include the use of user information, such as a human resources management system. The company may maintain intra-company user web pages and may provide intra-company communication applications, including instant messaging, email, bulletin boards, and the like. For users, the company services also provide additional locations in which the users must update their information.","Because the services offered by these social network sites vary, many individuals maintain accounts on multiple sites. To maintain the user's profile information, an individual must log into the sites and update the same, or related, information multiple times. For example, if a user changes her summary statement in one social network application, she must also remember to change it in all the other sites where she wants the same statement to appear.","Accordingly, what is needed are systems and methods that provide a user the ability to control her information and leverage existence of information stored with one service provider to easily propagate some or all of that information to one or more other service providers.","Embodiments of the present invention enable management of data between a plurality of sites or service providers. Presented herein are systems and methods that facilitate the portability and management of user data maintained at two or more services. In embodiments, a configurable profile management interface or interfaces are provided to a user, which enable the user to identify data elements that may be maintained across one or more services. In embodiments, a user has the ability to set precedence values by identifying which elements from which service or services should be considered as sources of truth. In embodiments, those sources of truth may be used to propagate changes to one or more services. In embodiments, the profile synchronization functionality may be incorporated within an HR system. In embodiments, the user can also configure a schedule for transferring data, can import some or all of the data, and\/or can export all or some of the data.","In embodiments, a computer-implemented method for transferring data between services comprises displaying one or more interfaces to a user to aid the user in defining mappings and in order to access and transfer data to appropriate data fields. In embodiments, the method comprises displaying to a user a first set of fields available from a first service that operates on a first computer system. When a user desires to edit data associated with first set of fields, the user can select to edit the appropriate field. The user may directly enter the data or may identify a service to transfer data to, to transfer data from, or both. To facilitate the transfer, a user interface displays a second set of fields available from the second service. In embodiments, the available fields from the second service may be ascertained by interfacing with the second service via a preset protocol. In embodiments, a user interface facilitates the mapping of at least one field of the first service with at least one field of the second service.","In embodiments, the mapping includes precedence values wherein the field with the source data is identified. Thus, as part of the transfer, the source data in one service is transferred to the mapped destination field or fields in the other service provider.","In embodiments, at least one of the first and the second fields comprises multiple subfields and the mapping also comprises a parsing that defines a segmenting or aggregating of the set of transferred data relative to the multiple subfields.","In embodiments, the transferred data may be displayed to the user in a draft mode. The draft mode may be presented to the user in an interface that is configured to display the transferred data and is configured to receive the transferred data as edited by the user. After editing, the edited transferred data can be saved and associated with appropriate data field according to the defined mapping.","In embodiments, user-defined mappings are saved for future reference and\/or use. In embodiments, a user request to transfer may include setting a schedule of transfers and the data is transferred between services according to the schedule.","In embodiments, the data transfer may be an import, an export, or both. In embodiments, the data transferred from a source field to a destination field according to a mapping may overwrite any data in the destination field, pre-pend any data in the destination field, or post-pend any data in the destination field.","In embodiments, the present invention may be part of a human resources application utilized in an enterprise context. In embodiments, an enterprise system includes a profile management application that provides a configurable system for identifying elements of a user's profile that may be maintained across multiple services. The profile management system helps the user enter and maintain accurate data in the enterprise application. In embodiments, the system includes a profile management system that allows a user to transfer data between the enterprise application and one or more third-party services. To facilitate the transfer of data, the profile management system includes one or more user interfaces for configuring mappings between elements in the enterprise application and elements in the services. The user may also configure a precedence value, whereby a certain element or elements from a source can be identified as the source of truth for that item. In embodiments, the user can also configure a schedule for transferring data, can import some or all of the data, and\/or can export all or some of the data.","In embodiments, the application interface includes a link or links to export, import, or both, some or all of the data.","In embodiments, the present invention may be embodied in a computer program product comprising at least one computer-readable medium storing one or more sequences of instructions.","Although the invention is explained in the context of user data, it shall be understood that the invention may be applied to other types of data.","Some features and advantages of the invention have been generally described in this summary section; however, additional features, advantages, and embodiments are presented herein or will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Accordingly, it should be understood that the scope of the invention shall not be limited by the particular embodiments disclosed in this summary section.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these details. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments of the present invention, described below, may be implemented in a variety of ways, including software, hardware, or firmware, or combinations thereof. Accordingly, the examples described below are illustrative of specific embodiments of the invention and are meant to avoid obscuring the invention. Furthermore, although the invention is explained in the context of user data, it shall be understood that the invention may be applied to other types of data.","Components, or modules, shown in block diagrams are illustrative of exemplary embodiments of the invention and are meant to avoid obscuring the invention. It shall also be understood that throughout this discussion that components may be described as separate functional units, which may comprise sub-units, but those skilled in the art will recognize that various components, or portions thereof, may be divided into separate components or may be integrated together, including integrated within a single system or component.","Furthermore, connections between components within the figures are not intended to be limited to direct connections. Rather, data between these components may be modified, re-formatted, or otherwise changed by intermediary components. Also, additional or fewer connections may be used. It shall also be noted that the terms \u201ccoupled\u201d or \u201ccommunicatively coupled\u201d shall be understood to include direct connections, indirect connections through one or more intermediary devices, and wireless connections.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201cpreferred embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d or \u201cembodiments\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, characteristic, or function described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention and may be in more than one embodiment. The appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment,\u201d \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d or \u201cin embodiments\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment or embodiments.","The use of certain terms in various places in the specification is for illustration and should not be construed as limiting. Usage of the term \u201cservice\u201d is not limited to describing a single function; usage of the term also may refer to a grouping of related functions or functionality. Similarly, usage of the term \u201cresource\u201d is not limited to describing a single resource; the term also may be used to refer to a set of resources that may either be distributed or aggregated within a computing environment. It shall be understood that a set may comprise zero or more members and that references to data or a set of data includes no data (i.e., empty set).","It shall be noted that the interfaces depicted herein are presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation. Also, the interfaces may be integrated together or further divided. It shall also be noted that the mapping and managing of data need not be simply one-to-one. Rather, the present invention may be implemented in one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one mapping configurations.","Internet services, particularly social networking services, are collecting increasing amounts of data from individuals. Individuals find value in providing \u201cvolunteered\u201d data because it helps facilitate the services provided by these various services. Although users submit information to these services, users typically have a strong sense of ownership regarding their data contained at these sites, particularly when the services are social networking services. Because the services offered by these social network sites vary, many individuals maintain accounts on multiple sites. To maintain the user's profile information, an individual must log into the site and update the same, or related, information multiple times. Many users find the overhead associated with maintaining these accounts time consuming and troublesome, particularly because of the large amount of duplicated efforts. If the data associated with the various services were portable, it could be utilized by systems beyond the scope of the initial services. For example, a company's human resources (HR) systems can greatly benefit by having access to some or all of the data housed at third-party services sites.","Accordingly, presented herein are systems and methods that facilitate the portability and management of user data maintained at two or more sites. In embodiments, a configurable profile synchronizing interface or interfaces are provided to a user that enable the user to identify data elements that may be maintained across one or more sites. In embodiments, a user may also have the ability to identify which elements from which site or sites should be considered as sources of truth. In embodiments, those sources of truth may be used to propagate changes to one or more other sites. In embodiments, the profile synchronization functionality may be incorporated within an HR system.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a much easier and more efficient means for a user to populate a profile with data previously entered in one or more other, unrelated or third-party sites. Furthermore, a user can more easily and more efficiently manage updates to profile data for multiple sites. In embodiments, the user can control the sharing of data across the sites, including the sharing of internal company profile data. By improving the sharing and updating of information, the sites, including internal company sites, that utilize the data can better serve the user. For example, by facilitating the inputting of user profile information, both the company and the user\/employee can benefit. The company and user benefit by having current and more complete user information because the company can use the information to help keep the employee engaged, to help match employees with tasks, to help match employees and mentors, and the like.","Consider, by way of illustration, the system  displayed in .  illustrates the interaction between services to allow a user to manage the data associated with the various services according to various embodiments of the invention. Associated with service A is a user profile, Profile A A. Likewise, associated with each of the other services B-E is a user profile, Profile B-E B-E, respectively. A user profile may contain a number of types of information including, without limitation, user name, contact information, interests, preferences, schedules, contacts, etc. A user profile may also contain a number of types of information including without limitation, text and multimedia data (such as, by way of illustration and not limitation, pictures, video, music, images, etc.).","As depicted in , service A may interact with one or more of the other services B-E via one or more protocols . For example, Service A A may interact with Service B B and Service E using one protocol, protocol X X. And, Service A A may interact with Service C C and Service D D via different protocols, protocol Y Y and protocol Z Z, respectively. In embodiments, a protocol may be an open standard protocol, such as OpenSocial and Friend Connect. Alternatively, in embodiments, the protocols may be proprietary protocols developed by a service or developed between services. In embodiments, as new standards are developed or become available, these new standards may be added to a service.","Having a protocol between services allows for the interaction between services. For example, Service A A may retrieve and\/or post data to one or more of the other services B-E. Being able to retrieve data, post data, or both to one or more other services allows a user associated with profile A A to leverage and control the data that exists about her. Consider, by way of illustration and not limitation, the following example.","Company ABC has implemented an Oracle application that includes a profile management application according to the present invention. Employee Josephine Smith joins ABC and is a member of several social networks, including LinkedIn and Facebook.","Josephine would like colleagues at Company ABC to know that she likes sailing, and that she achieved the XYZ Certification at her previous employer . This information, along with additional useful information about Josephine, is stored at one or more other social networks sites. Without implementation of the present invention, Josephine would be frustrated because, despite Company ABC having a social network to store and display this information, she would have to enter all her information again. This frustration and duplication of effort may cause Josephine to not re-enter this additional data at her work site.","Similarly, if Josephine achieves a new certification with Company ABC, she would have no way of easily adding that information to LinkedIn so that her wider business network is aware of her recently professional advancement.","By implementing the teachings of the present invention, Josephine can access one site, in this example, her profile page at Company ABC and manage data at one or more third-party sites. Via the company site, Josephine can identify her networks and choose how to synchronize information to and\/or from each network with her profile data. In embodiments, the company's site may keep track of Josephine's open identification and network accounts.","An aspect of the present invention is that Josephine has control, and choice, over whether and what data will be transferred and how it will be transferred, as opposed to having something happen automatically, behind-the-scenes, that she cannot control. Thus, Josephine can indicate what information should be managed and which source of data is the source of truth for a specific content. For example, Facebook may be designated as the source of truth for recreational interests, Company ABC's profile may be designated as the source of truth for her professional credentials, and LinkedIn may be designated as the source of truth for her prior work history and professional memberships.","Via one or more interfaces provided through Company ABC's profile management service, Josephine can transfer some or all of that data. It should be noted that Josephine initiates the transfer of the data but she does not have to re-enter the data. In embodiments, her imported data is displayed to her online so that she can edit some or all of the data, if she chooses to do so. For example, she may wish to make some of the imported data more appropriate for the Company ABC audience.","An aspect of the present invention is that it allows an enterprise, by providing this utility within its company and by having this based on a person's profile in the company's enterprise system (as opposed to open social data outside the enterprise), to have its employees keep and maintain employee data within its network. Thus, the company has value because its employee data is more likely to be complete, more likely to be accurate, and more likely to be current. It is in the enterprise's interest for employees to keep what they are doing outside the company current with what is happening in their company profile, and employees are far more likely to do so when they have a convenient and easy method to do so, while still retaining full control of the process.","It should be noted that this profile data interaction is not intending to be an aggregator that compiles everything together and requires the user to sort it. Rather, it makes the populating of data fields in one profile, such as the profile at Company ABC, easy and effective by accessing other sources. In addition, in embodiments, it gives an added benefit of allowing the user to move the data from within an internal profile to an outside network or networks.","Thus, by allowing mapping of data fields between services, by allowing real-time user feedback or editing, and by allowing the designation of sources of truth, a user has effective control and management of her data across dispersed sites.","It shall be noted that one value of the present invention is in offering access to services using recognized open standards. And, for new standards, a value of the present invention is in the ability to create new connections and mappings without requiring an upgrade to a profile management application.","Also, a significant value is that individual users benefit from owning and managing their data in multiple places, while still providing an enterprise organization with the accurate data it requires to benefit its business.","Furthermore, allowing users the ability to manage their profile in multiple places creates greater efficiency and time-saving. By having the profile management features described herein, users can update various profile items in one site and manage the transfer of those items across multiple sites from the one site.","Having centralized profile management yields better consistency and reliability of data. For users with accounts on multiple sites, it is difficult to remember the sites they have updated and those they have not. This complexity of tracking the updating of multiple sites can lead to unintended inconsistencies and out-of-date information. Having a centralized profile management allows the user to keep multiple sites up-to-date and to track updates and revisions.","Furthermore, having a centralized profile management system respects the individual user. It gives the individual ownership of his or her profile data, to manage it how he or she sees fit; yet, it also gives an enterprise organization accurate employee data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"205"},"As illustrated in , a user identifies () at least one additional source of data. For purpose of this disclosure, an additional source is a source that is separate from the management\/synchronization service, which source may be a third-party source or a source within the same entity as the management\/synchronization service but a separate service or application.","Having identified at least one additional source of data, a mapping is developed () between elements, or data fields, in the first source of data and elements in the second source of data. For example, there may be a mapping between \u201caddress\u201d fields in the first source of data and \u201ccontact information\u201d in the second source data. In embodiments, a protocol, such as by way of example and not limitation, OpenSocial, can facilitate the mapping between elements. In embodiments, a protocol defines application programming interfaces (APIs) for retrieving information from and posting to a source of data. Elements that are accessible by the second source of data can be displayed to the user, and the user may select which field or fields in the first source of data should be mapped to a field or fields in the second source.","In embodiments, as part of the mapping, a user can indicate, for an element, a precedence value as it relates to the sources of data. For example, the user may identify the flow of data for an element or elements\u2014whether the first source of data should overwrite the second source of data, whether the second source of data should overwrite the first source of data, or whether neither source of data has a higher precedence than the other. In embodiments, the precedence may be set per element, per group of elements, per source of data, or a combination thereof.","Having established a mapping between sources of data and having indicated a precedence for elements, the user can import, export, or both () data between the two sources of data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["305","400","400","405","420","425","430","450","410","415"]},"In embodiments, all of the user's data may be displayed within a single page, or alternatively, data may be displayed in separate or supplemental pages. In the embodiment depicted in , a main page  exists that displays some information and links to additional pages are provided. For example, summary sections for some areas, such as the most frequently used areas, may be provided on the main page, but more detailed information for an area can be obtained by selecting a link to that area of information. In embodiments, if a person wanted more detailed information about the contact information, the person could click or otherwise select the contact information summary box . Alternatively or in addition to selecting a summary box, tabs of areas  can be displayed for selecting. Thus, if more detailed information about the contact information were desired, a user could select the tab labeled \u201cContact Information\u201d . One skilled in the art shall recognize that there are a number of ways to display data and that no particular way is critical to the present invention.","Returning to , a user may desire to add or edit information associated with a particular area. To do so, the user selects () an area to edit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","505","505","510","515","515","520"]},"In this illustrated embodiment, upon indicating that the user desires to edit the \u201cMy Career Statement\u201d section, a user interface is displayed to allow the user to edit the data.  depicts an interface  for allowing a user to input data according to various embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the art shall recognize that there are a number of ways to accept input data from a user and that no particular method is critical to the present invention; thus, the interface may be part of the display  or may be separate window, such as a pop-up dialog window, as depicted in .","The interface  depicted in  displays the title of the section of referring section , in this case \u201cMy Career Statement.\u201d Having the referring title  is beneficial, particularly when the interface is a separate window, because it helps keep the context for the user. The interface  provides an area  that is configured to receive input from the user. The user may enter text or other data into section . Also provided in the user interface  are buttons or links, which allow the user to save  entered data, to cancel , or to import  data from a third-party source. For purpose of this disclosure, a third-party source is a source that is separate from the management\/synchronization service from which the user has accessed his portrait information. Thus, a third-party source may be an external source or may be a source within the same entity as the management\/synchronization service but separate from the management\/synchronization service. The \u201cImport\u201d functionality , allows the user to choose () between entering the data into field  or obtain information from another source.","If the user does not wish to use data from another source of data, the user can directly enter the data into field  and save the newly entered data by selecting the \u201cSave\u201d button . A user may want to enter the data directly if no other data exists. Even if similar data does exist, the user may not want to use it. Aspects of the present invention provide the user control over the use or the non-use of data that exists in other locations. However, assuming that other data does exist that could be used for this selected element, the user may import that data by selecting the \u201cImport\u201d button .","If the user wants to import the data from another source, the user can define a source of data and an element to be imported (). In embodiments, an interface is presented to the user to facilitate the selection of a source, to facilitate the mapping between the fields, and to facilitate the identification of the source of truth for this data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","600","700","765","765","700","705","770","700","770","715","710","710","715","715","770","720"]},"Also depicted in  is a display of the elements available from the selected source of data. In embodiments, once the source is identified , available mechanisms (for example API, XML) for that source of data can be ascertained and used to populate the listing  of elements . In embodiments, the elements that are available at the selected source  can be known by querying the source or may be known from previous interactions with that source.","In embodiments, the ability to add a new source of data and\/or to define mappings is restricted to system administrators. For example, in embodiments, a user may identify a new source of data to a system administrator via the \u201cEnter New\u201d option discussed above, but before being allowed to interact with this source of data, the user must wait until an administrator has added the new source of data and has defined mappings. Embodiments of adding new sources of data and defining mappings are explained in more detail below.","In embodiments, the interface may have tiered display of data available from a source of data, wherein the listing in a subsequent tier is determined by the prior tier. For example, a source of data may have three general areas: \u201cWork History,\u201d \u201cContact Information,\u201d and \u201cEducation\u201d with data fields associated with each of those three element groups. If \u201cContact Information\u201d is selected at the first tier, the second tier listing may be all of the fields under that general area (e.g., \u201cHome Address ,\u201d \u201cHome Address ,\u201d \u201cHome City,\u201d \u201cHome State,\u201d \u201cHome Phone,\u201d \u201cWork Address ,\u201d \u201cWork Address ,\u201d \u201cWork City,\u201d \u201cWork State,\u201d \u201cWork Phone,\u201d etc.).","In the depicted embodiment, in the Element  listing , the user has selected \u201cAbout Me\u201d . It should be noted that this process creates the mapping between an element in the first source of data (\u201cMy Career Statement,\u201d in this example) to the element in a second source of data (\u201cAbout Me\u201d in Facebook, in this example). In embodiments without explicit precedence setting, the mapping inherently includes precedence in that the first source of data is being overwritten by the second source of data for this element. Alternatively, the interface may receive or prompt for a precedence value to set the source of truth between these elements and services.","Having identified the source of data and the element to be imported (), the user can import () the data in the current application. In the interface depicted in , an \u201cImport Now\u201d button  is provided to allow the user to initiate the importing process. It should be noted that the interface  depicted in  can also receive a login  and password . If the selected source of data  is password protected, the login and password information may be needed to access the element to be imported. Interface  may also include an option to synchronize  the data at set intervals, which will be described in more detail below.","In embodiments, after having imported the data element, a draft of the imported data can be displayed to the user.  illustrates an interface  that provides a draft display of imported data according to various embodiments of the invention. In this embodiment, the interface  is the edit interface of  that has been updated with the imported data. Having a draft display allows a user to preview () the imported data. The user can determine if the imported data is acceptable () by previewing or editing the imported data before it is saved within the first source of data. This preview and edit ability is advantageous for at least a few reasons.","First, the user may have mis-mapped the elements between the sources. In that case, the user may want to cancel the importing by selecting the \u201cCancel\u201d feature . Alternatively, the user may re-try () the mapping process by selecting the \u201cImport\u201d  button, which, in embodiments, may return the user to the interface depicted in . Second, the user may have incorrectly remembered the contents associated with the mapped element. That is, the user may have thought that the data would be appropriate to import but upon inspection realizes that the imported data does not satisfy the user. Third, having the ability to preview and edit allows the user to address validation errors. For example, a date might be imported from a second source in a format not recognized or valid in the first source, which could cause an error that the user can then correct. Finally, the draft display may allow the user to edit () the imported data. For example, the imported data may contain the bulk of the information that the user wanted to import, but the user may want to alter the data for the destination service. In the present example, the user may want to leverage the prior statement by importing it (so the user does not have to reenter the data), but the user may want to change the tone or expand upon the imported statement. Assuming that the imported data (or an edited version of the imported data) is acceptable, the user may save  the data within the first source of data by selecting the \u201cSave\u201d button .  illustrates the profile interface  of  with the updated data  associated with the My Career Statement element obtained from a third-party service according to various embodiments of the invention.","It shall be noted that the above example used to illustrate the general methods associated with  represents the data management of an element (e.g., My Career Statement) that is a multi-line editable field.

It should be noted that each element, or type, may contain one or more items and an item may comprise one or more data fields. In embodiments, a number may be presented by the element to indicate how many items are currently within that element. For example, the user depicted has 4 competency records, 3 accomplishment records, and 1 school record. In embodiments, if an element is not listed, a list of values  is provided to the user to enter a new element (type of content). Selecting \u201cSchools\u201d  causes the display to list the items  of that element. The categories of the data fields of this element include, by way of example, Degree , Area of Study , School , and Date Acquired . The data associated with these data fields includes Leslie's Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University, but she wants to include her post-graduate degrees.

In this section, the administrator identifies () one or more elements for a first source  and identifies () one or more corresponding elements from a second source . In embodiments, elements that are available from a service are displayed to the administrator, and the administrator can select element mappings. For example, the administrator may select \u201cEducation\u201d  from a dropdown listing of the available elements in Plaxo and may select \u201cSchools\u201d  from a dropdown listing of the elements available from the Oracle service. If the administrator is satisfied with these mappings, he may select \u201cOK\u201d to save them. Thus, mappings between elements are defined (), and these mappings can serve as default mappings when users want to transfer their data between these services.  depicts the interface of  that has been updated with the new registered service, Plaxo , and its field mapping details .","Aspects of the present invention include setting () precedence values between elements. As part of the mapping, or alternatively in addition to the mapping, a user and\/or an administrator can indicate, for an element, a precedence as it relates to the sources of data. For example, the user may identify the flow of data for an element or elements\u2014whether the first source of data should overwrite the second source of data, whether the second source of data should overwrite the first source of data, or whether neither source of data has a higher precedence than the other. In embodiments, precedence may be set per element, per group of elements, per source of data, or a combination thereof.","For example, in embodiments, all data imported into the profile management application may be set by default to be overwritten. Alternatively, the precedence values may be individually set. Consider, by way of illustration and not limitation, the interface shown in .  depicts an interface similar to the shown in , however, it includes fields  and  for explicitly setting the precedence. In the depicted embodiment, the precedence is set element by element. For example, Accomplishments in Oracle is set as the source of truth  and therefore has a higher precedence than Achievements in Plaxo. Whereas, Memberships in Plaxo is set as the source of truth  and therefore has a higher precedence than Affiliations in the Oracle application. In embodiments, the precedence can be set at the user level, rather than (or in addition to) at the administrator level. In embodiments, where neither element has a higher precedence, the data may be concatenated and displayed for a user to edit.","One skilled in the art shall recognize that transitive properties may be used to generate additional mappings between services. For example, if mappings are set between service A and service B and set between service B and service C, then some mappings may be able to be automatically generated between service A and service C. Furthermore, in embodiments, precedence settings may be relative and universal precedence values. For example, an element in service X may always be the source of truth no matter what other service is being mapped to it; thus, the administrator or user can set that as a universal precedence.","In embodiments, as part of setting mappings, an administrator and\/or a user may define () parsing rules. Although preset or predefined protocols help facilitate the exchange of information between services, differences in formatting or other implementation specifics may result in differences that require special parsing rules. In embodiments, these parsing rules may be saved as part of the mappings, or as part of the interface definition API.","Having an application that can manage data between a plurality of services, as described herein, is extremely beneficial. However, if a user's access to that application may one day be limited, user adoption of the application's profile management functionality may be reduced. Consider, for example, if the application is part of a company's human resources application. Users generally want assurance that they can utilize that data even if they leave the company.
