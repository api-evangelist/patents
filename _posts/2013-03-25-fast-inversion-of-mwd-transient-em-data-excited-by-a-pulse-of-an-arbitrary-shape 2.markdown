title: Fast inversion of MWD transient EM data excited by a pulse of an arbitrary shape
abstract: A system and method of estimating properties of a subsurface formation are described. The method includes transmitting an excitation current pulse into the formation, receiving an induced pulse used to generate input data, and performing an inversion on the input data using a lookup table based on a shape of the excitation current pulse to estimate the properties of the subsurface formation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In downhole exploration and production efforts, a number of sensors and measurement systems are used to provide information about the downhole environment. For example, temperature and pressure in the subsurface environment are typically monitored, and changes in these parameters may indicate the ingress of wellbore fluid or other useful information. Obtaining resistivity (or, inversely, conductivity) information about downhole formations may help to characterize the formation and facilitate decisions regarding drilling and production. Resistivity may be estimated from reflected or induced pulses resulting from transmitting electric pulses into the formation.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method of estimating properties of a subsurface formation includes transmitting an excitation current pulse into the formation; receiving an induced pulse used to generate input data; and performing an inversion on the input data using a lookup table based on a shape of the excitation current pulse to estimate the properties of the subsurface formation.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method of performing inversion to estimate properties of a subsurface formation includes generating a first lookup table based on a step-function excitation pulse shape; and calculating a residual norm based on inversion of input data using the first lookup table to estimate the properties according to values that provide a minimum residual norm.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, a system to perform inversions to estimate properties of a subsurface formation includes a memory device configured to store a first lookup table; and a processor configured to calculate a residual norm based on inversion of input data using the first lookup table to estimate the properties according to values that provide a minimum residual norm.","As noted above, resistivity information about a formation may be helpful in ascertaining characteristics of the formation and making decisions based on the formation. Resistivity values may be estimated, rather than measured directly, based on induced (reflected) electrical pulses resulting from transmitting current pulses (excitation pulses) into the formation. Prior inversion algorithms used to estimate formation parameters from data acquired in this manner only account for step-function excitation pulses. In addition, the methods may rely on heuristic relationships between parameters that are not always valid under every circumstance. Embodiments of the system and method discussed herein relate to an inversion algorithm that employs look-up tables to provide inversion results.","Generally, inversion is a process of finding a model that provides the best fit between measured data and synthetic data. With respect to geophysical data, inversion facilitates inferring information about a formation from acquired data. The inference is usually statistical and generally not uniquely solvable. That is, when a single model fits the data, then an infinite number of models would fit the data, as well. Many of those models may, in fact, be unreasonable or yield inferences that are inaccurate. Embodiments of the system and method discussed herein include the use of prior information to reject the unreasonable models that fit the data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","2","3","4","10","2","5","5","6","6","7","6","7","7","2","5","9","10","15","15","15","10","12","13","10","11","4","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["11","7","7","10","4","7","10","210","220","11"],"sub":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIGS. 3-8"],"b":["15","15","310","210","220"]},"The method includes calculating residual norm at block .

three five-parametric original lookup tables, corresponding to xx, yy, and zz components, and a step-function excitation pulse are generated.

The exemplary model used to generate three sets of the input data is a three-layered model, with each model using a different distance from the tool to the bottom boundary (D2B). The three models use D2Bvalues of 1, 5, and 10 meters. The D2Bvalue is 1 meter for all three models. Resistivity of the first (R) and third (R) layers (Ro) is 1 ohm, and resistivity of the second (R) layer (Ro) is 5 ohm. Measurements are assumed to start 2 \u03bcs after switching on the current in the transmitter  and to last 0.405 ms. No cross components (e.g., xy) are used, and random, normally distributed 20% noise (as a percentage of signal level) is added to the input data.
