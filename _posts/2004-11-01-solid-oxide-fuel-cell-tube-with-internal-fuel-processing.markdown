{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/515,779 filed on Oct. 30, 2003.","This invention was made with government support under contract number DAAD19-01-C-0073, awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to solid oxide fuel cells and more particularly, to solid oxide fuel cells of lightweight design.","A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFCs) is a type of fuel cell which reacts a fuel gas with an oxidant to generate DC electric current. SOFCs comprises an anode, an electrolyte and a cathode, and have been made from a variety of materials and in a variety of geometries. Fuel processing is required to render hydrocarbon fuels (such as propane, butane, etc.) suitable for SOFCs. For example, known designs for fuel processors include those done with a separate external reactor where a catalytic substrate processes a hydrocarbon fuel such as butane (CH), propane (CH) or diesel fuel (JP-8 or JET-A) to a suitable fuel gas such containing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H). CO and Hydrogen gas are then oxidized at an active area of a SOFC to carbon dioxide and water, with DC current generated. Non hydrocarbon fuels such as ammonia (NH) can also be transformed into SOFC fuel using one or more catalytic reactions.","It has become desirable to make solid oxide fuel cells as light as possible so that they may serve as a portable power source. An external reactor is bulky and is accompanied with significant inefficiencies in transfer of hot processed fuel gas from the reactor to the active area of the fuel cell. U.S. Patent Publication 2003\/0054215 to Doshi et al discloses a stack of fuel cell plates where a catalytic substrate is positioned within the plates and within a thermal enclosure. However, such stack designs are known to have problems with thermal cycling, they cannot be heated and cooled quickly, and extensive seals have to be used, including seals subjected to high thermal loading. Further, hot seals have to be used at locations inside the thermal enclosure, and hot seals are expensive. Addressing all of these problems makes such stacked plate designs relatively expensive. It would be desirable to provide a solid oxide fuel cell of a simple, and lightweight design which is also robust in construction and capable of withstanding thermal cycling.","In accordance with a first aspect, a solid oxide fuel cell comprises a tube forming an anode, electrolyte and cathode, and a catalytic substrate for fuel processing is positioned within the tube. The solid oxide fuel cell forms a lightweight module that does not require a separate, external reformer.","It should be understood that the appended drawings are not necessarily to scale, presenting a somewhat simplified representation of various preferred features illustrative of the basic principles of the invention. The specific design features of the solid fuel cell as disclosed here, including, for example, specific dimensions of the catalytic substrate will be determined in part by the particular intended application and use environment. Certain features of the illustrated embodiments have been enlarged or distorted relative to others for visualization and clear understanding. In particular, thin features may be thickened, for example, for clarity of illustration. All references to direction and position, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the orientation of the solid state electrochemical device illustrated in the drawings.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, to those who have knowledge or experience in this area of technology, that many uses and design variations are possible for the fuel cells disclosed herein. The following detailed discussion of various alternative and preferred features and embodiments will illustrate the general principles of the invention with reference to an internal reformer suitable for use with a solid oxide fuel cell (\u201cSOFC\u201d). Other embodiments suitable for other applications will be apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","30","28","24","26","20","22","12","10","14","36","16","38","32","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["40","45","40","41","43","47","40","43","41","48","43","40","44","45","44","36","16","58","44","32","97","60","16","36","38","60"]},"Such fuel cell designs are advantageously relatively light in weight, and provide good power density to mass ratios. As an example of a lightweight design each tube  can comprise a 1 mm-20 mm diameter tube with at least three layers, an inner layer of anode, a middle layer of electrolyte, and an outer layer of cathode. The anode comprises, for example, a porous cermet of nickel and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The electrolyte can comprise a thin membrane of YSZ. The cathode can comprise, for example, a porous lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM). An example of a suitable fuel cell tube shaped anode, electrolyte and cathode is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,749,799 to Crumm et al, entitled METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE and hereby incorporated by reference. Other material combinations for the anode, electrolyte and cathode, as well as other cross section geometries (triangular, square, polygonal, etc.) will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.","In accordance with a highly advantageous feature, the catalytic substrate , which partially oxidizes the fuel gas, is positioned inside the tube, advantageously eliminating the need and expense of an external processing device. Moreover, significant heat is generated at the catalytic substrate  when a fuel gas is introduced, and this heat is useful in increasing the temperature of the gases to a level where the fuel cell is more efficient in generating electrical power.","The catalytic substrate  can comprise, for example, particles of a suitable metal such as platinum or other noble metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, or their alloys. Other suitable materials for use as a catalytic substrate can comprise oxides, carbides, and nitrides. The catalytic substrate may comprise a wire, a porous bulk insert of a catalytically active material, or a thin \u201cribbon\u201d which would have the effect of increasing the ratio of surface area to volume. In the preferred embodiment shown in , the catalytic substrate  comprises a supported catalyst. Supported catalysts consist of very fine scale catalyst particles supported on a substrate made of, for example a ceramic such as aluminum oxide. Preferably the catalytic substrate is honeycomb shaped, provided with a series of openings  which the fuel gas passes through as it is processed. The outer diameter of the honeycomb catalytic substrate is smaller than the inner diameter of the of SOFC tube . The honeycombed catalytic substrate may also be provided with spaces through which any current collector wires may pass. Other materials suitable for use as a catalytic substrate will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.","The catalytic substrate  is shown in  positioned inside the thermal enclosure defined by the insulation .  shows the insulation  removed showing tubes  of the SOFC bundled together by manifold . In this manner, a series of tubes can be assembled together into a close fitting compartment surrounded by insulation . In this manner, cold hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen advantageously can be introduced to the SOFC through tubes closed off at the manifold with conventional or \u201ccold seals\u201d such as adhesives and sealants.","Current collectors may be mounted within and around the tubes , preferably at or near the active area  to capture electric current generated when the fuel gases are completely oxidized.  shows an alternate preferred embodiment of a tube-shaped catalytic substrate  where an opening  may be provided to receive a current collector. Alternatively, a packed bed of catalytic substrate beads may be used, with the beads either arranged in an orderly fashion or randomly packed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["40","40","43","44","32","46","32","40","40","46"]},"Advantageously, the internal catalytic substrates can be combined with different compositions in series to effect controlled ignition, thermal distribution and reaction, as desired. A fuel mixture consisting of one or more of water vapor, fuel, and oxygen can first pass over a catalytic substrate which partially oxidizes a portion of the fuel to create a hot mixture of the remaining fuel, and one or more of partially reformed fuel, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water. The heated fuel-water from the partial oxidation reaction could then undergo endothermic steam reforming in a downstream internal reactor or across the same reactor (tube) to produce a desired reformed fuel. This type of fuel processing is known as autothermal reforming. Alternatively, a suitable mixture of fuel and water vapor used in combination with one or more catalytic substrates may be used to transform a hydrocarbon into a desired reformed fuel. Additional catalytic materials may be applied to promote a \u2018water gas shift\u2019 reaction which would enrich the hydrogen content of a fuel gas stream. The catalytic substrates disclosed herein are advantageous in that they may be used in any of the aforementioned processes where a catalytic agent is required to accelerate a reaction.","From the foregoing disclosure and detailed description of certain preferred embodiments, it will be apparent that various modifications, additions and other alternative embodiments are possible without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention. The embodiments discussed were chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to use the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally, and equitably entitled."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
