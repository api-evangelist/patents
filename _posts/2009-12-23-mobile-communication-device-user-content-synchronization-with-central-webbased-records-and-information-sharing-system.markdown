{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is in the field of user content management and synchronization for mobile communication devices, such as cellular telephone devices, and other devices with user records maintained at a central node, such as at a web server.","The immense popularity of mobile communication devices, such as cellular telephones and other hand held communication devices, has resulted in ever-increasing quantities and types of data that are being stored on the mobile communication devices. Therefore, such data becomes more important for the user and thus the updating and safety of such data is more important than ever. The same is true for photo data, video files and other user content stored.","Services such as ActiveSync, are available for mass storing of certain types of user data stored on such communication devices. However, such services do not allow on-line and off-line management of individual fields of user data by the user and from a second device. They do not provide granularity of data field management for the user. Further, existing services do not provide for automatic transporting of the data stored on-line to a different mobile device, for example, if the original mobile device is lost or damaged or if two or more users wish to share certain types of content.","Also, they do not provide for automatic two-way synchronization by updating the central node, such as a web server providing access to the user data, with any additions or changes to the data stored on the mobile device, while also updating the mobile device with any changes or additions to the on-line data.","A method, a system, a program of instructions embodied on a processor-readable storage medium, a set of signals implementing such a method, and a device that includes a module for carrying out such a method are described to enable a mobile communication terminal or another device that stores data for the user to automatically synchronize user content stored on a mobile device with user content stored at a central node, such as at a synchronization server. In this way, automatic two-way synchronization may be provided, the user may monitor, view, update, change, add to or delete all or any field of user content using a web interface provided for the device at a central node such as at a synchronization server cloud or data storage cloud, and may monitor the central node user content on-line or off-line from a remote device other than the mobile device.","Also, since the mobile device initiates most of the commands and thus most of the processing necessary to conduct a synchronization operation, the central node is relieved and the distributed system is obtainable. Accordingly, the central node, such as the synchronization server is required to perform a reduced quantity of processing and less demand is placed on the server cloud.","According to an embodiment of the synchronization operation, the synchronization application maintains a running log or list of every field of user content, and optionally the content of all such fields, that have been changed, deleted or added since the most recent synchronization application. Similarly, the central synchronization application of the synchronization server maintains such a running list for the user content stored by the central node that are changed, added or deleted since the most recent synchronization operation. Then, during the next synchronization operation corresponding fields of the list maintained by the synchronization application running on the device and the list maintained by the central synchronization at the central node are determined and the most recently updated field of each pair is used to update the user data that was less recently updated. These lists may also include a date\/time stamp for each field that was changed as well as a hash, which represents the data's unique qualities. Alternatively, the lists may refer or index the user content records but not actually contain their user data that has been changed, deleted or added.","Further, if the mobile device is lost or is damaged, the central node would still have a record of all the user content as of the most recent synchronization operation and any replacement mobile device obtained by the user may be conveniently and automatically updated with the synchronization operation at the next timing (or at the user's initiation of the synchronization operation).","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention which refers to the accompanying Drawings.","With reference to the Drawings, the features thereof are described below.","As illustrated in , a synchronization application  may reside on a mobile device , such as a cellular phone or a handheld keyboard device, or another type of portable communication device. The synchronization application may be implemented as software that comes prepackaged with the operating system and other software units of the mobile telephone from a cellular network provider or may be sold or downloaded separately. Also, the software may be sold as a package or downloaded from a specialty vendor that sells such software applications. Also, while the present application repeatedly refers to the synchronization application as software, the synchronization application may be implemented as hardware that is part of the telephone or device, as firmware embodied on a card sold together with or separate from the mobile device, or the like.","As illustrated in , the synchronization application  includes a synchronization controller  that activates a synchronization operation upon the occurrence of a certain event, upon the initiation by a user (not shown), or upon the elapse of a predetermined time period. For example, the user may wish to initiate a synchronization operation when he has purchased a new mobile device and wishes to update his or her current device with the information from his\/her previous one. Alternatively, the synchronization controller  may automatically initiate the synchronization operation at a certain time everyday, every week or at some other regularly occurring time period. Further, the user of the mobile device  may also be allowed to determine the times or the regularity occurring periods at which a synchronization application is to be performed.","Such user content to be synchronized may include some or all of the user content that is stored for the user on the mobile device . For example, such user content may include the user's contacts or \u201caddress book\u201d or \u201ctelephone book\u201d stored by the user, including the names and telephone numbers of the user's friends and acquaintances, the user's calendar events, the user's alarm clock settings, the user's text messages and e-mail messages, including outgoing, incoming, archived, deleted and draft, the user's voicemails, the user's recorded greeting or outgoing messages, the user's notes, the user's photos, the user's videos, the user's ringtones, the user's saved links and URLs, the user's preferences and any other such information that the user may store.","The synchronization application  may provide for a two-way synchronization of the user content data, such that any changes, automatic updates, additions or deletions made to the user content data stored on the mobile device  are automatically updated to a central node illustrated in  as a synchronization server , and such that any changes, automatic updates, additions or deletions made to the user content data for that user at the synchronization server  are automatically updated to the contents of the mobile device . The user of the synchronization application may have access to the synchronization server at the central node, for example, via a website provided by a vendor that provides the synchronization service or via a website of the wireless network carrier or cellular provider , and thus, according to this aspect of Applicant's invention, the user would be able to monitor, view, change, delete or add to any portion of the user content data stored for the user for the mobile device  at the synchronization server  via the website. Thereafter, during each synchronization operation, the synchronization application  residing at the mobile device  would automatically provide the two-way synchronization of the user content data stored at the mobile device  with the user data stored at the synchronization server  and\/or the database  at the central node.","According to an aspect of Applicant's invention, to overcome a potentially difficult hurdle regarding data ambiguity, the synchronization operation would entail giving preference to any data stored at the mobile device , which would be assumed to be more recent than the data for the user stored at the synchronization server  and\/or at the database  of the central node, or, according to another implementation, in case of conflict as to which update is more recent, the content stored at the mobile device  would be given preference. Alternatively, at each synchronization operation, the synchronization application  would determine which of the data stored at the mobile device  at the synchronization server  is more recent, and in particular would determine for every field of data or every particular record of the user content the more recent one, and would use the more recent field as the basis for updating the less recent corresponding field or record for the user, without giving preference to information stored on the mobile device .","As illustrated in , the synchronization application  may provide the synchronization operation by communicating with the synchronization server  via wireless connection  with a base station or , whichever is determined to be the controlling cell for the mobile device , of a wireless cellular network which further may include BS control node  for controlling the base stations, and the wireless provider facility  for providing a web interface for the cellular network to connect with the internet, such as the world wide web  and the synchronization server . Alternatively, or in addition to the foregoing structures, the mobile device  may include a Wi-Fi connection card or other type of Wi-Fi connection port (not shown) to communicate via Wi-Fi wireless link  with Wi-Fi connection or Wi-Fi connection which in turn connects with the Wi-Fi web interface  to connect with the synchronization server  via the web . A mobile device  may have one or more network interfaces, for example, one or more network interface cards (NIC) or a network controller, and the network interface may include a personal area network (PAN) interface providing bluetooth, UWB (ultrawideband network) or IEEE 802.15.4 (for example ZigBee) functionality. For example, mobile device  may be in wireless communication using bluetooth or ZigBee with a local device that is in turn in communication with the central node via web .","The synchronization server  may be implemented as a processor cloud that includes a series of processors and may include a synchronization application  that provides functionality for synchronization at the central node, components of which are shown in . The synchronization server  may also be attached to a database , which too may be implemented as a data storage cloud, or a set of servers connected to the web . The synchronization server  or processor cloud may be connected to the database  (or to data storage cloud) directly or via web .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"A synchronization operation may be performed, for example, at a certain time every hour or once a day. Further, the user may be allowed to specify via user preference module  of the synchronization application  at what time or how often such synchronization operations are to be initiated. For example, as illustrated in  the user interface provided by the mobile device  may include a set of boxes or \u201cradio buttons\u201d or the like to designate the times or events for commencing of synchronization operations. The selections may be stored in the user preference module  of the synchronization application . Similarly, the user interface provided by the mobile device  may allow the user to designate using a selection of boxes or radio buttons or the like what types of user data to synchronize. The user may wish to synchronize only contact list\/telephone book type information and items on the calendar, but not such items as the alarm clock function settings. The user interface may also provide default settings that are checked automatically until or unless the user changes them. These settings may then be stored in the user preference module  of the synchronization application . Mobile device  may include a display, such as an LCD, LED or an organic light emitting diode (OLED) based display, or a CRT display or some such other type of display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["25","20","26","20","41","40","20","20","20","20","20"]},"As illustrated in , synchronization control  initiates remaining components of the synchronization application  at a predetermined time or upon the occurrence of a predetermined event. Synchronization control  attempts to contact the synchronization server  via the wireless network and the base station or or via the Wi-Fi connection , and the Wi-Fi interface . Communication between the synchronization application  of the mobile device  and the central synchronization application  at the synchronization server  may be conducted using a standard TCP\/IP implemented as part of a packet-based network and may use standard HTTP in a RESTful paradigm.","As illustrated in , when setting up the mobile device  for synchronization with the central node the user may be prompted to enter a user name and password and to enter a mobile ID identifying this mobile device  for the user. Thus, the user may associate many mobile devices for synchronization with the central node and each mobile device will share the same user name and password for the convenience of the user. In the alternative, for added security as illustrated in  the user may be asked to provide the user name and\/or the password associated with the user name and\/or the mobile ID in addition to the user name and password each time the synchronization operation is to be commenced. The mobile device  may be assigned a unique ID, or, the subscribing user may be assigned a unique ID and the mobile device  may be assigned a secondary device ID, for example device ID -, associated with the unique ID of the mobile user. An authentication of the mobile device  is performed by authenticator  which ensures that the mobile device  is a subscriber of the service provided by the synchronization server . For example, a public key and private key approach may be used for authenticating the mobile device  by authenticator . Other authentication schemes are well known and may be used in addition to or instead of the one described. Although the synchronization server  is shown as a unit distinct from the wireless provider , according to an aspect of Applicant's invention, the wireless carrier or network provider may provide the synchronization service and may thus house or provide the synchronization server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","2","30","20","30","60","50","60","50","31","30","20","20","50","32"]},"At step  the central node is requested to provide all fields of the user data that have been changed since the most recent synchronization operation and the data\/time of the most recent change or update of each field that has been changed. The GETcompare may be a method call requesting a list of all records maintained associated with the requesting mobile  device of the user at the central node that have been changed, added or deleted since the most recent synchronization operation. Other terms used in  include FSCL, the File System Changes Log, which is a representation of all the user records of interest on the mobile device . oldFSCL is a list of all records on the mobile device  as they existed before the current synchronization operation. Thus, since most devices do not keep a list of recently deleted files, the FSCL file is compared with the oldFSCL file to determine which file or files needs to be deleted by adding it to the DELETEqueue. Thus, the DELETEqueue is a list of records to be deleted from the central node, as determined by comparing the oldFSCL with the FSCL. Similarly, DELETEphone is a list of all records that are recently deleted on the central node. They are deleted via a DELETE command. The GETqueue is a list of records that are to be retrieved from the central node. Then, FSCL is compared with the GETcompare\/oldFSCL. The POSTqueue, on the other hand, is a list of records to be posted using the POSTcommand to the central node. This list is determined by comparing the FSCL with the GETcompare\/oldFSCL. Alternatively, all user content data from the central node may be requested and stored temporarily by the mobile terminal.","At S the fields that have been changed may be stored temporarily by the synchronization application  in the mobile device . Similarly, at F a File System Changes Log is generated or read out. This log represents all fields of the user content stored on the mobile device  that have changed since the most recent synchronization operation.","Such a File Systems Changes Log may be generated in several ways, for example, a background process may be running that adds each file system change in the mobile device to the log, or at run time during the synchronization operation (or just before the synchronization operation) the files may be scanned and those fields that have changed since the most synchronization operation may be added to the log. The latter approach may be more applicable for the first synchronization operation and would be less susceptible to a changed field if the program had been turned off.","At S the corresponding fields of the records obtained from the central node and the file system changes log are determined. Such corresponding fields of the user record may be obtained, for example, if each field of user content is indexed by a searchable key. Then, at S, for each corresponding record a determination is made as to which version, the version that had been maintained by the central node or the version that had been maintained by the mobile device  is the most recent version. This determination is made based on the date\/time stamp associated with each field of the user data of the GETcompare results and the File System Changes Log. If at S the version maintained at the synchronization  is determined to be more recent then a command is generated and added to a command queue to update content stored by the mobile device . Alternatively, if the mobile device  version (the \u201cphone version\u201d) is determined to be more recent for that field of the user data content, then a command is generated and added to the command queue to request that the synchronization server  update the data stored at the central node, including by the database or the data storage cloud  (S).","As shown in S the commands on the command queue are executed one after another. As shown in the flowchart of , two command queues may be generated, one at S containing the GET commands for obtaining data of the central node and updating the mobile device  user content, and one at S containing the POST commands for updating the central node user content. At S a determination is made as to whether there was an error. If a GET error was made then the command is reposted to the GETqueue and if a POST error is made then the command is put back on the POSTqueue S. It will be understood that while described using method calls of one computer language, many other types of command syntax are possible. Also, while the synchronization operation is described with reference to the approach illustrated in , it will be readily understood that many other types of synchronization operation are known that will make possible the update of a field of user data that has been changed by a user, in order to automatically update with new information that has been added, or to remove data has been deleted, to a less recent corresponding field.","At S commands effecting residual records are added to queues of residual commands, a residual get queue is generated at S and a residual post queue is generated at S and these command queues are added to respective command queues performed at the next synchronization operation, except that if a field effected by such residual command is more subsequently updated after the current synchronization operation then residual commands are not executed. At S the timer for starting the next synchronization operation is reset, such that, for example if a synchronization operation is set to be commenced every hour than the timer is set for an hour starting from the completion of the current synchronization operation. According to an aspect of Applicant's invention, the user preference module  may provide an automatic default setting for a timing of synchronization operations, and the user preference module  may have a minimum threshold, for example five minutes, that must elapse between synchronization operations. Also, a thirty minute or an hour minimum interval setting may be provided as the minimum time that may be set by the user by the user preference module .  illustrates a list of operations performed by the synchronization application  as part of a synchronization operation written out as pseudo code.  is a high-level illustration of the authentication stage and the synchronization operation according to an aspect of Applicant's invention, performed with command issued by the synchronization application  residing on the mobile device .","A basic outline of steps executed during a synchronization operation is illustrated in . At \u201cSign Up\u201d an SMS (short message service message) or other such communication may be sent to the mobile communication device  (phone) with a link to install the application. At \u201cCompare\u201d the Phone sends a command to the central node (Web), which replies with XML data required to synchronize. At \u201cSynch from Phone\u201d the Phone passes data to the central node, with the central node-transmitting confirmation. At \u201cSynch from Web\u201d the Phone is requesting data from the central node. \u201cChange Settings\u201d is provided to update user account details from the Phone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["20","99","90"]},"Also, according to another aspect of the invention, the central node may initiate the synchronization operation using \u201cpush\u201d approach. Thus, the central synchronization application  of synchronization server  of the central node may transmit a request to the synchronization controller  of the synchronization application  of the mobile device  to commence synchronization operation. Such a push-based initiation may be provided at a particular time of the day, week or month, at predetermined time intervals or upon the occurrence of a previously specified event, such as the user signing onto an account via a web interface to the central node. Also, the central synchronization application  may include a user preference module  to request and store user selected time, time interval or specified occasions for initiating the synchronization operation. Such a push-based synchronization operation may also be initiated automatically for all devices when a second mobile device of the user or another terminal  is associated with the central node, or may be initiated manually as desired by the user. Such a push-based synchronization operation may be performed in addition to or in lieu of the synchronization operation initiated by the synchronization application  of the mobile device .","As illustrated in , another processing device of the user, such as the user's terminal , may be used to monitor or to manage user content. User may interface using user interface  with the user terminal , which may be connected via modem  to web  for communicating with the synchronization server , to allow user to view or to change user content via a web interface. Terminal  may be connected as part of a local area network (LAN) or WAN (wide area network) or using near field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth. User terminal  may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a netbook, a television unit or other electrical appliance, a handheld device, tablet or other type of mobile terminal or device, or a mobile communication device such as another mobile telephone. According to an embodiment of the invention, the user's terminal  may also store off-line all or some of the user content for the mobile device  of the subscriber, and during each synchronization operation or following each synchronization operation between the mobile device  and the synchronization server , the user's desktop terminal  may also be updated and synchronized with the most recent version of the user content. Alternatively, the user's desktop terminal  may be synchronized each time the user's terminal  is turned on and connected to web  via modem .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["160","50","43","20","43","43","43","44","20","43","43","43","43","20","90"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 13","FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIGS. 11-14","FIG. 10"],"b":["45","45","44","45","44","47","47","47","47","20","47","90","91","90","90","40","20"]},"In addition, or in the alternative, the user terminal  may have a second synchronization module  that initiates independently of synchronization application  a synchronization operation for synchronizing content stored on terminal  with content stored at synchronization server . Components of synchronization module  are shown in . As discussed with reference to synchronization application , synchronization module , or portions thereof, may be provided as hardware, software, firmware or the like, or combinations of the foregoing. This independent synchronization operation may be commenced at regular intervals, or at previously designated times as discussed above.","According to an aspect of the invention the desktop terminal  may be used by a parent to monitor user content of the mobile device  of a minor and may allow the parent to change the user content stored on the mobile device  via the automatic synchronization operation described above or may change user settings for permissible user content, such as porn filters or other filters for user content. Thus, if the mobile device  is unavailable, the user may still change any fields of the user content for the mobile device by visiting the website managing the synchronization server .","A further operation that may be initiated by the user is a \u201cdata wipe\u201d operation. The user may visit the synchronization server  via the web interface, for example, in case the mobile device  is lost or damaged, and initiate a request from the synchronization server  to the mobile device  to delete all user content stored by the mobile device . In this way, if the mobile device  is found by an unscrupulous party all data stored on the mobile device  would have been deleted. However, if the user obtains a replacement mobile device , the data stored at the central node can be updated to the replacement mobile device without burdening the user with having to replace the data manually.","According to another aspect of Applicant's invention, the user may track a location of the mobile device  via the user's terminal  because at every synchronization operation, or other predetermined times, the location of the mobile device  would be communicated to the synchronization server, and the central node would maintain a record of the location of mobile device  as of the last synchronization operation, or as of the last location registration time, or would maintain it as of some period of time, for example, for the past week, past month or the like.","The location of the mobile device , as would be known by person of ordinary skill, could be obtained using a GPS device contained in a mobile device , or carried by a user device in communication with the mobile device .","In addition or in the alternative, the location information may be obtained with reference to the most recent base station , used by the mobile device  or the most recent Wi-Fi connection or used by the mobile device , or may be obtained using a triangulation procedure of more than one such base station, or more than one such Wi-Fi connection for finding the best signal with the mobile device , or some other such mobile device tracking operation.","The central node may store a record of such mobile device locations in a location archive so that a series of locations of the mobile device  may be retrieved and monitored. Accordingly, the user's desktop  could be used by a user, such as a parent or guardian, to track the location of a minor, or in case of emergency, could be used to locate a missing person or a person in jeopardy or the like. Also, a lost or stolen mobile device  could thus be found.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["20","20","20","20","30","20","20","20","20"]},"Also shown in  are cameras A and B which may also communicate via Wi-Fi connection  or via connection with a cellular network through cellular link . Also, cameras A and B may be connected through a wired connection through a desktop or a laptop terminal or other device that has connection to web  using a wired connection or via Wi-Fi connection  or via a wireless link  of a wireless cellular system. Thus, for example if the user has pictures on camera A that the user wishes to use as a screen saver on a mobile communication device, the photos or other types of pictures or graphical data stored on the camera A can be automatically synchronized with the mobile device A via the central node. Thus, cameras A and B may include a synchronization application that initiate synchronization via the central node or may respond to a synchronization initiated at the central node. Cameras A and B may initiate synchronization each time a synchronization is carried out between the mobile device  and the central node or may initiate synchronization at a time or following a period of time, or upon occurrence of an event that is programmed at the synchronization application residing in the camera. Also, devices A and B may be camcorders or digital video recorders or other types of equipment that captures photographic or video data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["220","220","220","220","71","71","50","51","20","20","50","99","20","20","220","220"]},"Also shown in  is an auxiliary device  connected to television B. Auxiliary device  may be a keyboard, computer, or a gaming device connected to television B using a wired or a wireless connection. Auxiliary device  may have its own display and controls, and thus content viewed or stored at the auxiliary device  may also be synchronized with the central node content in addition to or instead of the content viewed or stored at television B.","Also contemplated is a system in which many such devices are all synchronized at the central node such that upon selection by the user of the device, or of types of content of a device, all such designated user content may be synchronized at the central node to all other selected devices or to any device designated by the user. Thus, the user may wish to view pictures or video data or recordings captured by camera A, B on the mobile device A, B, and in addition or instead, on the television A, B.","Also, synchronization may be performed automatically each time user content for any designated synchronized device is changed, updated, added or deleted. Such event-driven synchronization may be performed in addition to or instead of synchronization at set time intervals or at pre-specified times. Thus, the user may wish to perform synchronization with a device such as a camera A, B, which is less frequently used or for which data stored is less frequently changed, added or deleted, or for which content files include larger amounts of data and thus require more bandwidth and storage space, only upon the occurrence of a content changing event, such as the addition, deletion or the editing of user content. Also, the user may wish to port user data or other content immediately only in one direction between designated devices. For example, the user may wish to view television content received by the television A on the mobile terminal , but not to view content of the mobile device on the television A and thus, the user may set for only one way synchronization.","Also, while shown as mobile communication devices A and B, cameras A, B, televisions A, B and television auxiliary device , other types of devices may also be used to view synchronized content or to supply synchronized content. For example, such platforms may include printer devices, medical surgical equipment, electronic pens, radio devices, electronic shavers\/electronic personal care device, lighting systems\/fixtures, refrigerators microwave ovens, security systems (home or business), air conditioning systems, heating systems, electronic book readers, home or business entertainment systems, headphones, gaming devices, electronic billboards\/signs, cook top stoves, electronic picture frames, elevators, electronic tables, dishwashers, washer\/dryer laundry units, small to mid size kitchen appliances, electronic planners, electronic calendars, car computer systems and dashboard displays, wall mounted electric systems, aviation systems, boating computer systems, electronic toothbrushes, digital recorders, DVD player, blue ray players, cable-satellite set-top box, device remote control units, handheld \u201csky caddie\u201d (golf device), GPS golf cart with or without \u201csky caddie\u201d built in home\/auto alarm systems, car rear camera\/obstacle detector, portable automobile TV, on-board bicycle racer computer, landline phones, electronic doors, paper shredder, electric reclining chair, treadmills and workout bikes, vending machines, ticketing machines, toll\/commuter fair machines or turnpikes pedometer built into shoe, cash register, coin counting machines, DVD renting units, self checkout machines","Thus, less memory may be needed for mobile communication device  because the two-way synchronization affords the user the ability to delete larger chunks of data, for example photos or videos captured by the mobile communication device . Thus, a more streamlined telephone or telephone memory may be obtainable.","Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art.
