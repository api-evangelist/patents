No. 12\/122,305 entitled \u201cSystem and Apparatus for a Multi-Point Touch-Sensitive Sensor User Interface Using Distinct Digit Identification\u201d and filed on May 16, 2008 for Lisa A. Seacat, which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field","The invention relates to multi-point touch-sensitive sensors. Particularly, the invention relates to a multi-point touch-sensitive sensor user interface using distinct digit identification.","2.Description of the Related Art","As electronic devices have proliferated, the number of ways to interact with those devices has also proliferated. One such user interaction tool, or user interface, is a touch sensitive sensor which can detect touches on its surface. Many such sensors are used in connection with a display or screen allowing a user to interact with onscreen menus or data. These touchscreens are often standard features on such devices as cellphones, Personal Digital Assistants (\u201cPDA\u201ds), and tablet computers.","While many touch sensitive devices are able to sense only one point of contact, multi-point touch-sensitive sensors can detect multiple, simultaneous touches. By allowing more than one contact with the sensor, the user is able to exert greater control and better accuracy over the interface of the device","An apparatus for digit identification on a multi-point touch sensitive sensor is presented. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a computer readable storage medium storing computer readable program code executable by a processor, an assignment module, a receiving module, and a determination module. In one embodiment, the assignment module assigns a digit identity to each digit of at least two digits in contact with a multi-point touch sensitive sensor during a learning phase. In a further embodiment, the digit identity includes a distinct representation of each digit. In one embodiment, the receiving module detects a digit interaction of one or more particular digits of the at least two digits with the multi-point touch-sensitive sensor. In one embodiment, the determination module recognizes the assigned digit identity for each particular digit involved in the digit interaction. A method and a computer program product also perform the functions of the apparatus.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment,\u201d \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment, but mean \u201cone or more but not all embodiments\u201d unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d also refer to \u201cone or more\u201d unless expressly specified otherwise.","Furthermore, the described features, advantages, and characteristics of the embodiments may be combined in any suitable manner. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the embodiments may be practiced without one or more of the specific features or advantages of a particular embodiment. In other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain embodiments that may not be present in all embodiments.","These features and advantages of the embodiments will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of embodiments as set forth hereinafter. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method, and\/or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of computer readable program code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","Indeed, a module of computer readable program code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network. Where a module or portions of a module are implemented in software, the computer readable program code may be stored and\/or propagated on in one or more computer readable medium(s).","The computer readable medium may be a tangible computer readable storage medium storing the computer readable program code. The computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, holographic, micromechanical, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","More specific examples of the computer readable storage medium may include but are not limited to a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disc (DVD), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, a holographic storage medium, a micromechanical storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, and\/or store computer readable program code for use by and\/or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","The computer readable medium may also be a computer readable signal medium. A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electrical, electro-magnetic, magnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport computer readable program code for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. Computer readable program code embodied on a computer readable signal medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireline, optical fiber, Radio Frequency (RF), or the like, or any suitable combination of the foregoing","In one embodiment, the computer readable medium may comprise a combination of one or more computer readable storage mediums and one or more computer readable signal mediums. For example, computer readable program code may be both propagated as an electro-magnetic signal through a fiber optic cable for execution by a processor and stored on RAM storage device for execution by the processor.","Computer readable program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++, PHP or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The computer readable program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","The computer program product may be shared, simultaneously serving multiple customers in a flexible, automated fashion. The computer program product may be standardized, requiring little customization and scalable, providing capacity on demand in a pay-as-you-go model.","The computer program product may be stored on a shared file system accessible from one or more servers. The computer program product may be executed via transactions that contain data and server processing requests that use Central Processor Unit (CPU) units on the accessed server. CPU units may be units of time such as minutes, seconds, hours on the central processor of the server. Additionally the accessed server may make requests of other servers that require CPU units. CPU units are an example that represents but one measurement of use. Other measurements of use include but are not limited to network bandwidth, memory usage, storage usage, packet transfers, complete transactions etc.","When multiple customers use the same computer program product via shared execution, transactions are differentiated by the parameters included in the transactions that identify the unique customer and the type of service for that customer. All of the CPU units and other measurements of use that are used for the services for each customer are recorded. When the number of transactions to any one server reaches a number that begins to affect the performance of that server, other servers are accessed to increase the capacity and to share the workload Likewise when other measurements of use such as network bandwidth, memory usage, storage usage, etc. approach a capacity so as to affect performance, additional network bandwidth, memory usage, storage etc. are added to share the workload.","The measurements of use used for each service and customer are sent to a collecting server that sums the measurements of use for each customer for each service that was processed anywhere in the network of servers that provide the shared execution of the computer program product. The summed measurements of use units are periodically multiplied by unit costs and the resulting total computer program product service costs are alternatively sent to the customer and or indicated on a web site accessed by the customer which then remits payment to the service provider.","In one embodiment, the service provider requests payment directly from a customer account at a banking or financial institution. In another embodiment, if the service provider is also a customer of the customer that uses the computer program product, the payment owed to the service provider is reconciled to the payment owed by the service provider to minimize the transfer of payments.","The computer program product may be integrated into a client, server and network environment by providing for the computer program product to coexist with applications, operating systems and network operating systems software and then installing the computer program product on the clients and servers in the environment where the computer program product will function.","In one embodiment software is identified on the clients and servers including the network operating system where the computer program product will be deployed that are required by the computer program product or that work in conjunction with the computer program product. This includes the network operating system that is software that enhances a basic operating system by adding networking features.","In one embodiment, software applications and version numbers are identified and compared to the list of software applications and version numbers that have been tested to work with the computer program product. Those software applications that are missing or that do not match the correct version will be upgraded with the correct version numbers. Program instructions that pass parameters from the computer program product to the software applications will be checked to ensure the parameter lists match the parameter lists required by the computer program product. Conversely parameters passed by the software applications to the computer program product will be checked to ensure the parameters match the parameters required by the computer program product. The client and server operating systems including the network operating systems will be identified and compared to the list of operating systems, version numbers and network software that have been tested to work with the computer program product. Those operating systems, version numbers and network software that do not match the list of tested operating systems and version numbers will be upgraded on the clients and servers to the required level.","In response to determining that the software where the computer program product is to be deployed, is at the correct version level that has been tested to work with the computer program product, the integration is completed by installing the computer program product on the clients and servers.","Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics of the embodiments may be combined in any suitable manner. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of programming, software modules, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, hardware modules, hardware circuits, hardware chips, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that embodiments may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, and so forth. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of an embodiment.","Aspects of the embodiments are described below with reference to schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams of methods, apparatuses, systems, and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams, can be implemented by computer readable program code. The computer readable program code may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, sequencer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams block or blocks.","The computer readable program code may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function\/act specified in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams block or blocks.","The computer readable program code may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the program code which executed on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of apparatuses, systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions of the program code for implementing the specified logical function(s).","It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the Figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function, logic, or effect to one or more blocks, or portions thereof, of the illustrated Figures.","Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flowchart and\/or block diagrams, they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding embodiments. Indeed, some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the depicted embodiment. For instance, an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted embodiment. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart diagrams, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer readable program code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","108","110","101","101","110","101","110","101","101","101","101","101","101","101"]},"The sensor  may be flat such as that used in computer displays, or form fitted as needed. Furthermore, the embedded sensor  may be similar to the multi-point touch-sensitive sensors available from Perceptive Pixel, Inc, of New York, N.Y. Referring also to , in one embodiment, the display  and the sensor  are embodied in a tablet, slate, or pad computer , a personal desktop assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), an e-Book reader, a mobile phone, a Smartphone, and the like. Although in the embodiment depicted in , the sensor  is embedded in the display , in other embodiments, the sensor  may be integrated with any suitable device including but not limited to a steering wheel , a keyboard , a computer mouse , a video game control, a portable device display, an automobile, and an electric appliance interface.","The display  may be embodied as a Liquid Crystal Display (\u201cLCD\u201d) screen, a plasma screen, a projector projecting an image, and the like. In one embodiment, the display  is a touchscreen display receiving touch input from a user on a display surface. The display , in one embodiment, communicates with and\/or is controlled by a computing device.","Referring back to , the digit identity apparatus  may provide and\/or be integrated with a user interface that assigns digit identities to digits in contact with the sensor , detects a digit interaction involving those digits, and recognizes the assigned digit identities for the digits involved in the digit interaction. In certain embodiments, the digit identity apparatus  initiates one or more functions in response to recognizing the assigned digit identities.","In the depicted embodiment, the digit identity apparatus  assigns a user's fingers  distinct digit identities \u201c-\u201d. Fingers with the digit identity \u201c\u201d  and \u201c\u201d  have made contact with the sensor . Furthermore, in addition to fingers, the digits  used for the sensor  may include but not be limited to knuckles, toes, a nose, an ear, a tongue, arms, legs, elbows, knees and a head. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the digit may also be any object capable of being uniquely identified such as a pen, pencil, presentation pointer, and so forth.","In one embodiment, the digit identity apparatus  assigns a digit identity to two or more digits based on characteristics of the digits and\/or by the relationship between the digits . This relationship may be determined by the association between the digits  as registered by the multi-point touch-sensitive sensor  during an initialization or a learning phase. The association may be based on the spatial position of one digit  in relation to another  on the sensor  surface, as digit \u201c\u201d  is positioned in relation to digit \u201c\u201d . Therefore, when digit \u201c\u201d  and digit \u201c\u201d  are in contact with the sensor  simultaneously, based on their position, the digit identity apparatus  determines that one finger  corresponds with digit identity \u201c\u201d and the other finger  corresponds to digit identity \u201c.\u201d The digit identity apparatus  may then use these digit identities to determine functions to initiate. For example, digit \u201c\u201d  may be preassigned to carry out a certain function such as launch an email application whenever digit \u201c\u201d  makes contact with the sensor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","204","206","208","210","212","200","108"]},"The assignment module , in one embodiment, assigns digit identities to digits in contact with the sensor . In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns a digit identity to each digit of at least two digits in contact with the sensor . In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns the digit identities during a learning phase or user interface initialization. This initialization or learning phase may include configuring the sensor  by assigning initial digit identities. A digit identity may include a distinct representation of a digit. The assignment module  may assign a distinct digit identity to each digit . For example, a user who has placed his\/her hands on the sensor  may have each of his\/her fingers  assigned a distinct digit identity. This digit identity may be represented as a number, an alpha-numeric character, a combination of numbers and characters, a variable, or any other distinct representation. Specifically, in one embodiment, each digit is assigned an alphanumeric value. The digit identity may uniquely identify the digit  whenever the digit  makes contact with the sensor  as described below.","In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns a digit identity based on unique characteristics of the digit . The assignment module  may assign a digit identity based on an amount of pressure applied by the digit , as different digits  may apply varying amounts of pressure. For example, a thumb  would apply a different amount of pressure than an index finger . Consequently, the assignment module  may assign a distinct digit identity to the thumb  corresponding to the particular amount of pressure the thumb  applies with similar terms of assignment for the index finger . As a result, whenever the digit  makes contact with the sensor  applying the amount of pressure corresponding to a thumb , the apparatus  may recognize the distinct digit identity of the thumb . In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns a digit identity based on a contact area of the digit such as a portion, position, and\/or location of the contact point of the digit on the sensor .","In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns a digit identity for a particular digit based on a number of digit contact points on one or more sides of the particular digit. Specifically, the number of contact points to the right and left of a given contact point can be used to determine which digit made contact. If there is a single contact point to the left of a digit contact point and three contact points to the right then the apparatus  may determine that the digit being pressed is the second digit from the left. Furthermore, the size and\/or shape of a digit contact point may also be used. A thumb  has a different contact size and shape than an index finger . Furthermore, a nose has a different contact size and shape than an elbow. If fingers are used as the digits and if the sensor  is configured to scan a fingerprint, the fingerprint of the fingers may be used to uniquely identify the digit. In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns a digit identity for each digit by an interaction between two or more digits. The interaction may include comparative movement between the two or more digits (e.g. a movement pattern of a thumb in comparison with a forefinger), comparative pressure between two or more digits (e.g. a relative pressure of one digit compared to another), spacing between the two or more digits, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns a digit identity based on a plurality of digit characteristics such as two or more of the characteristics described above (e.g. pressure of a digit, size of a digit, and the like).","In one embodiment, the assignment module  works with and\/or coordinates with a relationship module  to assign digit identities. Specifically, in one embodiment, the relationship module  determines a relationship between at least two digits  based on an association between the digits  as registered by and signaled from the sensor . As mentioned above, the association may be based on distance between digits and\/or the spatial position of one digit  in relation to another digit  on the sensor . In addition, the association may be based on the area of the sensor  in which the digit  has made contact. For example, a user may initialize the user interface by placing a thumb  and index finger  on the sensor  surface. The relationship module  determines that two distinct digits have been registered by the sensor  by associating the two digits with their approximate location on the sensor  and to each other. In one embodiment, the assignment module  assigns the digit identities based on the relationship determined by the relationship module . In certain embodiments, the assignment module  assigns a distinct digit identity to each digit  recognized by the relationship module .","In one embodiment, the assignment module  stores each digit identity along with characteristics associated with each digit identity such that the determination module , as described below, may recognize the assigned digit identities. The assignment module  may store the assigned digit identities in a database, a flat file, and\/or the like on volatile or non-volatile storage of a computing system in communication with the apparatus  and\/or sensor .","The receiving module , in one embodiment, detects digit interactions with the sensor . In one embodiment, the receiving module  detects a digit interaction of one or more digits that have been assigned digit identities. A digit interaction may be an interaction of one or more digits with the sensor . This interaction may include contact and\/or movement of one or more digits on the sensor  surface and may be in the form of one or more movements by the digit  or one or more contacts from the digit . For example, a digit interaction may be a simple press of two fingers  on the sensor . Conversely, the digit interaction may be a finger  swiping across the sensor  surface. Any other combination of contact or movements from one or more digits  may be used as digit interactions. In one embodiment, the receiving module  detects a predetermined pattern of a plurality of digit interactions, each with one or more particular digits. For example, the receiving module  may detect digit  making contact with the sensor , then digit  making contact with the sensor , then digit  making contact with the sensor .","One or more digit interactions may comprise a digit event that is received and\/or accessed by the receiving module  from the sensor . For example, in one embodiment, the receiving module  interfaces with an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) provided by driver software for a sensor  to obtain location coordinates (x and y axis coordinates) and other characteristics for digit events. In one embodiment, the receiving module  includes a driver that receives low level signals from the sensor  that the receiving module  translates into characteristics of digit events and digit interactions. For example, the receiving module  may generate an interrupt when the sensor  is touched and determine characteristics of the touch in response to the interrupt.","In one embodiment, the receiving module , detects digit interactions with the sensor  in a period of time subsequent to the learning phase. For example, the assignment module  may assign digit identities during the learning phase and the receiving module  may detect digit interactions after the learning phase is complete and after digits have been assigned digit identities.","The determination module , in one embodiment, recognizes digit identities for digits involved in the digit interaction. After the receiving module  receives and\/or accesses the digit interaction and\/or the digit event, the determination module  may recognize a digit identity for each digit  involved in the digit event\/digit interaction. For example, if a user drags an index finger , which has previously been assigned a digit identity of \u201c\u201d, and a thumb , which has previously been assigned a digit identity of \u201c\u201d, across a sensor , the determination module  may determine that digits \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d have been dragged across the sensor .","In one embodiment, the determination module  recognizes the assigned digit identities based on similar characteristics of the digits as those used above by the assignment module  to assign the digit identities. In certain embodiments, the determination module  recognizes a digit identity based on at least one of an amount of pressure applied by the digit, the number of digit contact points on one or more sides of a digit (e.g. to the right and left of a given contact point for a digit), the size and shape of a contact point for a digit, a contact area of the digit, a fingerprint of a digit, and\/or the like.","For example, the assignment module  may have assigned a particular digit associated with a particular pressure reading with a digit identity of \u201c.\u201d The determination module  may recognize a digit with the particular pressure reading as having a digit identity of . In one embodiment, the determination module  recognizes the assigned digit identity for a digit by a relative position of a digit contact point in relation to other digit contact points, a spatial relationship between digits, and\/or a distance between digits. As described above, if there is a single contact point to the left of a digit contact point and three contact points to the right then the determination module  may recognize that the digit being pressed is the second digit from the left. In one embodiment, the determination module  recognizes a digit identity based on plurality of digit characteristics such as two or more of the characteristics described above (e.g. pressure of a digit, size of a digit, and the like).","In one embodiment, the determination module  recognizes the assigned digit identity for each digit by an interaction between two or more digits. In a further embodiment, this interaction corresponds to an interaction used by the assignment module  to initially assign the digit identities of the two or more digits. In one embodiment, the determination module  recognizes a predetermined pattern of a plurality of digit interactions, each with one or more particular digits. For example, a predetermined pattern may include digit  making contact with the sensor , then digit , then digit  and the determination module  may recognize this predetermined pattern in response to digit  making contact with the sensor , then digit  making contact with the sensor , then digit  making contact with the sensor .","In one embodiment, the determination module  references characteristics for particular assigned digit identities stored by the assignment module  and compares characteristics for digits involved in the digit interaction with these stored characteristics. For example, in one embodiment, the determination module  compares an amount of pressure applied by a particular digit with amounts of pressure for various assigned digit identities stored by the assignment module  and recognizes the digit identity for the particular digit in response to determining that the amount of pressure associated with the digit identity corresponds to the amount of pressure for the particular digit.","The initiation module , in one embodiment, initiates a function (a digit event function) in response to the determination module  recognizing the assigned digit identity. In one embodiment, the initiation module  may initiate the digit event function associated with the determined digit identity and the digit interaction. The digit event function may be assigned to a specific digit identity regardless of the form of the digit interaction. For instance, the digit  with the identity of \u201c\u201d may be assigned the digit event to open an internet browser window on a tablet computer display regardless of whether digit \u201c\u201d makes brief contact with the sensor , drags across the sensor , or presses and remains on the sensor  surface. In one embodiment, the initiation module  initiates a function in response to a combination of an assigned digit identity and a characteristic of the digit interaction. A characteristic of the digit interaction may include a movement of the digit across the sensor , a length of time the digit made contact with the sensor , and\/or the like. For example, digit \u201c\u201d may be assigned to open an internet browser window if digit \u201c\u201d makes a brief contact with the sensor , while a sweep across the sensor  surface with digit \u201c\u201d may cause the browser window to scroll. The user may predefine what digit event functions are implemented with certain digit identities and digit interactions. In one embodiment, the initiation module  initiates a function in response to a combination of each recognized assigned digit identity. For example, the initiation module  may initiate a first function in response to a digit interaction with digit , but initiate a second distinct function in response to a digit interaction with digits  and .","In one embodiment, the initiation module  initiates a function in response to a combination of each recognized assigned digit identity and a characteristic of the digit interaction. For example, the initiation module  may initiate a first function in response to digits  and  sweeping across the sensor , but initiate a second distinct function in response to digits  and  resting on the sensor .","In one embodiment, the initiation module  initiates a function in response to a pattern of digit identities in one or more digit interactions. Specifically, in one embodiment, the initiation module  initiates a function in response to the determination module  recognizing a predetermined pattern of a plurality of digit interactions, each with one or more particular digits. For example, the initiation module  may initiate a function in response to digit  making contact with the sensor , then digit , then digit .","Digit event functions may vary depending on the implementation of the sensor . For example, possible digit event functions for an automobile steering wheel with an integrated multi-point touch-sensitive sensor  may include changing a radio station, changing the compact disc (\u201cCD\u201d) playing in the multi-disk player, changing the track on the CD, dialing a phone number with an attached Bluetooth phone, doing math on a calculator, changing the volume, changing the temperature, or picking pre-set information such as radio stations. If each of a user's fingers  has been assigned the digit identity \u201c-\u201d, a user could easily perform math functions having every number combination possible from his fingers . For example a user might press digit \u201c3\u201d which is assigned number  and then digit \u201c4\u201d which is assigned number . Both 3 and 4 are added together and a result of 7 is displayed on the multi-touch device. In this example the function being performed is the addition function. However this can be generalized to take in the input from one or more digits to perform a defined function.","A volume control of a radio with \u201c-\u201d representing volume levels could be changed by a user's fingers . In addition, a keyboard with this user interface  may be implemented with each letter assigned to a different digit identity and digit implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1-2"],"b":["300","101","300","200","300"]},"The method  starts and the assignment module  assigns  a digit identity to each digit of at least two digits in contact with a multi-point touch sensitive sensor  during a learning phase.
