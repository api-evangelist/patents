Field","The present disclosure relates generally to high-speed data communications interfaces, and more particularly, multi-wire, multi-phase data communication links.","2. Background","In the field of high-speed serial communication, demand for ever-increasing data rates continues to grow. Many conventional high-speed serial interface systems use non-return to zero (NRZ) data encoding with separate data and clock signals. This separation of the data and clock signals, however, typically results in skew between the two signals, limiting the maximum possible link data rate of the interface.","Typically, de-skewing circuitry is used at the receiving end of the serial interface to eliminate skew between the data and the clock signals. Consequently, both the real estate requirements and the link start-up time of the serial interface are increased, with the latter becoming disadvantageous when the interface is being used intermittently at a low duty cycle to minimize system power consumption.","Other conventional serial interface systems are more immune to skew by using data and strobe signals, but still suffer from skew problems when operating at high speeds.","Additionally, certain integrated receiver devices are typically built with slower logic because they have larger feature sizes in order to drive high voltages. This is the case, for example, for integrated LCD Controller-Driver circuits that are used to drive LCD panels. As such, it would be difficult to implement a high-speed serial interface for such devices using conventional systems.","What is needed therefore is a high-speed serial interface that resolves the above-described problems of conventional serial interface systems. Further, a high-speed serial interface with increased capacity and reduced power consumption relative to conventional systems is needed.","Embodiments disclosed herein provide systems, methods and apparatus that enable improved transmission rates on physical interfaces between devices within an apparatus. The apparatus may comprise a mobile terminal having multiple Integrated Circuit (IC) devices, which may be collocated in an electronic apparatus and communicatively coupled through one or more data links.","In an aspect of the disclosure, a method for data communications, includes steps of encoding data in multi-bit symbols, and transmitting the multi-bit symbols on a plurality of connectors. Transmitting the multi-bit symbols may include mapping the multi-bit symbols to a sequence of states of the plurality of connectors, and driving the connectors in accordance with the sequence of states. The timing of the sequence of states may be determinable at a receiver at each transition between sequential states. The state of each connector may be defined by polarity and direction of rotation of a multi-phase signal transmitted on the each connector.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the multi-phase signal carried on each connector is phase-shifted with respect to the multi-phase signal carried on the other connectors. for each state in the sequence of states.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the state of at least one of the plurality of connectors changes at each transition between the sequence of states.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the plurality of connectors include a plurality of wires. The multi-bit symbols may be transmitted on the plurality of connectors by leaving a first wire undriven providing a voltage differential between a second wire and a third wire during a first of two sequential time intervals, and leaving the second wire undriven and providing the voltage differential between the first wire and the third wire during a second of the two sequential time intervals. During the second of the two sequential time intervals, the polarity of the voltage differential may be reversed. At least one of the plurality of wires is undriven during each of the sequential time intervals.

A wire may be left undriven by causing the wire to transition toward a voltage level that lies substantially halfway between voltage levels of a pair of driven wires.","In an aspect of the disclosure, there is no significant current flow through an undriven wire.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the multi-phase signal transmitted on each connector includes one of two three-phase signals that have different phase rotation directions.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the multi-phase signal transmitted on each connector is a three-phase signal. The plurality of connectors may include three or more connectors.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the plurality of connectors may include two groups of three connectors. Different symbols may be encoded on each group of three connectors.","In an aspect of the disclosure, the plurality of connectors may include four or more connectors. Each symbol may be encoded for transmission using the four or more connectors.","In an aspect of the disclosure, an apparatus for data communications includes means for encoding data in multi-bit symbols, and means for transmitting the multi-bit symbols on a plurality of connectors. The means for transmitting may be configured to map the multi-bit symbols to a sequence of states of the plurality of connectors, and drive the connectors in accordance with the sequence of states. The timing of the sequence of states may be determinable at a receiver at each transition between sequential states. The state of each connector may be defined by polarity and direction of rotation of a multi-phase signal transmitted on the each connector.","In an aspect of the disclosure, an apparatus that encodes data includes an encoder configured to encode data in multi-bit symbols, a mapper configured to map the multi-bit symbols to a sequence of states for transmitting on a plurality of connectors, and one or more drivers configured to transmit the multi-bit symbols on the plurality of connectors, by driving the connectors in accordance with the sequence of states. The timing of the sequence of states is determinable at a receiver at each transition between sequential states. The state of each connector may be defined by polarity and direction of rotation of a multi-phase signal transmitted on the each connector.","In an aspect of the disclosure, a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium has instructions stored thereon for encoding data. The instructions, when executed by at least one processor may cause the at least one processor to encode data in multi-bit symbols, and transmit the multi-bit symbols on a plurality of connectors. The multi-bit symbols may be transmitted by mapping the multi-bit symbols to a sequence of states of the plurality of connectors, and driving the connectors in accordance with the sequence of states. The timing of the sequence of states is determinable at a receiver at each transition between sequential states. The state of each connector may be defined by polarity and direction of rotation of a multi-phase signal transmitted on the each connector.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspects may be practiced without these specific details.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem\u201d and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as, but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.

In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations.

One or more communications channel  may be bidirectional, and may operate in half-duplex and\/or full-duplex modes. One or more communications channel  and  may be unidirectional. The communication link  may be asymmetrical, providing higher bandwidth in one direction. In one example described herein, a first communications channel  may be referred to as a forward link  while a second communications channel  may be referred to as a reverse link . The first IC device  may be designated as a host system or transmitter, while the second IC device  may be designated as a client system or receiver, even if both IC devices  and  are configured to transmit and receive on the communications link . In one example, the forward link  may operate at a higher data rate when communicating data from a first IC device  to a second IC device , while the reverse link  may operate at a lower data rate when communicating data from the second IC device  to the first IC device .","The IC devices  and  may each comprise a processor or other processing and\/or computing circuit or device , .

The forward link  and\/or reverse link  may be configurable to operate in a bidirectional mode when, for example, the forward and reverse links  and  share the same physical connections and operate in a half-duplex manner. In one example, the communication link  may be operated to communicate control, command and other information between the first IC device  and the second IC device  in accordance with an industry or other standard.","Industry standards may be application specific. In one example, the MIPI standard defines physical layer interfaces including a synchronous interface specification (D-PHY) between an application processor IC device  and an IC device  that supports the camera or display in a mobile device. The D-PHY specification governs the operational characteristics of products that comply with MIPI specifications for mobile devices. A D-PHY interface may support data transfers using a flexible, low-cost, high-speed serial interface that interconnects between components  and  within a mobile device. These interfaces may comprise complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) parallel busses providing relatively low bit rates with slow edges to avoid electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues.","The communication link  of  may be implemented as a wired bus that includes a plurality of signal wires (denoted as M wires). The M wires may be configured to carry N-phase encoded data in a high-speed digital interface, such as a mobile display digital interface (MDDI). The M wires may facilitate N-phase polarity encoding on one or more of the channels ,  and . The physical layer drivers  and  may be configured or adapted to generate N-phase polarity encoded data for transmission on the communication link . The use of N-phase polarity encoding provides high speed data transfer and may consume half or less of the power of other interfaces because fewer drivers are active in N-phase polarity encoded data links .","N-phase polarity encoding devices  and\/or  can typically encode multiple bits per transition on the communication link . In one example, a combination of 3-phase encoding and polarity encoding may be used to support a wide video graphics array (WVGA) 80 frames per second LCD driver IC without a frame buffer, delivering pixel data at 810 Mbps for display refresh.","According to certain aspects disclosed herein, data and clock information may be jointly encoded and\/or timing information may be embedded in the data signal in order to eliminate skew between data and clock signals and thereby render de-skewing circuitry unnecessary in a serial interface. For example, a differential data encoding scheme may be used, whereby data and clock information are jointly encoded in state transitions of a single signal. The majority of differential data encoding schemes employ level differential schemes, whereby state transitions are defined in terms of changes in the level or magnitude of the data and clock signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","320","300","320"]},"In the first diagram , the signal level transitions from \u2212V to +V, including a first transition from \u2212V to 0 followed by a second transition from 0 to +V, such that a \u201c01\u201d data sequence is transmitted.

Similar transition decoding problems occur on +V to \u2212V transitions, or when the slew rate is faster than the response time of the data recovery circuit.

Signaling states defined for a 3-wire, 3-phase polarity encoding scheme may be denoted using the three voltage or current states (+1, \u22121, and 0). In the 3-wire, 3-phase polarity encoding scheme, the positively driven state and the negatively driven state may be obtained by providing a voltage differential between two of the signal wires , and\/or , and\/or by driving a current through two of the signal wires , and\/or connected in series such that the current flows in different directions in the two signal wires , and\/or ","The undriven state may be realized by placing an output of a driver  of a signal wire , or in a high-impedance mode. Alternatively, or additionally, an undriven state may be obtained on a signal wire , or by passively or actively causing an \u201cundriven\u201d signal wire , or to transition toward a voltage level that lies substantially halfway between positive and negative voltage levels provided on driven signal wires , and\/or .

Terminating impedances can be provided at one or both ends of the transmission line.","In one example , a terminating resistor  at the transmitting end of a transmission line  may pull an undriven signal wire , or towards a first voltage, while a terminating resistor  at the receiving end of the transmission line  may pull an undriven signal wire , or towards a second voltage, where the first and second voltages are different. The first and second voltages may include a ground (zero voltage) and a non-zero voltage, voltages that have different polarities and\/or voltages that have the same polarity but different magnitudes.","In another example  shown in , pairs of terminating resistors ,  and ,  may be provided at one or both ends of a transmission line .

In implementation, overlaps or gaps between the signals may occur. The inputs signals , , , , , and  are respectively coupled to the clock inputs of the D flip flops -. Each of the D flip flops - has its D data input coupled to a logic one, which causes its Q output to have a value of one whenever its respective clock input experiences a rising edge transition.

Since only one of the Q_bar outputs of the D flip-flops - toggles at any one time while the others will maintain the same value, the output of the XOR gate  toggles for each change in the inputs , , , , , and . This generates the double data rate clock signal Rx_Clk . In an embodiment, a delay element  is used to ensure that the Rx_Clk signal is in synchronism with the other signals that are output by the CDR circuit .","The OR gate  generates the Rx_Data_Polarity signal , which indicates whether the state that just occurred is of positive or negative polarity.

Similarly, D flip-flop  will have a Q output of value one whenever the previous state is C-to-A (regardless of polarity) and the current state is A-to-B negative. This corresponds to the clockwise transitions into the state A-to-B negative from either of states C-to-A positive or C-to-A negative.

Note that the Rx_Data_Phase  can have a value of zero if either a counter-clockwise transition or a polarity-only (same phase transition; e.g., A-to-B positive to A-to-B negative) transition occurs. For example, if the current state is A-to-B positive, the CDR circuit  outputs the same values for the Rx_Data_polarity  and the Rx_Data_phase  if the next state is C-to-A negative or A-to-B negative.
