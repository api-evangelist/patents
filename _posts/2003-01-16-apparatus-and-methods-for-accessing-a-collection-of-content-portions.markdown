title: Apparatus and methods for accessing a collection of content portions
abstract: Techniques for browsing through a large collection of content portions uses a scatter and gather approach where a collection of content portions is clustered into one or more clusters using multi-modal data modeling. Additionally, as part of the multi-modal data modeling, “proximal cues” surrounding links or connections or surrounding “image links” in a content portion are used to quickly identify the user's information needs. Thus, taking into account proximal cues during multi-modal data modeling improves the scattering and the gathering process, as well as personalizes the scattering and the gathering process to most effectively cluster content portions of interest to the user.

Field of Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods for accessing a collection of content portions.","2. Description of Related Art","Increasingly, the World Wide Web has become the information delivery mechanism of choice for both corporations and individual users. The ubiquity of World Wide Web browsers and the push by many corporations to adopt commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology have all helped the World Wide Web become the delivery option for most information systems.","Although information sources are now more likely to be available to their intended audience through the World Wide Web, access to relevant information is still limited by the user's ability to navigate both the World Wide Web and the destination websites themselves to actively retrieve the required information.","Many website designers design a website which is suited for the information to be conveyed by the website. For example, a website designer of a county government tax assessors office site may assume that any query would be related to county tax assessment. In contrast, the website designer for an online department store would design a website that would provide a user with access to product information of products that are available at the store. Likewise, the website designer of an internal corporate information site would provide information such as corporate tax information, real estate holdings, business permits and\/or health and safety records. Accordingly, certain tasks would be better addressed by one website when compared with another website and certain information needs would be satisfied by one website rather than another website.","Usually, it is not easy for a user to initially formulate a query so precise that the user is immediately able to accurately find the required information contained in the websites. For example, the user may not be familiar with the terms used in describing the information. In many instances, the user has only a general understanding of the information. Therefore, in a typical search, the user may initially perform a browsing session that broadly uncovers information in a general manner. As the user becomes familiar with the range of topics available and the terms related to the information, the user refines the browsing session to obtain topics which are more closely related to the user's needs. Once the user is satisfied, the user may then perform specific searches on the results of such a refocused search that would lead to the required information.","This invention provides systems and methods for browsing a collection of content portions using proximal cue information.","This invention provides systems and methods for browsing a collection of content portions using user behavior.","This invention provides systems and methods for browsing a collection of content portions that is adaptively tailored to user information needs and\/or tasks.","This invention provides systems and methods for browsing a collection of documents that is dynamically re-tailored to user information needs and\/or tasks.","This invention provides systems and methods that provides an interface to a collection of content portions.","In various exemplary embodiments, multi-modal information and proximal information are determined for at least one content portion in a collection of content portions. In various exemplary embodiments, the proximal information includes information based on one or more images in a content portion. In various exemplary embodiments, at least one cluster center is generated for clustering content portions. In various exemplary embodiments, a content portion is clustered to a cluster center having similar multi-modal information and proximal information.","In various exemplary embodiments, content portions of at least one selected cluster are retained and content portions of a non-selected cluster are purged. In various exemplary embodiments, when content portions of at least two clusters are selected, the selected clusters are merged.","In various exemplary embodiments, at least one user access path through the collection of content portions is determined. An access path is a path that a user looks along in accessing linked content portions by judging from one content portion forward or backward to another linked content portion. At least one content portion associated with the user access path is determined. In various exemplary embodiments, the content portion associated with the user access path is used as a basis for clustering.","In various exemplary embodiments, a vector based on the multi-modal information and the proximal information of the content portion is generated. The generated vector is used as basis for determining similarity between content portions.","In various exemplary embodiments, a vector based on the multi-modal information and the proximal information of content portions of the accessed content portions lying along the user access path is generated. The vector is used as basis for determining similarity between user paths.","In various exemplary embodiments, a summary is generated for at least one generated cluster.","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in, or are apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.","A known technique for browsing through a large collection of content portions uses a scatter and gather approach, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,442,778 to Peterson et al. In the scatter and gather approach described in the 778 patent, a collection of content portions is clustered into one or more clusters based on similarity of words between content portions. In various exemplary embodiments, each content portion is represented by words contained in the content portion. The clustering is based on an assumption that mutually similar content portions will tend to be relevant to the same queries. A summary is generated for each cluster. The user is then presented with the clusters for selection. Once one or more clusters have been selected, the selected clusters are gathered to form a subcollection. The scatter and gather approach then reclusters or scatters the subcollection into one or more new clusters based on similarity of words. The set of clusters is again presented to the user for selection. With each successive iteration, the number of content portions decreases and the user is presented with a more detailed group of clusters of content portions that are relevant to the user's information needs. Further, when scattering the content portions into clusters, the known technique may also cluster the content portions based on the frequencies of words that occur in a content portion. However, the known technique does not take into account browsing a collection of content portions based on user modeling or user profiles. Further, the known technique does not take into account multi-modal data modeling.","User modeling or user profiles contextualize and personalize a collection of content portions based on user information goals. The user information goals can be obtained, for example, from user traces or access paths in a network. Further, a more effective browsing technique is achieved by using multi-modal data modeling. Additionally, as part of the multi-modal data modeling, \u201cproximal cues\u201d, i.e., surrounding links or connections, including surrounding \u201cimage links\u201d in a content portion, are used to quickly identify the user's information needs. Proximal cues can be words or text that surround a link, a connection or an image link in a content portion and that convey information to a user when deciding which access path in the network to take. Thus, taking into account proximal cues during multi-modal data modeling in the user modeling or in the user profiles improves the scattering and gathering process, as well as personalizes the scattering and gathering process to most effectively cluster content portions of interest to the user. Details for determining proximal cues associated with links, including image links, that can be used for multi-modal data modeling are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","130","150","160","110","120","130","100"]},"In the exemplary embodiment of , the content portions ,  and  may be web pages or documents accessible through the Internet. Each content portion ,  and  may contain one or more content elements that may be of interest to a user. For example, as shown in , the content portion  contains a text  and a link . The link , when selected, connects the user to another content portion, for example, to the content portion  over the connection . The content portion  contains a text element  and an image element . The image  is an \u201cimage link\u201d having a pictorial representation of one or more content elements in another content portion, for example, the content portion . The image element , when selected, connects the user to the content portion  over the connection . The content portion  contains an image element , a text element  and a link . Relative to a given content portion, a link that connects the user to another content portion is defined as an \u201coutlink\u201d. On the other hand, relative to that given content portion, a link in another content portion that connects the user to this given content portion is defined as an \u201cinlink\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","204","208","202","206","200","202","204","202","204","204","206","206","204","204","204"]},"Unlike the link , the proximal cues of the image link  may be the pictorial representation of the image link  itself. The use of image links will increase as web site developers attempt to improve the navigability of their web sites. Accordingly, it is desirable to determine proximal cues associated with image links. Various strategies may be used to determine the proximal cues that describe an image link. In one strategy, the image may be analyzed using known image recognition techniques. However, presently, a large increase in processing time and required resources will result. In another strategy, the proximal cues may be derived from information surrounding the image link . For example, referring back to , if the image element  is an image link, then any text strings or words surrounding the image element  may be analyzed. Further, the distal content portion  that is linked to the image element  can be retrieved and analyzed for proximal cues. Consequently, the content portion  serves as a proxy to supplement or replace any proximal cue information in the content portion  containing the image  that is insufficient or unavailable. In various exemplary embodiments, the text strings, words or title in the distal content portion may serve as proximal cues to link the image elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","110","120","130","140","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["110","200","205","210"]},"In step S, associations between an initial reference content portion and any content portions immediately reachable from the initial reference content portion are determined and stored in a topology data structure. It should be appreciated that a topology data structure may include a topology matrix, a topology adjacency list or any other known or later-developed technique of storing topology information about the content portions. Then, in step S, each reachable content portion is selected individually as a next reference content portion. Next, in step S, for each reference content portion, associations between that reference content portion and any immediately reachable content portions are determined. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, the associations are stored in the topology data structure. In various exemplary embodiments, continual looping may be avoided by maintaining a list of reference content portions already visited. Then in step S, a determination is made whether all reachable content portions reachable from the initial reference content portion via a determined number of link\/connection traversals have been identified. If not, the operation returns to step S. Otherwise, operation continues to step S.","In step S, the contents of initial and each of the reachable content portions are determined. Next, in step S, the words within each content portion are added to a word\/content portion frequency matrix. In various exemplary embodiments, in step S, weights for each of the words are determined and a weighted word content portion frequency matrix is created. Then, in step S, connections or links, including any image links, identified in steps S to S and the content portions are analyzed for proximal cues. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, the proximal cues are added as proximal cue feature vectors to a proximal cue feature vector matrix. The proximal cue feature vector matrix stores information about which proximal cue feature vectors are associated with which links and\/or content portions. In various exemplary embodiments, the vectors in the proximal cue feature vector matrix may be weighted. Operation then continues to step S, where the process terminates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["130","300","305","310","315","320"]},"In step S, the number of content portions Q for the selected user path is determined. Next, in step S, a second counter R is set to one. Then, in step S, a first content portion is selected as a current content portion. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, one or more feature vectors for the selected content portion are determined. In various exemplary embodiments, the one or more feature vectors include one or more of a content feature vector, a uniform resource locator feature vector, an inlink feature vector and an outlink feature vector, among others. Next, in step S, the proximal cue vector associated with the current content portion is determined. Then, in step S, a content portion path position weighting for the current content portion is determined. The path position weighting may, for example, adjust the weighting to provide a greater weighting for content portion information that appears later in the path under the assumption that information accessed farther along a path more closely reflects the user's information needs. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, a content portion access weighting for the current content portion is determined. In various exemplary embodiments, the content portion access weighting may be determined by analyzing usage information, such as a document server, electronic library log file or web server access information, to determine how many times each content portion has been accessed. In various exemplary embodiments, weighting function is developed based on this information. Then, in step S, one or more of the proximal cue feature vector, the content feature vector, the uniform resource locator feature vector, the inlink feature vector and\/or the outlink feature vector for the current content portion are concatenated to form a single multi-modal vector that represents the current content portion. Next, in step S, the multi-modal vector is weighted using the content portion path position and\/or the content portion access weighting. Operation then continues to step S.","In step , a determination is made whether the counter R has reached the maximum number of content portions Q in the user path. If the counter R has not reached the maximum number, then operation continues to step S. Otherwise, operation jumps to step S.","In step S, the counter R is incremented. Operation then returns to step S. In contrast, in step S, a determination is made whether the counter N has reached the maximum number of user paths M. If the counter N has not reached the maximum number M, then operation continues to step S. Otherwise, operation continues to step S. In step S, the counter N is incremented. Operation then returns to step S. In step S, a collection of relevant user paths (that is, user profiles) is selected that is similar to a user profile of a user. Then, in step S, a collection of content portions from the collection of user profiles are gathered for the scattering and gathering process. The operation of the method continues to step S, where the operation terminates.","It should be appreciated that after step S, user profiles for each relevant user path has been constructed. Thus, these user profiles are used to select content portions for the scattering and gathering process. A user using the scattering and gathering process would have their own user profile. This user profile may be generated on-the-fly based on the user's surfing history, past interaction history or specified explicitly, for example. The user's user profile is compared with other user profiles. A collection of user profiles that are similar to the user user's profile is gathered. The collection of content portions used to perform the scattering and the gathering is selected from the collection of user profiles. Thus, a similarity comparison of the user profiles with each of the content portions is performed. If the similarity of a content portion is within some threshold, the content portion is selected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["140","400","410","420","430","440"]},"In step S, for each cluster, a summary is generated that is representative of that cluster. Next, in step S, the summary of each cluster is presented to the user so that one or more clusters can be selected based on the summary of the cluster. Then, in step S, a determination is made whether one or more clusters have been selected by the user. If one or more clusters have been selected by the user, operation continues to step S. Otherwise, operation jumps to step S.","In step S, the one or more non-selected clusters are discarded. Then, in step S, the selected one or more clusters are gathered, that is, combined, into one collection. Operation then returns to step S. In contrast, in step S, operation of the method terminates. It should be further appreciated that the scatter-gather method for browsing a collection of content portions is described in greater detail in the incorporated 778 patent.","In various exemplary embodiments, summaries may be determined for each cluster using a commercially available summarization engine. Selected images from a cluster may be also pieced together to form a collage. These features are further described in Helfman, J. I., \u201cImage Representations for Access and Similarity-Based Organization of Web Information\u201d, PhD Dissertation, University of New Mexico, Computer Science Department, July 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In various exemplary embodiments, the weighting performed in, for example, in steps S and\/or S can be accomplished according to any known or later-developed weighting technique. For example, Term Frequency by Inverse Document Frequency (TF.IDF) weighting may be used. Term Frequency by Inverse Document Frequency is an information retrieval technique that calculates term importance of a word by weighting the word based on how frequently it occurs in the document collection or web site. Further information on Term Frequency by Inverse Document Frequency is found in H. Schuetz, et al., \u201cFoundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing,\u201d, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1999.","In various exemplary embodiments, the topology matrix data structure may be developed automatically. In various exemplary embodiments, the information for the topology matrix data structure may be supplied by any other tool or utility, such a web crawler. Alternatively, the information may be provided by the web site designer. The topology matrix represents the content portions that can be reached, for example, from an initial starting content portion.","In various exemplary embodiments, proximal cue words include, for example, the text of the link structure. For links including characters such as \u201c\/\u201d and \u201c.\u201d, these characters may be used as word boundary markers. The text is added to the list of proximal cue words. Text surrounding the link structure, the title of the proximal page and\/or features, such as where the link is found within the document, may also be analyzed for proximal cue words. It will be apparent that any feature of the proximal content portion may be used to provide or define proximal cue words. If the link structure is an image, proximal cue words surrounding a link frequently provide some cue words. In various exemplary embodiments, proximal cue words for the image are determined from text surrounding the link, the title of the content portion containing the image, image filename and\/or the like.","In various exemplary embodiments, the user paths may be determined, for example, by analyzing the document server or web server access information. The document server or web server access information indicates the connected to, or linked to, content portion which a user has used to traverse into the collection, the connected to, or linked to, content portion, the date and the time as well as machine address information. Information about the type and\/or version of the user's browser may also be recorded.","In various exemplary embodiments, when a user views a content portion, such as a document or a web page, of the content portion collection, such as a document collection or a web site, through a document or web server, the user's machine identification information, \u201creferred by document\u201d, \u201creferred to document\u201d, browser type and date and time are saved in the document server or web server access information. As the user traverses the site from an initial entry page, a user path is generated in the access information. The path is identified by the machine identification information and indicates the previous document or web page and current document or web page in the \u201creferred by document field\u201d and the \u201creferred to document field\u201d of the document server or web server access information.","In various exemplary embodiments, the value of a given position in the information need keyword vector indicates how relevant the associated keyword is to the user path. For an exemplary vector B having the following six dimensions, [1 2 5 99 1 50], the vector positions  and  represent the two most relevant keywords. These vector positions might represent, for example, \u201cchocolate\u201d and \u201csouflee\u201d.","In various exemplary embodiments, the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are broken into constituent words and the words are weighted according to frequency. For example, a Uniform Resource Locator such as \u201cwww.xerox.com\/index.html\u201d is broken up into the words \u201cwww\u201d, \u201cxerox\u201d, \u201ccom\u201d, \u201cindex\u201d and \u201chtml\u201d. A vector describing the weighted presence of the words appearing in the Uniform Resource Locators is determined.","In various exemplary embodiments, the machine address information can be used to provide an indication of the path of users between the content portions identified in the document server, or in the web server access information. The user path information may be further analyzed using the techniques described in Pitkow et al., \u201cMining Longest Repeating Sub-sequences To Predict World Wide Web Surfing\u201d, in Proceedings of USITS\u2032 99; The 2USENIX Symposium on Internet Technologies and Systems, USENIX Association, 1999; and Pirolli et al. \u201cDistributions of Surfers' Paths Through the World Wide Web: Empirical Characterization\u201d, World Wide Web 2(1\u20132):29\u201345, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In various exemplary embodiments, a content feature vector reflects the content of the words contained by each content portion in the path. In various exemplary embodiments, a Uniform Resource Locator feature vector reflects words within the Uniform Resource Locators contained by each content portion. The \u201c\/\u201dand \u201c.\u201d contained within Uniform Resource Locators are used to define word boundaries. In this way, the word content of the Uniform Resource Locators may be determined.","In various exemplary embodiments, an inlinks multi-modal feature vector indicates the inward connections or inlinks into each of the content portions along the selected user path. The inward connections or inlinks are determined for example, by examining the topology data structure of the collection of content portions and by identifying which content portions have entries indicating a link into the selected content portions along the selected user path. Similarly, an outlinks feature vector indicates outward connections or outlinks for each content portion along the selected user path. It will be apparent that any other set of known or later-developed features of a content portion may be used to determine feature vectors.","In various exemplary embodiments, a mathematical function assigning asymptotically greater weight to information appearing later along the path or any other known or later-developed technique may be used to provide path position weighting according to this invention.","In various exemplary embodiments, a content portion weighting function might lower the weighting associated with a content portion that is accessed by every user path, under the assumption that the content portion is a splash screen or entry content portion, or the like, that every user of the site must visit to start the user path traversal.","In various exemplary embodiments, the proximal cue feature vector, the content feature vector, the Uniform Resource Locators feature vector, the inlink feature vector, the outlink feature vector and the information need feature vector for each content portion on the user path are combined using the content portion position and content portion access weighting.
