The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Anthracyclines are one of the most effective classes of drugs currently available for cancer diagnosed across the entire age spectrum. However, the therapeutic potential of anthracyclines is limited because of their strong dose-dependent relation with progressive and irreversible cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure (Blanco et al., 2012; Grenier et al., 1998; Barry et al., 2008). This dose-dependent risk is modified by younger age at anthracycline exposure, chest radiation and co-existence of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes (Puma et al., 2008; Armenian et al., 2011). However, a significant inter-individual variability exists; cumulative anthracycline exposure as low as 150 mg\/mresults in cardiomyopathy in some patients, while exposure as high as 1000 mg\/mis tolerated without cardiomyopathy by others (Bryant et al., 2007).","Thus, it would be beneficial to determine the reasons for the observed inter-individual variability and develop an optimal anthracycline dosage regimen for cancer patients based on the risk of developing cardiotoxicity from the effects of these drugs.","In one embodiment, methods of identifying a subject, for example, a cancer patient, having an increased risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity are provided. Such methods may include isolating a DNA sample from a biological specimen from the subject; genotyping the DNA sample to determine a copy number of a variant allele that increases the risk of developing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity; and identifying the subject as having an increased risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity when the copy number is at least one.","In some embodiments, the methods may include optimally administering a therapeutically effective dose of a chemotherapy agent or an alternative non-cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agent to the subject. The optimal administration of the chemotherapy agent prevents or minimizes the agent's toxic effects, yet does not compromise its ability to effectively treat primary cancer. In some aspects, the variant allele comprises a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The SNP may be part of an HAS3 or a CBR gene, for example, rs2232228(G>A), or CBR3V244M. In some aspects, the chemotherapy agent is an anthracycline. In other aspects, the chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity prevented is cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure (CHF).","Methods of identifying a subject (e.g., cancer patients) having an increased risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity and methods for preventing or reducing said risk as a result of treating a cancer patient with a chemotherapeutic agent are provided herein. Such methods are based on identifying the subject's genotype or the number of copies of a variant allele carried by the subject.","According to certain embodiments described herein, a method of identifying a subject having an increased risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity may include isolating a DNA sample from a biological specimen from the subject using a suitable method known in the art and genotyping the DNA sample.","The genotype may be determined based on the number of copies of a variant allele carried by a cancer patient. A subject is determined to have an increased risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity when the copy number is at least one. The method may optionally include administering a chemotherapeutic agent based on the patient's genotype.","The methods described herein may also be used to prevent or reduce the risk of any type of acute or delayed cardiotoxic events that are common to patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents including, but not limited to, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy, which is indicated by a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (e.g., tachycardia, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, dependent edema, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, oliguria, ascites, pleural effusion, and arrhythmias).","Chemotherapeutic agents that may cause cardiotoxic events may include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anti-tumor antibiotics (e.g., Anthracyclines), topoisomerase inhibitors, mitotic inhibitors hormone therapy, targeted therapeutics and immunotherapeutics. In certain embodiments, anthracyclines may be responsible for causing cardiomyopathy and other cardiotoxic events when administered as a cancer therapy, and may be optimally administered alone or in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agents according to the embodiments described herein. Examples of anthracyclines that may be administered according to the embodiments described herein include, but are not limited to, doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone, valrubicin, and idarubicin. A strong dose-dependent association between anthracyclines and cardiomyopathy limits the therapeutic potential of this effective class of therapeutic agents, suggesting that identification of those at highest risk is important so that anthracycline exposure may be tailored to maximize the efficacy of these drugs.","The methods described herein may be used to prevent cardiotoxicity during the treatment of any type of cancer including, but not limited to, bone cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, breast cancer, cancer of the urinary tract, carcinoma, cervical cancer, childhood cancers (e.g., astrocytoma, brain stem glioma, NCS atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor, CNS embryonal tumor, CNS Germ Cell tumors, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, kidney tumors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and other types of leukemia; Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the bone, rhabdomyosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and Wilms' tumor,), colon cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma and leukemia, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pituitary cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, renal cancer, sarcoma, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, uterine cancer.","In some embodiments, the methods described herein may include a step of determining the genotype (\u201cgenotyping\u201d) (e.g., heterozygous for an allele (XA or XG), or homozygous for an allele (AA or GG)) of an isolated DNA sample to determine the number of copies (or \u201ca copy number\u201d) of a variant allele that increases a cancer patient's risk of developing chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity. The copy number may be determined by any suitable whole genome or locus-specific method known in the art including, but not limited to microarray methods, SNP-array methods, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) followed by Southern blot, quantitative real-time PCR, locus specific PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), competitive fluorescent multiplex STRP assay (CFMSA), pyrosequencing, ligation detection reaction, and the invader assay. Such methods may also be used to screen for any variant alleles that are associated with chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.","The copy number may be determined using a DNA sample obtained from a cancer patient. The DNA sample may be derived from any biological specimen containing DNA including, but not limited to, any material, biological fluid, tissue, or cell obtained or otherwise derived from the cancer patient including, but not limited to, blood (including whole blood, leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, buffy coat), and saliva. This also includes experimentally separated fractions of all of the preceding. For example, a blood sample can be fractionated into fractions containing particular types of blood cells, such as red blood cells or white blood cells (leukocytes). If desired, a sample may be a combination of samples from an individual, such as a combination of a tissue and fluid sample. A biological specimen may also include materials containing homogenized solid material, such as from a stool sample, a tissue sample, or a tissue biopsy; or materials derived from a tissue culture or a cell culture.","As discussed above, there is significant inter-individual variability related to the development of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The Examples described below investigate the reason(s) for this observed inter-individual variability by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might modify the association between anthracycline exposure and risk of cardiotoxicity. The ITMAT\/Broad CARe (IBC) cardiovascular SNP-array was used that profiles SNPs in 2100 genes considered relevant for cardiovascular disease in the general population (Keating et al., 2008). A 2-stage design was used that included a discovery and a replication stage. In the discovery stage, both the main effects of SNPs as well as gene-environment (anthracycline) interactions were examined. SNPs surpassing a pre-specified threshold for statistical significance were validated in the replication stage using an independent set of cases with anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy.","Thus, in some embodiments, the allele may include a mutation, deletion or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In some embodiments, the SNP is part of a gene associated with cardiotherapeutic agent metabolism, or cardiovascular conditions or diseases, including, but not limited to, genes in the HAS or CBR families. For example, the SNP may be an A allele on SNP rs2232228 (rs2232228(G>A)), or CBR3 V244M, which are described further below.","In some embodiments, the variant allele that increases the risk of developing cardiotoxic effects is part of a gene associated with cardiovascular condition or disease. In one embodiment, the variant allele is part of the family of hyaluronan synthase genes (e.g., HAS3), including, but not limited to, a variant allele that includes an SNP, such as rs2232228. The HAS3 gene, located on chromosome 16, encodes for an enzyme that produces hyaluronan (HA). HA is a ubiquitous component of extracellular matrix (ECM) (Spicer et al., 2004), and plays a dynamic role in organization of ECM following injury or inflammation by providing a matrix to support cellular migration and adhesion (Spicer et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005; Laurent et al., 1992; Knudson et al., 1993; Toole et al., 1990; West et al., 1985; Zhang et al., 2000). HA is especially enriched in matrices undergoing remodeling. HAS3 has been implicated in organ dysfunction, such as ventilator-related lung injury (Jacobson et al., 2000; McKee et al., 1996; Noble et al., 1996; Bourguignon et al., 2011; Bai et al., 2005) and phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor reduces inflammatory effects by directly inhibiting HAS3 expression (Mrabat et al., 2009).","In the myocardium, ECM provides a scaffold for alignment of myocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and vasculature (Gorda et al., 2000). In myocardial infarction, with consequent apoptosis of myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts serve as a central mediator of cardiac remodeling, using the ECM as a scaffold (Burlew et al., 2000). HA accumulates after myocardial infarction in rats (Waldenstrom et al., 1991), and HA synthesis is part of the extensive remodeling seen in cardiac hypertrophy (Hellman et al., 2008). Anthracyclines injure heart muscle through induction of apoptosis in myocytes, which is then followed by replacement fibrosis (Perik et al., 2005). Anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity is directly linked to the amount of anthracyclines in the heart (Meissner et al., 2002; Begg et al., 1994). ECM is likely involved in cardiac remodeling (from inflammation to fibrosis) after anthracycline-related injury; the extent of remodeling and repair is possibly modulated by variability in HA production in the ECM, consistent with the genotype-dependent cardiomyopathy risk observed in the current study. Thus, high-dose anthracyclines likely trigger differential expression\/HA synthesis based on the genotype of rs2232228, influencing cardiac remodeling.","As described in the Examples below, a two-stage design was used to determine host susceptibility to anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. The ITMAT\/Broad CARe cardiovascular SNP-array was used to profile common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2100 genes considered most relevant to de novo cardiovascular disease. In this matched case-control design (93 cases, 194 controls), a common SNP rs2232228 was identified in the hyaluronan synthase (HAS3) gene that exerts a substantial modifying effect on anthracycline dose-dependent risk of cardiomyopathy. Among individuals with rs2232228 GG genotype, cumulative anthracycline exposure was not associated with cardiomypathy risk at any dose. On the other hand, in individuals with AA genotype, cardiomypathy risk increased substantially with increasing anthracycline exposure; individuals exposed to high-dose (>250 mg\/m) anthracyclines, the presence of rs2232228 AA genotypes were at 8.5-fold (95% Cl, 2.0-35.6, p=0.004) increased cardiomyopathy risk, compared with GG genotype. The gene-environment interaction between SNP rs2232228 and high-dose anthracycline exposure was replicated in an independent set of 76 patients with anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. The significant modifying effect of HAS3 genotype on the dose-dependent association between anthracycline and cardiomyopathy risk suggests that genotyping HAS3 may help to tailor anthracycline exposure to maximize benefit.","In other embodiments, the variant allele that increases the risk of developing cardiotoxic effects is part of a gene involved with anthracycline metabolism. The main route for anthracycline metabolism is a two-electron reduction of the C-13 carbonyl group in the anthracycline side chain, resulting in the formation of alcohol metabolites (erg, doxorubicinol, daunorubicinol) (Mordente et al., 2009; Minotti et al., 2004). Development of cardiomyopathy correlates with myocardial accumulation of anthracycline alcohol metabolites (Mushlin et al., 1993; Stewart et al., 1993). Variability in the formation of these metabolites could influence the risk of cardiomyopathy (Mordente et al., 2009). Synthesis of cardiotoxic alcohol metabolites is catalyzed by myocardial cytosolic carbonyl reductases (CBRs) (Mordente et al., 2009; Kalabus et al., 2010). In humans, two monomeric CBRs (CBR1 and CBR3) are encoded for by genes located on chromosome 21. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3\u2032-untranslated regions of CBR1 where nucleotide 1096, a guanine (G), is replaced by adenine (A) (CBR1 1096G>A); and in CBR3 where amino acid 244, a valine (V), is replaced by methionine (M) (CBR3V244M), impacts catalytic activity for anthracycline substrates (Bains et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Covarrubias et al., 2009; Lakhman et al., 2005). The goal of the current study was to understand the contribution of functional polymorphisms in CBR1 and CBR3 to the dose-dependent risk of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy in survivors of childhood cancer.","As described in detail in Example 1 below, one hundred seventy survivors with cardiomyopathy (patient cases) were compared with 317 survivors with no cardiomyopathy (controls; matched on cancer diagnosis, year of diagnosis, length of follow-up, and race\/ethnicity) using conditional logistic regression techniques. A dose-dependent association was observed between cumulative anthracycline exposure and cardiomyopathy risk (0 mg\/m: reference; 1 to 100 mg\/m: odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 101 to 150 mg\/m: OR, 3.85; 151 to 200 mg\/m: OR, 3.69; 201 to 250 mg\/m: OR, 7.23; 251 to 300 mg\/m: OR, 23.47; >300 mg\/m2: OR, 27.59; P<0.001). Among individuals carrying the variant A allele (CBR1:GA\/AA and\/or CBR3:GA\/AA), exposure to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines (1 to 250 mg\/m) did not increase the risk of cardiomyopathy. Among individuals with CBR3 V244M homozygous G genotypes (CBR3:GG), exposure to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines increased cardiomyopathy risk when compared with individuals with CBR3:GA\/AA genotypes unexposed to anthracyclines (OR, 5.48; P=0.003), as well as exposed to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines (OR, 3.30; P=0.006). High-dose anthracyclines (>250 mg\/m2) were associated with increased cardiomyopathy risk, irrespective of CBR genotype status.","This study demonstrated that an increased anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy risk exists at doses as low as 101 to 150 mg\/m. Homozygosis for G allele in CBR3 contributes to increased cardiomyopathy risk associated with low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines, such that there seems to be no safe dose for patients homozygous for the CBR3 V244M G allele. These results, along with those regarding the rs2232228(G>A) allele within HAS3, suggest a need for targeted intervention for those at increased risk of cardiomyopathy.","Thus, according to some embodiments, the methods described herein may include a step of optimally administering a therapeutically effective dose of a chemotherapeutic agent based on a cancer patient's genotype. The genotype may be measured as a copy number as determined above. The optimal administration addresses the need for targeted intervention for patients with an increased risk of cardiotoxicity who are also receiving a chemotherapeutic treatment. Alternatively, in some embodiments where a patient has been identified as having in increased risk of anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity, the methods may include a step of administering a non-cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic, cardioprotective agent or treatment, in lieu of an anthracycline or other chemotherapeutic agent that may cause cardiotoxic events. Non-cardiotoxic chemotherapeutics, cardioprotective agents or treatments that may be used in accordance with the methods described herein may include those described below.","Cancer patients are typically administered a maximum safe dosage of a particular cancer treatment or combination treatment, including chemotherapeutics and targeted cancer therapies. A \u201cmaximum safe dosage,\u201d \u201cmaximum tolerated dosage\u201d or \u201cmaximum recommended therapeutic dosage\u201d is the highest amount of a therapeutic agent that can be given that minimizes complications or side effects to a patient while maintaining its efficacy as a treatment. Such a dose can be adjusted to consider the patient's overall heath and any extenuating factors that could hamper the patient's recovery. Due to the severity and potential lethal outcome of the cancer being treated, a maximum safe dosage tolerated in cancer treatment may be an amount that causes considerable and severe side effects, including cardiotoxic effects. In some embodiments, the maximum safe dosage is represented by a cumulative dose of the therapeutic agent, which is the total amount of the therapeutic agent given to a patient over the course of treatment. For example, anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are typically administered at a dosage of 60-75 mg\/mevery three to four weeks when administered as a single agent and 25-60 mg\/mevery three to four weeks when administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic agents. However, according to the package insert for doxorubicin hydrochloride injection (Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc.), the risk of developing cardiotoxicity that manifests as potentially fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) increases rapidly with increasing total cumulative doses of doxorubicin in excess of 400 mg\/m. Thus, in some embodiments, the maximum safe dosage may be approximately 400-500 mg\/mor any suitable dosage greater than 400 mg\/m, based on factors related to each individual patient's disease state.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount,\u201d \u201coptimally effective amount\u201d \u201ceffective amount,\u201d \u201ceffective dose,\u201d or the like, is an amount of a therapeutic agent that produces a desired therapeutic effect in a subject, such as preventing or treating a target condition or alleviating symptoms associated with the condition. The precise therapeutically effective amount is an amount of the composition that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy of treatment in a given subject. This amount will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to the characteristics of the therapeutic compound (including activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bioavailability), the physiological condition of the subject (including age, sex, disease type and stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage, and type of medication), the nature of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or carriers in the formulation, and the route of administration. One skilled in the clinical and pharmacological arts will be able to determine a therapeutically effective amount through routine experimentation, namely by monitoring a subject's response to administration of a compound and adjusting the dosage accordingly. For additional guidance, see Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21Edition, Univ. of Sciences in Philadelphia (USIP), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa., 2005","In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective dose of a particular agent may be a cumulative dosage that is the same as or lower than a maximum effective dose. A therapeutically effective dose for a particular agent used in accordance with the embodiments described herein may be a low cumulative dose (or a \u201clow dose\u201d) ranging from about 1-150 mg\/m, a moderate cumulative dose (or a \u201cmoderate dose\u201d) ranging from about 151-250 mg\/m, a low-to-moderate cumulative dose (or a \u201clow-to-moderate dose\u201d) that is less than 250 mg\/mor ranging from about 1-250 mg\/m, or a high cumulative dose (or a \u201chigh dose\u201d), which includes doses greater than 250 mg\/m. In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective dose may be a cumulative dose that is approximately 1-100 mg\/m, approximately 101-150 mg\/m, approximately 151-200 mg\/m, approximately 201-250 mg\/m, approximately 251-300 mg\/m, approximately 301-350 mg\/m, approximately 351-400 mg\/m, approximately 401-500 mg\/m, less than approximately 250 mg\/m, over approximately 250 mg\/m, or any suitable dosage greater than 400 mg\/m, based on factors related to each individual patient's disease state.","Each individual patient's dosage may be tailored to the patient's needs based on their genotype or copy number. In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective dose that is administered to a cancer patient includes a low to moderate cumulative dose of a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., anthracycline) when the patient carries at least one copy of the variant allele that increases the risk of developing cardiotoxic effects (e.g., rs2232228(G>A) or CBR3 V244M). In some aspects, the low to moderate cumulative dose is less than 250 mg\/mor between approximately 1-250 mg\/mwhen the patient carries at least one copy of the variant allele. In such embodiments, the patient may be heterozygous (carries one copy of the variant allele) or homozygous (carries two copies of the variant allele) for the variant allele that increases the risk of developing cardiotoxic effects.","In other embodiments, the therapeutically effective dose that is administered to a cancer patient includes a low cumulative dose of a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., anthracycline) when the patient carries two copies of the variant allele that increases the risk of developing cardiotoxic effects (e.g., rs2232228(G>A) or CBR3 V244M). In some aspects, the low cumulative dose is less than 150 mg\/mor between approximately 1-100 mg\/m, between approximately 101-150 mg\/m, or between approximately 1-150 mg\/mwhen the patient carries two copies of the variant allele. In such embodiments, the patient is homozygous (carries two copies of the variant allele) for the variant allele that increases the risk of developing cardiotoxic effects.","The therapeutically effective dose may include one or more doses of the chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., anthracycline) administered at regular intervals. Standard chemotherapy is typically administered by an intravenous infusion once every three to four weeks (i.e., intervals of approximately 21-28 days), but may be administered at any suitable interval that results in effective treatment of a malignancy.","In some embodiments, the optimal therapeutically effective dose of the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered in combination with one or more additional chemotherapeutic or cardioprotective agents or treatments or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic regimens known in the field of oncology. \u201cIn combination\u201d or \u201cin combination with,\u201d as used herein, means in the course of treating the same disease in the same patient using two or more agents, drugs, treatment regimens, treatment modalities or a combination thereof, in any order. This includes simultaneous administration, as well as in a temporally spaced order of up to several days apart.

One hundred twenty-one COG member institutions contributed patients to the study after obtaining approval from local institutional review boards. Written informed consent\/assent was obtained from all patients and\/or their parents\/legal guardians.","Participants.","Prevalent cases and matched controls were identified from patients diagnosed with a primary cancer at age 21 years or younger and followed at a COG institution. Cases consisted of individuals who developed cardiomyopathy after completion of cancer therapy and were alive at study participation.

Clinical and echocardiographic documentation of cardiomyopathy was provided by participating sites. Cases were considered eligible if they fulfilled the American Heart Association (AHA) criteria for cardiac compromise by presenting with symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, etc.) and\/or signs (edema, hepatomegaly, rales, etc.) of cardiac decompensation or, in the absence of symptoms\/signs, had echocardiographic features of left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced by ejection fraction (EF)\u226640% and\/or fractional shortening (SF)\u226628%.","Controls had no symptoms or signs of cardiac compromise (all 317 controls) and had normal echocardiographic features (n=203; EF: median=65 [range, 53-84]; SF: median=36 [range, 29-61]) or no clinical indication for echocardiographic examination because of lack of exposure to anthracyclines or chest radiation (n=63). In addition, echocardiograms were unavailable for 51 anthracycline-exposed (n=41) or chest radiation-exposed (n=10) controls. Thus, echocardiograms were unavailable for 114 controls. Exclusion of these 114 controls did not materially alter the associations (); therefore, the 114 controls were included in the analysis.","DNA Isolation and Genotyping.","Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood or buccal cells\/saliva by using QIAamp or Qiagen kits (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and Puregene (Qiagen) or Oragene (DNA Genotek, Kanata, Ontario, Canada) kits, respectively. The CBR3 V244M and CBR1 1096G>A polymorphisms (rs1056892, rs9024) were analyzed using validated assays for allelic discrimination with specific fluorescent probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) (Gonzalez-Covarrubias et al., 2009; Lakhman et al., 2005). Laboratory personnel were blinded to case-control status. Nine samples had noninformative results.","Statistical Analysis.","Univariate conditional logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to compare cases and controls for categorical and continuous characteristics, respectively. Chi-square tests were used to test for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.","Anthracycline Exposure and Cardiomyopathy.","Association between anthracycline exposure and cardiomyopathy was measured by estimating the odds ratio (OR) while controlling for chest radiation (yes\/no), age at cancer diagnosis (continuous variable in years), and gender, using conditional logistic regression techniques.

For the combined analysis, patients homozygous for both the CBR1 and CBR3G allele (i.e., CBR1:GG and CBR3:GG [associated with increased CBR activity]) served as the group of interest, while patients carrying at least one copy of the variant A allele in either of the CBR genes (i.e., CBR1:GA\/AA and\/or CBR3:GA\/AA) served as the reference group. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for cumulative anthracycline exposure in addition to gender, age at cancer diagnosis, and chest radiation.","Modifying Effect of CBR Genes on Dose-Dependent Risk of Anthracycline Related Cardiomyopathy.","The interactive effect of genes and anthracycline exposure was examined by including genotypes (CBR1 and CBR3 individually as well as in combination), anthracycline exposure, and the product of CBR genotypes and anthracycline exposure in the model. The risk of cardiomyopathy was examined at varying levels of anthracycline exposure (no exposure: 0 mg\/m; low to moderate dose: 1-250 mg\/m; and high dose: >250 mg\/m) for the two risk categories of the CBR genotypes (homozygosis for GG v GA\/AA), using CBR GA\/AA genotype and no exposure to anthracyclines as the referent group. Next, the modifying effect of the CBR genotypes was examined by stratifying on the dose categories of anthracyclines.","Data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). All statistical tests were two-sided; p values<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

These results indicate that homozygosis for the G allele in CBR3 gene was primarily responsible for modifying the risk for cardiomyopathy. As shown in , among patients with at least one copy of the A allele in CBR3, low- to moderate-dose anthracycline exposure was not associated with cardiomyopathy when compared with patients not exposed to anthracyclines.

As described herein, genetic variants have been identified that simultaneously confer modest risk of disease and substantial risk of lethality, which could affect the results in case-control genetic association studies. Tools that allow calculation of effect size erosion caused by survival bias have been developed. Anderson et al. have developed a formula to allow estimation of effect size erosion given a variant's odds ratio of disease, odds ratio of lethality, and minor allele frequencies (MAF) (Anderson et al., 2011). Thus, using the variant's MAF, genotype relative-risk of disease (GRR-D), and genotype relative risk of lethality (GRR-L) in addition to disease annual incidence (\u03a6) and disease-related mortality (\u03c6) estimates for the age range of included subjects, the percent erosion of effect size is calculated as described below:\n\n% effect size erosion=exp(8.73(\u0398)\u00d71.4(\u03a6)+0.067(GRR-D)+1.02(MAF)+1.53(GRR-L)\u22127.25)\n","Using this formula, the degree of erosion of the true estimate due to survival bias in this case-control study was estimated. In order to do this, the MAF for CBR1 to be 0.2 and for CBR3 to be 0.4 was used; and an estimated incidence rate of cardiomyopathy of 0.003 per year from a cohort of children treated with anthracycline in the Netherlands was used (van Dalen et al., 2006). The following assumptions were then made: i) a fairly high mortality rate of 50%; ii) a (GRR-D) of 2 and (GRR-L) also of 2. Using these assumptions, the maximum possible effect size erosion was only about 2.7%. However, if the GRR-L was assumed to be 3 (i.e., the high-risk genotype is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of death), the maximum possible effect size erosion could be 12%.","Discussion","Anthracyclines play an undisputed role in the treatment of childhood cancer (Granowetter et al., 2009; Grier et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 1998); unfortunately, development of dose-dependent cardiomyopathy limits their therapeutic potential (Gianni et al., 2008). An elevated risk of clinical heart failure was reported by 5-F year survivors of childhood cancer exposed to anthracycline doses exceeding 250 mg\/m(Mulrooney et al., 2009). The current study demonstrates elevated risk of clinically validated cardiomyopathy at lower doses, such that patients exposed to a cumulative dose of 101-150 mg\/mare at increased risk compared to the unexposed (OR=3.9). The current study also demonstrates that at low to moderate doses of anthracycline exposure, individual differences in anthracycline pharmacodynamics modify the risk of cardiomyopathy.","Myocardial accumulation of anthracycline alcohol metabolites influences the course of cardiomyopathy (Mushlin et al., 1993; Stewart et al., 1993). These metabolites form a reservoir in the cardiomyocytes and impair contractility through inhibition of Ca2 and Na\/K pump activity (Mushlin et al., 1993; Boucek et al., 1987; Olson et al., 1998). In the human heart, CBRs are considered major anthracycline-metabolizing enzymes (Mordente et al., 2009; Mordente et al., 2003). Functional polymorphisms in CBR1 and CBR3 modulate the synthesis of anthracycline alcohol metabolites. The rate of doxorubicinol synthesis is 1.5-fold higher in liver samples with CBR1 1096G>A homozygous G genotype compared with samples with heterozygous G\/A genotype (Gonzalez-Covarrubias et al., 2009). CBR3 V244M polymorphism results in CBR3 protein isoforms (CBR3 V244, CBR3M244) with distinct catalytic properties (Bains et al., 2010; Lakhman et al., 2005); CBR3 V244 (G allele) catalyzes the synthesis of doxorubicinol 2.6 times faster than CBR3M244 (A allele) (Blanco et al., 2008).","The current study examined the modifying effect of CBR11066G>A and CBR3 V244M genotype status on the dose dependent risk of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. Among individuals carrying at least one copy of the variant A allele in CBR1 and\/or CBR3, low- to moderate-dose anthracycline exposure (1-250 mg\/m) was not associated with cardiomyopathy. The risk of cardiomyopathy, however, was significantly increased among individuals with CBR3:GG genotype exposed to low- to moderate-dose anthracycline exposure when compared to unexposed individuals carrying at least one copy of the A allele. On the other hand, the risk of cardiomyopathy was modest and statistically non significant for individuals with CBR1:GG genotype exposed to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines. CBR1 or CBR3 genotype status did not impact cardiomyopathy risk among those exposed to high-dose anthracyclines.","Homozygosis for the G allele in CBR3 gene appears to drive the increase in risk for cardiomyopathy associated with low- to moderate dose anthracyclines. The differential impact of CBR1 and CBR3 genotype status on cardiotoxicity may be explained, in part, by recent findings on the bases that control the transcription of both genes (Ebert et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2009; Lakhman et al., 2007). CBR3 expression is modulated by the master transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2, NFE2L2), whereas expression of CBR1 appears to be predominantly regulated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway (AHR) (Ebert et al., 2010; Lakhman et al., 2007). Nrf2 coordinates the induction of a battery of genes involved in protection against oxidative stress. Here, it is proposed that the Nrf2 pathway provides a link between the acute cardiotoxicity mediated mostly by reactive oxidative species (ROS) and chronic cardiotoxicity induced by anthracycline C-13 alcohol metabolites. Parent anthracyclines induce ROS production and Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus. In turn, nuclear Nrf2 upregulates CBR3 expression with consequent increase in synthesis of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites. This upregulation of CBR3 activity in a chronic setting may help explain why the association with cardiomyopathy appears to be stronger for polymorphic CBR3 than for polymorphic CBR1.","Restriction of the modifying effect of CBR genotype status only to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines is intriguing. In humans, approximately 50% of anthracyclines remain unmetabolized (Joerger et al., 2005) and induce cardiotoxicity through mechanisms that invoke ROS production (Minotti et al., 2004; Menna et al., 2008). CBR activity contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy by generation of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites, three possible scenarios could be envisaged, depending on the dose of anthracyclines. First, in the absence of anthracycline exposure, CBR activity does not play a role in the development of cardiomyopathy due to of lack of substrate. Second, exposure to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines provides the necessary substrate to synthesize cardiotoxic C-13 alcohol metabolites by the high-risk\/high-activity CBR variants, resulting in an increased risk of cardiomyopathy. Finally, in the presence of high-dose anthracyclines, cardiotoxicity is mostly mediated by the oxidative stress generated by the excess of unmetabolized anthracyclines, such that anthracycline alcohol metabolites play a relatively minor role. However, it is also possible that cardiomyopathy in individuals exposed to high-dose anthracyclines and carrying the high-risk variants (CBR1:GG-CBR3:GG) is associated with high lethality, thus removing these individuals from the pool of eligible cases and reducing the association in this group to null.","Prevalent case-control studies by the very nature of their design exclude fatal endpoints from the case set. Presence of survival bias risks under-ascertainment of genotypes associated with high lethality, with consequent underestimation of disease risk effect size for those genotypes associated with both increased disease risk and disease-associated lethality (Hernan et al., 2004). Using the methodology developed by Anderson et al (Anderson et al., 2011) to estimate effect size erosion, the maximum possible degree of erosion of the true estimate as a result of survival bias in this case-control study was calculated to be 12%, assuming that the high-risk genotype was associated with a three-fold increased risk of death (see Results section).","Furthermore, in order for early cardiac death to have eliminated the association from an anticipated genotype-outcome risk of 3.0 to 1.0 (i.e., associated with a 67% erosion) due to an overrepresentation of the GG genotype among those who had received high-dose anthracyclines and died prior to study participation, the high-risk genotype would need to be associated with a four-fold increased risk of death when compared with the low-risk genotype. There is no data to support such a high level of lethality. However, since it is logistically impossible to prove this within the context of a large multi-institutional study, it is acknowledged that the possibility among recipients of high-dose anthracyclines, patients with CBR1:GG-CBR3:GG genotype, could have been more likely to have developed cardiomyopathy and died, thus becoming lost from the sampling frame and eroding the true association between high-risk variants and cardiomyopathy.","Here, it is recognized that interindividual variability in alternate metabolic pathways, such as reduction to semiquinone radicals by a number of oxidoreductases or two-electron reduction by aldo keto reductases, and in pharmacodynamic targets (e.g., calsequestrin, iron regulatory proteins) could play a role in modulating cardiomyopathy risk (Joerger et al., 2005). However, functional, biochemical and genetic studies support CBR-mediated reduction of anthracyclines to cardiotoxic alcohol metabolites as a major metabolic route implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiotoxicity (Forrest et al., 2000; Olson et al., 2003). Furthermore, findings in this study confirmed the association between CBR3 V244M genotype and cardiomyopathy reported in a small previously published study (Blanco et al., 2008). The current study demonstrates that patients with CBR3 V244M homozygous G genotype exposed to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines are at an increased risk of cardiomyopathy, even at cumulative exposures between 101 and 150 mg\/m. These results could allow for enhanced surveillance and\/or prevention strategies among childhood cancer survivors at increased risk of cardiomyopathy.","Materials and Methods","Study Participants","Discovery Set:","The discovery set was drawn from a Children's Oncology Group study (COG-ALTE03N1, PI: Bhatia) that aimed to understand the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in childhood cancer survivors. COG member institutions contributed patients after obtaining approval from local institutional review boards. Written informed consent\/assent was obtained from patients\/parents\/legal guardians. Cases and controls were identified from individuals diagnosed with cancer at age \u226621 years. Cases consisted of individuals who developed cardiomyopathy after completion of cancer therapy, and were alive at study participation. For each case, 1 to 4 controls were randomly selected from the same COG childhood cancer survivor cohort, using the following matching criteria: 1) cancer diagnosis; 2) year of diagnosis (\u00b15 years); 3) race\/ethnicity; and 4) duration of cardiomyopathy-free follow-up for controls to exceed time from cancer diagnosis to cardiomyopathy for the corresponding case. Four hundred and one individuals (130 cases; 271 controls) participated in this study. All participants provided a biological specimen (blood [89%], buccal cells\/saliva [11%]) for DNA.","Anthracycline-exposed participants had normal cardiac function prior to initiation of anthracyclines. Cases fulfilled American Heart Association (AHA) criteria for cardiac compromise by presenting with symptoms (dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue) and\/or signs (edema, hepatomegaly, rales) of cardiac compromise, along with echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction; or, in the absence of symptoms\/signs, had echocardiographic features of left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF]\u226640\u2032)\/0 and\/or fractional shortening [SF]\u226628%). Controls had no symptoms\/signs of cardiac compromise coupled with normal echocardiographic features in the anthracycline-exposed individuals.","Replication Set:","An independent set of 76 patients diagnosed at City of Hope (COH) with cardiomyopathy following anthracycline exposure were drawn from the COH Long-term Follow-up study (IRB #00029), that follows patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for the development of cardiomyopathy (Armenian et al., 2011). The protocol was approved by the COH institutional review board, and written informed consent\/assent was obtained from patients\/parents\/legal guardians. Eligible cases fulfilled AHA criteria for cardiac compromise, along with echocardiographic confirmation of cardiac compromise.","Therapeutic Exposures","Total lifetime anthracycline exposure was calculated by multiplying the cumulative dose (mg\/m) of individual anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) by a factor that reflects the drug's cardiotoxic potential (Table S1, Shankar et al., 2008), and then summing the results. Radiation therapy with heart in the field was designated as \u201cchest radiation\u201d. Total body irradiation at \u226712 Gy was included as chest radiation.","Genotyping and Quality Control","Discovery Set:","Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood\/buccal cells\/saliva by using QIAamp\/Qiagen kits and Puregene\/Oragene kits, respectively. Genotyping was performed on the Illumina IBC cardiovascular SNP-array by the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. The IBC cardiovascular SNP-array includes a prioritized list of 2100 candidate genes potentially involved in cardiovascular diseases (Keating et al., 2008). This array uses a \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d approach to determine tagging SNPs for loci of interest to cover genetic diversity in populations of different ancestry (De Bakker et al., 2006).","Quality control (QC) for genotype data were performed with the PLINK toolset (Purcell et al., 2007). Of the 401 study participants, 399 (99.5%; 129 cases, 270 controls) met call rates >95%. No duplicated samples or sample contamination was identified. The Multidimensional Scaling method (Purcell et al., 2007) was used to cluster individuals into two sub-populations: non-Hispanic whites and \u201cothers\u201d. In order to control for potential population stratification, 112 individuals in the \u201cother\u201d category were filtered out, retaining 287 non-Hispanic whites (93 cases, 194 controls) in the discovery stage analysis. After adjusting for the overall genomic control inflation factor (\u03bb=1.27), the type I error appeared to be under control. For the 287 individuals, the total genotyping rate exceeded 98.9%. Of the 43,293 autosomal SNPs in the IBC SNP-array, 988 that failed a missingness threshold for missing fraction >0.05, and 7,267 that failed a frequency threshold for a minor allele frequency (MAF)<0.01 were removed. A check for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) resulted in exclusion of 108 SNPs with P value<0.000001. The final dataset included 34,912 autosomal SNPs.","Replication Set:","Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and buccal cells\/saliva, using Qiagen kits. Genomic DNA from formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies or from unstained slides of bone marrow smear was extracted using QuickExtract FFPE DNA Extraction Solution (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, Wis.). Significant SNP(s) identified in the discovery stage were genotyped using Sequenom iPLEX SNP chemistry on a MassArray system (call rate=93.4%).","Statistical Analysis","Discovery Stage:","Discovery stage was designed as a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to examine both the main effects of SNPs as well as gene-environment (anthracycline) interactions.

HA is especially enriched in matrices undergoing remodeling. HA plays a role in cell proliferation, cell migration, inflammation, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, embryonic development, and the organization of the extracellular matrix. The dynamic turnover of ECM results in net deposition of matrix in interstitium of affected tissue.","HAS genes (HAS1, HAS2, HAS3) are responsible for HA synthesis. HAS is located in the cell membrane and secreted into interstitial space. Expression of HAS appears to correlate directly to HA synthesis. Regulation of HAS occurs at the level of transcription. HAS1 and HAS2 produce high molecular weight HA. HAS3 gene expression plays an important role in regulation of LMW HA synthesis.","LMW HA accumulates at sites of inflammation and is implicated in multiple proinflammatory activities such as monocyte activation, leukocyte adhesion to endothelium, smooth muscle cell migration as part of wound healing, induction of chemokines, and activation of dendritic cells and macrophages through NF-\u03baB signaling. Additionally, reactive oxygen species have been shown to be potent inducers of HA depolymerization\u2014yielding smaller molecules. HAS3-induced over expression of HA often leads to organ dysfunction. For example, acute lung injury caused by large tidal volume mechanical ventilation is mediated by LMW HA produced by upregulation of HAS3. Thus, these genes may have a role in anthracycline-related myocardial injury through pro-inflammatory activities.","The high-density IBC cardiovascular SNP-array described above was used to study the association between anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy and 34,912 SNPs in 2,100 carefully curated genes known to be associated with de novo cardiovascular disease (Keating et al., 2008). There was a substantial modifying effect of the common SNP rs2232228 in HAS3 on the dose-dependent risk of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. Among individuals with a homozygous G genotype on SNP rs2232228, cardiomypathy risk did not demonstrate a dose-dependent increase. However, in individuals with AA genotype, cardiomypathy risk increased significantly as anthracycline exposure increased. Thus, among individuals exposed to high-dose anthracyclines, presence of AA genotype conferred an 8.5-fold increased cardiomyopathy risk, when compared with the GG genotype. This significant gene-environment interaction at SNP rs2232228 was replicated using an independent set of cases with anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy.","In this study, the identified significant SNP rs2232228 on exon2 of HAS3 (67701078 bp) resides on chromosome 16, and appears to be in a region of low LD. The data contain 7 SNPs in HAS3 but the LD between rs2232228 and the other 6 SNPs were not strong (the largest rwas 0.42\u2014between rs2232228 and rs8047014). The gene-environment interaction for rs8047014 was not significant. The entire chromosome 16 was also imputed using 1000 genome SNPs as reference SNPs. Analysis based on SNPs with imputed r>0.5 did not reveal any SNPs with strong gene-environment interactions. Finally, the HapMap CEU data was examined within 1 Mb of rs2232228 and only 2 SNPs were identified, both with weak LD (rs8082856 r=0.56; rs9332431 r=0.579).","The case-only design used to replicate significant findings is an efficient and valid method for evaluating gene-environment interactions (Begg et al., 1994). A positive association (>2-fold) implies a gene-environment interaction (Vanderweele et al., 2010). The current study demonstrated that, among cases, individuals with homozygosis for A allele of rs223228 in HAS3 had a 5-fold increased odds of being in the high-dose anthracycline group.","Prevalent case-control studies are at risk for underestimation of effect size for genotypes associated with both increased disease risk and disease-associated lethality (Hernan et al., 2004; Anderson et al., 2011). In the current study, a dose-dependent association was not observed between anthracyclines and cardiomypathy risk in individuals with a homozygous G genotype on SNP rs2232228. Although high lethality could erode a potential anthracycline-cardiomyopathy association, there is currently no data to support high lethality associated with the G allele of rs2232228. Furthermore, the replication set included all patients with cardiomyopathy (alive and deceased) in a cohort of HCT recipients. Successful replication of significant findings indicates that survival bias is likely not a significant issue with the prevalent cases and controls in the discovery set.","Of note, while the discovery set was limited to non-Hispanic white childhood cancer survivors, the replication set included cases drawn from survivors of childhood and adult-onset cancer from all racial\/ethnic backgrounds. The successful replication of the finding in a clinically and demographically diverse population speaks to the robustness of the association between the common variants in rs2232228 in HAS3 gene and anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy.","In this study, SNP rs2232228 in the HAS3 gene was shown to alter the risk of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy among patients exposed to high-dose anthracyclines. The IBC cardiovascular SNP-array was used with a carefully-curated yet comprehensive list of genes enriched for their association with de novo cardiovascular disorders, reducing the probability of false-positive associations and helping identify smaller specific pathogenetic regions associated with cardiomyopathy. However, the IBC cardiovascular SNP-array does not include genes that could potentially regulate anthracycline metabolism or disposition (CBR, MRP, MDR1, SLC28A3, ABCB1, ABCB4, ABCC1) (Blanco et al., 2012; Visscher et al., 2012; Wojnowski et al., 2005) or are implicated in the pathogenesis (HFE) (Miranda et al., 2003).","This investigation establishes a foundation to understand the functional significance of SNP rs2232228. In addition, these findings provide a rationale for genotyping for the SNP rs2232228 to tailor anthracycline dose (prior to anthracycline exposure) or develop screening\/intervention strategies (after anthracycline exposure) among those at increased risk of cardiomyopathy, in order to maximize the benefits of anthracycline therapy.","The references, patents and published patent applications listed below, and all references cited in the specification above are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.\n\n"],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 13","sup":"\u22126"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
