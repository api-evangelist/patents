abstract: An approach is provided for methods and apparatus for efficiently and effectively determining communities of interest for a user, for use over an ad-hoc mesh network, based on context information associated with user devices. Context information of a device is accessed. The context information is processed to determine one or more themes associated with the context information. One or more communities of interest relating to the one or more themes are determined, the one or more communities of interest having respective community identifiers corresponding therewith. The device is associated with at least one of the communities of interest relating to the one or more themes, based at least in part on the corresponding community identifiers, for accessing awareness information related to one or more of the communities of interest associated with the device. Further, the availability of at least one of the communities of interest associated with the device can be identified via the ad-hoc mesh network, based at least in part on the corresponding community identifiers, and awareness information can be accessed, based at least in part on the availability of the at least one of the communities of interest associated with the device.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus for efficiently and effectively determining communities of interest for a user, for use over an ad-hoc mesh network, based on context information associated with user devices, are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term \u201cawareness information\u201d refers to any information and\/or context about a local environment as well as the users and communication devices within the local environment. By way of example, awareness information can be used to support applications for creating social networks, determining presence, determining contexts associated with a device, advertising, searching for information, etc. Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to determining communities of interest for a user, for use over an ad-hoc mesh network, based on context information associated with user devices and for locating communities over an ad-hoc mesh network, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used within any type of communication system or network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , a system  comprises one or more wireless nodes -optionally having connectivity to a communication network  through either operator A  or operator B . The wireless nodes -are any type of mobile terminal, portable terminal, or fixed terminal including mobile handsets, personal computers, stations, units, devices, multimedia tablets, Internet nodes, communicators, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), radio readable tags (e.g., near field communication (NFC) tags, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags), or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the wireless nodes -can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","In exemplary embodiments, the wireless nodes -form an ad-hoc mesh network  for sharing awareness information. The ad-hoc mesh network  is, for instance, a connectionless and serverless device-to-device network (e.g., a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET)) created using short-range radio technology (e.g., wireless local area network (WLAN) or Bluetooth\u00ae). Within the ad-hoc mesh network , each wireless node  may be mobile and is within communication range of any number of other wireless nodes . Accordingly, the set of wireless nodes -that is within communication range of any a particular wireless node  is transient and can change as the wireless nodes -move from location to location.","As discussed previously, service providers and device manufacturers that are developing communication systems and networks determining communities of interest for a user, for use over an ad-hoc mesh network, based on context information associated with user devices, face many technical challenges. For example, current ad-hoc radios (e.g., WLAN and Bluetooth\u00ae) are designed for connectivity (e.g., connectivity via Internet protocol (IP)). However, in an \u201calways on\u201d environment such as the ad-hoc mesh network , it is not practical to have a large number of wireless nodes -(e.g., mobile handset devices) \u201cconnected\u201d by, for instance, IP to each other for extended periods of time because of power usage and scalability problems. Specifically, a multi-hop connection in a large ad-hoc network typically requires a significant amount of control signaling and power and can quickly deplete a mobile device's battery. Moreover, scalability can be a problem because current ad-hoc radios are typically limited in the number of connections and the related signaling that they can support at any given time. Another shortcoming of current ad-hoc radios is that they do not adequately protect a user's privacy because they expose the user's identity through a fixed network address (e.g., a media access control (MAC) address) associated with the user's device.","To address these problems, the system  creates the ad-hoc mesh network  for sharing awareness information in a connectionless fashion. As used herein, the term \u201cconnectionless\u201d refers to the ability of a node (e.g. wireless node ) to send and of all surrounding nodes -to receive awareness information without the need to send any prior control signaling. For example, sending awareness information using the transmission control protocol\/IP (TCP\/IP) over a WLAN ad-hoc is not connectionless because of the two-way TCP control signaling between the sending and receiving nodes used to establish the TCP connection. The awareness information is provided, for instance, in small anonymous messages that are exchanged by the wireless nodes -automatically without user intervention. As used herein, the term \u201canonymous\u201d means that it is not possible to infer the true identity of the sender from the message, unless the true identity is intentionally included in the message (e.g., by the user or another entity authorized by the user). The exchange of awareness information occurs as a broadcast message (i.e., a flooding message) from a wireless node  to neighboring wireless nodes  that are within range of the radio of the broadcasting wireless node . As neighboring wireless nodes  receive the broadcasted message, each receiving wireless node  may in turn rebroadcast the message to other neighboring wireless nodes . In this way, the originally broadcasted message propagates throughout the ad-hoc mesh network . In exemplary embodiments, the extent of the propagation may be limited by criteria such as distance, location, time, etc.","Unlike traditional systems, such messages are only for carrying awareness information and are not for transporting content (e.g., files or media containing voice, video, etc.) between two wireless nodes (e.g., wireless nodes and ). Instead, the messages contain only pointers to the content or a small amount of data (e.g. presence or context information) to minimize the data traffic transported over the ad-hoc mesh network . The wireless nodes -may then access the content using other communication channels (e.g., via IP through the communication network ). In addition, the system  eliminates the problems associated with traditional methods for route establishment and maintenance (e.g., connection based communication protocols), such as maintaining and handing off connections as mobile devices move, and requiring high levels of network resources for maintaining connections in an environment with a high number or density of mobile devices. For example, the event of a wireless node  appearing\/disappearing to\/from the network does not generate any control signaling in the ad-hoc mesh network . Similarly, the system  creates routing information only when needed to route replies to queries back to the querying node. The routing information is generated by using the query messages alone (i.e. no control signaling is used for creating routing information). After the query and subsequent reply process is completed, the routes are forgotten. In other words, the query\/reply process of system  provisions routes for a reply to provide awareness information on demand rather than pushing awareness information from one node  to another. In exemplary embodiments, both push (e.g., information is published over the ad-hoc mesh network ) and pull (e.g., information is queried from other nodes -of the ad-hoc mesh network ) modes of disseminating awareness information are possible. In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that the pull mode of operation can be used instead of the push mode to help suppress potential spam messages.","Moreover, the system  optimizes the power consumption of wireless nodes  communicating over the ad-hoc mesh network  to enable always-on operation without seriously affecting the battery life of the wireless nodes . For instance, by utilizing only short awareness messages, by eliminating the need for any route maintenance signaling, by employing procedures to minimize transmission and reception of duplicative messages and by enabling an efficient sleep scheme for the short-range device-to-device radio used within each wireless node  (allowed by the low latency requirements typical of an awareness information network), the system  can potentially provide hundreds of hours (e.g., over 400 hours) of continuous operation of each wireless node  between battery charges in a mobile device. The system  could be seen as a \u201cnervous system\u201d between the mobile devices, where small messages (\u201cnerve impulses\u201d) are continuously exchanged by the mobile devices (\u201cneurons\u201d) in order to bring awareness to the user of a mobile device about the user's surroundings.","The system  also enables the development of new services and applications based on awareness information (e.g., social networking applications, location-based applications, application for determining presence, applications for determining context, advertising applications). In particular, the continuous and immediate nature of the awareness information with respect to local environment enables compelling new services. For instance, awareness information may be combined with the increasingly available storage and computing power in mobile devices (e.g., wireless nodes -) to create a local semantic web, whereby local awareness information is created and searched for automatically by wireless nodes  within the ad-hoc mesh network . As used herein, the term \u201csemantic web\u201d refers to a system in which the information and messages shared with the system is understandable by the nodes  within the system. It is noted that establishing such a local semantic web using the system  overcomes two major problems blocking the development of a global semantic web: (1) lack of mechanism for providing semantic content on a large scale, and (2) lack of semantically aware search engines to help users find information in a semantic web. The system  can also be used for collaborative context calculation, publishing pointers to information or content, search for friends within a defined community, finding out what is going on and what kind of people are around a user, making the environment aware of the user, and other like applications.","The following are exemplary use-case scenarios for applications based on awareness information.","In a first use-case, the awareness information alerts a user to nearby people or places. For example, a user is visiting a new town when the wireless node alerts the user that \u201cSalvatore, a friend of your friend David is nearby.\u201d The user may then arrange to meet Salvatore to get a recommendation for sites to visit in the new town. In another example, a user is looking for a good restaurant in an unfamiliar neighborhood. An application based on awareness information may present a list of local restaurants ranked by the number of people currently eating in the restaurant that have the same food preferences as the user. Such a list can be collected based on queries and replies that contain anonymous information of people's food preferences.","In a second use-case, an application uses the awareness information to discover events near the user. For example, as a user passes a park, the wireless node informs the user, based on messages exchanged between nearby devices, that \u201cThere is a Japanese culture festival in the Tea Garden Park; five members of your Kabuki community are there: Zen, Mi, Xia, Talo, and Chris.\u201d The user may then decide to attend the festival.","In a third use-case, an application provides location-based or context-based services using awareness information. For example, a wireless node does not have positioning capabilities but nonetheless knows that it is in a grocery store based on anonymous awareness information from other nearby wireless nodes . It is contemplated that the grocery store may also place a node  in the store to provide such context information, possibly combined with other store specific information such as the address of the store's web page. The wireless node then reminds the user to \u201cRemember to buy dishwasher detergent\u201d based on the user's location in a grocery store. The awareness information can also be the physical position information from a neighboring wireless node  that has the positioning capability. Sharing of positioning information with a neighboring node with such a capability can enable nodes  without such capability to offer navigational services.","In another example, a group of people are attending a meeting. The meeting invitation includes an identification code for that particular meeting that is stored in the mobile nodes  of the meeting attendees (e.g., the identification code may be stored in the calendar data). Using the principles set forth in this invention, the nodes  can exchange the meeting identification code over the ad-hoc mesh network  while attending the meeting. Comparing the exchanged identification code in a user's wireless device  can, for instance, establish whether the users was indeed at the meeting corresponding to the identification code. Such accurate social context knowledge can be used, for instance, to adapt the service or application behavior towards the user.","In a fourth use-case, an application provides for search of local information that changes rapidly and very specific to a local environment. The local information often does not reach traditional Internet search engines. For example, a user bought tickets to a concert, but discovers at the last minute that the user cannot attend. The user stores a string \u201cTicket to concert X at venue Y is available\u201d into the awareness services module  of the user's wireless node . As a result, a nearby wireless node , within a few street blocks away, that searches for tickets by sending query messages with a string \u201cTicket concert X\u201d over the multi-hop ad-hoc mesh network , will receive the user's ticket availability message as an automatic reply.","In a fifth use-case, an application enables locally targeted advertising. For example, it is almost closing time for a local fresh fruit market. The merchants decide to publish an advertisement over the ad-hoc mesh network  that \u201cApples are 50% off for the rest of the day.\u201d The advertisement is available to users who live nearby the market. In another example, a user browses an advertisement for a new printer on a wireless node . In the browsing activity, a code attached to the advertisement is stored in the awareness services module . Upon searching and finding such a code, a nearby electronics store sends the user an offer to sell the printer with a 10% discount.","In a sixth use-case, an application automatically creates an activity log based on the awareness information associated with a user. For example, the application records the people the user meets along with other awareness information such as when, where, context, etc. The user then meets a person while walking on the street. The person looks familiar but the user does not recall the person's name or how the user knows the person. The wireless node running the application reports that the person's name is David and that the user met him at a soccer match one year ago in London.","In a seventh use\u2014case, an application provides the capability to initiate local discussion threads and group chats over the ad-hoc mesh network . For example, the supporters of a football team form a community over the ad-hoc mesh network  wherein community members can send short text messages (e.g., of small enough size to be sent directly over the ad-hoc mesh network ) that can be received and read only by the fan club community members of that particular team.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIGS. 2B-2E","FIG. 2A"],"b":["101","109","101","201","201","111"]},"By way of example, the awareness services module  includes three layers: a awareness layer , a community layer , and a network layer . The awareness layer  is the highest control layer for sharing awareness information. As shown in , the awareness layer  includes a control logic  and item storage . The control logic , for instance, provides the logic for creating, publishing, querying, and receiving awareness information over the ad-hoc mesh network . The control logic  can store the information that it either creates or receives in the item storage . It is contemplated that the item storage  may be of sufficient size to store all or a portion of the information that flows through the wireless node  over a configurable period of time (e.g., days, months, or years).","In exemplary embodiments, the control logic  enables querying and dissemination of awareness information by initiating the flooding of the query or information to neighboring wireless nodes  within the ad-hoc mesh network . For example, upon receiving a query, the wireless nodes  in the local neighborhood that have the queried information may decide to reply to the querying node automatically. In exemplary embodiments, the reply information is also automatically stored in the item storage  of each wireless node  through which the propagating reply passes. Moreover, the reply to a query may result in return of a pointer to specific content relevant to the query rather than the content itself under certain circumstances (e.g., when the specific content is large in size). It is contemplated that the reply may contain direct content if the content is relatively small (e.g., a few tens of bytes of information). By using a pointer, the system  minimizes the data traffic that flows through the ad-hoc mesh network . The user may then access the content via the pointer (e.g., a universal resource locator (URL) address, IP address) via a more appropriate communication protocol (e.g., IP) and\/or means of communication (e.g. infrastructure networks). The receipt of the pointer (e.g., IP address) may automatically trigger the transfer of the content using, for instance, the communication protocol associated with the pointer. In the case of broadcasting or publishing information, any wireless node  through which the published information propagates may store the information in item storage  of the wireless node .","In other exemplary embodiments, awareness information can also be published directly by flooding an awareness message. Such a push mode for the dissemination of awareness information can be used to support some applications (e.g. advertising or group chatting) over the ad-hoc mesh network .","It is recognized that privacy and anonymity may be of concern to users of the system . Accordingly, the control logic  provides mechanisms for ensuring privacy and anonymity. For example, the control logic  can prevent the transmission of intimate information when the number of neighboring wireless nodes is small to prevent the possibility of inferring identity. As used herein, the term \u201cintimate information\u201d refers to information directly related to the user, e.g., the user's habits, tastes, or preferences (musical preferences, favorite restaurants, etc.).","The control logic  may also periodically broadcast decoy queries and replies to make tracking an individual wireless node  more difficult. Since an outside observer does not know the authentication key associated with a community, the observer cannot distinguish a valid message from a fictitious one. Accordingly, by observing decoy messages, the observer is likely to detect presence of a private community when there is not one. Additionally, the control logic  enables to user to define filters for incoming information (e.g., filter advertisements) and how these filters would work (e.g., ignore the information completely, relay the information but do not store, etc.). It is also contemplated that the user can direct the control logic  to control the user's visibility on the ad-hoc mesh network  (e.g., no visibility, visible only to a certain community or other user) to maintain privacy. As another mechanism for protecting privacy, the control logic  can interact with the community layer  to anonymize a specific message and corresponding identifiers as described below with respect to the community layer .","Because one of the goals of the system  is to provide a mechanism for anonymous spreading of awareness information, it is recognized that undesired or unsolicited messages (e.g., spam messages) may become a problem. To address this problem, the control logic  may obtain, for instance, information from the lower system layers of the awareness services module  about the traffic load and current average power consumption. If the traffic load is medium or high (meaning that also power consumption related to system  is medium or high) restrictions may be set for the frequency at which flooding messages are sent by the control logic . It is also contemplated, that the neighboring peer nodes  can be configured to not forward any flooding messages originating from a node  neglecting such message restrictions.","The awareness layer , together with the community layer , provide an application programming interface (API)  to enable an application  to access the functions of the control logic  and the item storage . In exemplary embodiments, the API  enables application developers to have uniform and easy access to functions related to sharing awareness information over the ad-hoc mesh network . It is contemplated that the API  is extensible to accommodate any application designed to access or use awareness information. The applications in the various nodes  do not have to be the same or mutually compatible. It is sufficient that the applications use the API correctly to be able to publish and search awareness information in the surrounding nodes .","The awareness layer  also has connectivity to the community layer . The community layer  controls the formation and cataloging of communities of wireless nodes  within the ad-hoc mesh network . By way of example, a user may create any number of communities for sharing awareness information. It is contemplated that a community may be either a peer community (e.g., any wireless node  may join), a personal community (e.g., a wireless node  may join only if invited), or the open local community that consists of all nodes in the local neighborhood. In exemplary embodiments, the messages that traverse between the wireless nodes  within the ad-hoc mesh network  belong to one of these three community types. Communities can either be private (messages are encrypted) or public (no encryption used). In exemplary embodiments, membership and status in a community affect how the wireless node  shares awareness information (see the discussion with respect to  for additional details of community membership).","Furthermore, a community may be created for any purpose or duration (e.g., a permanent work community, a permanent community of friends, a temporary community of concert goers lasting only the duration of the concert). As shown in , the community layer  includes a community control module , a community directory , and an encryption\/decryption module . The community control module  provides the logic for creating, joining, managing (e.g., updating membership, configuring settings and preferences, setting privacy policies), and deleting communities. The module  also provides part of the API .","In exemplary embodiments, the community control module  assigns a unique community identification number (CID) to each community for use within the ad-hoc mesh network . The control module  can also generate authentication keys K associated with the CID to, for instance, authenticate users who wish to join the community or authenticate messages directed to the community. For example, a wireless node  may invite another wireless node  to join a community by transferring the CID and authentication keys associated with the community to the other wireless node . It is contemplated that the transfer of the CID and corresponding authentication key may occur using short range radio or using another secure mechanism (e.g., short message service (SMS) or electronic mail). It is noted that both peer and personal communities use a CID and corresponding K, whereas the open local community either can use a predetermined value for CID (e.g., zero) or does not use the CID at all.","To ensure privacy (as discussed above), the community control module  interacts an encryption\/decryption module  to anonymize the CID when including the CID in messages over the ad hoc mesh network . For example, a wireless node  may direct a query to a specific community using an anonymized CID (e.g., a pseudonym) associated with the community in lieu of the actual CID. In exemplary embodiments, multiple anonymized CIDs may be used to represent a single community. In this way, it is more difficult to identify queries corresponding to a particular community by monitoring traffic within the ad hoc mesh network . From the perspective of an outside observer, the anonymized CIDs look random. In addition, the encryption\/decryption module  may encrypt or decrypt message data using, for instance, a temporary key that is periodically derived from the authentication key K associated with the CID. These measures hinder the discovery of the CID by outsiders that do not have the authentication key. By way of example, the community layer  inserts a special header into the messages that it receives from the awareness layer . The special header, for instance, contains a list of anonymized community identifiers corresponding to the communities to which the message is relevant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2D"],"b":["101","251","253","109","201","101","255","251","253","101","251","101","101","253","205","205"]},"When the wireless node  is in the joined state , the wireless node  may also be in either an inactive state  or an active state . To transition between the inactive state  and the active state , the application  may issue a command  to either activate or deactivate the joined state  via the application programming interface . When the wireless node  is in the inactive state , the community layer  abandons the message even though it is a member of the community. In certain embodiments, the wireless node  may also be invisible to other members of the community while in the inactive state . For example, the wireless node  may enter the inactive state  when it temporarily does not want to receive or share information with the community. When the wireless node  is in the active state , the community layer  encrypts and decrypts community messages as usual for private communities, and enables all outgoing and incoming community specific messages for public communities (e.g., communities with no restrictions on membership).","Within the active state , the wireless node  may also be in either an invisible state  or a visible state . To transition between the invisible state  and the visible state , the application  issues a command  to set either the visible or invisible state. When in the invisible state , the community-specific identity (e.g., a user alias) associated with the wireless node  cannot be queried by other members of the community. For example, in the invisible state , the community layer  continues to receive and send community messages without its identity known to other community members. When in the visible state , the identity of the wireless node  can be queried by other members of the community.","In various embodiments, the community directory  of the community layer  maintains, for instance, information on the communities that the user has joined. Such information contains, at least, the community identification (CID). Additionally, it may contain public and\/or private authentication keys (K) of the joined communities and a list of anonymized community identifiers for each community. The community control module  may periodically recalculate the list of anonymized CIDs. By way of example, the community layer  inserts a header into the message it receives from the awareness layer . The header contains, for instance, a list of anonymized community identifiers identifying the communities to which the message is relevant.","It is contemplated that a special personal community can be reserved for tracking new bonds or relationships created between users. Consider, for example, that user A meets user B for the first time and wants to create a radio bond between the mobile devices corresponding to each user. In one embodiment, user A can initiate the creation this bond with user B by transferring to user B (e.g., by using a secure transfer mechanism) the CID and the public K of user A's personal \u201cnew bonds\u201d community. Similarly, user B may give user A similar credentials corresponding to user B's \u201cnew bonds\u201d community. Once the credentials are exchanged and the bond has been created, user A may find user B over the ad-hoc mesh network  by searching for members of user A's \u201cnew bonds\u201d community. In other words, with a simple search of a single community, user A can search for all the people in user A's local neighborhood with whom user A has created a bond. This requires that a high number of community CIDs and Ks can be stored in the community directory . Also, an effective lookup of the community directory must be provided. There are many existing and good solutions for such efficient lookup.","As the user creates new bonds, the number community CIDs and Ks stored in the user's community directory  can grow quite large. Accordingly, to enable effective search of a large number of communities, the community layer  may generate a special community search message to initiate the search. For example, the special community search message contains, at least in part, a list of anonymized community identifiers corresponding to the communities to be searched. To protect the privacy, the community layer  can generate a new set of anonymized community identifiers for each community search message. If the community layer  finds a match to any of the anonymized community identifiers in any of the neighboring nodes  that receives the search message, the community layer  generates a reply message that may contain the alias of the user in that community or other community specific information. The reply message may be encrypted with the encryption key of the community.","As shown in , the community layer  has connectivity to the awareness layer  above and the network layer  below. The network layer  manages the rebroadcasting of received flooding messages and the routing of the unicast (typically reply) messages received by the wireless node .  depicts a diagram of the components of the network layer , according to an exemplary embodiment. The network layer  includes a network control module , routing table , neighbor table , message identification (MID) table , and message table . The network control module  directs the broadcasts of messages and information by managing and updating the routing table , neighbor table , MID table , and message table . In certain embodiments, the network control module  may also assist in protecting the privacy and anonymity of users by periodically changing the network layer identification associated with the wireless node . It is noted that making such a change in the network layer identification between queries does not cause routing problems for replies because the routing information is recreated by each query in the ad-hoc mesh network .","In exemplary embodiments, the network layer  may insert a header into messages it receives from the community layer  to, for instance, direct flooding and routing of the received messages. The structure of this network layer message header  is discussed with respect to .  is a diagram of the data structure of a network layer message header, according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown, the message header  contains the following fields: (1) a TX field  to identify the transmitter node ID (NID) of the last transmitting node ; (2) a SRC field  to identify the source node ID of the node  that originated the message; (3) a DST field  to identify the destination source ID of the intended recipient of a unicast (reply) message (e.g., this field is give a value of zero when the message is a flooding messages); (4) a MSN field  to identify the message sequence number assigned by the source node; and (5) a hop count field  that is incremented by one by each node  that transmits the message. In certain embodiments, the message header  may also contain the following optional fields: (6) a geographical limit field  to designate the extent of the physical over which the message is intended to propagate (e.g., the geographical limit field  may contain a geographical position of the source node and a maximum flooding radius from that position); (7) a temporal limit field  (e.g., the temporal limit field  may contain the time when the message becomes obsolete and should be dropped); and (8) a context limit field  that defines the context beyond which the message is not intended to propagate (e.g. a message related to a particular concert is not intended to extend beyond the concert venue).","Returning to , the network layer  also contains a routing table . In exemplary embodiments, the routing table  contains a listing of the node identification number (NID) of the originating wireless node  (e.g., source NID) and the NIDs of the last known transmitters of the message. The purpose of the routing table is to enable the routing of the reply messages (e.g., unicast messages) back to the querying node that originated the query through a flooding message. As the message propagates through the ad-hoc mesh network , each subsequent wireless node  that receives the message adds the NID of the last transmitter to the routing table to record the next hop neighbor towards the source node. The source node is marked as the destination node (DST) in the routing table. Also the message sequence number of the message is recorded. The update of the routing table  is coordinated by the network control module . As shown in Table 1, the routing table  lists the destination NID, the transmitter NIDs associated with wireless nodes  that have rebroadcasted a message and the MSN of the message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Destination NID","Transmitter NIDs","Message Sequence Number"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["DST","TX, TX, . . . , TX","MSN"]},{"entry":["DST","TX, TX, . . . , TX","MSN"]},{"entry":[". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":["DST","TX, TX, . . . , TX","MSN"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The neighbor table  contains a list of the neighboring wireless nodes  and an estimate of their relative radio distance (see Table 3). It is contemplated that the observed signal strength together with the known transmitting power of a neighboring wireless node  is an indicator of the proximity of the wireless node  and can be used to calculate the relative radio distance. The relative radio distance of the node from which the message was last received is then used as a criterion for whether or not the wireless node  retransmits a received message. For instance, a higher signal strength indicates closer proximity to the wireless node . The network control module  monitors the signal strengths of neighboring nodes  as the module  receives messages from nearby devices and uses it to estimate the relative radio distance (e.g., proximity of the transmitting node ). It is also contemplated that the network control module  may use any other mechanism for estimating the relative radio distance of neighboring nodes (e.g., estimating location using global positioning satellite receivers or other positioning techniques).","In certain embodiments, the network control module  uses the proximity information to direct the routing and transmission of messages over the ad-hoc mesh network . For example, the system  can reduce the potential for overloading the ad-hoc mesh network  by implementing a smart flooding scheme whereby only a few nodes  retransmit a flooding message. Whether a node  retransmits a flooding message can be dependent on the relative distance group (e.g., \u201cvery near\u201d, \u201cnear\u201d, or \u201cfar\u201d) to which the node  that is the transmitter of the message belongs. More specifically, if the transmitting node  is in the \u201cfar\u201d or \u201cnear\u201d group, the receiving node  can retransmit the flooding message. If the transmitting node  is in the \u201cvery near\u201d group, the receiving node  does not retransmit the flooding message. For each broadcast message received from a node in either the \u201cfar\u201d or \u201cnear\u201d group, the network control module  assigns a random delay time for relaying or rebroadcasting. The delay period, for instance, exhibits a distribution function based on the estimated relative radio distance as a way to randomize the delay period before transmission. The distribution should be chosen in such a way that the random delay is larger for those nodes that are \u201cnear\u201d than for those that are \u201cfar.\u201d This favors, for instance, nodes  that are further away to relay the flooding message forward, which results in better flooding efficiency (smaller total number of transmissions). The use of a random delay time also prevents the unintended synchronization of message broadcasts as the message propagates over the ad-hoc mesh network . For example, unintended synchronization of the message broadcasts may result in too many nodes  sending broadcasting (i.e., flooding) messages over the ad-hoc mesh network  at exactly the same time. Additionally, the delay time provides an opportunity for the network control module  to monitor and count rebroadcasts of the message by other neighboring wireless nodes .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Transmitter NID","Relative Radio Distance"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"TX","D"]},{"entry":[{},"TX","D"]},{"entry":[{},". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[{},"TX","D"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The MID table  contains a list of received messages. As the wireless node  receives messages from neighboring nodes over the ad hoc mesh network , the network control module  uses the MID table to check whether the message has been received previously by, for example, comparing the MIDs in the MID table  to that of the received message. The MID table  also contains a flag indicating whether a message has been transmitted by the node  and the time when the entry was last updated. In exemplary embodiments, the MID is the tuple (SRC, MSN), where SRC is the NID of the source node and MSN is a message sequence number assigned by the source node. In this way, the MID is a unique identifier of each message that propagates in the network . The network control module  makes an entry in the MID table  for all new messages that it receives. If the message has been scheduled for transmission, the module  increments the message counter in the message table (see Table 4).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"MID","Sent flag","Time of reception"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(SRC, MSN)","\u201cSENT\u201d","t"]},{"entry":[{},"(SRC, MSN)","\u201cNOT SENT\u201d","t"]},{"entry":[{},". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[{},"(SRC, MSN)","\u201cNOT SENT\u201d","t"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The message table  contains messages that the network control module  has scheduled to transmit. For example, as the node  receives a flooding message that the network control module  schedules for transmission, the module  updates the message table to include the message in the message table . Each entry in the message table  contains the message itself, the time when the message is scheduled to be sent, and the number of receptions of the same message by the node  (see Table 4). In exemplary embodiments, a message is not relayed over the ad-hoc mesh network  if the number of times the message has been received exceeds a predefined limit. For example, a message has the initial count of 0. In this example, as a wireless node  in the neighborhood is observed to transmit the message, the message count associated with the message is increased. When the maximum message count is reached, the network control module  removes the message from the message table . The transmitter of each message is also associated with an estimated relative radio distance (D) indicating whether the transmitting node is within close proximity of the wireless node  (e.g., transmitting node  is in the \u201cvery near\u201d relative radio distance group) or far from the wireless node  (e.g., transmitting node  is in the \u201cfar\u201d relative radio distance group). If the relative radio distance associated with the transmitting node indicates that the transmission of the message occurred \u201cvery near,\u201d the wireless node  would not have to relay the message because it is assumed, for instance, that most of the other neighboring wireless nodes  have already received the same message. By taking into account the relative radio distances of neighboring nodes, the described smart flooding functionality leads to, on average, each flooding message being received for a few times by each node  independent of the node density. The number of times a message is received by any one node  affects the scalability of the network .","If the received message, however, is a unicast reply message that was addressed to the receiving node , the network control module  checks whether the destination node  can be found in the routing table  (e.g., can be found from the destination field in the reply message, or obtained from the source field of the query by the replying node). If found, the routing table entry will give the NID of the neighboring node to which the reply message will be sent in the next opportunity. If the unicast transmission is not successful, the next entry for the same DST will be used as the next try. If the received message is a unicast reply message that was not addressed to the receiving node, and no acknowledgment from the intended receiver node was heard, the node will store the message in the message table  for scheduled retransmission. It is noted that unicast messages or acknowledgement messages that are not addressed to the node  are normally received D2D radio layer  (see discussion of the D2D radio layer  below) but not by the awareness services module . However, under certain circumstances, the D2D radio layer  can provide such messages to the awareness services module  to schedule for retransmission. For example, if no successful unicast of the same message is observed by the time when the message is scheduled to be transmitted, the node  will transmit the unicast or acknowledgement message to the intended recipient found from the routing table  associated with the message. In this way, the nodes  that are not the intended recipients of the reply messages can assist in routing the message forward towards the correct destination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Message","Time to send","Received msg count"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"MSG","t","C"]},{"entry":[{},"MSG","t","C"]},{"entry":[{},". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[{},"MSG","t","C"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"As shown in , the awareness services module  has connectivity to a device-to-device (D2D) radio layer .

The determination as to whether a particular term constitutes a \u201ccommon term\u201d for purposes of the identification of a community of interest to the user may, for example, be based on a predetermined frequency of the occurrence of a term.

For example, the header may specify a maximum message count (e.g., hop count), a geographical limit for the flooding message, a temporal limit, or other context limit. Preparing the message for broadcast also includes, for instance, assigning a message sequence number  (MSN) to the flooding message and specifying a source NID, destination NID, and\/or transmitter NID. The awareness services module  initiates broadcast of the flooding message by adding an entry for the generated flooding message in the MID table, with the sent flag set to \u201cnot sent,\u201d and forwarding the message to the D2D radio layer  for broadcast over the ad-hoc mesh network  (step ). After broadcasting, the awareness services module  may determine whether the flooding message should be rebroadcasted over the ad-hoc mesh network  (step ). For example, the application  may direct the awareness services module  to rebroadcast the flooding message based by monitoring and counting the number times the originating node  is able to observe rebroadcasts of the flooding message by neighboring nodes . The observed rebroadcasts, for instance, serve as an acknowledgement that the neighboring node  that is retransmitting the flooding message has successfully received the flooding message. In one embodiment, the awareness services module  determines whether the observed rebroadcasts is of the same flooding message by comparing the MID of the observed message and the original flooding message (step ). If, after a predetermined period of time, no rebroadcasts are observed, the awareness services module can rebroadcast the flooding message (e.g., by returning to step  and repeating as necessary). It is contemplated that the application  or the awareness services module  can define the number of rebroadcasts to attempt. After reaching the rebroadcast limit, the awareness services module  notifies the application  of the rebroadcasting status and suspends additional rebroadcasts (step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 3I","b":["366","111","109","101"]},"In addition, the information within the flooding message is shared anonymously (e.g., shared without identifying the sender of the information) unless directed otherwise. By way of example, the awareness services module  may use any mechanism to share the information anonymously including changing a link layer or network layer identification, preventing transmission of intimate information when the number of neighboring nodes is small, anonymizing information that can be used to identify a user or community, or a combination thereof. For example, by periodically changing a link layer or network layer identification associated with a transmitting wireless node , the awareness services module  makes it more difficult for an outside observer to determine the identity of the wireless node  or its user. The anonymous sharing of information is further protected by preventing the transmission of intimate information with the number of neighboring nodes is small. This reduces the possibility that an outside observer may infer the owner of the intimate information by observing the small community of wireless nodes . As another mechanism, the awareness services module  can anonymize any identifying information in the flooding message using the process described with respect to the encryption\/decryption module  of the community layer  (e.g., anonymizing the CID).","On receipt of the flooding message, the awareness services module  updates the routing table  associated with the message and the MID table  (step ). As discussed with respect to , for each observed source node NID the routing table  contains listing of all neighboring nodes that the awareness services module  has observed to retransmit the same flooding message (messages with equal MID). For example, the network control module  stores the NID of the node from which the message was received as the next entry of the list. This way, the routing table  contains redundant next-hop information from the current receiving node towards the source node. If the received flooding message contains a MSN that is larger than that found in the routing table , the listing of the next hop neighbors is deleted from the routing table  for this destination and the transmitting node is set as the first entry in the next hop list. In exemplary embodiments, the dynamic updating of the routing table  based on the flooding messages enables the awareness services module  to dynamically create reply routes among wireless nodes  within the ad-hoc mesh network .","To update the MID table , the awareness services module  checks whether there is already an entry for the received message. If there is not, the awareness services module  adds a new entry for the received flooding message including the time of reception. If there is an existing entry, the awareness services module  updates the time of reception. The time of reception is used, for instance, to remove older entries from the MID table.","To update the message table , the awareness services module  first checks (based on the MID) if the received message already exists in the message table. Existence of the message would mean that the message has been received earlier and is already scheduled for retransmission by the module . If the message already exists in the message table , the message counter in the message table  is also incremented.","The neighbor table  contains a list of the neighboring wireless nodes  and an estimate of their relative radio distance. In exemplary embodiments, the awareness services module  initiates determination of the relative radio distance of neighboring wireless nodes  (step ). In one embodiment, the relative radio distance is estimated by measuring the transmitting power (e.g., a receiver carrier power indication (RCPI) level) of received messages to determine the relative radio distance of neighboring wireless nodes . The awareness services module  then classifies the neighboring nodes  according to their respective relative radio distance or other predefined criteria (step ). For example, based on the RCPI and, optionally, the observed RCPI history of the neighboring nodes , the nodes  are ordered by increasing RCPI value. The nodes  are then divided into, for instance, one or more distance categories (e.g., three categories): the nodes  with the highest RCPI (or RCPI history) values are assigned a relative radio distance of \u201cvery near\u201d; the nodes  with lowest RCPI (or RCPI history) values are assigned a relative radio distance of \u201cfar\u201d; and the remaining nodes  are assigned a relative radio distance of \u201cnear\u201d. The sizes of these three populations are adaptively set by the awareness services module  by modifying the RCPI thresholds used for relative distance classification. If the number of neighboring nodes is small, the thresholds should be set in such a way that all the nodes will fall in the \u201cnear\u201d category.","It is contemplated that the observed signal strength together with the known transmitting power of a neighboring wireless node  is an indicator of the proximity of the wireless node  and can be used to calculate the relative radio distance. The relative radio distance of the node from which the message was last received is then used as a criterion for whether or not the wireless node  retransmits a received flooding message. For instance, a higher signal strength indicates closer proximity to the wireless node . The awareness services module  monitors the signal strengths of neighboring nodes  as it receives messages from nearby devices and uses it to estimate the relative radio distance (proximity). It is also contemplated that the awareness services module  may use any other mechanism for estimating the relative radio distance of neighboring nodes (e.g., estimating location using global positioning satellite receivers or other positioning techniques).","For example, an entry for a neighboring node  is maintained in the neighbor table , if within a predetermined time window T, the neighboring node  has transmitted a message or a beacon signal. In certain embodiments, the time window T is dependent on how quickly the neighboring nodes  are moving or changing. For example, if the set of neighboring nodes  is changing rapidly, the time window T is shorter; if the set of neighboring nodes  is stable, the time window T is longer. It is contemplated that the time window may be dynamically adjusted based on the stability of the set of neighboring nodes .","In one embodiment, if the received flooding message is from a neighboring wireless node  that is classified in the very near distance category (step ), the awareness services module  cancels retransmission of the flooding message or does not initiate retransmission of the flooding message (step ). Under this circumstance, the awareness services module  assumes that because the flooding message was received from a very near neighboring wireless node , the other neighboring wireless nodes  most likely have also received the flooding message. Therefore, retransmission of the flooding message to immediate neighboring nodes  is likely not needed. In this way, the awareness services module  reduces unnecessary retransmissions over the ad-hoc mesh network .","If the neighboring node  from which the flooding message was received is not in the very near distance category, the awareness services module  determines whether to retransmit the flooding message based on other predefined retransmission criteria (step ). As part of this determination, the awareness services module , for instance, classifies the neighboring wireless nodes  into one or more groups based on the criteria. Classification in a particular group may then be used to determine whether that group, for instance will receive retransmission of the flooding message. The retransmission criteria include, for instance, a message hop limit, geographical limit, temporal limit, context limit, or a combination thereof. It is contemplated that the awareness services module  may use any other limitation or context as retransmission criteria. In exemplary embodiments, the retransmission criteria reduce the potential for unnecessarily rebroadcasting a flooding message, thereby minimizing data traffic over the ad-hoc mesh network . For example, the awareness services module  applies the message count limit by checking the hop count field  in the received message, which indicates the number of hops the flooding message has traveled over the ad-hoc mesh network . Once the message count reaches a predefined limit, the flooding message is dropped and no longer retransmitted. Such a limit prevents messages from travelling without limit. In certain embodiments, the message count limit can override any other limits that the originator of the message may have set.","Similarly, the awareness services module  can limit the geographical dispersion of the flooding message by, for instance, comparing the location of the wireless node  to the geographical limit  of the flooding message. This location information may be obtained as awareness information shared by neighboring wireless nodes  or directly obtained from a positioning module or other positioning service accessible by the wireless node .","With respect to a retransmission criterion based on a temporal limit, the awareness services module  rebroadcasts the flooding message only during the effective time period of the message. For example, a flooding message includes information concerning a concert and is effective only for the duration of the concert. By way of example, the awareness services module  accesses a clock service (e.g., resident on the wireless node  or external to the wireless node ) to determine the time and does not retransmit the flooding message if the time is outside the effective time period specified by the temporal limit  of the flooding message.","With respect to a retransmission criterion based on a context limit, the awareness services module  rebroadcasts the flooding message only if the context limit  in the received message matches with that of the receiving node. Such a context (e.g. location in \u201cBradbury Mall\u201d) may be calculated based on the awareness information received from other mobile nodes or from nodes installed at fixed locations. For example, a flooding message including an advertisement for a store may have its distribution limited to only those wireless nodes  that are located within the mall in which the store is located.","Based on application of the retransmission criteria, the awareness services module  makes a determination of whether to retransmit the flooding message. If the determination is to retransmit, the awareness services module  updates the message table  to add the received flooding message to the transmission queue and initiates rebroadcast of the flooding message by, for instance, assigning a retransmission time range to each distance category (step ). The retransmission range for the near group, for instance, can be calculated based on the number of wireless nodes  classified or included in the near group. Similarly, the retransmission range for far group can be calculated based on the number of wireless nodes  classified or included in the far group. It is contemplated that the retransmission range can be independently calculated for each defined group. By way of example, the retransmission time range specifies a time period during which the flooding message will be retransmitted to the neighboring wireless nodes  within a specific distance category. More specifically, the awareness services module  schedules the retransmission of the flooding message according to assigned retransmission time range for each neighboring wireless node  (step ). In this way, the awareness services module  can delay or stagger the retransmission of the flooding message to neighboring wireless nodes  based on, for instance, their relative radio distances. The delay or stagger reduces the potential to saturate the traffic capacity of the ad-hoc mesh network . In addition, the awareness services module  may also determine whether to continue retransmission of a flooding message based on the distance category of the neighboring wireless node  from which the flooding message was received. For example, the awareness services module  may cancel retransmission of the flooding message if the transmitting neighboring wireless node  is in the very near category. For example, because the transmitting wireless node  is in the very near category, it is assumed that other neighboring wireless nodes  are also likely to have already received the flooding message. Therefore, retransmission is likely to be unnecessary. If the transmitting node  is in the far category, the awareness services module  will schedule the flooding message for retransmission because it is less likely that other neighboring nodes have already received the flooding message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 9","FIG. 2D"],"b":["111","400","401","111"]},"Moreover, it is contemplated that the state of a community in a wireless node  can be used to filter incoming messages. For example, to block all incoming or outgoing messages, a user can set the state of a community to inactive so that all messages from that particular community are disregarded. It is contemplated that a user belonging to multiple communities may independently set the visibility state for each community. By way of example, to block incoming advertisements, the user can set the state to inactive for the community sending the advertisements. It is also contemplated that the user can automatically set the visibility state based on criteria such as time (e.g., to automatically set a visibility state at certain periods of the day), location (e.g., to automatically set a visibility state at certain locations such as work or school), or any other context (e.g., while in a meeting or at dinner).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["502","506","508","502","201","203","205","207","209"]},"In step , the application  within querying node  generates a request for searching community information (e.g., wireless nodes  having active communities or communities with visible members) over the ad-hoc mesh network  and sends the request to the community layer  of the querying node .

After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile station  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile station . The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the station. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile station .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile station  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile station settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
