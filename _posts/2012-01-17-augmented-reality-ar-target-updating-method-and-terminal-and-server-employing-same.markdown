In mobile AR service, additional information is added to real things seen by the camera of a terminal through information about the current location and direction of the terminal and shown.","Common mobile AR service is a method in which a terminal requests, from a server, an AR target (or AR content) including contents necessary for a user in the current location of the terminal and provides the requested AR target or uses an AR target previously stored in the terminal. This method is disadvantageous in that seamless mobile AR service is not provided to a user who uses consecutive mobile AR service.","Embodiments disclosed in this specification have been made to solve the above-described problem, and there are provided a method of updating an AR target stored in the cache of a terminal in order to provide a user with seamless mobile AR service and a method of previously downloading an AR target of an area that is substantially necessary for a user, and a terminal and server adopting the same.","A method of a terminal updating an AR target according to an embodiment disclosed in this specification includes the steps of receiving an AR target, a boundary distance for a coverage area of the AR target, and at least one area ID list from a server; determining whether or not the location of the terminal satisfies a boundary condition based on the boundary distance if precise positioning is possible; determining whether or not the serving cell ID of the terminal satisfies the boundary condition based on the at least one area ID list if the precise positioning is impossible; and sending an update request for the AR target to the server if it is determined that the boundary condition is satisfied.","In an embodiment, the at least one area ID list includes an entire area ID list included in the coverage area and a boundary area ID list corresponding to the boundary of the coverage area.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the boundary condition is satisfied if the serving cell ID of the terminal is included in both the entire area ID list and the boundary area ID list.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the at least one area ID list includes an outer area ID list corresponding to the boundary of the coverage area and an inner area ID list corresponding to the inside of the boundary of the coverage area.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the boundary condition of the terminal is satisfied if the serving cell ID of the terminal is included in the outer area ID list and is not included in the inner area ID list.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the at least one area ID list includes an area ID list corresponding to the inside of the coverage area.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the boundary condition of the terminal is satisfied if the serving cell ID of the terminal is not included in the area ID list corresponding to the inside of the coverage area.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the at least one area ID list includes a boundary area ID list corresponding to the coverage area.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the boundary condition of the terminal is satisfied if the serving cell ID of the terminal is included in the boundary area ID list.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the boundary condition of the terminal is satisfied if a distance between a location of the terminal at a point of time at which the AR target has been requested and a current location of the terminal is greater than or equal to the boundary distance.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the boundary condition of the terminal is satisfied if a radius of the coverage area is greater than a sum of the distance between the location of the terminal at the point of time at which the AR target has been requested and the current location of the terminal and the boundary distance.","Meanwhile, a method of a server updating an AR target according to another embodiment disclosed in this specification includes the steps of receiving an update request for the AR target from a terminal, wherein the request includes a moving direction and motion state of the terminal;

Personalization can imply the use of estimation regarding a user which can be distributed over, for example, many static data and\/or a user profile, and preference. Furthermore, contextualization refers to the processing of custom-tailored AR content based on specific user context. Contextualization can imply the use of estimation regarding user context, such as many dynamic data and\/or, for example, a location and performance.","Furthermore, user context refers to dynamic information set indicative of a current common state of a user and surrounding environments of the user. The information set can be searched for from various sources including an OMA enabler.","Furthermore, an AR App. is an external entity residing in a device.
