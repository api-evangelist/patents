{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to social networking systems, and more specifically relates to reordering search results based on social network data from social networking systems.","A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.","The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interests. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. The social networking system may also create and store user preferences.","A social networking system may support application programming interfaces and associated functionality that allows third-party systems to access user profile data of its users. Such third party websites can use the user profile data can use the identity and account of a user for purposes of identifying users and maintaining their accounts at such third party websites. These third party websites may also access user profile data in order to personalize or customize the user experience on the site.","The present disclosure generally relates to social networking systems, and more specifically relates to reordering search results based on social network data from social networking systems.","In particular embodiments, a method comprising, accessing, at a client device, a set of search results in a structured document loaded into a client application, wherein the search results correspond to a search query of a first user, accessing a data store of social graph information to determine if one or more second users having an association with the first user have accessed any of the search results, and visually distinguishing, at the client device, in a user interface of the client application each of the one or more search results that have been accessed by one or more second users.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","The present disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","Social Network Systems and Accessible User Profile Data","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other, through the system. Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter, the registered user may login to the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.","When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a \u201cuser profile,\u201d in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user. For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example, if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends). Connections may be added explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.","The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information. Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile. Again, such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user's most-recent activities. Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile. For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or remove the user as a friend). A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages\u2014typically known as wall-posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.","A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.","In particular embodiments, an edge may be one of a plurality of edge types based at least in part on the types of nodes that the edge connects in the social graph. In particular embodiments, for example, each edge from a first edge type defines a connection between a pair of user nodes from the first set, while each edge from a second edge type defines a connection between a user node from the first set and a concept node from the second set. Furthermore, each edge from a third edge type may define a connection between a pair of concept nodes from the second set. In particular embodiments, the edge itself may store, or be stored with, data that defines a type of connection between the pair of nodes the edge connects. In particular embodiments, each edge may simply define or represent a connection between nodes regardless of the types of nodes the edge connects; that is, the edge itself may store, or be stored with, identifiers of the nodes the edge connects but may not store, or be stored with, data that describes a type of connection between the pair of nodes the edge connects. Furthermore, in any of these or other particular embodiments, data that may indicate the type of connection or relationship between nodes connected by an edge may be stored with the nodes themselves. Additional information on automatic edge generation in an integrated social graph is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,145, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.","Similar to user profile pages, concept profile pages (\u201chubs\u201d) share information related to the concept associated with the corresponding hub node. In particular embodiments, any registered user logged in to social networking system and viewing a hub may add content to the hub similar to a wiki-site. A hub may also generally include a basic information section, a detailed info section, as well as, potentially, other sections, any and all of which may generally be filled in by any user viewing the hub. In particular embodiments, wall (or news feed\/activities feed) section, or other feed or activities section of the hub, displays comments, status updates, wall posts and other user activities associated with the user and friends of the user that are viewing the hub. The wall (or news feed\/activities feed) section, or other feed or activities section of the hub may also display comments, status updates, wall posts and other user activities and user generated content that are related to the concept for which the hub was created. A hub may also include a photo or picture section under photos tab allowing users to upload images in or related to the concept, one of which may be selected as a profile picture for the hub.","In particular embodiments, user nodes and hub nodes stored in the social graph database may be connected with one another via edges. In particular embodiments, each edge may be classified or characterized by an edge type of a plurality of edge types that define, indicate, or characterize the connection between the pair of nodes connected by the edge. In particular embodiments, edges define friendship or other social relationship connections between users (e.g., friends) associated with the respective user nodes.","The social networking system may also support a privacy model. A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user and\/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information. A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party application) that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections, a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the Internet). A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120","130","150","110","120","110","130","120","130"]},"Client device  is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating over a computer network (e.g., remotely). Client device  may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable mobile computing devices. Client device  may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network.","In particular embodiments, client device  may host a browser application  or other application that processes structured documents. In particular embodiments, client device  may have received one or more structured documents from external website  and\/or social networking system . In particular embodiments, the structured document may be a markup language document that contains text, links, scripts, and other attributes, such as API calls identifying social network data elements of a user profile maintained by social networking system . In particular embodiments, the structured document may contain instructions, for example, to specify how to render content for display at client device . In particular embodiments, the structured document may contain instructions, for example, on how to access additional information from social networking system .

(http:\/\/www.google.com). In particular embodiments, external website  and its contents may be stored at many different sites, such as on computers and servers, in databases, etc., around the world, as illustrated by content store . In particular embodiments, the information that search engine  seeks to locate may be in content store , on social networking system , or on many different sites, such as on computers and servers, in databases, etc., around the world as well. These different sites are communicatively linked to the Internet through various network infrastructures and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of external website  specifies where the corresponding documents are located and the mechanism for retrieving them. Any person may access the publicly available external website  or its contents via a suitable network device (e.g., a computer, a smart mobile telephone, etc.) connected to the Internet.","In particular embodiments external website  and social networking system  may have one or more users or members. In particular embodiments, users of external website  may also be users of social networking system . In particular embodiments, a user may interact with external website  and\/or the social networking system  using client device . In particular embodiments, the social networking system  may keep user profile information and the connections among the users.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system  may receive requests from either the external website  or the client device  to which the social networking system  may respond with the requested information or with a subset of the requested information. Particular interactions between client device , the external website , and the social networking system  and information exchanged between the three systems will be described later in detail. As discussed in more detail below, implementations of the invention include augmented client-side functionality directed to informing the user as to which social network data elements of the user the external website  desires access and allows the user to control such access consistent with his or her privacy configurations.","In particular embodiments, social networking system  may include a web server , an authorization server , an action logger , an action log , a connection database , a privacy controls database , and member profile database . In particular embodiments, social networking system  may include additional, fewer, or different modules for various applications. Conventional components such as network interfaces, security mechanisms, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system. In particular embodiments, the social networking system  comprises a computing system that allows users to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system  stores user profile data and social graph information in member profile database . In particular embodiments, the social networking system  stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection database . Particular embodiments of the connection database  may store connection information for users who have indicated similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history. In particular embodiments, the social networking system  may also include user-defined connections between different users and those connections may be stored in connection database  as well. Particular embodiments of connection database  may allow users to specify their relationships with other users. In particular embodiments, for example, these user defined connections allows users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, relatives, co-workers, partners, and so forth. In particular embodiments, users may select from predefined types of connections, or define their own connection types, as needed.","In particular embodiments, the web server  links the social networking system  via the network  to one or more client devices . Network  generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices  may access the external website  and the social network system . In particular embodiments, the web server  serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, Flash, XML, and so forth. Particular embodiments of the web server  may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system  and the client devices . In particular embodiments, the messages may be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging technique.","In particular embodiments, the action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about user actions on and\/or off the social networking system . In particular embodiments, the action logger  populates the action log  with information about user actions in order to track them. More specifically, any action that a particular user takes with respect to another user is associated with each user's profile through information maintained in a database or other data repository, such as the action log . In particular embodiments, the actions taken by the members that are recorded in the action log  may be actions taken by the members on the social networking system  or actions taken by the members on the external website . In particular embodiments, the actions taken by the members on an external website  are communicated to the web server  and the web server  sends a request to the action logger  to record the actions in the action log . In particular embodiments, such actions may include, for example, adding a connection to the other user, sending a message to the other user, reading a message from the other user, viewing content associated with the other user, attending an event posted by another user, among others. Additionally, in particular embodiments, actions in connection with other objects may be directed at particular users, and these actions may be associated with those users as well.","In particular embodiments, when a user takes an action on the social networking system , the action is recorded in an action log . In particular embodiments, the social networking system  maintains the action log  as a database of entries. In particular embodiments, when an action is taken on the social networking system , the social networking system  adds an entry for that action to the action log .","In particular embodiments, a user of the social networking system may share media hosted by external websites with the social networking system and this action may be received by action logger  and stored in action log . In particular embodiments, external websites may have \u201cshare\u201d buttons that are operative to transmit links to the content to the social networking system and post the links as wall post entries for a user profile. In particular embodiments, the buttons are operative to transmit activity stream entries to the social networking system, which will post the entry in a news feed. In particular embodiments, for example, a user can access a photo, a photo album, a video clip, or other media from a client device  and post links to that content on the wall associated with a user profile on social networking system.","In particular embodiments, privacy controls database  may store a user's privacy data for a user's settings for each user datum associated with the user and the user's settings for third party applications. For example, a user may have selected default privacy settings or a user may have specifically excluded certain entities from viewing a user datum or particular type of user data, and all of that privacy data for all users and friends of users may be stored in the privacy controls database .","In particular embodiments, a user's privacy data may comprise privacy settings associated with any aspect of the user profile, including changes that the user makes to the user profile, events, locations, media, activities, connections between one or more users, the news feed associated with the user or any other action that the user takes in the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the privacy settings associated with the privacy controls database  may be provided and stored at different levels of granularity. In particular embodiments, for example, the information to be shared may be specific information, such as, work phone number, or a set of related information, such as, personal information including several pieces of related information including profile photo, home phone number, and status. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the privacy settings associated with the privacy controls database  may apply to all the information associated with the user in the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the specification of the set of entities that may access particular user information may also be specified at various levels of granularity. In particular embodiments, the user may specify any number of entities with which information may be shared. In particular embodiments, sets of entities with which information may be shared may include, for example, specified friends of the user, all friends of the user, all friends of friends, all applications, and all external systems. In particular embodiments, for example, the user may provide a list of external systems that may access certain information as well.","In particular embodiments, may specify a set of entities that includes exceptions that are not allowed to access the user's information. In particular embodiments, for example, the user of the social networking system may allow all external systems to access the user's work information but specify a list of external systems that are not allowed to access the work information. In particular embodiments, the list of exceptions that are not allowed to access certain information of the user may be a \u201cblock list.\u201d In particular embodiments, external systems belonging to a block list specified by a user of the social networking system are blocked from accessing the information specified in the privacy setting stored in privacy controls database . Particular embodiments contemplate various combinations of granularity of permitted access or denial of access depending on the type of user information and sets of entities with which information may be shared or accessed by the sets of entities, as specified by the user and stored in the privacy controls database .","In particular embodiments, the authorization server  enforces the privacy settings of the users of the social networking system, such as described above with respect to the privacy policy. In particular embodiments, the privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user may be shared. In particular embodiments, as described above, the privacy controls database  comprises the privacy data for a user's settings for each user datum associated with the user and the user's settings for third party applications. More specifically, the privacy data for a user's settings may specify particular information associated with a user and the entity or entities with whom the information may be shared. In particular embodiments, the entities with which information may be shared, may include users, third party applications, external websites, or any other entity that can potentially access the information. In particular embodiments, the information that may be shared by a user may comprise any aspect of the user profile, events, locations, media, activities, or the news feed associated with the user.","Search Results Modification","Typically, a web browser is used to access a webpage (or other structured document) for rendering at a client device. A web browser application is generally a computer program configured to run on a user's computing device (e.g., client device ) that enables the user to connect to various server-hosted webpages available over a network. A non-exhaustive set of common web browsers include, by way of example, Internet Explorer\u2122, Firefox\u2122, Safari\u2122, and Opera\u2122. The web browser provides a standard viewing window that displays the informational and visual content of the webpage or website (the term \u201cwebsite\u201d and \u201cwebpage\u201d may be used interchangeably herein where appropriate). In particular embodiments, the browser processes the structured document and creates an in-memory representation of the document. The representation may be a Document Object Model (DOM) representation of the webpage. The web browser then renders the page in the particular client viewing window of the browser utilizing the DOM (or other suitable) representation.","A search engine is a computer-implemented tool designed to search for information relevant to specific subject matters or topics on a network, such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, or an Intranet. To conduct a search, a network user may issue a search query to the search engine. The search query generally contains one or more words that describe a subject or concept. In response, the search engine may identify one or more network resources that are likely to be related to the search query, which may collectively be referred to as a \u201csearch result\u201d identified for the search query. The network resources are usually ranked and presented to the network user according to their respective degrees of relevance to the search query.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Particular embodiments access, at a client device, a set of search results embodied in a structured document loaded into a client application (such as a browser client), wherein the search results correspond to a search query of the first user, as illustrated in step . Sophisticated search engines implement many other functionalities in addition to identifying relevant network resources as a part of the search process. For example, a search engine usually ranks the network resources identified for a search query according to their relative degrees of relevance with respect to the search query, such that the network resources that are relatively more relevant to the search query are ranked higher and are presented to the network user before the network resources that are relatively less relevant to the search query. The search engine may also provide a short summary of each of the identified network resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","330","340","350","300","300"]},"As illustrated in search result  in , network resources , , , ,  each includes a title, a short summary that briefly describes the respective network resource, and a clickable link in the form of a URL. In particular embodiments, for example, network resource  is a web page provided by WIKIPEDIA that contains information concerning George Washington. The URL of this particular web page is \u201cen.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_Washington.\u201d","Particular embodiments access a social networking system to determine if one or more second users having an association with the first user have accessed any of the search results, as illustrated in step . As described above, social graph information is maintained by a social networking system. In particular embodiments, associations between the first user and any one or more second users may be represented by one or more edges and nodes within the social graph. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension records click-stream activity for users that have accessed a structured document and transmits data representing click-stream activity to the social networking system . The social networking system  stores click-stream data in data store . In particular embodiments, the clickstream data is added to the social graph. In particular embodiments, data store  may store the URL of the structured document that a user has accessed, the userID of the user that has accessed the structured document, and a time stamp representing when the user accessed the structured document. In particular embodiments, for example, if any one of the one or more second users have accessed any of the search results , , , ,  of , there will be an edge (or other association) between the second user and the URL and stored within the social graph.","In particular embodiments, the social browser extension queries the social networking system and accesses the social graph data to determine if any second users have accessed any of the search results of the displayed structured document. In particular embodiments, the second user may be any one of the first user's first-degree (and possibly second-degree) contacts or associations. In particular embodiments, for example, the query transmitted by the social browser extension may include a userID, one or more URLs in the search results, and t, where t=T\u2212T (where T=Current Time and T=30 s, 1 min, 5 min, or any other particular interval of time to infinity). In particular embodiments, the query string for a URL may be the entirety of the URL for each of the search results, such as the scheme, host, and path. In particular embodiments, the query string for the URL for each of the search results may only be the scheme and host. In other embodiments, the query string may also include a partial path. In particular embodiments, t indicates a particular time in the past as a method of restricting the amount of click-stream data that is returned.","In particular embodiments, the social browser extension may also record search activity and transmit to the social networking system queries that have been submitted by users to the search engine and the URLs in the search results clicked on by the users. In particular embodiments, the social browser may record search activities by transmitting to the social networking system queries submitted by users at one of a plurality of search engines. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension may utilize the same query submitted by a user at a search engine and query the hybrid social graph for the URLs selected by users within the search results. In particular embodiments, the social browser may insert search results that other search engines identified into the query of the hybrid social graph. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may also return to the social browser extension related queries to the instant query for display.","Particular embodiments display search results that have the most social relevance to the user. In particular embodiments, search results from the hybrid social graph may be displayed in a sidebar or overlay of a search results contained in a structured document. In particular embodiments, for example, the social browser extension may augment the search results returned by a search engine and displayed within a current page with results retrieved by accessing the social graph and surfacing any open graph action taken on or off the social networking system. More specifically, open graph actions may be surfaced, such as check-in, like, read, recommend, review, comment, or any other open graph action. In particular embodiments, for example, if a first user enters a search query for \u201cMexican Food Palo Alto,\u201d a restaurant, such as \u201cPalo Alto Sol\u201d may be returned in the search results if any friends of the first user have checked-in there. In other particular embodiments, the search results may be filtered according to the various edge types discussed above, such as by like, recommend, friend, review, comment, and the like.","Particular embodiments may display in the search results recommendations that have been made by one or more second users. In particular embodiments, one or more second users may recommend a link, article, website, or specific location to a particular first user. In particular embodiments, when a first user enters a search query that is related to the recommendation that was made by the one or more second users, the recommendation may be displayed in the search query results as well.","Particular embodiments may visually distinguish in a user interface of the client application each of the one or more search results that have been accessed by one or more second users, as illustrated in step . In particular embodiments, the social browser extension modifies the page to indicate which contacts have viewed or accessed which search results. In particular embodiments, modifications may be, but not by way of limitation, displaying profile pictures of second users that have interacted with the search results when the first user mouses-over a link to the search result, and\/or changing the color, font-type, size, or style of the displayed object, etc.","In particular embodiments, in order to modify the structured document containing the search results, the application accesses the DOM (or other suitable) representation of the currently rendered structured document generated by the web browser. In particular embodiments, the application may modify, or cause to be modified the DOM representation of the results webpage (without necessarily modifying the native HTML or other markup language cone or content transmitted to the browser for rendering the target webpage (which is generally stored separately)) to indicate that the objects within the structured document have been accessed by one or more second users.

In particular embodiments, the search results may be reordered according to a popularity ranking based on each of the one or more search results that have been accessed by one or more second users having a connection with the first user. In particular embodiments, for example, the search results may be re-ranked based on a degree of affinity between the first user and the other second users so that a search result that had been accessed by a close friend may be up-ranked more than if the search result had been accessed by a more distant associate of the user. In particular embodiments, the reordering or re-ranking of the network resources with respect to the social network data may be determined by a ranking algorithm implemented by the browser or plug-in in addition to the regular search algorithm of the search engine. Given a search query and a set of network resources identified in response to the search query, the social networking ranking algorithm ranks the network resources in the set according to their relative degrees of relevance with respect to the whether the search results have been accessed by one or more second users having a connection with the first user. In particular embodiments, the popularity ranking may be based on a number of times each of the one or more second users have generated an edge for the search result. In particular embodiments, the edge comprises one or more of a number of times viewed, a number of times liked, or a number of times the search results was posted to the social networking system.","In particular embodiments, the popularity ranking may be based on first user's coefficient to the one or more second users that have interacted with the search results. More specifically, in particular embodiments where one or more second users have explicitly indicated one or more web pages or other interactions for a specific first user, the search results displayed for a first user may be affected by those explicit indications. In particular embodiments, for example, if a second user has liked a page and indicated that a first user would also like that page, then the liked page may show up in the search results list of the first user. Additional filtering and ordering capability is described in U.S. application Ser.
