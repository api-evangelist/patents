title: Identification and measurement of social influence and correlation
abstract: Techniques for detecting social influence between users in a set of users with regard to an activity are provided. Data for each user of the set of users is received that includes a time value at which the user became active with regard to the activity, and includes at least one indication of another user in the set of users associated with the user. A first estimate of social correlation in the set of users is determined based on the data. The data is modified. For instance, the data may be modified according to a shuffle test and/or an edge reversal test. A second estimate of social correlation in the set of users is determined based on the modified data. The first estimate is compared to the second estimate to determine a degree of social influence in the set of users.

Background","Social networking services and systems exist on the World Wide Web that are intended to build online social networks for communities of people having common interests and\/or activities, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others. Such systems provide various ways for users to interact, including blogging, discussion groups, email, file sharing, instant messaging, online chat, video, voice chat, etc. Social networking systems such as MySpace.com\u2122 and Facebook\u2122 enable users to create self-description pages (also referred to as a \u201cprofile page\u201d), and enable the users to link their pages with pages of friends.","In many such online social systems, social ties between users play an important role in dictating their behavior. One of the ways this can happen is through social influence. According to social influence, the actions of a user can induce his\/her friends to behave in a similar way. In social systems where social influence may be exerted, ideas, modes of behavior, new technologies, and\/or further concepts can be diffused through the social network by the users. As such, understanding how social influence is manifested within a social network may be leveraged by entities that desire to market products and services to users in the social network.","However, detecting social influence in a social network is a difficult task because it is difficult to distinguish the effects of social influence from other factors that may be present. Examples of such other factors include homophily, where individuals tend to befriend others who are similar to them and thus perform similar actions, or further unobserved confounding variables that can induce a statistical correlation between the actions of friends in a social network. Distinguishing social influence from such factors is similar to the problem of distinguishing correlation from causality, which is a notoriously difficult statistical problem.","Techniques are provided for detecting social influence between users in social networks with regard to particular actions\/activities in the social networks. Social influence may be detected based on data associated with the social network, such as data indicating relationships\/associations within the social network, as well as time stamps indicating times that users in the social network become active with respect to the activity. The social network data may be analyzed to determine a first estimate of social correlation. The social network data may be modified, such as by modifying the indicated relationships\/associations and\/or the time stamps. A second estimate of social correlation may be generated based on the modified social network data, and the first and second estimates may be compared to detect whether social influence is present. A particular level or degree of the social influence present in the social network with regard to the activity may optionally be determined.","In one implementation, a method for detecting social influence between users in a set of users with regard to an activity is provided. Data for each user of the set of users is received that includes a time value at which the user became active with regard to the activity, and includes at least one indication of another user in the set of users associated with the user. A first estimate of social correlation in the set of users is determined based on the data. The data is modified. For instance, the data may be modified according to a shuffle test and\/or an edge reversal test. A second estimate of social correlation in the set of users is determined based on the modified data. The first estimate is compared to the second estimate to determine a degree of social influence in the set of users.","In another implementation, a system for detecting social influence between users in a set of users with regard to an activity is provided. The system includes a social correlation determiner, a data modifier, and a social correlation comparator. The social correlation determiner receives data for each user of the set of users that includes a time value at which the user became active with regard to the activity, and includes at least one indication of another user in the set of users associated with the user. The social correlation determiner is configured to determine a first estimate of social correlation in the set of users based on the data. The data modifier is configured to modify the data. The social correlation determiner is configured to receive the modified data, and to determine a second estimate of social correlation in the set of users based on the modified data. The social correlation comparator is configured to compare the first estimate to the second estimate to determine a degree of social influence in the set of users.","In one aspect, the social correlation determiner may include an active user determiner, an inactive user determiner, and a logistic regression estimator. The active user determiner is configured to determine a first number of users Yof the set of users for each time t of a plurality of times t that each had a number of c associated active users at time t and that became active at time t. The inactive user determiner is configured to determine a first number of users Nof the set of users for each time t of the plurality of times t that each were inactive at time t, had a number of c associated active users at time t, and did not become active at time t. The logistic regression estimator is configured to generate a first estimate of a coefficient \u03b1 using a maximum likelihood logistic regression based on the determined first number of users Yand the determined first number of users N. The coefficient \u03b1 indicates a degree of social correlation in the set of users. The active user determiner is configured to determine a second number of users Yof the set of users for each time t of the plurality of times t based on the modified data. The inactive user determiner is configured to determine a second number of users Nof the set of users for each time t of the plurality of times t based on the modified data. The logical regression estimator is configured to generate a second estimate of the coefficient \u03b1 using the maximum likelihood logistic regression based on the determined second number of users Yand the determined second number of users N. The social correlation comparator is configured to compare the first estimate of the coefficient \u03b1 to the second estimate of the coefficient \u03b1 to determine the degree of social influence.","In a further aspect, the logical regression estimator may include a first summer, a second summer, and an expression maximizer. The first summer, the second summer, and the expression maximizer are configured to process the unmodified data to generate the first estimate, and to process the modified data to generate the second estimate. In each case, the first summer is configured to calculate Yfor each value of c, where",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"t"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"Y","mrow":{"mi":["c","t"],"mo":","}},"mo":"."}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["N","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"t"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"N","mrow":{"mi":["c","t"],"mo":","}},"mo":"."}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2009","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u220f","mi":"c"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"c"}},"msub":{"mi":["Y","c"]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"c"}}}},"msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"where","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"c"}}}}},{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}},"mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"\u2009","mn":"1"},"mo":"+","msup":{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b1","ln"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}},"mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"="}}}},"In another aspect, the data modifier may include a time value shuffle module configured to shuffle time values in the data between users of the set of users.

The computer program products include a computer-readable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon for enabling social influence to be detected between users in a set of users with regard to an activity, as well as enabling further embodiments.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is noted that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. Such embodiments are presented herein for illustrative purposes only.

In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the corresponding reference number.","The present specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate the features of the invention. The disclosed embodiment(s) merely exemplify the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s). The invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.","References in the specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d \u201can example embodiment,\u201d etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to implement such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.","Online social systems play an ever-important role in shaping the behavior of users on the World Wide Web (\u201cthe Web\u201d). Currently popular social websites such as Facebook\u2122 (social networking), MySpace\u2122 (social networking), Flickr\u00ae (photo\/video sharing), and Del.icio.us\u2122 (social bookmarking), are receiving increasingly greater amounts of user traffic and are turning into community spaces, where users interact with their friends and acquaintances. Such social systems may track the interactions between their users, including tracking which users are indicated as associated with each other (e.g., as \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cfollowers,\u201d etc.), tracking interactions of the users with content, etc. The availability of tracking data for social interactions at never-before available scales enables user actions to be analyzed at an individual level in order to understand user behavior. A user's actions in the context of his\/her online associates may be analyzed, including the correlating of the actions of socially connected users. For example, the membership problem has been studied in an online community, where a correlation between the action of a user joining an online community and the number of friends who are already members of that community was observed (see Backstrom et al., \u201cGroup Formation in Large Social Networks: Membership, Growth, and Evolution,\u201d 12th KDD, Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2006, pages 44-54). In another example, the tag usage problem in Flickr\u2122 was considered, and the set of tags placed by a user and those placed by the friends of the user were studied, showing a correlation between social connectivity and tag vocabulary (see Marlow et al., \u201cHT06, tagging paper, taxonomy, Flickr, academic article, to read,\u201d in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia (New York: ACM Press), 2006, pages 31-40).","While such studies have established the existence of correlation between user actions and social affiliations, they do not address the source of the correlation. Causes of correlation in social networks can be categorized into roughly three types. The first cause is social influence (also known as induction), where the action of a user is triggered by one of his\/her friend's recent actions. An example of social influence is when a user buys a product because one of his\/her friends has recently bought the same product. The second cause is homophily, where persons tend to befriend other persons who are similar to them, and hence perform similar actions. In an example of homophily, a first pair of individuals that each own a Microsoft\u00ae Xbox\u00ae video game system are more likely to become friends due to the common interest, as compared to a second pair of individuals, where one or both of the individuals does not own a Microsoft\u00ae Xbox\u00ae video game system. The third cause is environment (also known as confounding factors or external influence), where external factors are correlated both with the event that two individuals become friends and also with their actions. In an example of confounding factors, two friends are likely to live in the same city, and therefore may be likely to post pictures of the same landmarks in an online photo sharing system.","The ability to identify situations where social influence is a source of correlation is important. In the presence of social influence, an idea, a norm of behavior, a product, or other entity or concept diffuses through the social network in a similar fashion as an epidemic. A marketing firm, for example, may desire to use social influence information to design viral marketing campaigns or to provide coupons to influential nodes in a social network, or a system designer may take advantage of such information in order to induce users to follow a desired mode of behavior. There has already been significant research on methods for designing strategies to leverage social influence in such systems (see D. Kempe et al., \u201cMaximizing the Spread of Influence Through a Social Network,\u201d 9th KDD, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2003, pages 137-146) and on the effect of influence on the growth pattern of new products (see P. Young, \u201cThe Diffusion of Innovations in Social Networks,\u201d in L. E. Blume and S. N. Durlauf, editors, The Economy as a Complex Evolving System, Volume III. Oxford University Press, 2003). A core idea in viral marketing strategies is that in cases where social influence between users is prevalent, careful targeting can have a cascading effect on the adoption of a product\/technology. Therefore, being able to identify in which cases social influence prevails is an important step to marketing strategy design.","Because social influence is important, it is desired to be enabled to test whether a given social system exhibits signs of social influence. This is a particularly difficult problem in online settings where individuals are often anonymous and therefore it is difficult, if not impossible, to control for all potential confounding factors. In embodiments, the availability of data about the timing of actions that occur in online settings is leveraged to enable the presence of social influence to be determined by correlation.","Embodiments described herein enable the detection of social influence in social networks. For instance, in one embodiment, a statistical test, which may be referred to as \u201cthe shuffle test,\u201d is used to determine social influence. The shuffle test is based on the concept that if social influence is not a likely source of correlation in a social network, the timing of actions occurring in a social network do not matter, and therefore reshuffling time stamps of actions occurring in the social network does not significantly change the amount of correlation. Thus, with respect to the shuffle test, actions in a social network are analyzed in a non-time shuffled manner and are analyzed in a time-shuffled manner, and the non-time shuffled analysis results and time-shuffled analysis results are compared to determine whether social influence is present in the social network.","In another embodiment, another test (which may be referred to as \u201cthe edge-reversal test\u201d) is used to determine the presence of social influence. The edge reversal test is based on the concept that if social influence is not a likely source of correlation in a social network, the spreading of actions through the social network will not depend on the direction of associations (e.g., \u201cfriend\u201d relationships and\/or other association types) between users in the social network. Because forms of social correlation other than social influence are based on associated users (e.g., \u201cfriends\u201d) often sharing common characteristics or being affected by the same external variables, and are independent of which of these two users has indicated the other as associated, reversing the edges in the social network does not change the estimate of social correlation significantly. In contrast, social influence does spread in the direction specified by the associations indicated in the social network. Thus, according to the edge reversal test, directions of the edges (associations) between users in the social network are reversed (to form a \u201creverse graph\u201d), and actions in the reversed social network are analyzed. The reversed analysis results and non-reversed analysis results are compared to determine whether social influence is present in the social network.","In embodiments of the present invention, social correlation is modeled within social systems. In one example, a set of users (also called agents or persons) may be indicated as nodes of a social network. For example,  shows a block diagram of a social network  represented as a directed graph \u201cG\u201d. Social network  includes users -(indicated as circular nodes in ), for illustrative purposes. In social network , users  are associated with each other in one-way associations (e.g., as between users and ) and in two-way interactions (e.g., as between users and ). For example, in a social network where users may designate \u201cfriends\u201d as associations, user may indicate user as a friend (as indicated by association indicator directed from user to user ) as well as users and . An association list, such as a friends list, may be maintained for each user  in social network , including an association list for user that lists users , , and as friends of user , an association list for user that lists user as a friend of user , an association list for user that lists users and as friends of user , etc. Because an association indicator is not present in social network  directed from user to user , user does not indicate user as a friend (e.g., user is not listed in an association list of user ).","Social network  enables actions or activities by users  to be tracked, which can be used to determine social correlation. In an embodiment, performance of a particular action or activity for the first time, such as the purchasing of a product, visiting a web-page, tagging a photo with a particular tag, or any other action(s)\/activity(s) is tracked for users . After a particular user  performs the action, the user is considered to have become active (with respect to the action). Social network  may be observed over a particular period of time (e.g., a time period [0; T]) to track times at which particular users  become active. \u201cW\u201d may be used to denote the set of users  that are active at the end of the time period.","Social correlation may be present in social network  for first and second users  that are adjacent in directed graph G, where the events that become active with respect to the first user  are correlated with the events becoming active with respect to the second user . For example, as described above,  shows social network , which includes users -. Referring to , a user may be considered to be active (e.g., as indicated in  by shading) with respect to a particular activity. For example, user may have viewed a particular video on a video sharing website. Associates (e.g., \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201cfollowers,\u201d etc.) of user may also view the video. For example,  shows social network , where users and , which are associated with user (e.g., users and have indicated user as a \u201cfriend,\u201d as indicated by association indicators  directed from users and to user ) have also viewed the video (as indicated by shading in ). Users and may have been influenced by user to view the video, or other factors may have led to users and viewing the video. As described above, there are at least three explanations for social correlation: homophily, the environment (or confounding factors), and social influence. These factors are described as follows.","Homophily: Homophily is the tendency of individuals to choose friends with similar characteristics. This is a pervasive phenomenon, and may lead to correlation between the actions of adjacent users  in social network . One example hypothesis for why there is social correlation in membership in an online community is that the users might know each other and become friends after joining the community. Mathematically, in a pure homophily model, the set W of active users  is first selected according to some distribution, and then the graph G is picked from a distribution that depends on W. Thus, in , users and may have viewed the video viewed by user because they have similar characteristics with user ","Confounding factors: The second explanation for correlation between actions of adjacent users  in social network  is external influence from elements in the environment (also referred to as confounding factors), which are more likely to affect users  that are physically located close to each other in social network . Mathematically, this means that there is a confounding variable X, and both the graph G and the set of active users W come from distributions correlated with X. For example, two individuals who live in the same city are more likely to become friends than two random individuals, and they are also more likely to take pictures of similar scenery and post them on an image sharing website using the same tag (e.g., a descriptive label). Thus, in , users and may have viewed the video viewed by user because they are located closely to user , and the video may have covered an object in their local vicinity.","Note that there is a fine distinction between confounding factors and homophily. Homophily refers to situations where the set of active users W affects individuals' choices to become friends, while in confounding factors, both the choices of individuals to become friends and their choice to become active are affected by the same unobserved variable. It is possible to distinguish between these models by analyzing the time where the edges (association indicators ) of G are established.","Social influence: As described above, social influence refers to the phenomenon that the action of individuals can induce their associations (e.g., friends, etc.) to act in a similar way. For example, a first friend may set an example for a second friend (e.g., as in the case of fashion), may inform the second friend about an action (e.g., as in viral marketing), or may increase the value of an action for the second friend (e.g., as in the case of adoption of a communication technology such as facsimile). Thus, in , users and may have viewed the video viewed by user because they were influenced by user (e.g., user may have recommended the video to users and ).","In an embodiment, social influence can be modeled as follows: a social network graph G may be generated according to a particular distribution. Then, in each of the time steps 1, . . . , T, each non-active user may or may not become active. The probability of becoming active for each user u may be a function p(x) of the number x of other users v that have an edge to user u and are already active. In embodiments, p(x) can be any increasing function, including the logistic regression, as is used for illustrative purposes herein.","In this subsection, example embodiments are described for measuring social correlation and testing whether social influence is a source of such social correlation. For instance,  shows a block diagram of a social influence detector system , according to an example embodiment. Social influence detector system  is configured to determine whether social influence is present with regard to a particular action or activity within a network of associated persons, referred to herein as a social network. In one embodiment, social influence detector system  may be configured to indicate whether or not social influence is present in the social network with regard to the activity. In another embodiment, social influence detector system  may be configured to indicate a particular level or degree of social influence present in the social network with regard to the activity.","As shown in , social influence detector system  receives social network data . Social network data  is data with regard to the activity of users in a social network, such as social network  of . Social network data  may indicate associations between users in the social network (e.g., \u201cfriends lists,\u201d \u201cfollowers\/following lists,\u201d etc.), including directions of the associations (e.g., whether a first user is indicated as a friend of a second user and\/or whether the second user indicates the first user as a friend), and may further include information regarding activities occurring in social network, including time values\/time stamps indicating times at which various users in the social network perform a particular activity. Social influence detector system  processes social network data  to determine whether social influence is detected in the social network. As shown in , social influence detector system  generates a social influence indication , which indicates whether social influence is detected in the social network, and may indicate a degree of social influence detected to be present.","Social influence detector system  may detect social influence in a social network in various ways. For instance,  shows a flowchart  for detecting social influence, according to example embodiments. In an embodiment, social influence detector system  may perform flowchart . Further structural and operational embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the discussion regarding flowchart . For instance,  shows a block diagram of social influence detector system , according to an example embodiment. As shown in , social influence detector system  includes a data modifier , a social correlation determiner , and a social correlation comparator . Flowchart  is described as follows with reference to social influence detector system  of , for illustrative purposes.","Flowchart  begins with step . In step , data for each user of the set of users is received that includes a time value at which the user became active with regard to the activity, and includes at least one indication of another user in the set of users associated with the user. For example, as shown in , social influence detector system  receives social network data . Social network data  may include data for each user of a social network. The data for each user may include a time value indicating a time at which the user became active with respect to the activity of interest. Furthermore, the data for each user may include a list of other users in the social network that are associated (e.g., as \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cfollower,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d etc.) with the user (and may indicate the type of association as \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cfollower,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d etc.).","For example, referring to , social network data  may include data for each of users -. For user , social network data  may indicate users , , and as friends of user , and may indicate that at time t=0, user became active with regard to viewing a particular online video. For user , social network data  may indicate users , , and as friends of user , and may indicate that at time t=1, user became active with regard to viewing the particular online video.","Note that the social network may track\/record such data in any manner. For example, social network  may maintain a \u201cfriends\u201d or other type of list for each user  in a similar manner as social networks such as Facebook\u2122, MySpace\u2122 Twitter\u00ae (a \u201cfollowers\u201d list), etc. Furthermore, the social network may track\/record web page clicks, link clicks, files accessed, images viewed, videos played, items purchased, etc., for each user in any suitable manner as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).","In step , a first estimate of social correlation is determined based on the data. For example, in an embodiment, social correlation determiner  in  may be configured to generate a first estimate of social correlation based on social network data . As shown in , social correlation determiner  generates a first estimate .","In step , the data is modified. For example, in an embodiment, data modifier  may perform step  by receiving and modifying social network data  to generate modified social network data . As described in further detail below, data modifier  may be configured to modify social network data  in various ways, including shuffling time values between the users of the social network that indicate when each user became active with respect to the activity, reversing the directions of each association in the network, etc.","In step , a second estimate of social correlation is determined based on the modified data. For example, in an embodiment, social correlation determiner  in  may be configured to generate a second estimate of social correlation based on modified social network data . As shown in , social correlation determiner  generates a second estimate .","In step , the first estimate is compared to the second estimate to determine a presence of social influence. For example, in an embodiment, social correlation comparator  in  may be configured compare first estimate  to second estimate  to determine the presence of social influence. As shown in , social correlation comparator  generates social influence indication . For example, if first and second estimates  and  are relatively close together in value (e.g., the difference is less than a predetermined threshold value), social influence indication  may indicate that social influence was not detected (is not present). If first and second estimates  and  are relatively far apart in value (e.g., the difference is greater than a predetermined threshold value), social influence indication  may indicate that social influence was detected (is present). Furthermore, social correlation comparator  may indicate that degree of social influence detected proportional to the difference between first and second estimates  and  (e.g., a greater amount of social influence is present if the difference is relatively greater; a lesser amount of social influence is present if the difference is relatively less).","Further example embodiments for flowchart  and social influence detector system  are described in the following subsections.","In an embodiment, a measure of social correlation between the actions of a user and associated users in a social network is estimated, according to step  of flowchart  in . This measure is configured to recover the activation probability, assuming that users follow the social influence model described above. According to the social influence model, each user decides at each time step whether or not to become active.

If the edge reversal test was performed by data modifier  to generate modified social network data , active user determiner  and inactive user determiner  generate Yand Nbased on the reversed associations (e.g., reversed friend indications, etc.) described above. With respect to the example of network  and Table 1 shown above, active user determiner  and inactive user determiner  generate Yand Nfor users -based on the association lists resulting from the association indicator reversals of shown in .","As shown in , logistic regression estimator  receives the determined second number of users Yin second active user data  and the determined second number of users Nin inactive user data . Logistic regression estimator  is configured to generate a second value for the coefficient \u03b1, which is representative of social correlation based on second active user data  and second inactive user data . As described above, in an embodiment, logistic regression estimator  may be configured to generate the second value for coefficient \u03b1 using maximum likelihood logistic regression, although in other embodiments, logistic regression estimator  may generate the second value for coefficient \u03b1 using other techniques, as would be known to persons skilled in the relevant art(s). For example, logistic regression estimator  may be configured as shown in , and described above, to generate second estimate , and may operate according to flowchart  shown in , in an embodiment.","For instance, in an embodiment, second values for Yand Nmay be generated (e.g., by first and second summers  and , respectively; according to steps  and , respectively). In , first summer  may receive second active user data , and second summer  may receive second inactive user data , and may generate second values for first sum  (e.g., according to Equation 3) and second sum  (e.g., according to Equation 4), respectively, based thereon. Expression maximizer  may receive the second values for first sum  and second sum , and generate second estimate  based thereon (e.g., by generating second values for the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 that maximize Equation 5).","As described above, in step  of flowchart , the second estimate of social correlation generated in step  is compared to the first estimate of social correlation generated in step  to determine the presence of social influence. For example, as described above, in an embodiment, social correlation comparator  in  may be configured to compare first estimate  to second estimate  to determine the presence of social influence. As shown in , social correlation comparator  generates social influence indication .","Social correlation comparator  may be configured in various ways. For instance,  shows a block diagram of social correlation comparator , according to an example embodiment. As shown in , social correlation comparator  includes a subtractor  and a threshold comparator . Subtractor  is configured to determine a difference between first estimate  and second estimate  (e.g., to determine a difference between first and second determined values of the coefficient \u03b1). As shown in , subtractor  generates a difference value . Threshold comparator  is configured to compare difference value  to a predetermined threshold value to generate social influence indication . In an embodiment, social influence is determined to be present in the social network if difference value  is greater than the predetermined threshold value, or has other predetermined relation with the predetermined threshold value. For example, if first and second estimates  and  are relatively close together in value (e.g., the difference is less than a predetermined threshold value), social influence indication  may indicate that social influence was not detected (is not present). If first and second estimates  and  are relatively far apart in value (e.g., the difference is greater than a predetermined threshold value), social influence indication  may indicate that social influence was detected (is present). Any suitable predetermined threshold value may be used, depending on the particular application, including values such as 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, etc.","In another embodiment, threshold comparator  may not be present in social correlation comparator . In such an embodiment, subtractor  is configured to determine difference value  as a difference between first estimate  and second estimate , and difference value  may be output from social correlation comparator  (in a scaled or non-scaled form) as social influence indication . In such an embodiment, difference value  may indicate a degree of social influence in the social network, which is proportional to the difference value . For example, a greater amount of social influence may be present if difference value  is a relatively greater value. A lesser amount of social influence may be present if difference value  is a relatively lesser value.","Social influence detector system , data modifier , social correlation determiner , social correlation comparator , active user determiner , inactive user determiner , logistic regression estimator , first summer , second summer , expression maximizer , time value shuffle module , edge reversal module , subtractor , and threshold comparator  may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.
