No. 61\/163,620, filed Mar. 26, 2009, is incorporated herein by reference.","Priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/163,620, filed Mar. 26, 2009, is hereby claimed.","Not applicable","Not applicable","The present invention relates to cardiology and more particularly to a method of evaluating a heart patient wherein a computer has a database and a user interface connected thereto that includes a display screen.","Even more particularly, the present invention relates to a method of evaluating a heart patient that employs a computer and a display screen, the display screen having multiple images that are displayed to a user, each image being an anatomical representation of a portion of a human heart, wherein multiple of the images depict different portions of the human heart and the display screen simultaneously displays data next to one or more of the images, the data being specific to the patient in the display data relating to at least one of the portions of the human heart that is represented by the display.","Currently, the practice of cardiology in the United States uses disparate modalities and systems for documentation. This includes for example handwritten notes, scanned images, document management systems, and fully integrated electronic medical systems.","The current state of the practice of cardiology includes: (1) Era of increasing demand; (2) Time constraints; (3) More complex procedures; (4) Increased imaging requirements; (5) Decrease allotted time per patient visit; and (6) Decreased reimbursement. Cardiologists can average of 8-10 minutes per patient.","Traditionally, the practice of dictating and transcribing cardiology reports has been used by cardiologists. Cardiologists have been increasingly burdened by the need to quickly and accurately generate cardiology reports after reviewing the results of heart studies.","Additionally, cardiologists must fill out forms for submission to insurance companies and provide information to regulatory agencies. To gather and produce all of this information, cardiologists must spend a significant portion of their work day dictating the needed information. Additionally, cardiologists must maintain a staff to transcribe the information into reports and to fill out required forms.","A cardiologists typically dictates a report reviewing the results of a heart study, which, subsequently, must be typed by a transcriber. This process is time consuming and repetitive. Using traditional manual methods of record keeping, patient data is not readily available for fast and easy review. A patient's medical record cannot be easily combined with other studies and\/or reports, and\/or other patient data for analysis and reporting.","There is a need to automate the report generation process to free up more time in the practice of cardiologists.","One embodiment provides an integrated software solution for cardiac procedures encompassing reporting, storing, data mining, retrieving and online analysis. For example, the method of the present invention enables capture of predefined data elements and cardiac testing modalities.","In one embodiment the method and apparatus automates the report generation process by providing a graphical user interface incorporating a relational database with user selectable reporting components in a graphical environment.","In one embodiment is provided a method of clinical evaluation of a cardiology patient. The method includes the providing of a computer having a database. A user interface is provided which is connected to the computer and which includes a display screen. As part of the method, one or more images are displayed on the display screen which are anatomical representations, each of a different portion of a human heart.","In one embodiment the display can include patient data that is displayed on the display screen. In one embodiment the patient data relates specifically to the anatomical representation of the portion of the human heart that is being viewed on the display screen.","In one embodiment, multiple images can be displayed as optional parts of the human heart. In one embodiment one or more of those optional portions can be selectively enlarged for more easy inspection by a physician or other operator.","In one embodiment, the method includes entering data that relates specifically to the displayed image.","In one embodiment the method can include an interpreting cardiologist reviewing the data as part of a medical evaluation of a patient.","In one embodiment, the multiple images can include images of human heart chambers.","In one embodiment, the data displayed includes test results.","In one embodiment, multiple images are displayed on the display screen including multiple small images simultaneously displayed, each small image depicting a different part of the human heart.","In one embodiment, multiple images are displayed on the display screen, and wherein some of the images displayed are smaller images and wherein one or more of the displayed images is a larger image.","In one embodiment, a physician or operator can selectively enlarge one image or another image and by switching (e.g. clicking with computer mouse, touch screen) from one small image to another. The enlarged image selection generates data on the display screen that corresponds to the selected and enlarged image.","In one embodiment, a physician or operator can change from one image displayed to another image displayed without typing on a keyboard.","In one embodiment the method and apparatus provides a graphical display where a user has access to a first plurality of reporting segments.","In one embodiment the plurality of reporting segments are a plurality of geographical portions of a human organ. In one embodiment the segments can be portions of a human heart.","In one embodiment, the multiple anatomical images\/views of the human heart can be displayed including: parasternal long axis view, short axis of left ventricle view, short axis view at the level of the aortic valve, apical two chamber view, and four chamber view.","In one embodiment the average time from review of the testing results to generation of a report by the cardiologist is less than 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 minutes. In various embodiments the average time is between about any to the above specified time limits. In one embodiment the cardiologist generates more than 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 cardiology reports a day. In various embodiments the number of reports generated varies between about any to the above specified daily number of reports.","In various embodiments the report generation method and apparatus incorporates previously defined reporting text strings or components, and includes a graphical user interface for selecting phrases to be inserted in the template. Preferably, the system will further comprise a graphics engine for display of graphical expressions of selection analysis.","For instance, a heart study can be conducted which will contain many basic elements common to all patients, but examination data will vary for each patient. Examination data can contain any number of variable responses, and each variable within the input can offer any number of different options from which to choose. In addition, cardiologists can personalize the report to suit a particular situation.","In one embodiment the examination and\/or report input is electronically stored for possible future use in data mining, reporting, and\/or analysis.","One embodiment enables a report on a cardiology study to be generated from a single graphical input screen. In one embodiment is provided a graphical input display having images of various views of the human heart for data entry.","In one embodiment report text is generated by making selections on a graphical input screen. In one embodiment a set of a plurality of suggested cardiology report data string conclusions is indexed to possible selections made on the graphical input screen. In one embodiment a plurality of the suggested conclusions for the cardiology report based on input by cardiologist automatically show up based on the graphical selections made by the user of the method and apparatus.","One embodiment provides an interface with existing cardiology testing devices.
