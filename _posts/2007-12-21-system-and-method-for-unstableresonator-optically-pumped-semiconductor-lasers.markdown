For each such described embodiment, the present invention includes other embodiments wherein the laser gain medium is solid state but not semiconductor, or wherein the laser gain medium is electrically pumped and forms an electrically pumped semiconductor laser, but wherein the thermal lensing and the compensation for thermal lensing (e.g., iteratively changing the width of the pump stripe) are modeled and\/or iteratively determined in a manner similar to the described embodiments.","A number of other embodiments of the present invention embody and describe the laser as an optically pumped solid-state laser (OPSSL), which is a generic term that includes both optically pumped semiconductor lasers (OPSLs) and other embodiments wherein the laser gain medium is solid state but not semiconductor.

In unstable resonators, there are no ray paths which will not eventually \u201cwalk out\u201d of the cavity.

In some embodiments, system  is affixed (e.g., soldered) into a temperature-controlled enclosure (sometimes called an \u201coven\u201d although some embodiments use only a controlled cooler; e.g., some embodiments are operated close to liquid-nitrogen temperatures, i.e., around 77 K) whose internal temperature and temperature profile (i.e., the absolute temperature and the temperature differentials) are tightly controlled (e.g., by a controller that monitors one or more temperatures in the temperature-controlled enclosure and controls the amounts and\/or locations of heating and\/or cooling that are applied), in order to maintain more-constant lasing wavelength and output power, and to reduce mode hopping. In some embodiments, a plurality of temperature sensors monitor temperatures and various locations within the temperature-controlled enclosure of system  and feed temperature signals to controller , which in turn controls a plurality of cooling and\/or heating elements (e.g., Stirling-cycle coolers, Peltier-effect heater-coolers, and\/or the like) in order to maintain a tightly controlled profile of absolute temperatures and\/or temperature differentials.","In some embodiments, the mask\/heatsink portions  and  form a slit  between them that defines where the light goes (called the \u201cpump stripe\u201d herein) onto and into the lasing medium, and thus the thermal profile that causes the thermal lensing. The thermal lensing is a cause of the laser establishing lasing stability. One purpose of the present invention is to change the width of the pump stripe and or the curvature of one or more of the feedback mirrors on the end(s) of the lasing medium, in order to compensate for the thermal lensing, and thus establish good beam quality and single-mode lasing (e.g., by maintaining lasing instability through thermal-lensing compensation).","According to an embodiment by Ron Kaspi, the present invention is modified such that rather than using a constant-width pump stripe having parallel edges along the length of the signal path in the gain medium as described for the other embodiments of the invention, the width of the slit and\/or pump stripe varies along its length in a manner that is iteratively derived by modeling and testing prototype laser devices. For example, in some such embodiments, one could taper the stripe such that, as measured in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beam, the middle of the stripe is made wider than the ends, and the amount or rate of widening is iteratively increased until a desired amount of instability is achieved. In other such embodiments, one could taper the stripe such that, as measured in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beam, the middle of the stripe is made narrower than the ends, and the amount of narrowing is iteratively changed until a desired amount of instability is achieved. In still other such embodiments, one could taper the stripe such that, as measured in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beam, one end of the stripe is made narrower than the other end, and the amount of narrowing is iteratively changed until a desired amount of instability is achieved. The approaches disclosed here can still be used to guide the design even for these cases with non-rectangular pump stripes, for instance tapered or hour-glass shaped pump stripes. In these cases, an average stripe width (averaged over the length of the pumped region) can be calculated and used in the formulas of the present invention where the width of the pump stripe is called for.","In some embodiments, the tops of mask portions  and  are coated with a multi-layer dielectric mirror in order to minimize heat absorption in those portions on the gain medium that prevent pump light from entering the gain medium towards the outer edges. In some embodiments, the modeling includes the temperature effect of the light that strikes the mask on the gain medium and is absorbed there, such that the thermal profile prediction from the model includes the effect of light being partially absorbed by the mask, and in some embodiments, the absorptive qualities of the mask are adjusted up or down to achieve a particular profile. In some embodiments, the active gain region (e.g., a multiple-quantum-well (MQW) layered structure ) is located towards the bottom heatsink , so it can be more effectively cooled by conduction to the heatsink  (since then the heat dissipated from structure  does not have to pass through the somewhat thermally resistive material ). This is commonly referred to as an \u201cepi-down\u201d configuration. In some embodiments, a plurality of temperature sensors (e.g., thermistors) are embedded (e.g., in holes in a Cartesian grid pattern) within heatsink , in order to closely monitor the temperature profile of the OPSL gain medium in the epi-down configuration (locating temperature sensors in heatsink  can also be used to monitor the temperature profile of the OPSL gain medium in the epi-up configuration shown in , but may have a slower response time due to the lag in heat flow through that gain medium). In some embodiments, the devices of the present invention are cooled to the maximum extent practible (e.g., by liquid nitrogen, in some embodiments).","In some embodiments, the stripe width is primarily or even entirely established by focussing optics and\/or one or more apertures in the pump-light path between the pump source and the OPSL, and the mask sections  and  are omitted or play a secondary role in establishing the stripe width. In some such embodiments, the stripe width is varied dynamically and\/or iteratively using the focussing optics between the pump source and the OPSL. In some embodiments, controller  dynamically controls the focussing and\/or aperture size based on monitoring signals from temperature sensors and\/or beam-quality sensors.","Some embodiments of this method of the present invention use only focussing elements and allow more of the pump light to be used, since rather than using a mask on the OPSL chip or an aperture between the pump source and the OPSL, both of which block or reflect pump light to establish the stripe width and thus waste the light that falls outside of the desired stripe, the method uses focussing optics (e.g., a cylindrical lens) to establish the stripe width. In some such embodiments, and the width of the stripe is iteratively changed by moving the position(s) of the pump source, the OPSL chip, and\/or the focussing optics until a desired amount of instability and thus a good beam quality is achieved. In some such embodiments, a constant-width stripe is established (and its width then iteratively changed) by the focussing optics, while in other embodiments, different shapes (e.g., tapered or bow-tie shapes) for the pump stripe are formed by the focussing optics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["140","140","118","119","141"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["102","102","115","122","123","101","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["200","200","210","211","212","210","211","212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["201","201","222","223","224","225","211","212","250","250"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["202","202","217","250","216","250","202","245","242","243","244","211","212","250","250","202","232","233","234","235","211","212","250","250","245","217","233","234","235","233","234","235"]},"Quick Summary of the Thermal Lensing Analysis for OPSL's","A thermal gradient in the transverse temperature profile of a solid-state gain medium (e.g., one used for a laser) sets up a gradient in the transverse index-of-refraction profile (a \u201cthermal lens\u201d or \u201cduct\u201d).

The thermal gradient is affected by many factors, including pump power, pump-pulse duration, pump-stripe width, chip length, the material(s) conducting heat away from the immediate area of the pumped region, transverse pump profile, and the thermal efficiency of the OPSL. (In some embodiments, the curvature of the thermal profile depends upon the characteristics of all of the material through which heat flows from the rather tiny gain region and\/or the regions onto which pump light is projected. So, in some embodiments, one uses different material-thermal constants for the epi-up versus epi-down configurations.) In the end, for the Fabry-Perot cavity, the best improvement to beam quality comes from using a narrower pump stripe. Although the narrower pump stripe increases the thermal gradient \u0394T, it is more than compensated by the decrease in a. Unfortunately, decreasing a causes the overall device temperature to rise, which leads to a decrease in optical efficiency. So the narrower pump stripe is useful in terms of improving beam quality, but degrades overall system performance. \u0394T is smaller for the wider pump stripe, but the increase in the effective resonator aperture size a allows more transverse lasing modes to \u201cfit\u201d in the cavity, resulting in poorer beam quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sup":["2","2 ","2 ","2 ","2 ","2 "]},"From the formulas for Min the Fabry-Perot, we can see that there is no sharp break where a small change in stripe width makes a substantial change in beam quality.

(The thermal gradients produced by the pumping produce a positive thermal lens, making the flat-flat resonator stable.) The narrow pump stripe produced the best beam quality because the number of modes in the resonator scales as the area of the gain region, so to limit the number of higher-order modes, smaller pumped regions are favored. Still, as pump power was increased, the beam quality degraded rapidly.","To solve the beam quality at high power, the approach of using an unstable resonator was attempted. Unstable resonators are well-known solutions to produce good beam quality in many types of high-power lasers, including solid-state lasers. The unstable resonator is produced by replacing the flat high reflecting surface at the back of the laser cavity (the back surface of the semiconductor laser chip) with a curved external reflective surface, its convex side toward the gain material (or a mirrored facet formed in the gain material and having a concave surface). But it was discovered that although the unstable resonator produced good beam quality at low to moderate powers, at high pump power the beam quality degraded nevertheless. Attempts to improve the beam quality by using a narrower pump stripe were fruitless. Experts in the physics of optical semiconductor devices conjectured that the degraded beam quality was due to filamentation and other nonlinear and chaotic effects in the semiconductor material, and could not readily be compensated for.","The inventors of the present invention developed a thermo-optical model that explains the observations, and can be used as a design rule for improving beam quality at high powers in these types of OPSLs. At high pump powers, a very strong thermal lens is created in the lasing semiconductor material. This thermal lens can become so strong, that the positive thermal lens overwhelms the negative curvature of the back mirror in the laser cavity, and the resonator becomes stable. The stable resonator then supports many transverse modes, leading to poor beam quality. The key is to keep the (positive) optical power of the thermal lens from overwhelming the (negative) power of the end mirror in the cavity, so the resonator remains unstable. The strength of the thermal lens depends on the pumping conditions and the material thermal characteristics, so it is possible to define a quantitative design rule that will lead to a high-beam-quality, high-power OPSL.","Below is a derivation that shows the relationship of the various factors that determine the stability of the cavity, and therefore the limitations that will give good or bad beam quality. Briefly, the mathematical relation is based upon knowing the shape of the thermal distribution obtained for an infinitesimally narrow heated stripe on the surface of the material. This can be written analytically. Then if one multiplies that function by the shape of the pumping distribution and integrates over the width of the distribution, one can get the figure for \u0394T across the beam. In some embodiments, the function is the \u201cGreen's function\u201d for the problem\u2014one takes the Green's function that describes what temperature distribution is obtained for an infinitesimally narrow line-source of heat, and convolves and\/or integrates it with the actual heating distribution.","The following provides a heuristic method for choosing stripe width, pump power,
