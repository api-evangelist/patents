title: Account hijacking counter-measures
abstract: A method for providing an additional layer of authentication prior to accessing a user's account even though the user's credentials have previously been verified. User accounts are often accessed via a sign-in page that verifies the user's credentials. Upon detecting a device accessing the sign-in page, an identifier associated with the device is obtained. One such type of identifier is the IP address assigned to the device. Based on the identifier, it is determined whether the device is trusted or not. Even thought the user's credentials are verified via the sign-in page, if the device is not trusted, a second authentication page is presented to the user prior to proceeding to the account. The second authentication page presents at least one security question. The security question is based on information contained in the user's account (e.g., contact information, event information, electronic messages, etc.). The user is required to correctly answer the security question in order to access the account.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A single sign-on (SSO) service provides a method of access control that enables a user to log in once and gain access to the resources of multiple systems and\/or applications without being prompted to log in again. The initial log-in process typically includes a sign-on webpage that prompts the user for their credentials (e.g., usemame (user ID) and password). Upon entering the correct credentials, the user is authenticated and is taken to a home landing page. The landing page is either a default page set by the service or a page designated by the user during account registration. Once at the home landing page, the user may access additional services and\/or applications associated with their user ID such as email accounts, an address book, Groups, messenger applications, calendars, and the like.","User accounts are subject to account hijacking through a variety of techniques. Some of the most common ways of illegally entering a user's account are by guessing the user's password (commonly referred to as a \u201cbrute force attack\u201d), acquiring the user's password through social engineering (e.g., convincing technical support to provide a password reset to a different account) and acquiring the user's user ID and password through a computer infected with malware (e.g., a keylogger). If a user's credentials are obtained by an unauthorized third-party, the third party can log-in to the user's account and access all of the user's data contained in the account. The third party can copy the user's data, erase the user's data, and so on.","One aspect of the present technology is to provide an additional layer of authentication prior to accessing a user's account even though the user's credentials (e.g., password and user ID) have previously been verified. User accounts are often accessed via a sign-in page that verifies the user's credentials. Upon detecting a device accessing the sign-in page, an identifier associated with the device is obtained. One such type of identifier is the IP address assigned to the device. Alternatively, an identifier may include a device ID, subnet of the IP address and\/or geographical location. Based on the identifier, it is determined whether the device is know or suspicious. If the device is unknown or suspicious, a second authentication page is presented to the user prior to proceeding to the account even though the user's credentials have previously been verified via the sign-in page. The second authentication page presents at least one security question. The security question is based on information contained in the user's account (e.g., contact information, event information, electronic messages, etc.). The user is required to correctly answer the security question in order to access the account.","A security question may be based on information contained in the user's account. By using information contained in the user's account, answering the question should be trivial for the actual usual, while at the same time, difficult to answer for anyone else. Any information accessible in the user's account may be used as the basis for a security question. By way of example only, such information includes contact information in an address book, event information in a calendar, sent emails in a mail account, received emails in a mail account, Group affiliations, account activity, digital images, blog pages, profile information, and so on.","One aspect of the present technology is to provide a method for authenticating a user prior to providing access to the user's landing page. When the user's sign-in page is accessed, an identifier (e.g., IP address) associated with the device accessing the sign-in page is obtained. The device is designated as a known device or as an unknown device based on the device identifier. If the identity of the device is unknown, at least one security question is generated based on account activity associated with the user's account. Account activity data that may be used for the security question includes, but is not limited to, method of logging into the account (e.g., via web, via mobile device, etc.), messenger status message, and the like. Each security question must be correctly answered in order to proceed to the user's landing page.","In one aspect, the second layer of authentication prompts a user to provide a certain type of information and verifies whether the information is contained in the account. In one embodiment, the user is requested to provide at least one contact name that exists in the user's address book. Upon receiving the contact name, the address book associated with the user ID is accessed and the full_name field of each contact is searched for the contact name provided by the user. If the contact name provided by the user is not identified, the user is denied access to the account. Alternatively, the technology can identify other users that the user communicates with (e.g., friends, family, etc.), and use this information as the basis of a security question. In another embodiment, the user is requested to provide at least one calendar item contained in their calendar. If the calendar event provided by the user is not located in the calendar, the user is denied access to the account. In yet another embodiment, the user is requested to provide at least one subject line from an email recently sent by the user. The sent folder in the user's mail account is accessed and the subject_field of each email header in the account is searched. If the subject line provided by the user is not identified in a subject_field, the user is denied access to the account.","In another aspect, the second layer of authentication provides a security question containing both information from the user's account and fictitious information. The security question requires the user to verify which information from the user's account. In one embodiment, the contact name from a full_name field of a contact in the user's account is obtained and displayed to the user along with at least one fictitious name. The user is requested to select the contact name that exists in the user's address book. If the user does not select the correct contact name, or selects a fictitious name, the user is denied access to the account. In another embodiment, the user's calendar is accessed and event information is obtained. The obtained event information, along with fictitious event information, is displayed to the user. If the user does not select the event information from his calendar or selects a fictitious event, the user is denied access to the account. In yet another embodiment, a sent folder in the user's mail account is accessed. A recipient address is obtained from the TO: field of a header of an email recently sent by the user. At least one fictitious recipient address is also generated and displayed. If the user does not select the correct recipient address or selects a fictitious recipient address, the user is denied access to the account.","The technology described herein requires a user to authenticate a second time before accessing their landing page even though the user has previously been successfully by verified their credentials. The second authentication process presents one or more security questions to the user. The security questions are based on randomly selected information from the user's account (e.g., contacts in address book, calendar items, sent email, received email, etc.). Therefore, it will be extremely difficult for an account hijacker to provide the correct answers to the security questions. Yet, at the same time, it should be trivial for the user to correctly answer the security questions.","The technology described herein will now be described with reference to .  illustrates exemplary steps for authenticating a user. In step , the sign-in page to a user's account is accessed. For the purpose of describing the technology herein only, the sign-in page requests the user's credentials. In step , the location of the device accessing the sign-in page is obtained. The location of the device may be determined by several different types of information such as, but not limited to, the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to the device participating in the network (e.g., LAN, WAN, etc.). The technology described herein recognizes an IP address formatted in both IP version 4 (IPv4) and\/or IP version 6 (IPv6). IPv4 and IPv6 are well known within the computer science art and therefore, do not require further description herein. In IPv4 installations, the location of the device could also be expressed as a subnet mask. The location of the device may also be determined by a device ID, geographical location of the device (e.g., city, state, country, etc.), Autonomous System Number, and the like. For the purpose of describing the technology herein only, the location of the device is the IP address assigned to the device.","In step , it is determined whether the identity of the device is known or unknown.  provides additional description of determining whether a device is known or unknown. If the identity of the device is known, the user is prompted to enter their credentials, in step . Alternatively, a user may be promoted to enter their credentials immediately after the user accesses the sign-in page at step . In general, a user's credentials include a user ID and password. By way of example only, a user ID may include an email address, a username. Upon a user entering their credentials in the sign-in page, it is determined whether the user entered the correct credentials and should be authenticated, in step . If the user is authenticated in step , the user is directed to their landing page, in step . The user's landing page is, by way of example only, a webpage designated by the user upon registration of the account. If the user is not authenticated in step , access to the account is denied, in step .","If, in step , it is determined that the identity of the device is unknown or suspicious (also referred to as a trusted device or not trusted device), the user will be required to provide at least one additional level of authentication beyond the conventional username\/password before proceeding to the account's landing page. As will be described in more detail later, the two authentication processes are preferably based on different information associated with the account in order to make it more difficult for unauthorized access to the account. As shown in , the second authentication process (step ) that is required only when the identity of the device is unknown or suspicious.","In step , the user is asked to enter their credentials (user ID and password) to authenticate their identity. Again, the user may be requested to enter their credentials immediately after accessing the sign-in page at step . In that instance, step  occurs after the user enters their credentials. In step , it is determined whether the user is authenticated. If the user did not enter the correct credentials in step , the user is denied access to the landing page associated with the user ID, in step . If the user entered the correct credentials, the method proceeds to step . Even though the user has entered the correct credentials, the user is required to authenticate their identity a second time because the identity of the device was not known or verified (step ). Because the identity of the device is unknown, the system is suspicious that an unauthorized third-party is attempting to access the user's account. As will be discussed in more detail later, the second authentication (step ) is based on any information contained in the user's account or on account activity (see system  in ) that should be trivial for the user to identify yet difficult for a third-party to identify.","In step , the user is required to authenticate themselves a second time.  illustrates that the second authentication process may comprise a soft authentication process or a hard authentication process. The soft authentication process and hard authentication process will be described in more detail later in the application. In step , it is determined whether the user is authenticated based on the user's response to the soft\/hard authentication process. If the user did not properly authenticate, access to the account associated with the user ID is denied, in step . If the user properly authenticated, the user is directed to the landing page associated with the user ID, in step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","202","202","202","202","104"]},"In step , it is determined whether the user ID is currently in use in another location. Using the example whereby the user location is identified by an IP address, it is determined whether the user ID is currently associated with another IP address (other than the IP address obtained in step ). If another IP address is detected in step , it may indicate that more than one device is attempting to access the same user account, the user account is already in use, and so on. It is not often that a user accesses their account via more than one device at the same time. Thus, detecting two different IP addresses associated with a single user ID likely means that an unauthorized device is attempting to gain access to the user's account or has accessed the user's account. This suspicious behavior (two devices accessing a single account) triggers an unknown response, in step . If only a single IP address is identified, the method proceeds to step .","In step , it is determined whether the IP address (obtained in step ) is associated with a known bot. Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet, and are often associated with automated attack on networked computers. In one embodiment, a bot database (not shown) is maintained that stores IP addresses known to be associated with a bot. If the IP address obtained in step  is located in the bot database, the device accessing the sign-in page is designated as unknown, in step . If the IP address obtained in step  is not located in the bot database, the method proceeds to step .","In step , an IP address database is accessed. The IP address database contains trusted IP addresses that have been previously associated with various user IDs. Users routinely access their sign-in page via multiple devices, such as a home computer, a work computer, and a mobile device. When a user accesses their sign-in page, the IP address assigned to the device accessing the sign-in page is stored in the IP address database (not shown) upon successful sign in. The IP address is stored in the database in association with the user ID.","In step , the IP address database is searched for the IP address assigned to the device currently accessing the sign-in page (step ). Again, the search in the database is specific to the user ID associated with the account. Using the example provided above, the database is search for IP addresses stored in association with the user ID joe@example.com.","In step , it is determined whether the IP address (obtained in step ) is located in the IP address database under the user ID joe@example.com. If the IP address has been previously associated with the user ID, the identity of the device is known, in step . If the IP address has not been previously associated with the user ID, the identity of the device is unknown or suspicious, in step . Other heuristics could be used to determine whether a device should be designated as known or unknown. By way of example only, the time the user's sign-in page is being accessed could be used to designate the device as known or unknown. If, for example, the user's sign-in page is typically accessed between 8 am and 11 pm, and the user's sign-in page is currently being accessed at 3 am, the device may be designated as unknown. The geographical location of the device accessing the sign-in page (e.g., city, state, country) could also be used to designate the device as known or unknown. If, for example, the IP address of the device accessing the user's sign-in page indicates the device is located in France and the user's sign-in page has never been accessed outside of the United States, the device would be designated as unknown. Similarly, the mode of accessing the sign-in page may be used to designate a device as known or unknown. If a user's sign-in page has never been accessed via a mobile device, a mobile device accessing the sign-in page for the first time may automatically be designated as unknown. These heuristics are provided as examples only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein.","The second authentication process (step  in ) may be a soft authentication factor or a hard authentication process (commonly referred to as \u201ctwo-factor authentication\u201d).  illustrates an exemplary authentication UI  that the user may be presented with after the user's credentials are verified. Soft authentication generally refers to a process of authenticating a user via at least one security question that is based on personal information (e.g., contact information, sent email, received email, calendar information, group affiliations, most recently added contacts, etc.) and\/or account activity (e.g., connection locations, etc.) associated with the user's account. Hard authentication generally refers to a process of authenticating a user whereby a code or password is sent to a device registered with the user's account (e.g., send email with access code to registered email address, send a text message to a registered mobile device with access code, etc.). Upon receiving the code, the user repeats it back to system before being allowed to proceed to the landing page. Many different hard authentication processes are known within the art today and therefore, are not described in further details herein.","The technology described herein is not required to allow the user to choose the second method of authentication. Similarly, the technology described herein is not required to allow the user to choose the category of authentication within the soft authentication and hard authentication processes. Especially in the case of soft authentication, it is preferable to select information from the user's account without input from the user for generating the security questions. In the instance whereby the user's account contains four different categories of information\u2014contact information, sent email, received email and account activity\u2014it is preferable to randomly select the category of information that the security question(s) will be based upon each time the user is required to soft authenticate. By doing so, it will be impossible for an unauthorized third party to anticipate the type of information that will be required to answer to gain access to the user's landing page.","As discussed above, the security question(s) may be based on any category of user information contained in the user's account.  illustrates exemplary steps for performing one embodiment of soft authentication whereby the system has chosen to authenticate the user based on contact names stored in the user's address book (e.g., address book  in ). In step , the user ID is obtained. Because the user successfully authenticated a first time (step  in FIG. ), the user ID can be easily obtained. In step , the address book associated with the user ID is accessed.","In step , a second authentication UI (see ) is presented to the user requesting that the user enter three contact names from their contact list. The UI may ask a user to enter any number of contact names. The UI  shown in  includes a display window  displaying three contact fields , , . Upon entering a contact name in each field, the user selects the verify button .","In step , the contact names entered in fields , ,  by the user are received. In step , it is determined if all three names submitted by the user are located in the user's address book (address book associated with the user ID). If all three contacts entered by the user in fields , ,  are not located in the address book associated with the user ID, access to the account's landing page is denied to the user, in step . If the three contact names entered by the user in fields , ,  are located in the address book associated with the user ID, the user is directed to the account's landing page, in step .","In the case where the address book is selected as the source of information for the soft authentication, any information contained in the address book may be used to verify the user. The information that can be used to authenticate a user is not limited to contact names. The information the user is required to enter into the fields , ,  could be information contained in any contact field in the address book, such as the company_field, the business_phone_number field, home_phone_number field, address field, email field, and so on. Upon the user entering the information in the fields , ,  and selecting the verify button , the contact list associated with the user ID is searched for the information contained in the fields , ,  and the user is verified only if the information exists in the address book.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","350","352","350","356","358","360"]},"The system verifies that each of the contacts submitted by the user exist in the user's address book. Thus, in step , it is determined whether another contact name has been submitted by the user and not yet verified. If the user submitted more than one contact name, steps - are repeated. If any of the contact names submitted by the user are not located in the user's address book, access to the account is denied. If all of the names submitted by the user are verified, access to the account is granted, in step  (e.g., proceed to landing page).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In step , the user ID is determined. Using the example provided above, the user ID is joe@example.com. In step , the address book associated with joe@example.com is accessed. In step , the contact names (e.g., names in the full_name field) in the user's address book are identified. In one embodiment, it is preferable that the address book contain a minimum number of contact names so that the list of contact names provided to the user (step ) contains more than one contact name retrieved from the user's address book. Thus, in step , it is determined whether a minimum number of contact names exist in the address book. Step  is not required. If a minimum number of contact names do not exist in the user's address book, the system will choose another category of information as the basis of the security question (e.g., calendar events, sent emails, received email, etc.), in step . If a minimum number of contact names exist, the method proceeds to step .","In step , the contact name contained in the full_name field is selected from a certain number of contact names in the user's address book. The number of contact names selected in step  is preferably random so that the soft authentication process does not become predictable (e.g., two contact names from user's address book are always presented in step ). However, it is not required to randomly set the number of contact names. A contact name selected from a full_name field in the user's address book is referred to herein as a \u201creal contact.\u201d","In step , fictitious contact names are generated. A fictitious contact is a contact name that does not exist in any full_name field of any contact in the user's address book. The number of fictitious name generated depends on the number of total contacts that will be presented to the user and how many \u201creal contacts\u201d were selected from the user's address book (step ). In step , the real contacts and fictitious contacts are presented to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","412","1202","1202","414","1200","1200"]},"In step , the user is requested to select only the real contacts. Using the  example, the user selects each real contact by clicking the icon adjacent the contact name. Upon selecting all of the real contacts, the user selects the verify button . In step , the input from the user is received. In step , it is determined if the user selected all of the real contacts. If the user did not select all of the real contacts, access to the account is denied, in step . If the user did select all the real contacts, the method continues to step .","Selecting all the real contacts, by itself, is not sufficient to allow the user to proceed to the landing page.

By doing so, the technology is not required to generate fictitious contacts. Each of the contacts presented to the user is a \u201creal\u201d contact.","As discussed above, the soft authentication could also be based on email sent and\/or received by the user via the user's account.  illustrates exemplary steps for authenticating the user based on information contained in the user's email account (e.g., email service  in ). In step , the user ID is determined. In step , the mail account associated with the user ID is accessed. A typical mail account will contain email sent by the user (email stored in a sent folder) and email received by the user (email stored in an inbox folder). The security question(s) presented in the soft authentication may be based on information obtained from either email stored in the inbox folder or the sent folder. For the purpose of describing the technology herein only, the soft authentication steps shown in  are based on information obtained from email stored in the user's inbox folder.","In step , emails stored in the user's inbox folder are identified. These identified emails will serve as the basis for generating the security questions. As will be explained in more detail later, the soft authentication security questions should not be difficult for the user to answer. Thus, it is preferable to ask the user to verify recent information (e.g., recently received emails). However, the security questions can be based on any information contained in the user's account.","In step , the emails that will serve as the basis of the security question are selected. The number of emails selected in step  can be limited by setting a predetermined number of emails to identify (e.g., the last 50 emails received by the user), setting a date range (e.g., only select emails sent\/received by the user within the last seven days), and so on. The number of emails selected in step  can, of course, be any number, including up to all of the emails contained in the sent or inbox folder.","In step , the information contained in the header fields of each email selected in step  is collected. Information contained in an email header field includes, but is not limited to a FROM: field, a TO: field, and a SUBJECT: field. A FROM: field typically contains an email address designating the sender's address (e.g., sender@example.com). A TO: field typically contains an email address designating the recipient's address (e.g., recipient@example.com). A SUBJECT: field typically contains text (e.g., \u201cHello from Sender\u201d).","In step , the information contained in the FROM: field of each selected email is obtained. These sender email addresses are referred to herein as \u201creal senders.\u201d In step , a certain number of fictitious senders are generated. A fictitious sender is an email address that is not obtained from a FROM: field of any of the selected emails.
