{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to methods of reducing interference at television receivers produced by mobile communication systems transmitting radio communication signals, and networks, systems and mobile communication base stations for reducing such interference.","The UHF (Ultra High Frequency) radio band covers a range of frequencies between 300 MHz to 3 GHz. Radio frequencies within the UHF band have particularly useful propagation and information bearing properties therefore many systems which rely on the communication of information using radio waves are designed to transmit and receive information on radio signals using the UHF radio band.","To ensure a fair and organised allocation of the UHF spectrum, regulatory bodies, such as the Office of Communications (OFCOM) in the UK and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States, divide the UHF spectrum into different frequency bands and allocate each band to a certain group of users and uses.","As time progresses, it becomes necessary for the regulatory bodies to re-organise the allocation of the UHF spectrum to accommodate new technologies which communicate using the UHF spectrum and to account for the demise of older technologies which no longer justify a reserved section of the spectrum. The task of reallocating bands of the UHF spectrum is not always made purely with technical considerations in mind.","For example, in the UK after 2012, radio transmitters broadcasting terrestrial television signals using the PAL (phase alternating line) analogue transmission mode on the so-called \u201c800 MHz band\u201d will cease transmitting. The \u201c800 MHz band\u201d refers to a range of frequencies between 790 MHz and 862 MHz. These frequencies will be re-allocated by OFCOM for other uses such as so-called \u201cfourth generation\u201d mobile communications services. As a result mobile devices (such as mobile telephones and other portable devices such as laptops, notebooks, camcorders, cameras with built in wireless communications functionality) can be expected to be deployed which transmit and receive radio signals on frequencies within the 800 MHz band. As fourth generation mobile devices become more widespread, this may cause interference problems with devices for receiving television signals such as televisions, personal video recorders (PVRs), set-top boxes and so on.","According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of reducing interference to the reception of streams of television content received at a television receiver in which each of the streams of television content are transmitted on one of a plurality of frequency channels in accordance with a channel map which defines on which of the plurality of frequency channels each stream of television content is transmitted and the interference being caused by a base station transmitting data to or receiving data from one or more mobile devices via radio communication signals in a vicinity of the television receiver. The method comprises identifying the channel map and adapting a transmission of the radio communication signals between the base station and the one or more of mobile devices in accordance with the identified channel map to reduce interference at the television receiver.","The reallocation of certain frequency channels which are adjacent to frequency channels used for terrestrial television broadcasts poses a problem in that if the reallocated frequency channels are allocated for use in mobile communications systems, the transmission of mobile radio communication signals on the reallocated frequency channels may interfere with the reception of television content broadcast on the adjacent frequency channels used for terrestrial television broadcasts.","The broadcasting of terrestrial television signals typically involves dividing a geographical area into a number of television regions. Each television region is served by a television signal transmitter that transmits a number of television content streams on a number of different frequency channels. The allocation of television content streams to a given frequency channel is defined in each television region in accordance with a so-called channel map and the channel map used varies between transmitters. In accordance with the present invention it has been recognised that this variation can be exploited by enabling mobile communication base stations to selectively adapt the transmission of mobile radio communication signals based on the channel map of a particular television region. This selective adaptation means that rather than completely suppressing interfering mobile radio communication signals across an entire network or simply tolerating any interference that arises, the otherwise unrelated information associated with channel maps can be used to selectively limit the transmission of the mobile radio communication signals such that interference is reduced whilst maintaining the transmission of the mobile radio communication signals where possible.","In accordance with one example of the present invention, the radio communication signals are transmitted from the base station to the one or more mobile devices via a downlink frequency channel and transmitted from the one or more mobile devices to the base station via an uplink frequency channel, the uplink frequency channel and the downlink frequency channel being divided into frequency sub-channels. The step of adapting the transmission of the radio communication signals comprises selectively limiting or blocking one or more of the frequency sub-channels of the uplink frequency channel and\/or the downlink frequency channel.","In this example, the transmission of the radio communication signals is readily and conveniently adapted by selectively limiting or blocking certain uplink and downlink frequency sub-channels used when data is transmitted between the base station and mobile devices.","In accordance with another example of the present invention, identifying the channel map comprises identifying the channel map from data manually entered into a data store connected to the base station. In this example, location information can be conveniently provided to the base station, for example when the base station is installed.","In accordance with another example of the invention, identifying the channel map comprises identifying a location of the base station, determining from the location of the base station a television region in which the base station is located, and identifying the channel map associated with the television region. In accordance with this example, there is no requirement to manually enter the channel map, instead a location of the base station is referenced with respect to a list of television regions for which a list of channel maps is provided. In accordance with this example, each base station need only be provided with a single look-up table containing all the relevant channel maps.","In accordance with a further example of the present invention, identifying the location of the base station comprises receiving location information from a positioning unit connected to the base station or from one of the plurality of mobile devices.","In accordance with another example of the invention, information corresponding to which of the frequency sub-channels have been selectively limited or blocked is transmitted to a second base station, wherein the second base station communicates data with a plurality of mobile devices via radio communication signals in accordance with the adapted communication scheme. In accordance with this example, a first base station, for example a LTE macrocell base station can determine an appropriate adaptation to the transmission of radio communication signals on the frequency sub-channels which reduces interference to the reception of the television content. Information corresponding to this adaptation can then be sent to another base station such as a femtocell base station operating near the other base station. This allows the second base station (e.g. the femtocell base station) to transmit radio communication signals with a reduced likelihood of producing interference without there being a need to undertake any determination of how the transmission of the radio communication signals should be adapted.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a base station for transmitting data to and receiving data from one or more mobile devices via radio communication signals. The base station is operable to receive a channel map which defines on which of a plurality of frequency channels a plurality of streams of television content are transmitted and the base station is operable to adapt the transmission of the radio communication signals from the base station to the one or more mobile devices and to control the one or more mobile devices to adapt a transmission of the radio communication signals transmitted from the one or more mobile devices in accordance with the received channel map to reduce interference to the reception of the streams of television content received at a television receiver in a vicinity of the base station and the one or more mobile devices.","In accordance with another example of the invention, there is provided a network comprising a plurality of base stations as described above.","Various further aspects and features of the present invention are defined in the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","2","3","4","22","1","1","22","22","23","1"]},"A mobile device  situated near the television  includes a transmitter\/receiver unit  which receives and transmits radio communication signals to and from a base station  via an antenna .","If the frequency band on which the mobile device  is transmitting the radio communication signals is sufficiently close to the frequency band that the tuner  in the receiver  is tuned to receive (for example channel 61 with a centre frequency of 794 MHz), the radio signals from the mobile device  may not be filtered out by the tuner  and may interfere with the signals to be demodulated by the demodulator . This may arise because television receivers are typically very sensitive so as to be able to receive signals broadcast from transmitters that are up to several tens of kilometers away. Therefore, radio signals transmitted from the mobile device in the vicinity of the television may penetrate the television itself, thus \u201cbypassing\u201d the tuner , and even perhaps entering the demodulator  directly.","In some examples interference might be expected to occur if the mobile device or base station is up to 3 to 10 meters from the television receiver. However, the extent of the interference will also depend on factors including how close to the frequency band the mobile device and base station are transmitting with respect to the frequency band that the television receiver is receiving and the extent of any filtering and screening within the TV and tuner.","Interference with the signals to be demodulated by the demodulator  will result in a reduction in the quality of the sound and picture reproduced by the television .","LTE Mobile Communications",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a "},"Specifically, shows the 2009 OFCOM proposal to move PMSE (Programme making & Special Events) from channel 69 down to 38 and the plan to re-locate channels 61 and 62 to lower frequency channels such as 39 and 40. Additionally, PMSE access to TV bands 61-68 on an interleaved basis will no longer be permitted by end 2012\/early 2013.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"i":"b "},"The frequencies between 790 and 791 MHz provide a 1 MHz guard band . The frequencies between 791 to 821 MHz are allocated for downlink data transmission (i.e. transmission of data from an LTE base station to LTE mobile devices) and define a downlink spectrum . The downlink spectrum  is divided into six blocks (i.e. frequency sub-channels) of 5 MHz width. A duplex gap  of 11 MHz is provided between the frequencies of 821 to 832 MHz. The frequencies between 832 MHz to 862 MHz are allocated for uplink data transmission (i.e. transmission of data from LTE mobile devices to the LTE base station) and define an uplink spectrum . Like the downlink spectrum , the uplink spectrum is also divided into six blocks (i.e. frequency sub-channels) of 5 MHz width. Mobile communication systems, such as LTE, are designed so that components such as the base station can adapt the frequency band in various ways. This can include limiting or completely suppressing the transmission of the radio communication signals on individual blocks of the uplink and downlink spectrum and varying the width of the blocks.","Should the LTE UHF frequency band shown in be implemented without any adaptation, it has been identified that television content broadcast on frequency channels 53 to 60 shown in  would be at risk from interference from LTE devices and frequency channels 58 to 60 would be at a particular risk.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"i":"b","b":["401","402","403","404"]},"Television Regions","Countries such as the UK are divided into different television broadcast regions. Each television region is typically served by a single television transmitter which broadcasts streams of television content on various frequency channels (i.e. the frequency channels shown in the table of ).  provides a map illustrating the distribution of digital television transmitters throughout the UK.","For conventional analogue television transmission, a different audio\/video stream is broadcast on each frequency channel. These different audio\/video streams are referred to as \u201ctelevision channels\u201d. Examples in the UK include \u201cBBC \u201d, \u201cBBC \u201d and \u201cChannel \u201d. However, for digital television transmissions (such as those using the DVB-T transmission scheme) a \u201cmultiplex\u201d of content is broadcast on each frequency channel which can include multiple audio\/video streams along with other content such as interactive services, content from the internet such as web pages and so on. So for example in the UK, both \u201cBBC \u201d and \u201cBBC \u201d may be broadcast on the same frequency as part of a single multiplex. For simplicity, the content broadcast on each frequency channel is referred to as a \u201ctelevision content stream\u201d. A television content streams is also known as \u201cservice\u201d when referring to digital television signals transmitted in accordance with the DVB family of standards such as DVB-T.","The allocation of each television content stream for transmission on one of the frequency channels depends on a so-called \u201cchannel map\u201d. The channel map is defined by network planners and maps each frequency channel to a television content stream. For example, with reference to , a first television content stream may be transmitted on channel 39 (with a centre frequency of 618 MHz) and a second television content stream may be transmitted on channel 40 (with a centre frequency of 626 MHz).","Typically adjacent television transmitters (and thus television regions) are arranged to use a different channel map so that the same television content stream is broadcast on different parts of the frequency spectrum in adjacent television regions. This is to avoid interference issues at the boundaries between television regions.","For example, as can be seen from , the television transmitter at Knock More  is adjacent to the transmitters at Durris  and Angus . Accordingly, in a simplified example, television content streams transmitted from these transmitters could include a first television content stream (M), a second television content stream (M), a third television content stream (M), a fourth television content stream (M), a fifth television content stream (M), a sixth television content stream (M) and a seventh television content stream (M).","In this example, the channel map for the Knock More transmitter , the Durris transmitter  and the Angus transmitter  could be arranged as set out in Table 1 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Television ","Frequency channel","Frequency channel","Frequency channel"]},{"entry":["content","from Knock More","from Durris","from Angus"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["M1","60","53","43"]},{"entry":["M2","59","39","44"]},{"entry":["M3","58","40","45"]},{"entry":["M4","51","41","46"]},{"entry":["M5","50","42","47"]},{"entry":["M6","49","43","48"]},{"entry":["M7","48","44","49"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As can be seen by comparing Table 1 with the table shown in , from the Knock More transmitter  three television content streams are broadcast on frequency channels that are at risk of being affected by LTE transmissions transmitted using the scheme indicated in , namely M on channel 60 (786 MHz), M on channel 59 (778 MHz) and M on channel 58 (770 MHz). From the Durris transmitter  one television content stream is broadcast on a frequency channel that is at risk of being affected by LTE transmissions, namely M on channel 53 (730 MHz). From the Angus transmitter  there are no television content streams broadcast on frequency channels at risk of LTE interference.","As Table 1 shows, the effect of LTE transmissions will vary from television region to television region. Specifically, television receivers located in television regions provided by the Knock More and Durris transmitter will potentially experience interference if a LTE mobile device and\/or base station is situated in the vicinity of the television receiver. On the other hand television receivers located in the television region provided by the Angus transmitter will not be affected because there are no television channel streams broadcast on at-risk frequency channels.","As will be explained below, this variation can be exploited to optimise systems which aim to reduce the interference caused by the transmission of LTE radio communication signals.","LTE Mobile Communication Network",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","602","603","602","605","607","605"]},"The plurality of macrocells  shown in  are located within a television region  (for example a geographical area covered by one of the transmitters discussed in relation to ). As will be understood, the entire LTE mobile communication network is likely to be spread over several television regions. In any case, television receivers situated within the television region  and in the vicinity of one or more of the base stations and\/or mobile devices will potentially experience interference in the reception of television content streams on at-risk frequency channels.","As mentioned above, the LTE communication network may also include a number of smaller cells such as microcells, femtocells or picocells. These cells are provided by a plurality of pico\/micro\/femto base stations . As will be understood from , a macrocell with a typical radius from the base station of 1 to 5 kilometers is significantly smaller than a typical television region which may have a radius from the television transmitter of several tens of kilometers.","Manual Programming of Macrocell Base Station",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 3"],"b":["602","602","603","602","603","602","603","602","702"],"i":["b ","a ","b","a "]},"This adaptation of the LTE frequency band can be performed in dependence on the channel map of the television region  within which the macrocell  is situated to reduce interference with television content broadcast on the at-risk channels in that particular television region. Examples of this are explained further below.","In one example the base station controller is connected to a data store  which includes a look-up table that includes details of the channel map for the television region  within which the macrocell is located. The look-up table can be manually programmed when the base station  is installed, for example via a terminal . Depending on the channel map stored in the look-up table, the processor  can then be arranged to adapt the transmission of data to and from the mobile devices  to ensure that any interference caused by LTE transmission is reduced by adapting the LTE frequency band as described above.","For example, in the simplified example explained with reference to , assuming that the television region is provided by television signals from the Angus television transmitter, as can be seen from Table 1, none of the television content streams are broadcast on frequency channels which are likely to be affected by interference from LTE transmissions. Accordingly, the look-up table stored in the data store  would indicate that there is no television content being broadcast on an at risk channels therefore the base station  is free to permit the transmission of LTE radio communication signals to and from mobile devices on the entire downlink spectrum  and the entire uplink spectrum  and thus the processor need not adapt the LTE frequency band in any way.","On the other hand, if the television region is provided by television signals from the Knock More television transmitter, as explained above at least three of the television content streams are broadcast on frequency channels that are particularly at risk from interference from LTE radio communication signals. Accordingly, the processor , after retrieving the channel map from the look-up table in the data store, may be arranged to limit or completely suppress any LTE transmissions on all blocks of the downlink spectrum  and all blocks of the uplink spectrum  of LTE frequency band. In this case, the base station could be arranged to allow LTE radio communication signals to be transmitted to and from the mobile devices  on alternative sections of the frequency spectrum which have been allocated for LTE transmissions. Alternatively the processor may be operable to block all but the highest frequency blocks from the downlink spectrum  and the uplink spectrum  and reduce the width of these blocks. Furthermore the processor may be operable to reduce, the blocks from a frequency width of 5 MHz to, for example, a width of 1.4 MHz. Alternately or additionally, the processor could be operable to adapt a maximum strength of the radio communication signals broadcast on various blocks. Further still, the processor could define a reduced period of time during which radio communication signals are transmitted on certain blocks.","In another example, if the television region is provided by television signals from the Durris television transmitter, as explained above, only one of the television content streams is broadcast on a frequency channel which is at risk from LTE transmissions. Moreover, this frequency channel is at the furthest end of the group of channels that are at risk from interference from LTE radio commutation signals. In this case, the processor , after retrieving the channel map from the look-up table in the data store, may be arranged to limit or completely suppress downlink transmissions in the lower frequency downlink blocks of the downlink spectrum . This could be, for example, the three lowest frequency blocks (i.e. 791 to 796 MHz, 796 to 801 MHz and 801 to 806 MHz).","Location Based Programming of Macrocell Base Station",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["604","602","801","602","801","602"],"i":"a "},"In this example, the look-up table stored in the data store  contains a list of the geographical location of all the relevant television regions along with the channel map associated with each television region. When the positioning unit  identifies the position of the base station , the base station controller is arranged to access the look-up table stored in the data store  to determine which television region the base station is in and the channel map associated with that television region. The processor  in the base station controller may then generate the adapted LTE frequency band in dependence on the channel map as described above.","Macrocell Base Station Programming of Femtocell",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["901","606","901","606","606","904","601","902","903","606","903","606","606","902","606","606"]},"User Defined Location Information",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 7"],"b":["606","602","801"],"i":"a "},"In any case, once the macrocell base station  has generated an adapted LTE frequency band in accordance with the identified channel map as described above, the macrocell base station  transmits LTE frequency band adaptation information to the femtocell base station . The femtocell base station  is then arranged to adapt the LTE frequency band accordingly. In some LTE mobile communication networks, femtocell base stations are arranged to communicate with the macrocell base stations in order to avoid adjacent base station interference issues. Thus, a communication channel already exists which will permit a femtocell to manage the bandwidth of either or both of the LTE uplink or downlink channel bandwidths.","As will be understood, the technique illustrated in  can be applied to any LTE base station situated within the cell of another LTE base station. For example a macrocell base station could communicate the LTE frequency band adaptation information to any of a femtocell, picocell or microcell base station, a microcell base station could communicate LTE frequency band adaptation information to a femtocell or a picocell base station, and so on.","Location Input by User to Femtocell",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"LTE femtocell base stations are typically intended to be installed by a user in a home environment by connecting the femtocell base station  to the LTE core network via a communication link such as an ADSL line. The femtocell  is then established in the user's home providing LTE network coverage. As before, it is desirable to provide the femtocell base station with an adapted LTE frequency band in order to reduce a likelihood of interfering with television content streams being broadcast on at-risk channel frequencies.","In order to reduce the complexity of femtocell base station , rather than providing it with a data storage unit including a look-up table, means can be provided which enable the user to send location information from the femtocell base station  back to the LTE core network  via the link . This location information is then received at the LTE core network  which determines the television region within which the femtocell is located based on the location information by identifying the frequency channel plan associated with that television region from information stored in a data store . An appropriate adapted LTE frequency band can then be determined and transmitted back to the femtocell base station . The femtocell base station then implements the adapted LTE frequency band.","In some examples the location information can be an area code such as a UK \u201cpost code\u201d (typically a seven letter alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies a geographical regions in the UK). In other examples, the location information could be specific postal address information identifying a street or building in which the femtocell is located. In further examples the information could be longitude and latitude derived manually by the user from a map or from a positioning system.","In some examples the user can input the location information directly via an interface  on the femtocell base station. In other examples, when the user installs the femtocell base station, they may send a text message (such as a short message service (SMS) message) including the location information from the mobile device  to the femtocell base station . The femtocell base station  then sends the text message including the location information to the LTE core network as described above. In order to encourage the user to enter the location information, in some examples the femtocell base station  can be arranged to provide reduced functionality until the location information is provided.","In some examples specific channel map information can be provided by a \u201cteletext\u201d service (i.e. a text based information service which is included in a content stream broadcast in a particular television region). The teletext service may be provided by a MHEG (Multimedia and Hypermedia Experts Group) application or a Java application. In one example a user may access a specific teletext page to access channel map information or a coded representation of the channel map. In some examples this page may include a specific code to send by a text message as discussed above. In some examples, at each television transmitter there may be local insertion of a transmitter-specific teletext page with information representing the channel map.
