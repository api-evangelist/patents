{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A high-level overview of various aspects of the invention are provided here for that reason, to provide an overview of the disclosure and to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed-description section. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In brief and at a high level, this disclosure describes, among other things, a system for managing communications between a mobile device and a content provider, and specifically managing messages (e.g., texts, alerts, notifications) received by the mobile device from a content provider. Content providers may be services, applications, websites, or the like that provide content to a mobile device. For instance, a content provider as used herein may be a social media networking site, a gaming application, a weather application, etc. A communications manager receives a registration with the content providers, and also receives a registration with the mobile device indicating which content providers the communications manager is authorized to communicate with on behalf of the mobile device. The mobile device may send a block or unblock message to the communications manager, and the communications manager may translate the message to a content provider-specific format and deliver the message to the content provider.","The subject matter of select embodiments of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. But the description itself is not intended to define what we regard as our invention, which is what the claims do. The claimed subject matter might be embodied in other ways to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.

An illustrative resource that fleshes out various aspects of these terms can be found in Newton's Telecom Dictionary, 25th Edition (2009).","Embodiments of our technology may be embodied as, among other things: a method, system, or set of instructions embodied on one or more computer-readable media. Computer-readable media include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and nonremovable media, and contemplate media readable by a database, a switch, and various other network devices. Computer-readable media include media implemented in any way for storing information. Examples of stored information include computer-useable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data representations. Media examples include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile discs (DVD), holographic media or other optical disc storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage, and other magnetic storage devices. These technologies can store data momentarily, temporarily, or permanently.","As mentioned, embodiments of the present invention are directed toward managing communications between mobile devices and content providers, and specifically opting in and out of messages sent from content providers to mobile devices. Embodiments of the present invention provide users with an efficient and simple method to opt in or opt out or otherwise block messages (e.g., premium short messaging services (SMS) text messages) from various sources, such as one-time charge content, paid-for subscription services, and free social networking sites. Embodiments may provide end users with a common interface that will support communication to various content providers, senders, or originators of messages to the handset. A communications manager, described in more detail herein, accepts opt in and opt out requests from end users based on, for instance, SMS destination addresses or short-codes. The communications manager further translates these addresses (e.g., SMS-specific addresses) into specific content providers and customer service accounts to communicate directly with the impacting content providers or other parties on behalf of the customer to perform service-specific configuration and preference setting requests.","Embodiments of the present invention simplify the process for the end user of opting in and out of receiving certain messages from content providers and will improve the accuracy of blocking content provider notifications based on data captured by the messaging carrier where the messaging subscriber expresses an intent to block certain messages from specific sources. Embodiments also translate subscriber terminal identifiers and termination (short) code assigned to the source content providers into mobile notification preference-setting commands specific to the offending service or content provider on behalf of the messaging subscriber (e.g., end user). The system will provide end users, carriers, and the originators a method for tracking and implementing blocking\/unblocking message requests triggering service provider preference changes on behalf of the end users. This will then reduce the instance of false blocks where end users have the messaging carrier process and ignore messages from specific sources that would otherwise support or expose a mechanism to stop messages altogether on behalf of the user, improve the implementation time for requested blocks, and provide carriers with valuable information regarding block requests that ultimately result in customer experience as well as capacity and performance improvements.","In a first aspect of the present invention, computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon that, when executed, enable a computing device to perform a method of managing communications between a user and a content provider is provided. The method includes receiving registration information from a mobile device indicating that a communications manager is authorized to act on behalf of the mobile device for certain communications between the mobile device and the content provider. Further, the method includes registering the content provider with the communications manager thus allowing the communications manager to communicate with the content provider and receiving modified user preferences for the content provider from the mobile device. The method additionally includes communicating to the content provider the modified user preferences.","In a second aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for managing communications between a user and a content provider. The system includes a communications server for receiving and processing alerts that are intended for a mobile device and that are sent from one or more content providers based on the mobile device's subscription to the alerts associated with the one or more content providers. The system further includes a communications manager for managing communications with the one or more content providers on behalf of the mobile device, the communications comprising user preferences regarding alerts received from the one or more content providers. The mobile device is registered with the communications manager and provides the communications manager with a carrier identification, a list of accounts and access information for the one or more content providers, and notification services for each of the one or more content providers for which the communications manager is authorized to act on behalf of the mobile device. Each of the one or more content providers is registered with the communications manager thus allowing the communications manager to communicate the user preferences that are specific to the content provider on behalf of the mobile device.","In a third aspect of the present invention, computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon that, when executed, enable a computing device to perform a method of managing communications between a user and a content provider is provided. The method includes receiving registration information from a mobile device indicating the content providers with which a communications manager is authorized to communicate on behalf of the mobile device. The mobile device has registered with the content provider and has provided the content provider with user preferences corresponding to alerts in the form of short messaging services (SMS) text messages received from the content provider. The method further includes establishing an agreement with the content provider allowing the communications manager to communicate with the content provider on behalf of the mobile device regarding the alerts. The agreement is specific to the content provider such that it indicates how the communications manager is to communicate with the content provider. Additionally, the method includes receiving a request from the mobile device to modify the user preferences corresponding to the alerts received from the content provider and translating the request from the mobile device to a content provider-specific format consistent with the agreement. The method also includes communicating the request in the content provider-specific format to the content provider.","Turning now to , a block diagram of an illustrative mobile device is provided and referenced generally by the numeral . Although some components are shown in the singular, they may be plural. For example, mobile device  might include multiple processors or multiple radios, etc. As illustratively shown, mobile device  includes a bus  that directly or indirectly couples various components together including memory , a processor , a presentation component , a radio , input\/output ports , input\/output components , and a power supply .","Memory  might take the form of one or more of the aforementioned media. Thus, we will not elaborate more here, only to say that memory component  can include any type of medium that is capable of storing information in a manner readable by a computing device. Processor  might actually be multiple processors that receive instructions and process them accordingly. Presentation component  includes the likes of a display, a speaker, as well as other components that can present information (such as a lamp (LED), or even lighted keyboards).","Radio  represents a radio that facilitates communication with a wireless telecommunications network. Illustrative wireless telecommunications technologies include CDMA, GPRS, TDMA, GSM, and the like. In some embodiments, radio  might also facilitate other types of wireless communications including Wi-Fi communications and GIS communications.","Input\/output port  might take on a variety of forms. Illustrative input\/output ports include a USB jack, stereo jack, infrared port, proprietary communications ports, and the like. Input\/output components  include items such as keyboards, microphones, touchscreens, and any other item usable to directly or indirectly input data into mobile device . Power supply  includes items such as batteries, fuel cells, or any other component that can act as a power source to power mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","202","208","218","218","202"]},"Mobile device  communicates with an access component  by way of a communications link . Communications link  may be a short-range connection, a long-range connection, or a combination of both a short-range and a long-range wireless telecommunications connection. When we refer to \u201cshort\u201d and \u201clong\u201d types of connections, we do not mean to refer to the spatial relation between two devices. Instead, we are generally referring to short range and long range as different categories, or types, of connections (i.e., a primary connection and a secondary connection). A short-range connection may include a WiFi connection to a device (e.g., mobile hotspot) that provides access to a wireless communications network, such as a WLAN connection using 802.11 protocol. A long-range connection may include a connection using one or more of CDMA, GPRS, GSM, TDMA, and 802.16.","Generally, the access component  provides access to what some skilled artisans refer to as a wireless communications network , also termed a core network. A wireless communications network  may comprise one or more of the components illustrated in . To the contrary, not all components that make up a wireless communications network are shown. Also, not all connections or possible connections are shown. The access component  may be one or more of a base transceiver station (BTS) tower, a WiFi Router, a Mobile Hotspot, and any other device that facilitates communication between mobile device  and network . In one embodiment, the access component  includes both a WiFi Router and a BTS tower. In another embodiment, access component  is a BTS tower. A radio network controller (RNC) (not shown) performs various functions, such as managing radio channels, power control, load control, admission control, packet scheduling, handover control, macrodiversity, security functions, and mobility management. A base station controller (BSC) (not shown) acts as the intelligence behind base transceiver stations (BTS) (not shown), and handles allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from mobile devices, and controls handovers from one BTS to another BTS.","The components illustrated in  include a communications server , content providers , , and , and a communications manager . As mentioned, other components not shown here may also be used to carry out aspects of the present invention. Further, several components shown in  may be combined into a single component although shown separately in . The components illustrated in  may communicate with one another by way of the wireless communications network .","As mentioned, some components are not depicted in  so as to not obscure aspects of the various embodiments of the present invention. For instance, the wireless communications network  may include various components that are not shown. One of these components is a network-access gateway (not shown) that helps facilitate communication between the mobile device  and other networks (not shown) as well as the Internet (not shown). The network-access gateway is also known by some skilled artisans as a packet data serving node (PDSN). Similarly, others might refer to this device as a foreign agent. The network-access gateway helps manage communications sessions between the mobile device  and other components, such as the communications server , the communications manager , the content providers , , and , and the like. Any device that provides similar functionality is contemplated within the scope of this disclosure. For example, a GSM offers similar functionality in networks that utilize GSM or UMTS technology.","At a high level, the network-access gateway helps provide access to the Internet as well as to other network technologies and application services. It helps provide mobile IP (MIP) access, one-agent support, and transportation of packets to facilitate the funneling or communicating of data through virtual private networks. It can act as a client for an authentication server (not shown), which helps ensure that mobile device  is authorized to communicate via the wireless telecommunications network. In some embodiments, the authentication server is known as an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. But it can be any device that helps authenticate mobile device . In one embodiment, a network-access gateway includes a set of computer executable instructions that helps carry out various aspects of technology described herein. Further, a home agent (not shown) may be included in the embodiment of . A home agent is a router on the mobile device's  home network that maintains information about the device's current location, which, in one embodiment, is identified in a care-of-address. This allows the mobile device  to keep the same IP address even when it connects from a different location. In one instance, the home agent works in conjunction with a foreign agent.","Generally, in this disclosure, when we speak of communicating data or information we are referring to any action that requires mobile device  to have an IP address in order to carry out some action. Mobile device  might attempt to access items such as the Internet as well as other components that might alone or in combination facilitate things such as television reception, e-mail reception, picture mail, video mail, video conferencing, and the like.","The communications server  is a server that is responsible for managing incoming and outgoing messages, such as SMS messages, from mobile devices to other mobile devices, applications, and services. In one embodiment, the communications server  is a Short Message Service center (SMSC). Typically, alerts, notifications, and other such messages sent by content providers are first communicated to the communications server  prior to being delivered to individual mobile devices. The communications server  may monitor the types of messages (e.g., alerts, notifications) sent from the content providers to the mobile devices in the network. Further, modification events, as described further herein, may also be sent through the communications server.","The communications manager  is generally responsible for managing the communications between mobile devices and content providers. More specifically, the communications manager  manages user preferences for, for example, messages (e.g., alerts, notifications) received by mobile devices by content providers. As such, if a user indicates that he or she no longer wishes to receive particular alerts from a particular content provider, these modified user preferences may be sent to the communications manager , which, by way of its previously received registration with the particular content provider, knows how to communicate with that content provider to disable or enable certain alerts sent from the content provider. A mobile device, such as mobile device , has the option to register with the communications manager  to indicate its current user preferences with respect to receiving messages from various content providers. These user preferences may be included in a registration of the user of the mobile device  with the communications manager . The user preferences may include, for exemplary purposes only, an identification of the mobile device, identifications of the content providers that the communications manager  is authorized to communicate with on behalf of the mobile device, login information (e.g., username, password) for each content provider specific to the user of the mobile device, user preferences, etc. When the user wishes to change these preferences, the mobile device  communicates a modification event, which includes modified user preferences, to the communications manager . In one embodiment, the modification event is first sent to the communications server , and then to the communications manager . In one embodiment, the communications manager  is associated with a particular carrier or service provider, but in another embodiment, the communications manager  is not associated with any particular carrier or service provider and may provide its services for mobile devices in various networks.","Content providers , , and  represent various applications, services, etc., that are available via the wireless communications network . For instance, gaming applications, weather applications, messaging services, and social media outlets are just a few of the many types of content providers contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. Oftentimes, these content providers , , and  send out messages, such as SMS messages to registered users. The content providers , , and  may also broadcast e-mails, voicemails, and other forms of communication to mobile devices associated with users who are registered with the particular content provider. Users may opt in or opt out of receiving these messages or other forms of communications. The process of opting in and opting out can be quite time-consuming and burdensome for a user, as the user would need to access the particular content provider and from there determine how to opt in or out of particular messages. In some instances, the user may not even be able to opt in and out of particular messages using a website, for instance, associated with a content provider. Further, managing these notifications can be difficult and cumbersome, and end users are often unsure of how to opt out, or are unable to opt out of these notifications. In many cases, end users rely on mechanisms such as flagging notifications and advertisements as unwanted or spam, which merely prevents the messages from being forwarded to the mobile device, but leaves both the content provider and the service provider (e.g., communications server) burdened by a large volume of zero-value messages that still impact network capacity and cost of service. As such, one of the major issues is that even if the user relies on flagging or similar methods of preventing unwanted messages, the messages are still delivered to the service provider, which incurs a cost to block these messages on its own messaging infrastructure, and which can involve significant volume that otherwise carries no value and is better and more efficiently addressed by having the source content provider stop sending additional and unwanted message. The communications manager  resolves these issues by acting on behalf of the mobile device  to opt in or out of messages for a particular content provider.","Turning now to , a flow diagram is depicted of a method  for managing communications between a user and a content provider, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, the components illustrated in  include a mobile device , a communications server , a communications manager , and a content provider . The mobile device  communicates  registration information  to the communications manager . Generally, the communication of registration information allows the user of the mobile device to set up preferences with the communications manager , thus allowing the communications manager  to communicate with the content provider(s)  on behalf of the mobile device . The registration information  may include, for instance, PTN\/MDN, the cellular carrier, an identification of the user, an identification of the mobile device, an identification of the content providers (e.g., social networking accounts, notification services, news feeds, alerts), login information (e.g., username, password) for these content providers, allowed applications, nonallowed applications, notification services for each content provider that the user of the mobile device  wants the communications manager  to act on his or her behalf, and the like. In one embodiment, the registration information may simply be a message sent from the mobile device  indicating that the user would like to update his or her user preferences corresponding to the content provider . For instance, when the user purchased the mobile device , the user may have registered with the communications manager , but now would like to update these user preferences. The registration information  allows the communications manager  to act on behalf of the mobile device  and learn what it is and isn't allowed to do.","At step , the communications manager  stores the registration information  on a data store. The content provider  then communicates  a registration  to the communications manager . This registration  allows the communications manager  to understand how to opt in and opt out of messages with that particular content provider . For instance, each content provider  may have its own website, particular codes, etc. that the communications manager  would use to opt in or out of messages on behalf of a user. Further, particular types of notifications or alerts may be associated with a particular code. The registration  ensures that the communications manager  knows how to properly communicate opt in, opt out, or other information with each content provider .","Once the content provider  is registered with the communications manager , the mobile device  communicates  an alert registration  to the content provider  notifying the content provider  as to which alerts, notifications, or other messages the mobile device  would like to subscribe to and receive. It should be noted that the alert registration  may be communicated to the content provider  before or after the registration  of the content provider  with the communications manager , or even before or after the user, by way of the mobile device , has communicated registration information  to the communications manager . The alert registration  may include specific types of alerts or notifications that the user would like to receive, such as messages related to a particular topic or group. At step , the content provider  saves the alert registration information so that it can be recalled in the future. Once an alert or other message is to be sent to the mobile device based on the alert registration , the content provider  communicates  an alert  to the communications server . As mentioned, alerts are typically first sent to a component within the mobile device's network before being sent to the mobile device  itself. In one embodiment, a service provider or carrier may monitor which messages are blocked for each mobile device, but others may not. Here, the communications server  receives the alert  and communicates  the alert  to the mobile device .","Anytime after the alert  is received by the mobile device , the user of the mobile device  may determine that he or she no longer wishes to receive alerts from the content provider . Alternatively, the user may wish to not receive only a specific type of alert from the content provider . The mobile device  then communicates  a modification event  to the communications server  so that the carrier or service provider is aware of the modification event . The modification event , in one embodiment, is an indication from the mobile device  that the user wishes to modify user preferences in relation to alerts, notifications, or other such messages received from the content provider . In one embodiment, the modification event  is a block message for blocking all alerts or certain types of alerts from the content provider . Modifying user preferences may include opting in or out from certain alerts, or from all alerts from a particular content provider . The communications server  communicates  the modification event  to the communications manager  so that the communications manager  can communicate the modification event to the content provider . Prior to communicating the modification event  to the content provider , the communications manager  translates the modification event  into a content provider-specific format, or a format that is compatible with the content provider . This is shown at step . Compatibility information is learned when the registration  is communicated to the communications manager , as previously discussed. Further, at step , the communications manager  may access a data store to determine if it is authorized to act on behalf of the particular mobile device  in relation to the particular content provider . The communications manager  may also determine whether it has a relationship with the content provider  (e.g., determine whether a registration has been received).","The communications manager  then communicates  a modification message  to the content provider . The content provider  processes this information and makes the necessary changes to comply with the modification message  at step . The content provider  communicates  a modification confirmation  to the communications manager , which then communicates  the modification confirmation  to the communications server , which then communicates  the modification confirmation  to the mobile device . The modification confirmation provides an indication that the user preferences have been updated with the content provider .","For exemplary purposes only, user X may receive a status update from a social media network, which may be associated with the short code 123456. User X may send a carrier-specific short code blocking command over SMS so that no further SMS messages are delivered from short code 123456, or the social media site. The carrier message platform detects that the short code 123456 associated with the SMS block belongs to the social media site. Detecting that user X is a subscriber of the service described herein, the carrier, on behalf of user X, integrates with the social media site through either a negotiated API or the traditional HTTP, and sets user X's preferences on the social media site to no notifications.","Alternatively, embodiments of the present invention may be used by entities to potentially block employees from subscribing to certain notifications and receiving such notifications while at work. The communications manager  would provide these capabilities such that only a list of approved notifications could be received by employees while at work.","Referring to , a flowchart illustrates a method  for managing communications between a user and a content provider, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, at step , registration information is received from a mobile device. Receipt of the registration information indicates that a communications manager to which the information is sent is authorized to act on behalf of the mobile device for certain communications between the mobile device and a content provider. The content provider registers with the communications manager at step , thus allowing the communications manager to communicate with the content provider. This registration provides the communications manager with the understanding of specific codes and specific mechanisms for that particular content provider.","Modified user preferences are received at the communications manager from the mobile device at step . Modified user preferences may comprise, for instance, terminal identifiers and termination codes that allow the user to opt in or opt out of receiving messages from the content provider. In one instance, the messages received from the content provider are SMS text messages. As mentioned, the user preferences or modification events may be received by way of a user interface that allows the user to communicate user preferences for multiple content providers with the communications manager. At step , the modified user preferences are communicated to the content provider. The user preferences may be translated into mobile notification preference setting commands specific to the particular content provider before being communicated to that content provider. In one embodiment, a confirmation message, such as a modification confirmation, is received from the content provider indicating that the user preferences have been modified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","512"]},"At step , a request is received from the mobile device to modify the user preferences for alerts received from the content provider. The request is translated to a content provider-specific format at step , consistent with the agreement. At step , the translated request is communicated to the content provider. In one embodiment, the translated request is communicated to the content provider by way of an application programming interface (API) or a website associated with the content provider.","Many different arrangements of the various components depicted, as well as components not shown, are possible without departing from the scope of the claims below.
