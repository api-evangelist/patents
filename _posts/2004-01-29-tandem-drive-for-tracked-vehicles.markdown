title: Tandem drive for tracked vehicles
abstract: A tandem track system and method provides for safe withdrawal of a tracked vehicle if either of the main tracks becomes separated. The tracked vehicle has a main track longitudinally extending in a closed endless main loop on opposite sides and engaging a separate main drive sprocket assembly, extending under roadwheels to a main drive idler wheel, and back to the main drive-sprocket assembly in the main loop. The tandem drive system has a secondary track engaging each main drive-sprocket assembly and extending forward along the track vehicle from each main drive-sprocket assembly under only an aft-most fractional portion of the roadwheels. The secondary track is configured as a closed endless secondary loop inside of the main loop of each main track whereby each secondary track can transfer rotary power to move the tracked vehicle to safety.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to an improved track system for tracked vehicles. More particularly, this invention relates to a tandem drive system that assures continued operation of a tracked vehicle when either main track is broken or otherwise separated.","Military land forces traditionally use mechanical mine clearing devices, such as track-width mine plows, full-width mine plows, mine rollers, mine sweepers or mine flails to support the breaching and proofing of transit lanes through a minefield or mined roadway. Due to the weight and draft forces required to push these mine clearing devices, they are also traditionally attached to the front of a main battle tank or a supporting tracked vehicle.","The breaching process usually creates a primary cleared area of a transit lane directly in front of the tracks of the host vehicle pushing the clearing devices. Currently, these track-width plows and rollers are limited in their ability to clear large areas in front of the entire vehicle. Instead, they can only provide a marginal area of clearance to either side of the width of the host tank's track width. This limitation of clearance can be hazardous to the host vehicle.","Referring to , a typical host vehicle  (a main battle tank or other tracked vehicle) is shown pushing a typical mine clearing device  over the ground  to clear a safe lane in a mined area or an area suspected of being mined. Mine clearing device  can be any of many different contemporary track-width mine plows, full-width mine plows, mine rollers, mine sweepers, or mine flails. Mine clearing device  can be pivotally mounted on host vehicle or main battle tank  so that it can be deployed by suitable hydraulic mechanisms at the surface  of ground  or raised up and held above it when device  is not needed.","Main battle tank  has a heavy steel, longitudinally extending main track  on each of its opposite lateral sides that transfers the weight of the vehicle through several roadwheels . Tank  achieves its high degree of maneuverability by mechanically engaging each main track  with a main drive-sprocket assembly  located on opposite lateral sides of and at the rear of hull  of tank  and applying or distributing the weight of tank  over the large surface areas of main tracks .  shows only one main track  longitudinally extending on one side of tank , it being understood that the other side of tank  also has a similarly disposed main track , roadwheels , and main drive-sprocket assembly  and other structure to be described below.","Each main track  is routed to extend forward on each side of tank  from its rear-mounted main drive sprocket assembly  and over a number of relatively smaller idler wheels . From smaller idler wheels  each main track  continues to extend to the front of hull  where it wraps around a larger main return-idler wheel  and extends downward and toward the rear of tank . Smaller idler wheels  support the weight and movement of each main track  between each main drive-sprocket assembly  and main return-idler wheel . More or less idler wheels  can be used on opposite sides of hull  than shown to support each main track .","After being routed around main return-idler wheel  each main track  extends under a series of supporting roadwheels  and back to each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket  where it is secured to itself to form a continuous, closed endless main loop A. Roadwheels  distribute the weight of the vehicle  to ground  via each main track  that is entrapped between roadwheels  and ground . The number and size of roadwheels  used to support main battle tank  can vary but can be as many as seven or more (per side of vehicle).","Referring also to , each main track  has equal-distantly, longitudinally spaced-apart, inwardly extending track center guide horns  that fit into an annular guide groove  in a hub  of each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly . Only some of guide horns  are shown in , it being understood that guide horns  inwardly extend for the entire longitudinal length of each main track . Guide horns  in guide groove  help keep each main track  aligned so that gear teeth  of drive-sprockets  of each drive-sprocket assembly  can engage correspondingly spaced holes  in each main track  to deliver rotary power from machinery inside of tank . The rotary power (represented by arrow ) is transmitted through rotated drive-sprocket assemblies  to tracks  for propulsion and maneuvering of tank . Each of smaller idler wheels , larger main return-idler wheel  and roadwheels  also has an annular guide groove (not shown) similar to each drive-sprocket assembly  to receive guide horns  and help retain each main track  on tank .","During mine clearing and mine proofing operations, mine clearing device  (either of or combinations of plows\/sweepers\/rollers) can become damaged by detonations of disrupted mines. However, irrespective of whatever clearing device is used, those lanes that have had the devices applied to them, are never considered to be 100% cleared of mines in some cases. When mine clearing device  is damaged, the mine detonation usually occurs at\/under the first two sets of roadwheels  at the front  of tank  on the leading end portion of either main track , and usually induces separation and\/or breakage of one or both of main tracks . This condition is usually categorized as a \u201cmobility kill\u201d since the crew members of the vehicle are not killed in the process but the mobility of the vehicle has been compromised. It is also of significance to note that detonations of mines occurring under tracked vehicles usually occur under their forward one-third sections since this is the portion of their tracks (and roadwheels) that first come in contact with explosive mines.","Any further movement of a track-damaged vehicle, whether forward or rearward causes the broken track to be pulled around rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly . This broken track can bunch-up and bind the vehicle's drive mechanism (drive-sprocket assemblies ) while simultaneously causing the vehicle to steer out of the lane that was in the process of being cleared.","Often the operators of the tracked vehicles will attempt to back up and unbind the damaged track. Unfortunately, there is no force available to pull the damaged track back and it remains bunched on one side or the other around either or both main drive sprocket assemblies . This can cause the track-damaged vehicle to steer off-line and out of the cleared track path behind its mine clearing device  and expose the vehicle to further hazards of the minefield. This condition is caused by the fact that one track is broken while the unbroken track on the opposing side of the vehicle is still intact and fully functional. With only one functional track, the rearward moving vehicle will crab in a large radius path, in a direction towards the broken-track side.","When mine plows are used as mine clearing device , the only mines cleared can be those that are directly in front of the track-path of host vehicle . Following vehicles attempting to transit through this cleared lane must align their track or wheels to stay in this theoretically \u201ccleared path\u201d. Additionally, since some of clearing devices  only clear mines from the track path, anyone trying to work on a damaged-track of a disabled vehicle while it is still inside the minefield cannot approach it from the side of the vehicle since that area has not been cleared of mines. The tracks can only be approached from the rear and thus they are extremely difficult if not impossible to safely work on and repair while the host tank  is immobilized in the minefield. Often, the damaged host tank  and its attached mine clearing device  have to be towed out of the lane or are temporarily abandoned. In either instance, the assault lane is blocked, thus preventing the movement of any combat vehicles through the minefield.","In most cases, a second tracked mine-clearing equipped vehicle can be brought in to create a \u2018safe-path\u2019 around the incapacitated vehicle, or a new transit lane is started to support the breaching operation. However, such options can be unduly wasteful in terms of both equipment and time, can significantly degrade the efficiency of transit of military hardware and troops, and can expose them to hostile fire by an adversary.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a track system having a tandem drive that assures continued operation of a tracked vehicle when the main track is broken or otherwise separated to provide the ability to maneuver in a mined area.","An object of the invention is to provide a track system having a tandem drive that assures continued operation of a tracked vehicle when a main track is broken or otherwise separated.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system for a tracked mine clearing vehicle having a clearing device, such as a track-width mine plow, full-width mine plow, mine roller, mine sweeper or mine flail that assures continued operation of a tracked vehicle when a main track is broken or otherwise separated.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system that allows a tracked vehicle to continue to operate without a main track binding if the main track becomes separated during use.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system that allows the tracked vehicle to safely move forward and drop off a broken main track if the main track should become separated or broken.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system that allows a tracked vehicle that has removed its primary tracks (i.e. under maintenance) to have a parking brake capability.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system allowing a tracked, mine clearing vehicle having a clearing device, such as a track-width mine plow, full-width mine plow, mine roller, mine sweeper or mine flail to maintain its ability to maneuver clear (forward, to the side or rearward) of a mine cleared lane or area, when the main drive track becomes damaged to thereby not impede progress of other vehicles following it.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system allowing a tracked mine clearing vehicle to continue to support expeditionary mine clearing operations (i.e. continue to plow forward) even after a mine has detonated under the front of the vehicle and has caused substantial structural damage to the primary track system and\/or forward roadwheel assemblies.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system assuring safe rearward egress of a tracked mine clearing vehicle from a minefield by allowing the vehicle to remain in the safe track path cleared of mines even after a mine has detonated under the front of the vehicle and has caused substantial structural damage to the primary track system and\/or roadwheels.","Another object of the invention is to provide a track system providing a redundant path for vehicle propulsive power transfer to the ground.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is for a tandem track system and method that provides for safe withdrawal of a tracked vehicle if either of the main tracks becomes separated. The tracked vehicle has a main track longitudinally extending in a closed endless main loop on opposite sides and engaging a separate main drive sprocket assembly, extending under roadwheels to a main drive idler wheel, and back to the main drive-sprocket assembly in the main loop. The tandem drive system has a secondary track engaging each main drive-sprocket assembly and extending forward along the track vehicle from each main drive-sprocket assembly under only an aft-most fractional portion of the roadwheels. The secondary track is configured as a closed endless secondary loop inside of and shorter than the main loop of each main track whereby each secondary track can transfer rotary power to move the tracked vehicle to safety.","Referring to , tank  has a tandem drive system  of the invention on each longitudinally extending lateral side of tank  next to and inside of a portion of each main track . Tandem drive system  solves many of the limitations of the previous art as noted above and has a secondary belt-drive track  that is placed inside of each of the heavier (usually steel) main track  that is used to propel and steer tank .","Each main track  extends back to a separate rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly  to propel and maneuver tank during normal operations, and each secondary track  extends back to a common rear-mounted main drive-sprocket  to propel and maneuver tank when an adjacent main track  becomes separated. Each secondary belt-drive track  is much shorter in length than each main track  and is placed adjacent to the inwardly facing inner surface or inboard face  of its associated main track  where both tracks ,  are wrapped around each main drive-sprocket . Each secondary track  is thusly entrapped on inside face  of each main track , such that a single rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly  is driving two tracks  and  (i.e. Tandem-Drive).","Each secondary track  can be made in a continuous, closed endless secondary loop A from many well known combinations of proven materials and compositions that are strong and flexible to provide reliable long-term service. For example, each secondary track  can be broader forms of the fiber-reinforced belt-like structures used in the automotive industry to drive an alternator. The fiber reinforced, flexible belt-like structures of secondary tracks  can include a matrix of tough, flexible, and sufficiently wear-resistant rubber or other man-made compositions or composite materials having embedded, strong, stretch-limiting cords of nylon or the fibers marketed by Dupont Inc. under the trademark Kevlar. Many other combinations of fibers including metal and\/or glass fibers and compatible tough binders will readily suggest themselves to one skilled in the art for fabrication of secondary tracks  by well-known techniques.","Each secondary track  extends forward along tank  from each rear main drive-sprocket assembly  and under several of an aft-most fractional portion  of supporting roadwheels  and back to drive-sprocket assembly  where it is connected to itself to form secondary loop A. This arrangement is in contrast to each main track  which is routed to extend from each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly  all the way to the front of tank  under all roadwheels  and around main return-idler wheel .","Each secondary track  can extend forward under tank  under fewer or more of the aft-most located roadwheels  than the aft-most fractional portion  of four roadwheels  shown in  to accommodate different types of terrain or operational scenarios. Secondary track  extends under only the aft-most fractional portion  of roadwheels  since most explosions that damage tank tracks adversely affect or separate the part of main tracks  and roadwheels  that are under the forward part  of tank  and not where roadwheels  of aft-most fractional portion  are located.","Referring to , one arrangement that can be used for tandem drive system  has each secondary track  provided with longitudinally spaced-apart reinforced openings  in a reinforced center strip . Longitudinal spaced-apart openings  in strip  accommodate guide horns  of each main track . This accommodation allows each secondary track  to fit between drive sprockets  and ride next to inside face  of each main track  as tracks  and  are rotated by each main drive-sprocket assembly .","A hydraulic or mechanical belt-tensioning apparatus  can be mounted on each opposite lateral side  of tank  to contact or bear against each secondary track and selectably exert a pushing or tensioning force (shown by arrow ) on each secondary track  when main track  separates and tandem drive system  is needed to propel tank . Tensioning force  tightens each secondary track  on or around each drive sprocket assembly  to frictionally engage annular outside surfaces  of each hub  of each main drive-sprocket assembly . (Annular outside surfaces  can be smooth, knurled or otherwise roughened as desired). This frictional engagement of each secondary track  and outside surfaces  of hubs  can transfer rotary power (shown as arrow  in ) from internal propulsive machinery of tank  via each main drive-sprocket assembly  to each secondary track  to move tank  to the rear. Engagement of guide horns  of each main drive-sprocket assembly  and reinforced holes  of each secondary track  can augment this power transfer.","Referring to , another arrangement that can be used for tandem drive system  can have secondary sprockets  having annular gear teeth  extending from hub  on each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly . Hub  can have an annular spacer structure  between secondary sprockets  and drive-sprockets  to help assure that teeth  can engage correspondingly longitudinally spaced-apart holes  in each secondary track . This engagement assures direct and positive connection between each drive sprocket assembly  and its associated secondary track  to transfer rotary power to move tank . Optionally, belt tensioning apparatus  can exert tensioning force  to further assure engagement between each secondary track  and teeth  of secondary sprockets  and frictional engagement between secondary track  and outside annular surfaces  on hub . Engagement of guide horns  and reinforced holes  of each secondary track  also can augment this power transfer.","Tandem drive system  also can have side ridges\/side flanges  to captivate secondary tracks  onto roadwheels , idler wheels  and main idler wheel . Another propulsion linkage option is to have inwardly extending teeth  on the inside of each secondary track  (only three of which are shown on secondary track  in  by way of example). Teeth  are correspondingly spaced to engage spaces between sequential ones of teeth  on secondary sprockets  of each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly . Aft series  of supporting roadwheels  can be provided with appropriate spaced apart slots  (only three of which are shown on one roadwheel  in  by way of example) to engage inwardly extending teeth  and transfer propulsive and maneuvering forces from each drive-sprocket assembly  via each secondary track .","In operation, when each main track  is intact, each secondary track  can free-ride or rotate on each drive-sprocket assembly  as each main track  powers tank  to progress overland. When either main track  is broken or separated by impacting or exploding ordnance or other means, and falls away, the inner secondary track  becomes free of the covering provided by its adjacent main track  to contact the ground. The exposed secondary track  can now transfer propulsive forces and provide mobility to tank . Secondary tracks  of tandem drive system  automatically become the main power transmitting surfaces for tank  to allow virtually continuous power transfer by rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assemblies  and provide propulsive power to tank  via secondary tracks  on aft series  of supporting roadwheels .","With the weight of tank  now resting on a now broken or separated track , tank  can be driven via each secondary track  to the rear. Since each secondary track  continuously extends around each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly  in secondary closed endless loop A, the loose and damaged end of each separated main track  is kept from being pulled around and bunching up at sprocket assemblies  or from becoming piled-up behind tank . Each damaged main track  simply remains lying on ground  as it is rolled off each rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly  as tank  moves to the rear. Each secondary track  transfers propulsive power to maneuver tank  rearward and clear of the already cleared portion of an assault lane. Because of the functional secondary tracks  of tandem drive system , the cleared portion of the assault lane is kept clear of all major obstructions except for vehicle and track debris left-behind by the mine damaged vehicle.","Since secondary tracks  can be used to transport tank to the rear and away from a mined area, repair and reinstallation of damaged main track(s) can now proceed in a cleared area safely away from the assault lane. Secondary tracks  can also be relied upon to retrieve the damaged main track(s) when they are secured to and towed to a safe area by tank . Optionally, the damaged tank  can have one or both main tracks  replaced with new track(s) since secondary tracks  of tandem drive system  can maneuver tank  by its own propulsion system to a rapid repair depot where it can drive directly onto new main track(s).","Tandem drive system  of the invention allows a tracked vehicle such as tank  to continue to operate without binding either main track  at or around either rear-mounted main drive-sprocket assembly  if either main track  becomes separated during use. Tandem drive system  of the invention provides for redundant transfer of power for movement and maneuvering by redundantly powering the secondary track  around rear mounted main drive sprocket assemblies  and aft series  of supporting roadwheels . Tandem drive system  of the invention gives a tank crew the option of moving forward to drop off a broken main track if the main-track should become separated or broken and allows them to move aside should one or both main tracks  become damaged so as not to impede the progress of other vehicles following it. Another option for the tank crew is to allow them to jettison a damaged track while tank  remains in the safe track path that was behind tank  and was cleared of mines. Tandem drive system  allows a tracked vehicle to brake and or park safely park should both main tracks  become broken or while maintenance is being performed on main tracks .","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of tandem drive system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design that incorporates structures long proven to operate successfully lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use under the hostile and demanding conditions routinely encountered in active combat. Tandem drive system  can be fabricated in different physical arrangements from a wide variety of materials that have proven resistance to corrosion and have sufficient strength to provide long term reliable operation under a multitude of different operational conditions.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Tandem drive system  provides a reliable and capable means of keeping tracked vehicles capable of motion and maneuvering under the adverse conditions and terrain found on the battlefield. Therefore, tandem drive system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["5","5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
