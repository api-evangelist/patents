title: Method and system for displaying transient notifications
abstract: A notification component that is shared between all applications that provides notifications to users without interrupting the task that the user is working and allows users to manage the notifications from one location. The user can globally set preferences as to how the notifications should be rendered. These preferences include enabling or disabling notification classifications, which rendering type they want to use for each notification classification, and priority of notifications within each notification classification. The notification component allows the user to indicate what notifications the user want to sees and how the notifications are rendered. Rendering types include audio, visual, and pager styles. An application uses an application programming interface to send notification using schema based or text based notifications. The system parses the notification and provides the user the notification through notification classifications in accordance with the user preferences.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/192,691, filed Mar. 28, 2000.","This invention relates generally to networked communications and, more particularly, to a system and method to provide notifications to a user of the networked communications.","Continued advances in computer processor technology have led to not only increased performance, but also increased performance expectations by the users of such computer equipment. The industry has responded to these expectations by creating applications and operating systems that take full advantage of these performance enhancements. However, as additional functionality was added, these applications generally became more complex. This increased complexity, in turn, increased the amount of help and error information needed by a user. In response, developers added additional error messages, dialog boxes, and other windows (messages\/windows) in an effort to help the user, to notify the user that an error has occurred, and to notify the user that more information is needed.","Unfortunately, this has resulted in a continually increasing number of messages being generated from applications and the operating system. Additionally, the number of important and trivial messages sent from other users located remotely on the network is increasing rapidly. The most prevalent notification mechanisms for these messages in windows based operating systems are dialog boxes, message boxes, and icons (e.g., tray notify icons) on the operating system's status bar.","Dialog boxes, error messages, message boxes and other notification windows form all of these sources are invasive and often frustrate the user. These boxes may appear to the user as the top-most window and they generally capture control of the user interface. These dialog and message boxes are often accidentally dismissed by users who may be focusing on entering input and not paying attention to the computer monitor. Additionally, the dialog and message boxes often end up hidden behind other windows. The appearance of a box and the accidental dismissal of it frustrates the user because the appearance and accidental dismissal often interfere with the task the user is performing. This often causes the user to become sidetracked from his task and lose his train of thought.","Tray icon notifications, on the other hand, provide an indication on the status bar that a message has arrived. This indication is generally displayed using one of two methods. In the first method, the tray icon provides notification that a message has been received by either changing its shape, blinking, or a combination of the two. The second method places a tray icon on the status bar indicating that a message has been received. This second method then removes the tray icon when the user has seen the message. Two significant limitations of using tray icons are that they are not always obvious when they appear and the tray icon is not always easily identifiable. Another limitation is that the tray icon notification is not practicable in those operating systems that provide the user with an option to hide the status bar because the user will not see the tray icon notification. Additionally, when multiple messages are present, the tray notify icon area can become cluttered making new icons had to spot. As a result of the clutter, the user is often unaware when a new message arrives.","In response to these and other user frustrations with dialog boxes, message boxes and tray icons, application developers have developed individualized notification mechanisms for their applications in an attempt to reduce the user frustration. For example, many e-mail applications now provide some form of message indicating the receipt or presence of e-mail. When a user is logged on to MSN\u00ae Messenger Service, for example, a message window appears to inform the user whenever mail arrives. However, control of the user interface is not transferred to this message window. WorldNet\u00ae provides a tray icon that blinks when a message arrives and displays a message to indicate the number of messages that have not been read when the user places a cursor over the tray icon.","The development of independent notification mechanisms provide some advantages over prior methods of providing user notification. However, the mechanisms have resulted in inconsistent user interfaces for managing notifications and have introduced other limitations. Each application providing an independent mechanism requires additional overhead. Further, the effort of coding and debugging these individual notification mechanisms and their user interfaces has increased development time and cost of these applications. Unfortunately, users still cannot control how notifications are received and cannot disable the notifications from being received. What is needed is a notification mechanism that is shared between all applications and that provides users with more control over the notifications they receive.","In view of the above described problems existing in the art, the present invention provides a centralized notification component that may be shared between all applications. Through this centralized component users are provided the capability to manage their own notifications locally. Further, application developers no longer have to code and debug individual notification mechanisms and user interfaces thus reducing development cycle time and cost.","The instant invention provides a client-side shared notification component that lets a user continue working on a task while receiving a notification (i.e., a message). The notification component further allows the user to indicate what notifications the user want to sees and how he would like to see them, i.e. the rendering type. Rendering types include audible, visual, and pager styles. An application uses an API (Application Programming Interface) to send a notification to the notification component using schema based or text based notifications. The notification component parses the notification and provides the user the notification through notification classifications.","The notification component also allows the user to globally set preferences as to how the notifications should be rendered. These preferences include the enabling or disabling of notification classifications, the selecting of which rendering type the user wants to use for each notification classification, and the setting of priority of the notifications within each notification classification.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments that proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.","Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, the invention is illustrated as being implemented in a suitable computing environment.

The user's preferences may also be stored within the notification component . If the user's preferences indicate that the notification should be displayed, notification component  renders the notification according to the user's preferences via an appropriate notification medium such as monitor , speakers , pager , or other output . Other output  represents any mechanism that provides notification to the user such as a wireless PDA (personal digital assistant). The notification is rendered using a rendering style that does not transfer control of the input devices to the notification and that is not hidden behind other windows.","There are several types of notifications that are rendered by notification component . The types of notifications include mail messages, user messages, applications changing state messages, meeting reminders, stock tickers, etc. The notification component assigns each notification type a classification (i.e., a category). The list of classifications is extensible and presently includes contact, financial, e-mail, system level, and audio classifications. The contact classification is used for meeting notices, phone notifications, and any other notification that indicates that another user wants to make contact. The financial classification is used for financial based notifications, and the audio classification is used for audio notifications. The e-mail classification is used for e-mail notifications. For example, contact classification notifications are notifications such as \u201cConference Room 10 in 5 minutes\u201d for a meeting notice, and \u201cJoe at 703-308-4357\u201d for a phone notification. An example of an e-mail notification is \u201cBill from Microsoft.\u201d An example of a financial classification notification is a stock ticker such as \u201cMSFT up 5,\u201d an example of a system level notification is \u201cBattery is low\u201d and an example of an audio classification notification is \u201cPlaying Train.\u201d","The notification component  receives notifications to be rendered via an application programming interface (API) . In one embodiment, the application programs  specify the classification and the notification to be rendered in text form to the notification component  via the API .

The notification component  will incorporate other types of rendering mechanisms as they become viable. The user may also select a pre-notification notification with the audio rendering style. If this pre-notification notification is selected, the notification component  alerts the user that an audio notification is arriving. The alert allows the user to listen for the incoming notification. Without the alert, the user may misinterpret or not hear the first few words of the notification because the user is focusing on running a task. The notification component  renders the audio style by converting the notification text into audio and using the speakers . If speakers are not present, the notification component  renders the notification using the visual rendering style. In one embodiment, the notification component  is actionable (i.e., one or more actions are performed) when the user says a keyword or key-phrase in response to hearing the notification. For example, if the notification is a financial notification that is about the user's mutual fund performance and the user says the keyword or key-phrase (e.g., \u201cshow me\u201d), then the notification component  performs a specified function (e.g., brings up the web-site of the user's mutual fund).

The visual notification can also be rendered using a normal display (i.e., a message box display) or an animated display. Additionally, the visual notification can be actionable (i.e., a function is executed when the user clicks on the display with a user selection device such as a mouse, keyboard, joystick, etc.). For example, the web-site where the user's stock portfolio is stored can be brought up when the user clicks on notifications that are about his stock portfolio or the e-mail application can be opened or be brought to the top-most window level in response to the user clicking on an e-mail notification with a user selection device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIGS. 5","i":["a ","b "],"b":["5","310","312","314","300","138","310"]},"In one embodiment, the rendering styles also include a rendering version.

Once a notification is received, the notification component  parses the notification to determine the notification classification and the notification to be rendered. If the user's preferences indicate that the notification classification is enabled and the particular application is not disabled, the notification is rendered in accordance with the rendering style and priority specified in the user's preferences.","In some instances, a number of notifications to be rendered are present at the notification component . In these instances, notifications are queued by the notification component . There are two types of queues that the notification component  uses. The first type is a modified strict queue. Notifications in a strict queue are queued in the order they are received and are rendered in the same order. In the modified strict queue, the notifications are queued by priority and in the order they are received. They are then rendered in the same order (i.e., from highest priority to lowest priority in the order the notifications are received in each priority level) and may be stacked vertically in the display area. The second type of queue is a flushed queue. In the flushed queue, the queue is flushed of all messages when a new notification arrives. For example, if a compact disc player changes state or changes song, the queue is flushed of previous state changes or song changes because they are out of date.","In one embodiment, the notification component  has a history feature that keeps track of the notifications that have not been rendered. Notifications from the history may be flushed by the notification component  once they have been rendered to the user. Older notifications are also flushed from the history. The time period that the notifications are kept is selected by the user, and may be set for each notification classification. The user also may select how the notifications in the history are displayed. The history feature is also actionable (i.e., one or more actions are performed when the user selects a notification in the history).","A centralized notification system has been described that allows a user to continue working on the task at hand while receiving a notification. The system allows a user to set preferences globally and by notification classification, allows the user to enable or disable notification classifications, and allows the user to set priority levels of notifications.
