Typically, the alert details includes text that describes the purpose of the alert or prompts the user to perform a task such as the examples given immediately above.","In an embodiment, alert trigger criteria comprise at least a definition of a geo-fenced area. In an embodiment, the geo-fenced area specifies a geospatial area in which a user must be present to receive the alert. In an embodiment, the geospatial area is defined using any two or three dimensional format such as, for example:\n\n","In an embodiment, the point on which a geo-fenced area is centered could be an absolute location defined by, for example, a latitude and longitude or GPS coordinates. For example, a geo-fenced area could be a circle having a radius of 0.25 miles centered on GPS coordinates corresponding to the center of a city.","In an embodiment, the point on which a geo-fenced area is centered could be a location of a person, business or other entity defined by, for example, a name or street address. For example, a geo-fenced area could be a circle having a radius of 0.25 miles centered on a street address of a drug store. In an embodiment, where a name maps to a specific location (e.g. a business address, the point on which a geo-fenced area is centered is mapped to such location. In an embodiment, where a name corresponds to a business having multiple locations, the geo-fenced area corresponds to multiple physical locations, each centered on one location of the business. For example, a geo-fenced area could be a circle having a radius of 0.25 miles centered on each location of a supermarket. In an embodiment, where a name corresponds to a person, the point on which a geo-fenced area is centered could be a known address for the person, or could be the real-time location of the person determined by, for example, the geospatial location of a mobile device associated with the person.","In an embodiment, the point on which a geo-fenced area is centered could be a category of persons, places and\/or types of businesses, including types of products and services. In an embodiment, where a category that relates to multiple locations and\/or persons, the geo-fenced area corresponds to multiple physical locations, each centered on one location of a person or business matching the category. For example, a geo-fenced area could be a circle having a radius of 0.25 miles centered on each location of a business that sells food.","In an embodiment, categories used in alerts correspond to categories selected from a hierarchy of categories. For example, categories that match a supermarket could include.\n\n","In an embodiment, an alert can reference a list of multiple categories of interest, such that the alert is triggered if the user enters a geo-fenced area relating to any one of the categories on the list. In an embodiment, the list of multiple categories of interest represents a hierarchy of preferences. For example, suppose a user needs to buy milk, but has a preference for supermarkets and, in particular, a specific supermarket chain. The alert could be set up with multiple categories including, in order of preference:\n\n","The alert is triggered if the user enters a geo-fenced area relating to any one of the categories on the list, however, if the user enters a geo-fenced area relating to multiple locations matching one or more of the above categories, the alert is triggered by a business relating to the most preferred category and, in various embodiments, data relating to the business triggering the alert is sent to the user. Thus, in the above example, if the user enters a geo-fenced area relating to several supermarkets, including the user's preferred chain, only data relating to the preferred chain location is sent to the user.","In an embodiment, alert trigger criteria additionally comprise temporal criteria. In an embodiment, temporal criteria comprise periods of time during which an alert can be issued. In an embodiment, temporal criteria can comprise any definition of a period of time. For example:\n\n","In an embodiment, alerts are set up in advance of the dates and times on which the alerts are triggered. For example, a user could, at the beginning of a year, set up alerts for:\n\n","In an embodiment, alert trigger criteria can additionally include other criteria that condition how and when an alert is delivered. For example, such other criteria can include:\n\n","In the second operation of the method, one or more processes running on the server store  each alert of the plurality of alerts on an offer database in association with a respective one user of the plurality of users to which the respective offer relates. In an embodiment, the offer database can be any type of database now known or later to be developed in the art such as, for example, an object oriented database or a conventional RDBMS. In an embodiment, the alerts on the database are indexed by the user to which each alert relates and by alert trigger criteria.","In the third operation of the method, one or more processes running on a server receive , over a network, the geospatial location of a mobile device associated with a user. In an embodiment, the geospatial location of the mobile device is received in any format now known or later to be developed in the art such as, for example, latitude and longitude, GPS coordinates, and so forth. In an embodiment, a mobile communication network pushes the location data to the server without an explicit request. In an embodiment, the server issues one or more requests for data to the mobile communications network, for example, for data relating to users known to a mobile alert service provider, or alternatively, for all users known to the mobile communications network.","In the fourth operation of the method, one or more processes running on the server identify  at least one alert that relates to the user and whose trigger criteria are met. In an embodiment, the alert's trigger criteria are met where the trigger criteria comprise a geo-fenced area and the geospatial location of the is in the geo-fenced area. In an embodiment, the alert's criteria additionally comprise temporal criteria and the alert's trigger criteria are met where a current date and time associated with the user's mobile device falls within the temporal criteria.","In an embodiment, the alert's trigger criteria additionally comprise other criteria such as, for example:\n\n","In an embodiment, such other trigger criteria are met where, for example:\n\n","In the fifth operation of the method, one or more processes running on the server filter  the identified alerts according to user preferences. In an embodiment, user preferences comprise categories for which the user wishes to see alerts.\n\n","In an embodiment, if an alert does not fall within user preferences, the alert is not transmitted to the user. Additionally or alternatively, user preferences could include topics for which the user does not wish to see offers, such as a disfavored brand. In an embodiment, a user explicitly defines his or her preferences, for example, via a user website provided by the mobile alert service. Additionally or alternatively, the mobile advertising service automatically determines user preferences using user profile data and\/or data relating to a user's online activities.","In the sixth operation of the method, one or more processes running on the server transmit , over the network, the alert details of the identified alerts to the user's mobile device using facilities provided by the mobile communications network including, without limitation, text messaging, voice messaging and\/or multimedia messaging capacities provided by the network. In an embodiment, the users' mobile devices receive and display alerts by opening an application designed for displaying alerts. In an embodiment, the mobile alert service transmits alerts as text messages that are sent to the user's inbox. In an embodiment, the mobile alert service transmits alerts as flash files that are immediately displayed by user mobile devices without any action on the part of the user.","In an embodiment, the alerts are transmitted to multiple devices associated with the user, for example, to each mobile device owned by a user, even where such devices do not meet trigger criteria. In an embodiment, the alerts are transmitted to multiple channels associated with the user and\/or the user's mobile device, for example, as an SMS text message to the user's mobile device, as alert details to an alert app running on the user's mobile device and an email account associated with the user.","In an embodiment, the alert detail are supplemented with additional information that relates to the alert and\/or the specific conditions that triggered the alert. In an embodiment, additional information comprises information relating to one or more locations to which the alert relates. For example, where an alert relates to a category of products or services and the alert is triggered in response to determining that a specific retailer within that category is present within the geo-fence of the trigger criteria of the alert, the additional information includes information identifying or describing the retailer. See, for example, the alerts shown in - of . In an embodiment, additional information comprises information relating to one or more locations a user or entity who created the alert, if different from the user to whom the alert is directed. See, for example, alert  of .","While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems, various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer-readable media used to actually effect the distribution.","At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache or a remote storage device.","Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system, middleware, service delivery platform, SDK (Software Development Kit) component, web services, or other specific application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions referred to as \u201ccomputer programs.\u201d Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API (Application Programming Interface).

Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and\/or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively, portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically, just in time, when needed for execution. Thus, it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.","Examples of computer-readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non-recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media (e.g., Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD ROMS), Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), etc.), among others.","In general, a machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (e.g., stores) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).","In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order, operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out.
