title: Universal ground adapter for marine cables
abstract: An adapter is provided for electrically connecting an interior surface of a conduit and an external surface of a cable. The adapter includes a flat strip extending longitudinally from first to second ends with first and second transverse edges and composed of an electrically conductive and mechanically flexible material. The strip includes a longitudinal ribbon that forms a ring for wrapping around the cable by curling the first and second ends together in a direction transverse to the sheet, and a plurality of first and second incisions from the transverse edges towards the ribbon, the incisions being disposed at respective intervals that correspond to a longitudinally regular pattern. The first incisions form tapering tabs for bending in the direction transverse to the sheet to produce petals that extend radially inward from the ring to engage the cable. The second incisions form peripheral tabs for bending in an opposite direction transverse to the sheet to produce flanges that extend radially outward from the ring to engage the conduit.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention is a Continuation-in-Part, claims priority to and incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/385,470 filed Jan. 26, 2012, published as U.S. Patent Application Publication 2013\/0090004 and assigned Navy Case 101421, which claims the benefit of priority, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119, the benefit of priority from provisional application 61\/628,298, with a filing date of Oct. 11, 2011.","The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to ground adapters for electrical cables, especially those used aboard marine vessels and platforms. In particular, the invention relates to embodiments for low-impedance designs of a cable shield ground adapter (CSGA).","The United States Navy currently employs two technologies to provide electromagnetic (EM) protection from coupling to topside (i.e., above-deck) cables; conduit which provides an overall EM shield to cables placed within the conduit, and shielded cables with CSGAs used as termination connectors. Both technologies are viable but components used are expensive and difficult to maintain. The proposed CSGA embodiments deal almost exclusively with shielded cables and conduits. These are not explicitly described herein with respect to further applications, although the technology could be applied to the conduit shell whether flexible or rigid.","Conventional CSGA designs have been proven to be effective at grounding cable shielding when properly installed, achieving grounding effectiveness measures that exceed 80 decibels (dB), but are not easily repaired. The conventional designs are designed for use with swage tubes, also known as stuffing tubes. Specification requirements for the swage tube are provided in MIL-S-21239. Commonly utilized CSGA designs include Glenair\u00ae CSGA from Glenair Inc. of Glendale, Calif. and SkinTop\u00ae available from LAPP Group Inc. of Florham Park, N.J. The background section of parent application publication 2013\/0090004 includes further details about the conventional configurations.","Conventional electrical ground adapters yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an electrical grounding adapter within a conduit sealing assembly for electrically and environmentally shielding an electric cable. Various exemplary embodiments provide an adapter for electrically connecting an interior surface of a conduit and an external surface of a cable. The adapter includes a flat strip extending longitudinally from first to second ends with first and second transverse edges and composed of an electrically conductive and mechanically flexible material.","In exemplary embodiments, the strip includes a longitudinal ribbon that forms a ring for wrapping around the cable by curling the first and second ends together in a direction transverse to the sheet, and a plurality of first and second incisions from the transverse edges towards the ribbon, the incisions being disposed at respective intervals that correspond to a longitudinally regular pattern. The first incisions form tapering tabs for bending in the direction transverse to the sheet to produce petals that extend radially inward from the ring to engage the cable. The second incisions form peripheral tabs for bending in an opposite direction transverse to the sheet to produce flanges that extend radially outward from the ring to engage the conduit.","The assembly includes a conduit having a receiving end through which the cable passes axially; a lower seal that inserts into the receiving end; a gland boss that inserts into the receiving end; an external seal that inserts into the boss and extends axially outward from the receiving end; and the grounding adapter disposed between the internal and external seals.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments related to the invention were developed for the purposes of providing a Cable Shield Ground Adapter (CSGA) with the following characteristics important for use in marine environments and in particular shipboard environments:\n\n","Patent Application Publication 2013\/0090004 describes three designs for CSGAs for maritime utility, notionally referred to as \u201csnowflake\u201d, \u201croll-o-dex\u201d and \u201clantern\u201d for purposes of description. An activity report: \u201cCable Shield Ground Adaptor Resistance to Indirect Lighting Effects Test\u201d of June 2013 describes performance of the roll-o-dex and snowflake CSGA configurations of copper and stainless steel, both in D and K sizes, with the snowflake design demonstrating generally better grounding performance. The lantern configuration exhibited structural weakness and was hence not included. The terms \u201cadapter\u201d and \u201cadaptor\u201d are considered synonymous as spelling variants.","Swage stuffing tubes, as military part M24235\/17, have several standard sizes as listed at http:\/\/www.shipboardelectrical.com\/swagetubes.html including a tube body, gland nut and gland ring. The tube body can be stainless steel or aluminum. For purposes of disclosure, sizes B, C, D and K are described herein, although the principles described herein can be extended to additional cable sizes. Respective cable bore diameters for sizes B, C, D and K are \u00d80.515 inch (\u2033), \u00d80.640\u2033, \u00d80.750\u2033 and \u00d81.171 inches (\u2033).","The particular dimensions identified herein represent explanatory examples and are not limiting. Thus, other stuffing tube and conduit sizes can be contemplated within the spirit of the claims. MIL-S-24235\/2C provides the military standard dimensions for electrical cable packaging, available at http:\/\/dornequipment.com\/milspecs\/pdf\/24235-2C.pdf.","For purposes of grounding, an improved design for the CSGA is disclosed herein, combining advantages from the snowflake and roll-o-dex configurations in terms of performance and ease of manufacture. The roll-o-dex and lantern configurations can be produced as a metal ribbon or strip with a repeating pattern, cut to length, the tabs bent inward or outward, and the ends joined together for wrapping around an electrical cable to be grounded.","The snowflake configuration can be produced by cookie-cutter stamping of a circular coupon having an angularly regular pattern. The improved \u201cstetson\u201d or \u201cboater\u201d or \u201cporkpie\u201d configuration maintains the metal strip with repeating pattern of the roll-o-dex design combined with the denser penetrating contact capability of the snowflake design. The name stetson evokes a short broad-brim hat common at American political conventions, which the disclosed configuration resembles.","Additionally, the disclosure provides for lower and upper annular gaskets to provide environmental seals for the CSGA in the swage tube. The B-size lower gasket has an outer diameter (OD) of \u00d80.970\u2033 and a bore inner diameter (ID) of \u00d80.190\u2033 and a height of 0.563\u2033. The B-size upper gasket has a base rim of \u00d80.996\u2033, a stem OD of \u00d80.500\u2033, a stem ID of \u00d80.190\u2033 and a height above the rim of 1.000\u2033. The C-size lower gasket has an OD of \u00d81.090\u2033 and bore IDs of alternatively \u00d80.397\u2033 and \u00d80.230\u2033, and a height of 0.563\u2033. The C-size upper gasket has a base rim of \u00d81.040\u2033, a stem OD of \u00d80.608\u2033, stem IDs of alternatively \u00d80.397\u2033 and \u00d80.230\u2033, and a height above the rim of 1.000\u2033.","The D-size lower gasket has an OD of \u00d81.210\u2033 and bore IDs of alternatively \u00d80.635\u2033 and \u00d80.474\u2033, and a height of 0.583\u2033. The D-size upper gasket has a base rim of \u00d81.280\u2033, a stem OD of \u00d80.750\u2033, stem IDs of alternatively \u00d80.636\u2033 and \u00d80.474\u2033, and a height above the rim of 1.000\u2033. The K-size lower gasket has an OD of \u00d81.655\u2033 and bore IDs of alternatively \u00d81.000\u2033, \u00d80.750\u2033 (D insert), \u00d80.635\u2033 (C insert) and \u00d80.500\u2033 (B insert), and a height of 1.020\u2033. The K-size upper gasket has a base rim of \u00d81.040\u2033, a stem OD of \u00d81.160\u2033 (expanding to \u00d81.222\u2033 at the base), stem IDs of alternatively \u00d81.000\u2033, \u00d80.750\u2033, \u00d80.635\u2033 and \u00d80.500\u2033 (for accepting smaller size inserts), and a height above the rim of 1.500\u2033. While these dimensions are derived for use with commonly available swage tube and cable sizes, artisans of ordinary skill will understood that these dimensions could be adjusted to account for future variants without departing from the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B","b":["100","105","110","115","110","120","125","110","130","120","180","100","105"]},"An upper pair of slip rings  and  provides axial restraint between a CSGA diaphragm , shown herein as the stetson configuration, and the gland ring .

The designs can be used for commercial as well as naval ship construction. Due to the inherent design tolerance for either SAE or metric dimensions for swage tubes , the design can be utilized for both domestic and foreign ship construction. Although designed with maritime applications in mind, the designs can also be utilized for general construction practices where swage tubes or breach type fittings might be required for facility cable penetrations that require grounding, stabilization, or weather sealing.","The United States Navy utilizes hundreds of topside components that require electrical power or signal connections to systems internal to the ship via cable. Because of the complex and system hostile EM environment the connecting cables must be protected from unwanted EM coupling to the signal or power cable. The cables therefore are protected from the EM environment by a conductive cable shield grounded via a CSGA to the ship's bulkhead.","Current CSGA technologies utilized by the Navy are difficult to manufacture due to machining, difficult to install, repair and replace due to design characteristics, have relatively short service life due to poor environmental design, and are very expensive (approximately $300.00 per unit in quantity). The Navy also currently purchases CSGAs in multiple sizes due to the conventional CSGAs inability to adapt to multiple swage tube sizes or cable diameters. This significantly increases acquisition, logistics and design costs. The strategic goal of the proposed design is to provide the Navy a cost efficient technology that can significantly reduce total ownership costs via acquisition maintenance and logistics across the fleet.","The exemplary embodiments utilize relatively few parts. Common components include environmental seals that also perform as stabilizing structural components for cable centering and conductive spacers that perform diaphragm deformation control functions. The grounding diaphragm or CSGA diaphragm  itself is a cut stamped component made out of conductive sheeting.","The sheeting can be any useable conductive material depending on application such as brass, copper, stainless steel, aluminum or carbon impregnated sheeting. The required thickness of the sheeting depends on the design. The exemplary designs also utilize all components of the stuffing tube assembly. This includes the brass gland nut used as an integrating component and currently unused for shielded cable applications due to design characteristics of conventionally available CSGA designs. For conventional replacement operations of the CSGA assembly, the gland nut  may be discarded, resulting in waste higher incurred costs to the Navy.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
