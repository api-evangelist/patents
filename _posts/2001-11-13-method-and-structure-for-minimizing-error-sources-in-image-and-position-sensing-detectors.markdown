title: Method and structure for minimizing error sources in image and position sensing detectors
abstract: A method and structure for minimizing one or more non-uniformities in image and position sensing detectors are provided. The structure is directed to a focal plane processor for removing non-uniformities which distort the computation of a desired property of an object of interest in an image field. The focal plane processor is capable of selectively disconnecting one or more rows and/or columns from further processing in the imaging array for those rows and/or columns which contribute to the presence of at least one non-uniformity in a video image generated by the focal plane processor. In one embodiment, the disconnection means is embodied as pre-processing circuitry which includes row and column shift registers which provide control signals to area-of-interest (AOI) switches. In another embodiment, the pixels which comprise the focal plane array are constructed in a manner which facilitates their individual isolation.

No. 60\/248,902 filed on Nov. 15, 2000, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with U.S. Government support under NASA contract no. GSC144701. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to image processors of the type which are located on the focal plane of an imaging array, and more particularly to an improved image processor for removing non-uniformities which can distort the image processor's computations.","2. Description of the Related Art","The class of image sensors known as focal plane processors are integrated sensor circuits which combine some form of signal processing and an imaging array on a single die. The imaging array captures an image which strikes an array of pixel sensors lying on a focal plane. The focal plane is a light sensitive circuit on which the optical array focuses ambient light. The pixel sensors convert light into electrical signals. Generally, the focal plane is defined by the surface of a semiconductor device which has a plurality of light sensitive elements (photo-transconduction elements) formed thereon to achieve a pixel sensing capability.","The signal processing of a focal plane processor is often done in the analog domain resulting in a compact, low-power method of performing the signal computation. Due to inherent variation in fabrication processing, a large focal plane processor may have one or more pixels that provide erroneous signals, i.e., the pixel may always signal that it is being impinged with bright light when in fact this is not the case. These \u201cbad pixels\u201d may cause the analog computation to generate an incorrect result. Additionally, a given image may have an object in the field of view that interferes with the desired computation of some property of the desired object in the image.","As an example, image sensors are commonly used in a wide variety of image-tracking applications. One such application is that of a sun-based position sensor. In order to compute the sun's position using an imaging sensor, the sensor and associated computational circuitry must compute the centroid of the sun's image. Centroid computation is a very useful, well known quantity for image-tracking applications. Finding the centroid is an averaging process, the solution is robust to noise as well as insensitive to minor variations in illumination level. However, in practical applications, such as sun sensors, the illumination level of interfering objects that fall into the sensor's field of view (e.g., glint) may be significant enough so as to adversely affect the centroid computation, thereby causing an error in the reported sun position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","13","18","19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["13","12","13","1","2","3","22","13"],"sub":["i","i ","i"]},"Referring again to , the processor  generally operates as follows. For each column (c-c) and row (r-r) of the n\u00d7n array , the imaging pixels are summed (each pixel contributes a current) after an integration period yielding n summed rows and n summed columns. Each summed row is passed to the row computational block  and each summed column is passed to the column computational block . The row and column computational blocks ,  use the respective n summed row and n column currents to compute some desired property of the image, e.g., a centroid. As stated above, a drawback of this prior art configuration is that in the case where one or more non-uniformities (e.g., undesirable objects, bad pixels) exist in the image, there is no provision for their removal.","Thus, an improved processor would be desirable having a capability for removing the one or more non-uniformities thereby providing a more accurate computation of the desired property of the image.","The present invention is generally directed to a focal plane processor and associated method for removing non-uniformities which can potentially distort the computation of a desired property of the image field. The method of the invention, according to one embodiment, removes identified non-uniformities in the image field by disconnecting from further processing and readout, one or more rows and\/or columns of a focal plane array which contribute to the image field non-uniformities. In so doing, a more accurate computational result of some desired property of the image field is achieved.","Thus, in a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for removing one or more non-uniformities from an imaging focal plane array, the method generally comprising: observing an image (i.e., video output) produced by a focal plane array processor to identify at least one row and\/or column which contributes to a non-uniformity in the produced image; and means for removing the at least one row and\/or column from further processing in the focal plane array.","In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for removing one or more non-uniformities from an imaging focal plane array, the method generally comprising: observing an image (i.e., video output) produced by a focal plane array processor to identify at least one pixel which contributes to a non-uniformity in the produced image; and means for removing the at least one pixel from further processing in the focal plane array.","Circuitry for carrying out the above methods of the present invention includes at least a focal plane array, computational circuitry and processing circuitry all formed on a single substrate. The focal plane imaging array having current summing lines along each row and column and x and y position sensitive (computation) circuitry located on the edge of the array. The computation circuitry for computing some desirable property of the image field. In a first embodiment, the circuitry further includes circuitry for selectively disconnecting one or more rows and columns from the focal plane imaging array. The disconnection circuitry includes a plurality of row and column shift registers which provide control signals to area-of-interest (AOI) switches which selectively connect\/disconnect the respective rows and columns of the array.","In a further embodiment, the disconnection circuitry includes a plurality of row and column shift registers which provide control signals directly connected to the respective pixels for connecting\/disconnecting the respective pixels. In this embodiment, control is more refined in the individual pixels rather than selectively disconnecting the entire rows and\/or columns from further processing.","Further advantages of the improved sensor include an increased readout rate of a critical region, and enhanced sensor dynamic range due to not processing regions with very high illumination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","30","10","1","30","12","13","18","19","36","38","33","35","30"],"i":["a-n","a-n"]},"In operation, the pixels  in each column (c-c) and row (r-r) of the n\u00d7n array  are summed after each integration period. In the illustrative embodiment of , after one integration period, n independent row summations and n independent column summations are performed. Subsequent to performing the row and column summing operations, each summed row (r-r) is passed, via a respective row current summing line, to a respective row AOI circuit . Similarly, each summed column (c-c) is passed, via a respective column current summing line, to a respective column AOI circuit ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","40","33","35","3","42","12","40","45","40","47","42","45","45","18","19","44","36","38","44","36","38","45","47","42","18","19","40"],"i":["a-n","a-n ","a ","i"],"sub":"i "},"In the case where the control signal  (bit value), supplied from the n-bit row r(column c) shift register  () is a \u201c1\u201d indicating the particular row (column) contains at least some portion of an error source to be removed, the pFET  is turned \u201coff\u201d and the nFET  is turned \u201con\u201d. Under this condition, the row (column) signal  received by the computational block is zero and does not contribute to the computation.","In this case, the summed ith row (column) current from the focal plane n\u00d7n array  is blocked. In order to avoid a floating point input to the computational block  (), the nFET  shunts this node to ground.","A second embodiment of a focal plane processor will be described with reference to FIG. . In the second embodiment of the invention, it is recognized that because identified row and current signals are not used by the computational block ,  there is no requirement to actually sum the respective pixels that make up the removed rows and\/or columns. This is achieved in one way by holding the cathode of the diode at a fixed voltage (e.g., V). This prevents transistors M and M from passing any current to the row rand column csumming lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["13","13","2","3","13","4","5","4","5","22","13"],"sub":["i ","i ","j","i","DD","i ","i ","DD"]},"As shown in , a further modification to the second embodiment may be realized by noting that both the AOIRi and RESETi signals are common for all pixels in a given row. Since a pixel is held in \u201creset\u201d if either of these signals is held low, transistor M can be removed and transistor M is then driven with a signal that is the logical OR of AOIRi and RESETi, while maintaining the same functionality as shown in FIG. .","The second embodiment is advantageous in that the AOI function is performed as an integral part of the pixel. That is, it provides advantages over the first embodiment in that it removes the necessity of having additional circuitry (i.e., a separate AOI circuit block at the periphery of the array). A third embodiment further improves on the second embodiment by providing a further capability for disabling individual and\/or particular blocks of pixels which constitute a number of pixels less than an entire row or column of pixels. In the previous embodiments, disablement can only occur at the resolution of an entire row or column.
