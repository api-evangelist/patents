title: Methods and apparatus for adjusting forward link signal to interference and noise ratio estimates
abstract: Methods and systems for adjusting a forward link (FL) signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) are provided. In an example, a FL SINR is estimated for each user in a plurality of users, on at least one of each user's respective data rate control (DRC) message or each user's respective prior FL SINR value. The respective estimated FL SINR for a user in the plurality of users is increased, if, based on a reverse link acknowledge message, the user has decoded a packet before all symbols in the packet have been transmitted. Remaining control channel power is determined. The estimated FL SINR for all users in the plurality of users is increased if remaining control channel power is less than a low threshold. The estimated FL SINR for all users in the plurality of users is increased if the remaining control channel power is greater than a high threshold.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to electronics, and more specifically, but not exclusively, to methods and apparatus for adjusting an estimated forward link signal to interference and noise ratio.","2. Background","A modern wireless communication system is required to support a variety of applications and allow multiple users to share a common communications medium. Numerous multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The multi-access concept is based on channel allocation that separates communications among multiple users. By way of example, in a CDMA communication system, channel separation can be achieved by transmitting each signal with a different code that modulates a carrier, and thereby spreads the signal over the entire frequency spectrum. A receiver separates the transmitted signals with a demodulator using a corresponding code to de-spread the desired signal. The undesired signals, whose codes do not match, contribute only to noise.","Using CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d issued Feb. 3, 1990, as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d issued Apr. 7, 1992. Another CDMA system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d issued Jun. 3, 2003 (the HDR system). These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","A CDMA communications system is typically designed to conform to one or more standards. Such standards include the TIA-856 High Rate Data Air Interface Specification issued by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), which is also known as the \u201ccdma2000 1xEV-DO standard.\u201d The TIA-856 standard is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In EV-DO compatible systems, a basestation (i.e., access point) distributes forward link (FL) control channel power among users (i.e., access terminals), so that each user's service meets a minimum performance requirement. To efficiently distribute the control channel power, the basestation needs information about the FL's signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) for each user in order for conventional algorithms to allocate just enough power to maintain a target control channel SINR.","However, in conventional EV-DO systems, the basestation does not explicitly receive FL SINR information from the user. Instead, the basestation receives a data rate control (DRC) message, which is a FL data rate request generated by a rate predictor algorithm at the access terminal. The rate predictor requests data rates at which a target packet error rate (PER) can be maintained from a discrete list, based on then-current channel conditions. Thus, in conventional systems, the basestation only maps a discrete DRC data rate to a very coarse estimate of FL SINR. Generally, the FL SINR estimated by a DRC mapping is lower than the actual FL SINR. This bias is especially noticeable for voice over IP (VOIP) data on 1xEV-DO Rev. A\/B systems because it is recommended that DRC length for these systems be 8 slots (equivalently, 8*1.67 ms=13.36 ms) to reduce overhead gain on a reverse link (RL). In this case, the FL SINR estimated from the DRC message can be as much as 10 dB lower than the FL SINR estimated at the access terminal, whenever the user is not stationary. On the other hand, for stationary users this bias is within 3 dB. The worst case bias occurs on slow-fading channels. Similar statistics have been seen in system simulations using the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) methodology.","As a result of the conservative nature of the FL SINR estimate, power is inefficiently allocated. In the case of users with VOIP traffic, the resulting inefficiency limits user capacity of networks having reverse-link interference cancellation (IC) enabled at the basestation. Accordingly, there are long-felt industry needs for methods and apparatus to adjust the FL SINR estimates in order to improve performance of wireless communication systems.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention are directed to methods and apparatus for adjusting an estimate of a forward link signal to interference and noise ratio.","In an example, a method of adjusting a plurality of forward link (FL) signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) estimates is provided. The method includes receiving a data rate control (DRC) message from each user in the plurality of users. Prior respective FL SINR values associated with each user can be filtered. A FL SINR for each user in a plurality of users is estimated, based on at least one of each user's respective data rate control (DRC) message or each user's respective prior FL SINR value. The estimating can be performed in a first time slot, where the subsequent steps are performed in a subsequent second time slot. The respective estimated FL SINR for a user in the plurality of users are increased, if, based on a reverse link acknowledge message, the user has decoded a packet before all symbols in the packet are transmitted. Then, remaining control channel power is determined. If the remaining control channel power is less than a low threshold, the estimated FL SINR for all users in the plurality of users is increased. The increase can be limited to a maximum increase limit, and the estimated FL SINR for a first user can be increased by a larger amount than the increase amount for a second user, if the first user's DRC message is longer than the second user's DRC message. If the remaining control channel power is greater than a high threshold, the estimated FL SINR for all users in the plurality of users is decreased. The decrease can be limited to a maximum decrease limit, and the estimated FL SINR for a first user can be decreased by a larger amount than the decrease amount for a second user, if the first user's DRC message is longer than the second user's DRC message. The process can be repeated until the remaining control channel power is between the high and low thresholds.","In a further example, provided is a non-transitory processor-readable medium, comprising instructions that, if executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform at least a part of the methods described hereby.","In another example, provided is an apparatus for adjusting a plurality of FL SINR estimates. The apparatus includes a transceiver configured to support a plurality of communication links with a respective plurality of user access terminals and a processor coupled to the transceiver. A memory is coupled to the processor. The memory comprises executable code to cause the processor to perform at least a part of the methods described hereby.","In accordance with common practice, some of the drawings are simplified for clarity.

The AT is any device that allows a user to access a packet-switched data network through the EV-DO system. The AP is any network equipment\/entity providing data connectivity between a data packet-compatible network and the AT. The AP is analogous to a basestation, such as that found in a cellular communication system, thus, cellular communication terminology is often used to describe details of the EV-DO system.","Methods and apparatus are described hereby in the context of the EV-DO system and EV-DO compatible devices. While these methods and apparatus are well-suited for an EV-DO application, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that these inventive aspects are likewise applicable in various other communication and\/or electronic devices. Accordingly, any reference to a CDMA wireless communications device, an EV-DO system, or an EV-DO compatible device is intended only to illustrate the inventive aspects, with the understanding that such inventive aspects have a wide range of applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","110","105","115","115","115"]},"The wireless network  can have any number of access points (AP)  dispersed throughout a geographic region. The geographic region can be subdivided into smaller regions known as cells with a respective AP  serving each cell. For simplicity, only one AP  is depicted in . The AP  serves an entire sector under control of the access network controller . The AP  is connected to the access network controller  over a backhaul .","In , three ATs A-C are shown in communication with the AP . Each of the ATs A-C can access the communications network  or communicate with other ATs A-C through one or more APs . The AP  transmits data to the ATs A-C over a respective forward link (FL) A-C, and receives data from the ATs A-C over a respective reverse link (RL) A-C. Data transmission on the FL A-C occurs from one AP  to one of the ATs A-C at, or near, the maximum data rate that can be supported by the respective FL A-C and the EV-DO system . Additional channels of the FL A-C, e.g., a control channel, can be transmitted from multiple APs  to one of the ATs A-C. Link data communication via the RL A-C can occur from one of the ATs A-C to one or more APs . For simplicity, the following description discusses operation of the AT A. The other ATs B-C operate in a similar manner.","When coupled, the AT A is able to communicate data and control messages with the AP , including data and control messages relating to power control. Power control allows the EV-DO system  to adapt to changing environmental conditions, including but not limited to geographical conditions and mobile velocity. As the changing environmental conditions impact communication link quality, the APs  transmission parameters adjust to accommodate the changes. This process is referred to as link adaptation. It is desirable for link adaptation to track the conditions of the system as accurately and quickly as possible.","Link adaptation is controlled at least in part by the communication link quality. For example, when coupled to an AP , the AT A calculates a quality metric of the associated FL A, comprising an estimated FL signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), for example, based upon a measured FL SINR and historical FL SINR measurements. In an example, the AT A estimates the FL SINR by measuring a pilot signal that is modulated in a predetermined manner and received from the AP . The AT A measures the received pilot SINR and predicts the estimated SINR of the FL A from the measurement. The estimated FL SINR is a factor used by the AT A in preparing a data rate control (DRC) message.","The DRC message includes a DRC index that the AT A transmits to the AP . The DRC index corresponds to the rate at which the AT A expects to receive data on the FL A. The DRC index depends, at least in part, on the FL SINR measured by the AT A. Less noisy channels can support higher data rates, and lead to a higher DRC index. The DRC index should therefore be decreased as the FL SINR decreases, or increased as the FL SINR increases. The DRC index should be set as high as possible if data throughput in the system is to be maximized.","The AT A selects a DRC index with the highest data rate that can be supported by the FL A, based on the estimated FL SINR for a certain error performance (e.g., packet error rate (PER)). The AT A determines an optimum data rate for each of the measured FL SINR values, such as through a mapping function. The mapping function can be performed with a look-up table, an algorithm, or by other means. An exemplary look-up table for mapping the measured FL SINR to a data transmission rate that achieves a certain PER is shown below in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Rate",{},"Packet Length","SINR Threshold"]},{"entry":["(bps)","DRC index","(slot)","(dB)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2.456M","12","1","10.3"]},{"entry":["1.843M","11","1","8.0"]},{"entry":["1.228M","10","2","4.0"]},{"entry":["1.228M","9","1","3.9"]},{"entry":["921.6K","8","2","2.2"]},{"entry":["614.4k","7","2","\u22120.6"]},{"entry":["614.4k","6","1","\u22120.5"]},{"entry":["307.2k","5","4","\u22123.5"]},{"entry":["307.2k","4","2","\u22123.5"]},{"entry":["153.6k","3","4","\u22126.5"]},{"entry":["76.8k","2","8","\u22129.2"]},{"entry":["38.4k","1","16","\u221211.5"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Referring to Table 1, the selected data rate for a FL SINR value is the highest data rate among those whose thresholds are lower than the measured FL SINR value. By way of example, a measured FL SINR value of 2.2 dB for a 2-slot transmission should result in the selection of a 921.6 kbps data rate. If this measured FL SINR value yields the highest data rate among the various measured FL SINR values, then the corresponding DRC index (i.e., DRC index 8) is selected by the AT A.","After measuring the FL SINR, the AT A broadcasts a DRC message on a data request channel (DRC channel) to the AP . The DRC message includes the DRC index. The AP  receives the DRC message, and adjusts the FL SINR estimate as described in detail hereby.","The AP  uses the rate control information received in the DRC message from each of the ATs A-C to efficiently transmit data over the FL A at the highest possible rate. Because the rate of data can vary, the communication system operates in a variable rate mode. The AP  determines the data rate at which to transmit the data packet to the AT A based on the most recent value of the DRC message received from the AT A and the adjusted FL SINR estimate.","Average signal transmission power of the AP  can be controlled at a transmitter to achieve a specific FL SINR at the AT's receiver, in accordance with quality of service (QoS) requirements. Typically, a higher FL SINR is required to achieve a higher data rate for a video or other high-bandwidth transmission. A higher FL SINR can also be required if the AP  is far away from the AT A. In either case, improvements in the FL SINR can be achieved by increasing the average signal transmit power at the AP's  transmitter. An exemplary method for power allocation to reverse power control (RPC) channels is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/263,976, entitled \u201cPOWER ALLOCATION FOR POWER CONTROL BITS IN CELLULAR NETWORK,\u201d filed Oct. 2, 2002, assigned to the present assignee.","When a data packet is to be transmitted to the AT A, the data packet arrives at the access network controller . Thereafter, the access network controller  sends the data packet to the AP  over the backhaul . The AP  can schedule data transmissions to any of the ATs A-C at each interval of the FL A. The AT A, for which the data packet is intended, receives and decodes the data packet. Each data packet is associated with an identifier, e.g., a sequence number, which is used by the AT A to detect either missed or duplicate transmissions. Missed transmissions can be caused by, e.g., the AT A moving from a coverage area of the AP , shadowing, fading, and other well known reasons. In such an event, the AT A communicates sequence numbers of the missing data packets via the RL A. The access network controller  receives the data packet from the AT A via the AP  communicating with the AT A, then indicates to the AP  which data packets were not received by the AT A. The AP  then schedules a re-transmission of such data packets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","110","120","204","110","110","120","105","202","204","204","202","206","120","208","208","204","210","130","120","212","210","214","214","214","216","216","135","218"]},"A receive antenna  receives signals from the ATs A-C via their respective RL A-C, and provides the received signals to a receiver .

Step  is performed after step .","In step , the exemplary method of adjusting a plurality of FL SINR estimates ends.","The methods described hereby provide an improved power allocation algorithm based on improving the FL SINR estimation process. The AP  can use information about a user's early packet termination to refine FL SINR estimates. For highly loaded systems, the AP  can increase the FL SINR estimates slightly, but uniformly, across all users as control channel power begins running out, effectively lowering the allocated power to all users and thus accommodating more users. Also, the adjustment of FL SINR can vary with DRC length, since shorter DRC lengths improve FL SINR estimates. By improving the conventional power allocation algorithm, control channel performance (and higher network capacity) is achieved. These improvements are detailed in turn below.","The FL SINR estimate can be adjusted based on early packet termination. Whenever a user's packet from the FL A decodes early (i.e., before all symbols in the packet have been transmitted), the AT A can signal the AP  to early terminate transmission by sending the RL_ACK signal on the RL A. However, since the DRC values from the AT A reflect sustainable rates for the full packet duration, early termination implies that the true FL SINR, over the span of the transmitted portion, exceeds the FL SINR estimated by the AT A (and correspondingly, the FL SINR estimated at the AP ). Therefore, the FL SINR estimate can be increased. For example, the FL SINR estimate can be increased by a ratio of nominal packet length to early-terminated packet length. In another example, the FL SINR estimate can be increased based upon an error exponent analysis of the coded modulation schemes being used and comparing the nominal packet length to the early termination packet length.","The FL SINR estimate can also be adjusted based on control channel power. Prior to adjustment, the FL SINR estimate is conservative. As the network becomes heavily loaded, this conservativeness leads to some users not receiving any control channel power (especially in legacy systems), while mobile users have more than they need. Therefore, in heavily loaded systems where remaining control channel power is below a certain threshold, the AP  can choose to increase the FL SINR estimate uniformly across all users, for example, by a small amount. This technique provides results that are equivalent to using an aggressive FL SINR inverse DRC mapping for all of the users.","Increasing the FL SINR estimate uniformly across all users does not hurt the control channel performance below desired levels for mobile users, since the mobile user's FL SINR bias is very large. Further, by making only small increases (e.g., \u02dc1 dB) to the FL SINR estimate, power is saved throughout the network. For example, if the FL SINR estimate is increased for all users by \u02dc1 dB, then the network power savings is approximately 20%, because control channel power scales inversely with the FL SINR. Moreover, by adjusting the FL SINR estimate when the control channel power is small, there is no loss in performance for lightly loaded systems, or systems having only stationary users with low FL SINR biases, which leads to efficient power allocation.","In addition, the FL SINR estimate can be adjusted as a function of DRC length. The FL SINR estimate cannot be updated frequently when the DRC length is larger, as can be the case for mobile users. Thus, the FL SINR biases can be larger for mobile users. For stationary users, the update interval can have a negligible effect on the FL SINR bias.","When FL SINR estimates are adjusted based on control channel power, the adjustment method can differentiate between users, based on DRC length. Thus, when the system becomes heavily loaded and begins running out of excess control channel power, the estimated FL SINRs are adjusted for users using longer DRC lengths, prior to adjusting FL SINR estimates for users using shorter DRC lengths. In another example, FL SINR estimates are adjusted in different increments, based on the DRC length.","The apparatus described hereby can perform at least a part of the method of adjusting a plurality of FL SINR estimates .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIGS. 5-7","b":"140"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIGS. 5-6","FIG. 7"],"b":"700"},"In these simulations, the value for the maximum increase limit (Dmax) was chosen to be 1 dB. For scenarios with fewer mobile VOIP users, or with only stationary VOIP users, the method described hereby will not make as many FL SINR adjustments because less power is inefficiently consumed due to the FL SINR bias. Moreover, this is also the case if there are more users with shorter DRC lengths. Thus, the high loading behavior of the methods described hereby provides an overall network capacity increase with little or no penalty in performance to stationary users, and for low loading, the algorithm maintains or exceeds performance targets for all types of users.","Further, embodiments are described in terms of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device.
