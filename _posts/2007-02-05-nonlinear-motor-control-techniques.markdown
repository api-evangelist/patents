The name of the U.S. Government agency is the U.S. Army and the Government contract number is DAAE 30-92-C-1112.","The present invention relates in general to control of a servomotor, and more particularly, to nonlinear techniques for controlling a motor at high speeds.","AC synchronous motors and brushless DC motors are controlled through commutation of solid state switching devices connected to their stator windings. These motors can be of the permanent magnet (PM) type in which permanent magnets are used on the rotor instead of rotor windings. Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are widely used in motion controls, electric vehicles, and industrial turbo generators (ITG).","For demanding servo applications, having a well-tuned torque loop in an electric motor drive that works optimally under a variety of operating points is highly desirable. In a multi-axis servo application, suboptimal torque loop performance on any axis at any time can adversely affect servo performance in terms of adequately achieving the required velocity response and steady-state behavior.","Tuning the torque loop in an electric motor drive can be a labor intensive exercise that involves expensive equipment and often tuning techniques involve tuning for a particular operating point. However, due to the nonlinear dynamics of the cross-coupling terms in the voltage machine equations, optimal tuning at one operating point can be very suboptimal for a different operating point. For example, the majority of control schemes in industry utilize conventional PI control. These controllers typically have only one set of gains, and are optimized for a single operating point. Operation at any other point tends to be sub-optimal. Since these controllers are based on non-linear three-phase motor equations, their robustness and performance declines with changes in current, speed and inductance. Thus with conventional techniques one is left with a situation where performance and adequate stability margins are not guaranteed across the entire torque versus speed curve for a particular motor. Therefore, there is a need for a system that tunes high speed motors with wide operating ranges.","Servomotor applications typically require that the servomotor be capable of operating at various speeds. Motors can be driven by placing a pulse width modulated (PWM) inverter and PWM controller between the servomotor and the voltage source. Ideally, one would like to choose a PWM switching frequency as high as possible. However, certain parameters put a constraint on just how high the switching frequency can be obtained. There are a number of factors that influence the selection of the PWM switching frequency in three-phase inverters. Among these factors are:","(1) Switching losses;","(2) Inductance of the electric machine;","(3) Control algorithm selection;","(4) Electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions; and","(5) Electric machine harmonics.","One of the constraints in choosing the frequency is the processing capability of the computing element of the motor drive. The processor quite simply has a finite limit in how fast it can generate a control output. Another constraint is the switching losses. It is well known that switching losses are linearly proportional to the switching frequency. Depending on the switching elements selected in the inverter design, this can have significant impact on inverter efficiency which affects the design of the heat sink and vehicle cooling system sizing. Selection of an appropriate control algorithm with an appropriate PWM switching frequency can add important benefits toward minimizing this impact. There is a sizeable body of research in the technical community that has been focused on developing control algorithms that can lower switching losses and analyzing and comparing these control schemes to determine their impact on switching losses.","To solve the problem, one would like to set up a set of circumstances where the time spent on tuning the torque loop can be minimized while at the same time the techniques guarantee stability margins and performance requirements that hold across the entire torque versus speed curve for the motor under test. This is a complex problem that requires the following multi-layered strategy in order to solve. Thus there is a need to:","(1) Develop compensation for parameters that can change as a function of some known variable. It is known that motor torque constant, for example, changes as a function of current. By compensating for varying parameters in a well-behaved manner, they can be treated as constants for practical purposes and this simplifies the problem to a certain degree to set the stage for the next layer in the strategy.","(2) Develop a means whereby the control technique can decompose the operating regions into manageable partitions and the control system automatically adjusts its parameters according to which region it is operating in.","(3) Develop a set of performance enhancement techniques that can be implemented as needed to further improve performance. These techniques would further enhance torque loop response time, minimize current ripple and improve torque output for a given motor size.","(4) Develop a tool in firmware that can verify the performance enhancements and stability margins without the need for expensive equipment.","To have good dynamic response for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), the controller should be able to control the torque component of the inverter output current to the motor based on the rotor position. The present invention is a method for producing a well-tuned torque loop in an electric motor drive that works optimally under a variety of operating points. Therefore it is a primary objective of this invention to provide a torque versus speed curve partitioning and linearization multi-input multi-output control technique. The torque versus speed curve is partitioned into regions of a predefined speed width. An operating point is selected in the middle of each region. In the voltage machine equations, speed is considered constant with respect to the current dynamics around this operating point for the entire width of each region. Standard linear multi-input multi-output control techniques are used to find the optimal control gains for each region. A lookup table with current and speed indices determine which region the motor is operating in and an algorithm chooses the appropriate controller corresponding to that region.","It is further an objective of this invention to provide a technique for compensating for motor torque constant as a function of current. The technique uses a lookup table that characterizes the motor torque constant nonlinear behavior as a function of current. The current controller can then compensate for the change in flux that is a result from the changing motor torque constant.","It is further an objective of this invention to provide a technique using standard C libraries or Simulink models coded into C code, to generate a sine wave that can be created with programmable frequency, amplitude and outputs. The sine wave generator can be interfaced and embedded anywhere within the control algorithms to inject sine waves and programmed to inject a frequency sweep over a pre-selected frequency range. Data is collected and logged in real-time on the processor card and then transferred and stored in a buffer on a standard PC. The data can be processed or plotted using tools such as Matlab or Excel. This software-based spectrum analyzer takes the place of expensive hardware-based spectrum analyzers and makes troubleshooting and tuning out in the field less costly and cumbersome.","It is further an objective of this invention to provide a new scheme that decomposes the feedback signals to the fundamental and harmonic components through fast Fourier transform's (FFT's) or wavelet transforms. Standard d-q current control has limitations in bandwidth in that it has precise control of the fundamental but not of the harmonics, which act as time-varying current commands. Here, the fundamental and its harmonic components are transformed into multiple d-q reference frames, where its respective controllers perform the control for each of those components. Once the output control signals are computed, they are muxxed together into three-phase control output signals that are converted into PWM voltage input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The motor is intended to be driven from a sinusoidal (time-varying) voltage source thus the stator windings are sinusoidally wound. A shaft sensor is used to shape the voltage waveform incrementally as the rotor position changes. This contrasts with a \u2018trapezoidal\u2019 permanent magnet motor in which the winding are driven with a trapezoidal voltage waveshapes and the shaft sensor only detects 60\u00b0 electrical sectors.","The PMSM utilizes a control system design specified in this document that performs a reference transformation between the time-varying frame of reference and a non-time varying rotor frame of reference. This allows the motor to be controlled in a manner similar to a DC servo motor and it increases the closed loop performance as compared to a time-varying control system.","As illustrated in , the purpose of the torque loop algorithm is to determine the appropriate voltages to apply to the permanent magnet synchronous motor given a torque command and current and shaft position feedback.

Gain scheduling adjusts the proportional gain discretely according to the \u201cschedule\u201d, where the schedule is determined in the particular linearized torque\/speed region by ad-hoc tuning. This method works better than conventional PI control, but is still sub-optimal even when tuned to operate in the linearized operating region, because the gains are fixed within each region. A second disadvantage to gain scheduling is that the plant dynamics must change slowly as each region is transitioned. If the dynamics change too fast, the abrupt changes which can create instability issues.","The control strategy of using a multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller for each region provides distinct advantages over gain scheduling since the calculation can be computed by solving the Ricatti equation for each speed region.  provides an example of an LQG controller with an integrator . For this type of controller, the control law and estimator are designed separately in accordance to the Seperation Principle. For this segmented linearized regional partitioning scheme, each region has its own unique controller optimized for performance. Instead of using a fixed PI gain according to a schedule, weights on the cost function are scheduled. The controller minimizes the cost function and calculates the optimal gains and estimates by solving a pair of Ricatti equations. Each region's controller can then trade off performance for robustness if needed by performing loop transfer recovery if needed. Loop transfer recovery is accomplished by increasing the spectral density of the fictitious noise disturbance at the control output until acceptable robustness properties are obtained. A new controller is designed with these properties that is suboptimal in terms of performance at the cost of increased robustness.","The linear state-space equations for the plant can be represented as:\n\n()=()+()+()\u2003\u2003(Equation 8)\n\nand\n\n()=()+(),\u2003\u2003(Equation 9)\n\nwhere x(t) is a state variable, u(t) is the input , y(t) is the output , w(t) is the disturbance input , m(t) is the measurement  and v(t) is the measurement noise .

The result is an optimal controller in terms of performance in the presence of white noise disturbances. However, since the controller is not optimal in terms of robustness to all disturbances, loop transfer recovery must be performed. This concept of optimal control can be extended from single-input, single-output control (SISO) to multi-input, multi-output control (MIMO) using matrix algebra. In the case of the current controller for a PMSM motor, the inputs are i, iand \u03c9, and the outputs are vand v. A unique MIMO current controller can be designed to operate in each operating region of the linearized plant following standard design procedures for designing optimal MIMO LQG controllers.","In order to ensure a smooth transition from one controller to the next as the regions are traversed, the region sizes, as defined by \u03b4, that define the operating regions must be small enough to minimize the abrupt disturbance due to the change in plant dynamics. On the other hand, the region size must be large enough to keep the processing and memory requirements manageable. Since the gains are not fixed, they will adjust themselves to the new plant dynamics in a smoother fashion as compared to a fixed gain response.","In addition to linearizing portions of the torques versus speed curve, standard d-q current control has limitations in bandwidth in that it has precise control of the fundamental but not of the harmonics, which act as control modes that are uncontrollable. Thus, there is an opportunity to exploit more performance out of a PMSM if these control modes could be reached. This control scheme decomposes the current measurement into its spectral components, asserts control over specific components, and reintegrates the control outputs into one control output.","Specifically, the fundamental and its harmonic components are transformed into the d-q reference frame, where its respective controllers perform the control for each of those components. Once the output control signals are computed, they are muxxed together into three-phase control output signals that are converted into PWM voltage input. The entire control scheme is shown in .","As illustrated in , the feedback current measurement , which has been converted from an analog signal into a digital signal, is decomposed into select harmonic components via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) . The harmonic components - are transformed into the dq reference frame via reverse transformation  and summed with T. Separate MIMO-based current controllers  are designed to assert control authority over each harmonic component. Once the control outputs have been calculated, the components are transformed back into the abc rotating reference frame via forward transformation . The components are then combined  into one control output which is in the form of a voltage command  to the inverter .","DPWM (Discontinuous Pulse Width Modulation) with Power Factor Correction can further improve control performance of the servo motor. DPWM can reduce switching losses by injecting harmonics, called the zero sequence, into a conventional sinusoidal voltage command waveform in such a way that for a finite period of time there are no switching events. For example, the total power losses for a switched-mode inverter can be decomposed at the device level and at the operational level. At the operational level there will be loss contributions due to when the switching components are in the \u201con\u201d state. The \u201con\u201d state can be defined as the state at which the switching devices are continuously conducting. These losses are known as the conduction losses. During the time that the switching devices are in the process of switching, there is a finite period of time where there is conduction and voltage drop due to the fact that the switching devices cannot be turned on or off instantaneously. The losses that occur during this switching state are known as the switching losses.  shows an illustration of typical switching losses .

The timer value is shifted and rescaled to a voltage value that is normalized with respect to the maximum allowable phase voltage. The current measurement is normalized with respect to the maximum allowable current rating of the amplifier or the motor, whichever is lowest. Both signals are filtered through a low-pass filter of the same order so each output produces smooth sinusoidal waveforms with the same relative timer values with respect to each signal. The power factor is then calculated based on the stored timer values. Then the power factor value is fed into the DPWM algorithm, where the harmonic injection point in the sinusoidal phase voltage command is adjusted based on this power factor value. Thus the entire algorithm insures, based on the quality of the power factor estimate that the center of the voltage clamping occurs at the optimal point which is relative to the peak of the respective phase current.","This algorithm is implemented in an s-function with the following pseudo-code:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0116"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"electrical_period = 1\/electricaUrequency;"},{"entry":"\/\/ Check for zero crossings if(Vv> 0 && Vv_p1 < 0)"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"t1_meas = t1;"},{"entry":"t1 = 0.0;"},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"if((lv > 0) && (Iv_p1 < 0)) {"},{"entry":"t2_meas = t2;"},{"entry":"t2 = 0.0;"},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"\/\/ Calculate the power factor"},{"entry":"if(t1_meas != 0 && t2_meas != 0)"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"if(fabs(t1_meas \u2212 t2_meas) < O.S\u2032electrical_period)"},{"entry":"{"},{"entry":"\/\/if(t2_meas > t1_meas)"},{"entry":"\/\/ {"},{"entry":"power_factor_new = \u2212pi\u2032electricaUrequency\u2032(t2_meas \u2212 t1_meas);"},{"entry":"t1_meas = 0.0;"},{"entry":"t2_meas = 0.0;"},{"entry":"\/\/}"},{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"\/\/Update the power factor estimate power_factor = power_factor_new;"},{"entry":"\/\/Update states Vv_p1 = Vv; Iv_p1 = Iv;"},{"entry":"\/\/Increment the counters t1 = t1 + SampleTime; t2 = t2 + SampleTime;"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The present invention thus provides a method for reducing inverter switching losses through the implementation of a DPWM algorithm. The algorithm has the added feature of maximizing the reduction of switching losses by estimating the power factor in real time from the measured current and commanded voltage so that the harmonic injection signal occurs at the optimal time. It is envisioned that the optimal time is where the center of the voltage clamp in the harmonic injection lines up with the peak of the measured current.","The present invention further includes a built-in frequency response generator. Using standard C libraries or Simulink models coded into C code, a sine wave generator can be created with programmable frequency, amplitude and outputs. The sine wave generator can be interfaced and embedded anywhere within the control algorithms to inject sine waves and programmed to inject a frequency sweep over a pre-selected frequency range. Data is collected and logged in real-time on the processor card and then transferred and stored in a buffer on a standard PC. The data can be processed or plotted using tools such as Matlab or Excel. This software-based spectrum analyzer takes the place of expensive hardware-based spectrum analyzers and makes troubleshooting and tuning out in the field less costly and cumbersome.","As illustrated in , a servo motor controller  is interfaced to the PC hardware  via a communications interface  such as GBe (Gigabit Ethernet) for example. The frequency generation parameters and mode is user selectable on a Graphical User Interface (GUI)  on a conventional PC. From the GUI, the user can issue a command to begin the frequency sweep. Within the servo motor controller is embedded software that contains the application software  that implements the control loops . Also contained in the embedded software is the support structure for executing the frequency response commands. This support structure contains the inputs, outputs and a software-based sine wave generator  that operates based on the commands from the user. By selecting the appropriate mode, the embedded software injects the sine wave signal to the appropriate input and data is sent out to the corresponding output. The data is logged in real-time as the sweep is executing and it is sent across the communications interface back to the PC where the data is stored in a database . The database has an interface to Matlab  which processes the data. The processed data then appears on the GUI  and because it is catalogued and stored in a database, it can be retrieved for future analysis.","Various modifications and alterations to this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.
