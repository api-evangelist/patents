The respective owners of such intellectual property have no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the disclosure by anyone as it appears in published Patent Office file\/records, but otherwise reserve all rights.","The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are herein expressly incorporated by reference.","The present innovations are directed generally to media control, and more particularly, to MEDIA CONTENT SYNCHRONIZED ADVERTISING PLATFORM APPARATUSES AND SYSTEMS.","A home TV user may view TV programs from a plurality of channels. The user may operate a handheld remote TV controller sold with the TV set to select TV channels. For example, the user may push buttons on the remote controller to switch channels, turn up\/down audio volume, power on\/off the TV. Merchants advertise their products to attract consumers. Thus the TV audiences may interact with the TV and select a desired channel without physically touching it via operating the remote TV controller.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","The MEDIA CONTENT SYNCHRONIZED ADVERTISING PLATFORM APPARATUSES AND SYSTEMS provides a client-server interactive platform whereby a user may operate a general purpose personal mobile device (e.g., a smart phone, etc.) to receive a list of TV programs schedules and submit a selection of TV channel via the personal mobile device. In one implementation, the user may operate the personal mobile device as a TV remote controller. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may receive the user's selection of a channel and determine what media contents the user has elected to watch. In one implementation, the user's channel selection and viewing status may be populated to a social media platform, and the AD-SYNCH may obtain user response with regard to a TV program from the social media to perform analytics for TV program feedback review.","For example, in one implementation, a user may plug a AD-SYNCH accessory (e.g.,  in ) into his mobile device, such as a smartphone (e.g., an Apple iPhone, BlackBerry, Google Android, Palm, HTC Evo, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), laptop, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer (e.g., Apple iTouch, iPad, etc.), and\/or the like, to facilitate communication between the mobile device and a home TV set. In an alternative implementation, the AD-SYNCH accessory may be a standalone table top unit which may not need to be attached to a user mobile device. For example, the table top unit may communicate with a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a cell phone or mobile device and\/or the like via wired or wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). In further implementations, the table top unit may monitor audience activities as further illustrated in , E-H. Further implementations of the table top unit are illustrated in . Within implementations, a AD-SYNCH server may obtain real-time TV program listing, including the TV program schedule, advertisement schedule, and\/or the like, from a TV network. The user may then obtain the list of TV program schedules from the AD-SYNCH, e.g., as shown at  in . The user may then submit a channel selection, e.g., tap on the touch screen of the mobile device as shown at  in . In one implementation, upon receiving the user channel selection, the AD-SYNCH server may retrieve data record from a media content database and check program table to determine what's the TV program on air. For example, if the user selects the channel \u201cCBS,\u201d the AD-SYNCH may ascertain \u201cCBS\u201d has \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on air based on the timestamp when the user submits the selection. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may further retrieve a program table to obtain information with regard to the advertisement streamed during the intervals of the TV play \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and\/or the product placement advertisements tagged in the TV play \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on \u201cCBS.\u201d","In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH may parse commercial ad information retrieved at and generate prompt questions, surveys, and\/or the like . For example, if the AD-SYNCH determines the user is supposed to watch a series of \u201cAudi\u201d commercial during the show \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d the AD-SYNCH may prompt a survey including questions with regard to automobile purchasing. In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH may keep a record of advertisements that has played on channels the user has recently selected (e.g., for a period of past 2 weeks, etc.), and generate prompt questions based on such advertisements. In one implementation, the user may submit responses to such questions.","In a further implementation, when a user is provided a question with regard to an embedded advertisement in the TV show (e.g., \u201care you interested in the red bag the character is carrying?\u201d etc.), the user may submit a request to learn more and\/or purchase the product. In that case, the AD-SYNCH may provide a merchant URL to the user and\/or redirect the user to the merchant site.","In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may monitor whether the user is \u201cactually\u201d attending and watching the selected TV channel. For example, the user's mobile device may capture, aggregate and packetize atmospherics data (e.g., taking photos of the user, recoding audio clips, obtaining GPS information, etc.) and submit to the AD-SYNCH, which may in turn decode the atmospherics data to analyze ad effect and audience perception, as further illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["105","105","105","105"],"i":["a ","c ","b "]},"Within implementations, the AD-SYNCH platform  may interact with user mobile devices, e.g., PDAs, smart phones, etc., for targeted mobile advertisement delivery . For example, in one implementation, AD-SYNCH platform may obtain a TV viewing status information from a user's mobile device, and determine the TV program content the user is\/has been watching based on TV schedules, as further discussed in . When AD-SYNCH determines the user selected channel contains a TV ad of \u201cGeico\u201d , AD-SYNCH may deliver promotions, rewards, coupons, questionnaires, etc., related to \u201cGeico\u201d as a targeted ad to the user mobile device.","In one implementation, AD-SYNCH platform  may obtain data related to user interactive activities with regard to mobile ads, TV viewing, Internet  (including online browsing, purchasing, etc.), social media, and\/or the like to analyze ad effects, TV rating so that to determine delivery and performance of an advertisement campaign. Within implementations, the ad campaign planning , ad performance and ad delivery , may be separately executed by the AD-SYNCH platform  for each media type, e.g., TV, print, Internet, social media, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["115","120","115","130"]},"In one implementation, upon instantiating the downloaded AD-SYNCH client component, the user may receive a schedule listing of TV programs, and may select a channel that the user is interested. For example, the user may tap on the listed item to select \u201cCH2: CBS The Big Bang Theory .\u201d In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH plug-in accessory  may receive the indication of user channel selection and transmit such indication to the home TV set , and the TV  may switch to the channel \u201cCBS \u201d accordingly.","In a further implementation, the user's selection of channel \u201cCBS \u201d may be transmitted to a AD-SYNCH, which may in turn automatically populate a message on social media, e.g., a Facebook status update showing the user \u201cis watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS .\u201d In an alternative implementation, the user may elect to manually enter and populate the social media feeds via the AD-SYNCH client component instantiated on his personal mobile device.","For another example, the social message, e.g., a Tweet message, may contextually tag the text on key terms to indicate what the user is watching, e.g., the Tweet hashtags \u201c#The Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201c#CBS,\u201d etc. In one implementation, the hashtags may link to profile information of a TV show, including its scheduled airing time, crew information, description, and\/or the like. In further implementations, the Tweet hashtags may be employed for social content data taxonomy engine, as further illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["115","105"]},"As shown in one example in , the personal mobile device  may automatically snap a photo and\/or a video clip of the audience scene including the audience  watching the TV program . For example, the AD-SYNCH may be configured to snap a photo or video clip periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes, etc.). The AD-SYNCH may then packetize the obtained photo\/video clip as audience atmospherics data  for audience attendance analysis.","In further implementations, AD-SYNCH may include various data into the atmospherics data packets. For example, AD-SYNCH may \u201clisten\u201d and record an audio clip of the audience scene. For another example, AD-SYNCH may prompt the user to indicate how many audience are present to watch the on-going TV program. For another example, AD-SYNCH may monitor whether the user is engaging in other application activities on the personal mobile device , e.g., email(s), Facebook, browser activities, gaming applications, etc. For another example, AD-SYNCH may include GPS information of the personal mobile device  into the atmospherics data.","In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may be configured to automatically create photo\/video\/audio captures. In another implementation, AD-SYNCH may prompt the user to manually enter desired information, such as how many individuals are present to watch the TV program, and\/or request the user position the built-in camera of the mobile device to snap photos\/video clips. In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may provide promotion incentives for the user to cooperate with such requests, e.g., lottery opportunities, etc.","In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may analyze the obtained audience atmospherics data . For example, as shown in , AD-SYNCH may identify the number of audience  at an associated timestamp from an audience scene photo\/video  via face recognition software, e.g., Apple iPhoto face recognition, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIGS. 2 and 7B"],"b":["115","130","145","123","150","145","155","123"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1D","FIGS. 5A-5F"],"b":["150","180","185"]},"In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may generate a media analytics report  based on the obtained social media user comments to reflect audience reaction to the show \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d For example, in one implementation, the report may comprise statistical data with regard to audience age, demographics, occupation, etc. Further examples of media analytics report are discussed in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["233","220","250","270","219","280","250","213"],"i":"a"},"In one embodiment, the AD-SYNCH may receive a list of real time TV program .

Upon receiving a user request, the AD-SYNCH server  may determine whether the user has registered with AD-SYNCH . For example, in one implementation, the user may be a new user to the AD-SYNCH application service, who may just download and install the mobile application but has not registered. If the user is not registered , the user may be requested to submit registration information, such as user name, phone number, email address, residential address, and\/or the like for registration . The AD-SYNCH may also obtain a physical address, a hardware ID of the user mobile device, etc., for registration purposes.","In one implementation, upon registration, the AD-SYNCH server  may obtain and store a user application ID, and\/or a session ID  to start the AD-SYNCH service session. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH server  may obtain a real-time TV program listing , e.g., from a TV network, a TV broadcasting service, etc. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH server  may obtain the TV schedule updates on a periodical basis (e.g., daily, etc.), and store the TV schedule information at a TV schedule database. In one implementation, the user may receive a list of TV programs  via the AD-SYNCH application, e.g., see  in .","In one implementation, the user mobile device may send a user event message  to the AD-SYNCH server , and the AD-SYNCH server may monitor user event messages  from the user device. As discussed in  and will be further discussed in , the received user event at  may comprise a variety of events\/messages, such as, but not limited to user TV event (e.g., in ), user device application event (e.g.,  in ), atmospherics data (e.g.,  in ), social content (e.g., in ), response to ads\/surveys (e.g.,  in ), and\/or the like.

For another example, the user event message may comprise atmospherics data (as further illustrated in ), ad\/survey response (as further illustrated in ), social data (as further illustrated in ), non-live TV consumption message (as illustrated in . For example, in one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may determine the message types -based on the data structure, e.g., a field value of a field \u201cmessage type\u201d as shown in Table 2, message type code in the header information of a received data packet, and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2A"],"b":["289","289","2001","219","235"],"i":["b\/e","b\/e","a","a "]},"Within implementations, the AD-SYNCH may determine whether each received TV event message indicates a stable TV channel program selection, or a channel surfing. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH retrieve a list of unprocessed TV message records (e.g., grouped per user profile)  from the raw data store . For every two consecutively received messages , the AD-SYNCH may calculate the elapsed time in-between 2008, and determine whether the elapse time is greater than a pre-determined surfing threshold (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.). For example, when the elapsed time is shorter than the surfing threshold, indicating the user may be frequently switching channels to browse the program, the AD-SYNCH may not consider the channel selection message as effective TV viewing, and may filter such message records from TV viewing analysis .","In another implementation, when the elapsed time is greater than the surfing threshold , suggesting the user may at least spend an amount of time staying on the selected channel, the AD-SYNCH may further determine whether the elapsed time is greater than a capping threshold . For example, when the elapsed time is too long, greater than the capping threshold (e.g., 2 hours, 3 hours, etc.), it may suggest a user may just let the TV on without watching. In such cases, AD-SYNCH may apply capping edit rules to compute a \u201creal\u201d watching time . For example, if the elapsed time between a first TV channel switch and a second channel switch is 5 hours, the AD-SYNCH may not log 5 hours as the watching time for the first selected channel, as the capping threshold is 2 hours. The AD-SYNCH may in turn determine the watching time of the first selected channel as capped by a STB\/TV off event (e.g., when a STB\/TV off event is received during the elapsed time, the watching time may not exceed the timestamp of the STB\/TV off event), TV program end time (e.g., when the playing TV program on the first selected channel ends during the elapsed time, the watching time is calculated as the time elapse between the first TV channel event and the TV program end time), and\/or the like, e.g., at . In further implementations, the AD-SYNCH may apply cutoff thresholds based on historical heuristics via statistical analysis . For example, the AD-SYNCH may determine the watching time based on individual habits, e.g., a user has been observed to stay on the same channel for at most 1 hour, etc. For another example, the cut-off threshold may be analyzed by channel, e.g., 1 hour on CBS, 2 hours on ABC family, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, when the elapsed time does not exceed a capping threshold at , and\/or when the watching time has been re-calculated based on capping rules at , the AD-SYNCH may retrieve TV program information on the user selected channel , and generate a user channel selection log file . For example, the log file may comprise fields such as user ID, channel ID, channel selection time, user watching time, channel program name, channel program ID, and\/or the like. Such generated log files may be fed to a user TV viewing data engine  for audience analytics . For example, the audience analytics database may be utilized to analyze TV viewing rates of a TV program, product\/brand impression of advertised products during the user watching time, and\/or the like. Exemplary audience analytics reports are discussed at .","the AD-SYNCH server  may retrieve TV program information to determine the TV program played on the user selected channel . For example, the AD-SYNCH may query on a TV program table (e.g., obtained at  at ) based on an instant timestamp and the user selected channel. The AD-SYNCH may log the user channel selection with the timestamp  in a database, e.g., at in .","In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may generate TV viewing data for the retrieve TV program . In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may associate the user selection to the TV viewing rate of the retrieved TV program, and may refine the TV viewing rate with atmospherics analytics at . For example, in one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may monitor groups of audience's channel selection, wherein the audience groups may be defined based on age, geography, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may generate an audience summary via a dashboard, e.g., see .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 2E","b":["18","289","289","296","296"],"i":["a","a","a","b"]},"In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH may incorporate the received device application status (e.g., ) for user activity analytics. For example, the AD-SYNCH may capture active application s running on the device from the received device application data, and determine user activities when viewing , e.g., emailing, browsing Internet content, texting, video gaming, and\/or the like. Such indicated user activity data may be incorporated into audience attendance estimation .","In one implementation, the artifact may comprise a visual data file , such as a video file (e.g., \u201cwmv,\u201d \u201cmp4,\u201d \u201cavi,\u201d \u201crm,\u201d etc.), an image file (e.g., \u201cJPEG,\u201d \u201cbmp,\u201d \u201ctiff,\u201d \u201cgif,\u201d etc.), and\/or the like. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may determine graphical content  of the visual file. For example, the AD-SYNCH may perform image analysis to determine whether the photo image, and\/or video frames comprise a scene of audience, and\/or a TV screen. In one implementation, a mobile application at the user mobile device, e.g., iPhone, etc., may perform face recognition at a photo taken at an iPhone, and integrate such data in the atmospherics data package, e.g., an iPhoto including two faces, etc. In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH server may perform facial recognition to determine audience presence . In other implementations, the AD-SYNCH server may perform image analysis to determine user activities in the photo image, e.g., reading a book, doing housework, and\/or the like. In further implementations, a AD-SYNCH panelist may review the photo image and determine audience status.","In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH may determine whether a TV screen image matches the TV program associated with the user channel selection , e.g., the user may switch to watch recorded program (e.g., TiVo, DVD player, etc.) instead of live TV program on the channel, and in such cases, the AD-SYNCH may not receive an indication of such change. For example, in one implementation, AD-SYNCH may perform image analysis to determine whether the received image photo (and\/or a video frame grab) contains a TV screen shot , e.g., by detecting edges of a rectangular shaped object on the image, etc. For another example, the AD-SYNCH may store a plurality of sample screen shots from the TV program played at the user submitted channel, and may compare the received image photo with each of the stored sample screen shots. In further implementations, a AD-SYNCH panelist may assist in reviewing and determining whether the user TV screen matches the played TV program. In one implementation, if the AD-SYNCH determines the user is absent from a TV set, or engaging in other activities from the graphic analysis, AD-SYNCH may generate negative heuristics with regard to TV viewing data of the TV program on air.","In another implementation, if the received atmospherics data comprises an audio artifact (e.g., with a file extension of \u201cway,\u201d \u201cmp3,\u201d \u201cape,\u201d \u201cm4a,\u201d etc.), the AD-SYNCH may perform audio analysis to determine a content of the audio . For example, the AD-SYNCH may analyze the frequency range of the audio content to determine the sound source, e.g., whether it is human voice, ambient noise, media broadcasting, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, if the audio content comprises human voice (e.g., within the frequency range 60\u02dc7000 Hz), the AD-SYNCH may determine whether the human voice is from the audience or broadcasting media. For example, the AD-SYNCH may perform voice recognition to determine whether the human voice matches with any of the characters in the TV program on air on the user submitted channel, e.g., at .. If not, the AD-SYNCH may determine such human voices may indicate audience presence , e.g., whether more than one user is present with the TV set.","In further implementations, if the audio file comprises human voice, the AD-SYNCH may extract verbal content from the audio file to determine whether an audience conversation, or a human conversation from media playing, is related to the TV program on air on the user submitted channel .. For example, the AD-SYNCH may adopt speech recognition software (e.g., Nuance, IBM WebSphere Voice, etc.) to extract key terms from the conversation, and compare whether the key terms are related to key words stored with the TV program in the database. For example, if AD-SYNCH extracts key terms \u201cquantum mechanics,\u201d \u201cphysics,\u201d \u201cbig bang,\u201d etc., from the human conversation in the received atmospherics audio artifact, and the user submitted channel CBS is playing \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d AD-SYNCH may determine the audience is watching the show on air. In such cases, the AD-SYNCH may not need to distinguish whether the human conversation in the audio file is from the audience or TV, but focus on mining the content of the conversation.","In another implementation, if the AD-SYNCH determines the audio artifact comprises ambient noise, AD-SYNCH may determine an environment of the audience . For example, if the background is overly noisy, the user may not be watching the TV program.","In another implementation, if the AD-SYNCH determines the audio artifact comprises media sound (e.g., music, etc.), the AD-SYNCH may determine whether the audio media content matches the TV program on air on the user submitted channel via a media recognition software (e.g., a Shazam alike music recognition kit, etc.). For example, if the user selected channel CBS has \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d scheduled at the moment, but the AD-SYNCH determines a Lady Gaga song in the received audio atmospherics, this may indicate the user is not watching the TV program. In one implementation, if the AD-SYNCH determines the user is distracted from the TV program based on the audio content, AD-SYNCH may generate negative heuristics with regard to TV viewing data of the TV program on air.","In an alternative implementation, the AD-SYNCH client component, which may be instantiated on a user mobile device (e.g., a downloadable application such as, but not limited to an iPhone application, an Android application, etc.) and\/or a table top standalone unit, may obtain atmospherics data to determine the program the user is watching without user indication of the channel. For example, the AD-SYNCH component may obtain audio recording, video recording, signatures image captures, and\/or the like of the audience watching environment, and submit the obtained data to AD-SYNCH server. In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH server may analyze the obtained data to determine what the audience is watching in a similar manner as illustrated at ,  in , but without the user's channel selection indication.","In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may perform an audio\/video recognition procedure to identify a TV program, e.g., via digital signatures embedded in the program, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH may extract key terms from the audio\/video captures, and form a query on a database of TV programs to find a match. For example, in one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may extract textual terms from the obtained audio media program excerpts, such as \u201cbig bang,\u201d \u201cquantum physics,\u201d \u201cSheldon,\u201d etc., and may form a query in a database of TV programs which may return a result indicating the obtained audio media program excerpt may be related to the TV show \u201cBig Bang Theory.\u201d","In an alternative implementation, rather than uploading sampling and\/or the entirety of the captured audio\/video median content, the AD-SYNCH may analyze the recorded audio\/video content to generate a unique signature and\/or a unique hash, which may be used for further matching. For example, the unique signature\/hash may take a form similar to a sequence of 0-1 representation of a sampling of the recorded media content. In one implementation, the signature\/hash generation may be performed at a user device (e.g., the user's mobile phone, the table top unit, etc.), which may upload the generated signature\/hash sequence to the AD-SYNCH server. In another implementation, the user device may upload media content sampling, clips or the captured entirety to the AD-SYNCH server, which may then perform the signature generation. Within implementations, software tools\/components such as, but not limited to i-brainz, and\/or the like may be adopted to generate audio signature\/hash.","In further implementations, such \u201clisten-in\u201d activities may be performed on a standalone table unit, which may communicate with a user computer via a wireless network, and\/or transmit the \u201clisten-in\u201d results to the AD-SYNCH server.","In further implementations, lighting sensor data may indicate the lighting condition of the user environment to determine the viewing status. GPS information contained in the atmospherics data may indicate whether the user is located with the home TV , e.g., by comparing the instant GPS location with a registered user residential address, etc.","In one implementation, AD-SYNCH may analyze the variety of atmospherics data to determine whether the user should be accorded as a \u201cviewer\u201d of the real-time TV program on air. In one implementation, as shown in , the AD-SYNCH server may adopt a procedure to generate a progressive weighted sum of atmospherics scores to determine whether the user is \u201cwatching\u201d or \u201cnot watching.\u201d When the weighted sum of different atmospherics scores exceeds a predetermined threshold, the user may be considered \u201cnot watching,\u201d and the AD-SYNCH may not need to proceed with further atmospherics analysis to improve efficiency of the atmospherics analytics.","For example, at in  (e.g., comparing received user GPS information with the user's registered residential address in ), the AD-SYNCH may determine an address type , and may assign a weight to the GPS atmospherics factor based on the address type from an atmospherics GPS weight table . For example, the atmospherics GPS weight table may assign 0.1 to a residential address, 0.2 to a Starbucks store, 1.0 to an outdoor address (e.g., a national park, etc.), and\/or the like.

For example, AD-SYNCH may provide incentives of promotional rewards, points, coupons and\/or the like to users during questionnaire distribution (e.g., AD-SYNCH mobile questionnaires , etc) to allow AD-SYNCH access to their social content.","In one implementation, if the user agrees to provide the access to their social content, the permission component may get the authorization token from the respective social platforms (Facebook, twitter etc) as per the authorization protocol and persist the token in a repository . The user permission component may pass the user token and other application authorization details to social analytics platform so that the user's social content can be extracted at a scheduled frequency.

For another example, the user may visit a AD-SYNCH social data panel management website (e.g., as illustrated in one example in ). In each case, AD-SYNCH may provide a sign up link to a social media platform to the user. Upon user clicking the link, the AD-SYNCH may verify whether the user previously authorized AD-SYNCH to access their Facebook or Twitter information on their behalf and their previous authorization token (e.g.,  in ) is not expired.","In another implementation, the AD-SYNCH may receive user attempts to log in and determine whether the user is authorized to grant social media data access permission for AD-SYNCH. For example, when a user has received an email from a social media platform (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) comprising a AD-SYNCH link for authentication and the user clicks the link to proceed to grant permissions for AD-SYNCH, the user may deemed authorized to configure social media permissions via AD-SYNCH. In another implementation, when AD-SYNCH determines the user is not authorized, AD-SYNCH may redirect the user to a social media page with a AD-SYNCH application ID and a permission attribute request, e.g., as discussed at  in .","In one implementation, the AD-SYNCH may determine whether access is approved by the user, e.g., the user may select \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cCancel\u201d to indicate permission decision for AD-SYNCH to access the user's social media content when the social media platform sent an email notification indicating the access request from AD-SYNCH, e.g., at  in .","For example, if the previous authorization is not valid or if it is a first time access then the AD-SYNCH application may use oAuth protocol to request Facebook or Twitter to provide access to user profile and messages (e.g., sending an access request  as shown in ). In such cases, the user may be redirected to Facebook or Twitter web site with request to log in and provide access parameters, e.g., see  in , and  in . Facebook or Twitter web site may present a login and permission screen with option to allow or deny requested access to AD-SYNCH (e.g., see  at ).","In one implementation, if the user approves the access request then in the response Facebook or Twitter may provide an authentication token associated with permission to the data elements (e.g.,  at ). In one implementation, the authentication tokens may be requested with constant permission to allow user data access even when the user is neither logged into AD-SYNCH user portal (e.g., the mobile app or the web based app ) nor any social media platform. In alternative implementations, the authentication token may request timely update and re-authentication from user on a periodic basis, e.g., weekly, monthly, etc. In further implementations, the user may revoke access of AD-SYNCH from to their social media account if they wish to opt out.","If the user granted the permission, AD-SYNCH may save the authorization response token provided by the social media platform in a user repository . The authentication token may be used in all subsequent requests to social networking sites to access user's data elements. In another implementation, if the user did not grant permission, the user may continue with the mobile application or the web based panel management website ","Upon establishing and\/or confirm user authorization for social media access, AD-SYNCH server may generate social messages to populate to social media platforms via AD-SYNCH , e.g., see in , in , etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0207"},"figref":["FIG. 5D","FIG. 5A"],"b":["540","543","545"]},"For example, if the data record is obtained from Facebook, the data format analytics may determine whether it is structured user profile information, a user posted photo, unstructured user posting on the wall, others' comments, and\/or the like.

One type of program is a computer operating system, which, may be executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, which may be facilitated through a database program.

In another embodiment, the cryptographic processor and\/or transceivers may be connected as either internal and\/or external peripheral devices  via the interface bus I\/O. In turn, the transceivers may be connected to antenna(s) , thereby effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and\/or sensor protocols; for example the antenna(s) may connect to: a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 5.0, FM, global positioning system (GPS) (thereby allowing AD-SYNCH controller to determine its location)); Broadcom BCM4329FKUBG transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, FM, etc.); a Broadcom BCM47501UB8 receiver chip (e.g., GPS); an Infineon Technologies X-Gold 618-PMB9800 (e.g., providing 2G\/3G HSDPA\/HSUPA communications); and\/or the like. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization's circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that may increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests.

Additionally, processors may include internal fast access addressable memory, and be capable of mapping and addressing memory  beyond the processor itself; internal memory may include, but is not limited to: fast registers, various levels of cache memory (e.g., level 1, 2, 5, etc.), RAM, etc. The processor may access this memory through the use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address, which the processor can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and\/or Motorola's DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and\/or transportive conduits (e.g., (printed) electronic and\/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code) according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the AD-SYNCH controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and\/or capacity, distributed processors (e.g., Distributed AD-SYNCH), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants  (PDAs) may be employed.","Depending on the particular implementation, features of the AD-SYNCH may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST's R8051XC2 microcontroller; Intel's MCS 51 (i.e., 8051 microcontroller); and\/or the like. Also, to implement certain features of the AD-SYNCH, some feature implementations may rely on embedded components, such as: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), Digital Signal Processing (\u201cDSP\u201d), Field Programmable Gate Array (\u201cFPGA\u201d), and\/or the like embedded technology.

Alternately, some implementations of the AD-SYNCH may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.","Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded components may include software solutions, hardware solutions, and\/or some combination of both hardware\/software solutions. For example, AD-SYNCH features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs, which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called \u201clogic blocks\u201d, and programmable interconnects, such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and\/or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the AD-SYNCH features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the AD-SYNCH system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the AD-SYNCH may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate AD-SYNCH controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the 9 \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the AD-SYNCH.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like.

In one example, the power source  is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source  is provided through a connection across the I\/O  interface. For example, a USB and\/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.","Interface bus(ses)  may accept, connect, and\/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as but not limited to: input output interfaces (I\/O) 1108, storage interfaces , network interfaces , and\/or the like. Optionally, cryptographic processor interfaces  similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture.

Peripheral devices often include types of input devices (e.g., cameras).","It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed, the AD-SYNCH controller may be embodied as an embedded, dedicated, and\/or monitor-less (i.e., headless) device, wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.","Cryptographic units such as, but not limited to, microcontrollers, processors , interfaces , and\/or devices  may be attached, and\/or communicate with the AD-SYNCH controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller, manufactured by Motorola Inc., may be used for and\/or within cryptographic units. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16-bit multiply-and-accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512-bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents, as well as allowing for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of the CPU. Equivalent microcontrollers and\/or processors may also be used. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include: Broadcom's CryptoNetX and other Security Processors; nCipher's nShield; SafeNet's Luna PCI (e.g., 7100) series; Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner 184; Sun's Cryptographic Accelerators (e.g., Accelerator 6000 PCIe Board, Accelerator 500 Daughtercard); Via Nano Processor (e.g., L2100, L2200, U2400) line, which is capable of performing 500+6 MB\/s of cryptographic instructions; VLSI Technology's 53 MHz 6868; and\/or the like.","Generally, any mechanization and\/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and\/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the AD-SYNCH controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; however, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  may include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and\/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., Blueray, CD ROM\/RAM\/Recordable (R)\/ReWritable (RW), DVD R\/RW, HD DVD R\/RW etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); solid state memory devices (USB memory, solid state drives (SSD), etc.); other processor-readable storage mediums; and\/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the AD-SYNCH component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the AD-SYNCH controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan ; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and\/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS\/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista\/XP (Server), Palm OS, and\/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may facilitate the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the AD-SYNCH controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the AD-SYNCH controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective\u2212) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, dynamic (D) hypertext markup language (HTML), FLASH, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, wireless application protocol (WAP), WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the AD-SYNCH controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the AD-SYNCH database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the AD-SYNCH database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below 12 (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the AD-SYNCH. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the AD-SYNCH as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, capabilities, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/XP\/Vista\/7 (i.e., Aero), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Also, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the AD-SYNCH enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective\u2212) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POPS), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the AD-SYNCH.","Access to the AD-SYNCH mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces may allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the AD-SYNCH may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the AD-SYNCH component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the AD-SYNCH and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The AD-SYNCH database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the AD-SYNCH database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the AD-SYNCH database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the AD-SYNCH database  may be integrated into another component such as the AD-SYNCH component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A user accounts table includes fields such as, but not limited to: a UserID, UserName, UserPassword, UserAddress, UserDeviceID, UserViewingHistory, UserRating, UserPreference, and\/or the like. The User table may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on a AD-SYNCH.

A Taxonomy table includes fields such as, but not limited to: TaxpID, TaxoName, TaxoProducType, TaxoKeyWords, TaxoTreeNode, TaxoLevel, TaxoLabels, and\/or the like. A User Token table includes fields such as, but not limited to: TokenID, TokenUserID, TokenSocialID, TokenSocialSource, TokenNumber, TokenFile, and\/or the like. An Analytics Weight Scores table  includes fields such as, but not limited to: ScoreID, ScoreName, ScoreFactorAttribute, ScoreWeight, ScoreDescription, ScoreIndication, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the AD-SYNCH database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search AD-SYNCH component may treat the combination of the AD-SYNCH database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the AD-SYNCH. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the AD-SYNCH may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers  (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The AD-SYNCH may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The AD-SYNCH database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the AD-SYNCH database communicates with the AD-SYNCH component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The AD-SYNCH component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the AD-SYNCH component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the AD-SYNCH that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the AD-SYNCH affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The AD-SYNCH transforms TV program schedule listing information and user channel selection via AD-SYNCH components, such as real time TV , ad survey synchronization , atmospherics analysis , audience statistics analysis , social media connection , media analytics  and\/or the like into TV audience viewing data and ad effects data.","The AD-SYNCH component facilitates access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective\u2212) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the AD-SYNCH server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The AD-SYNCH component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the AD-SYNCH component communicates with the AD-SYNCH database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The AD-SYNCH may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the AD-SYNCH node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the AD-SYNCH controller may depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like.
