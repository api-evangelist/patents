title: Mobile sensor network
abstract: A sensor network may be created by collecting information from a plurality of mobile devices, such as cellular telephones. The mobile devices use sensors, such as microphones, cameras, accelerometers, biometric readers, etc. to detect the sensory information. Sensory output related to detected sensory information may be transmitted from a mobile device to a receiver that receives the sensory outputs. The received sensory outputs from a plurality of mobile devices may be aggregated to generate aggregated data, which may be transmitted to one or more receivers that use the aggregated data to perform a function and/or present the aggregated data to a user. Additionally, the aggregated data may be reviewed by a reviewer component that can create (revised) detection instructions regarding how one or more mobile devices are to detect sensory information and/or what sensory information to detect (e.g., to make resulting aggregated data more relevant).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile devices such as cellular telephones, global positioning systems, and laptop computers are becoming increasingly popular through the world, and manufactures of these devices are constantly releasing new and improved devices that push the limits of technology. Today, many of these devices include microphones, accelerometers, cameras, positioning sensors, biometric sensors, and other sensing elements that may collect information about a user and\/or a user's surroundings. For example, a positioning (e.g., GPS) sensor may determine a person's geographical location. Information collected from the positioning sensor may be combined with mapping software that provides some geographical context (e.g., what streets or restaurants are nearby). While this information is useful, its availability and relevancy is limited to the user and those with whom they explicitly share it.","To provide information more relevant to a larger community of many users as well as increase the coverage area, sensor networks are often deployed. Sensor networks are typically configured to measure a specific aspect of the physical environmental. For example, a sensor network may be deployed to monitor traffic on major highways near a large city or to monitor temperature or acoustics in an industrial complex. These sensor networks are often comprised of a plurality of sensor nodes (e.g., comprising sensor(s), local storage, a processor, and transceiver), that are positioned in particular areas of interests and are stationary during the collection process (e.g., the sensor nodes do not move while information is collected). The sensor nodes are configured to periodically transmit data to a computing system that collects and aggregates the data from the plurality of strategically placed sensor nodes. The aggregated data may then be used to provide information relevant to the larger community (e.g., how bad rush hour traffic is, how hot the building is, etc.).","While sensor networks, such as the one described above, have proven effective, there are significant limitations to these sensor networks. For example, the sensor nodes are often fixed and\/or tethered to the environment so they cannot be easily moved and\/or repositioned once they are put into place. Additionally, the sensor nodes are typically configured for one-way communication and are configured to measure only a predefined matrix (e.g., speed, temperature, heart rate, etc.). Therefore, the sensor network is not adaptable to changing interests of the community.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for aggregating data from mobile devices to create a sensory network is provided herein. The mobile devices act as sensor nodes of the sensory network. Sensory information (e.g., sight, sound, speed, heart rate, etc.) is detected using one or more sensors on a mobile device (e.g., a laptop, cellular telephone, car, etc.) and sensory output is generated. This sensory output may be received by a collector and transmitted to an aggregator that aggregates sensory output from a plurality of mobile devices to generate aggregated data. The aggregated data may then be transmitted to a receiver that receives the aggregated data and is configured to present the aggregated data to a user and\/or to use the aggregated data to perform a function (e.g., to determine whether to turn on a heating system, to determine whether to reroute a vehicle because of traffic on a particular road, etc.).","The aggregated data may also be reviewed (e.g., by a reviewer component) to improve the relevance of the information detected. For example, the reviewer component may instruct a device that is detecting sensory information in a first manner to begin detecting sensory information in a second manner. Additionally, the reviewer component may instruct a device that is not detecting information to begin detecting information. For example, if the aggregator does not have enough sensory outputs to aggregate, the reviewer component may instruct additional mobile devices to begin detecting information and transmitting the information to the collector. In this way, the reviewer component may alter the information the aggregator is aggregating.","The sensory nodes are mobile devices, allowing sensors to be positioned in places where sensor nodes are not normally positioned, as well as to move to the areas of interest, thus following people. In this way, information related to areas that traditionally do not have sensory nodes (e.g., residential roads where traffic sensors are rarely located) may be detected. Additionally, by using mobile devices that are already utilized by many people, such as cellular telephones, the sensory network may be cost effective to build and operate (relative to currently used sensory networks).","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","As provided herein mobile devices are used as nodes of a sensor network. Particular applicability is with regard to the use of cellular telephones, but other mobile devices may be used as well. Data related to sensory information detected from one or more sensors of the sensor nodes may be transmitted to a computing system that aggregates the data and generates aggregated data. The aggregated data may be transmitted to a receiver configured to present a portion of the aggregated data to a user and\/or to perform a function based upon aggregated data. Additionally, the computing system may communicate with the sensor nodes, instructing the sensor nodes what information to collect or when to collect it, for example. A goal of such a network may be to provide a sensor network that is flexible, adaptable, and\/or mobile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104"]},"The mobile device may act similar to sensor nodes commonly used in sensor networks known to those skilled in the art. For example, the mobile device may comprise one or more sensors (e.g., accelerometers, cameras, microphones, biometric receivers, positioning receivers, temperature probes, etc.), a processor, and\/or a transceiver. In this way, the mobile device may detect sensory information, such as the volume of a room, the temperature of a room, the speed a mobile device is traveling, etc. and generate sensory output. It will be understood and appreciated that mobile devices as referenced herein may also locally process or otherwise transform detected sensory information (e.g., perform signal processing, perform data computations, etc.), and that sensory output as referenced herein is intended to comprise such processed information. By way of example, a cellular telephone may perform signal processing, for example, on a noise level detected by a microphone of the mobile device, and may then transmit sensory output (e.g., datum) corresponding to this \u201ctreated\u201d information. Accordingly, sensory output from a mobile device as provided herein also comprises information that may be (pre)processed in some manner by the mobile device. The generated sensory output may be transmitted (e.g., through an allowed wireless frequency) to a receiver. In one example, the mobile device is a cellular telephone and the sensory output is transmitted through a 3G or similar data connection to a cellular telephone transceiver.","The manner in which the sensory information is detected may vary depending upon the type of information being detected, the configurations of the mobile device, and\/or the configurations of the sensor network. For example, the mobile device may be configured to detect sensory information at predefined intervals (e.g., every five minutes the sensor is activated for four seconds). In another example, the mobile device may be configured to detect sensory information with a first set of sensors during a first temporal interval and a second set of sensors during a second temporal interval. In this way, the information collected may vary based upon the time of day, the type of information that is relevant (e.g., traffic patterns during rush hour and\/or restaurant crowds during a lunch break), etc.","There are numerous ways for determining when the sensory output may be transmitted from the mobile device to a computing system (e.g., configured to collect the transmitted data). For example, the mobile device may be configured to upload the sensory output at predetermined intervals (e.g., every five minutes). In another example, the output is transmitted based upon user endorsement and\/or initialization (e.g., the user selects an upload icon on the mobile device). In yet another example, a notification, instructing the first mobile device when to transmit data, may be sent to the mobile device from the computing system. In this way, the computing system may collect sensory output when it is relevant (e.g., when few other mobile devices are transmitting similar sensory output to the computing system) and may not collect it when it is not relevant, saving the mobile device's resources (e.g., battery life) from unnecessary uploads. In one example, the notification instructs the first mobile device to determine information that is relevant when there is a substantial change in the sensory information being detected (e.g., the temperature drops by two degrees, the mobile device decelerates at a certain rate, such as by at least ten miles per hour while traveling on a highway, etc.). Stated differently, the notification (e.g., transmitted to the mobile device from the computing system) may instruct the mobile device to filter the sensory information being detected and generate sensory output related to less than all of the sensory information the mobile device detects. In this way, the sensors of the sensor network may be dynamically controlled (e.g., by the computing system).","For privacy and security purposes, an owner\/user of a mobile device may place limitations on the sensory information that is detected\/collected and\/or the sensory output that is transmitted to the computing system. For example, where a notification is sent, the user may have to select or otherwise endorse the notification (e.g., displayed on the mobile device) before the first sensory output is transmitted to the computing system. Additionally, user specified parameters for detecting sensory information and\/or transmitting sensory output may be set. For example, a user may create an instruction that has the mobile device automatically turn off the transceiver when the user is inside his\/her home (e.g., based upon a GPS or other positioning receiver in the mobile device). The user may also control which sensors of the mobile device are usable by the sensor network. For example, a user may allow the sensory output to comprise sensory information detected by an accelerometer, but may not allow the sensory output to comprise sensory information detected by a microphone.","To provide an incentive for users to allow sensory information to be detected on their mobile device and\/or transmitted to a receiver configured to receive sensory output, a service provider (e.g., the entity that manages the sensory network, the cellular telephone provider, etc.) may provide an incentive for collecting and uploading information. For example, the service provider may offer credits, refunds and\/or raffles, etc. if certain mobile devices (e.g., that are in areas of interests) transmit information to the receiver. In this way, a user may be incentivized to permit sensory output to be transmitted to a receiver.","At , second sensory output, indicative of sensory information detected in a second manner, is received from a second mobile device. It will be appreciated that the second mobile device may be a mobile device configured similar to the first mobile device (e.g., they may both be cellular telephones) or they may be configured differently (e.g., the first device may be a cellular telephone and the second may be a laptop computer). Additionally, the second manner for detecting sensory information may be similar to the first manner. For example, the first and second devices may utilize similar sensors to detect sensory information and\/or may detect sensory information for similar time intervals. Alternatively, the second manner may be different from the first manner. For example, the first mobile device may comprise different sensors than the second mobile device so the manner in which the information is collected may be different (e.g., the first mobile device may determine speed from an accelerometer and the second mobile device may determine speed based upon a rate of change according to its GPS).","It will be understood to those skilled in that art that the means by which the first and second sensory outputs are received may the different. For example, the first mobile device may utilize a 3G data connection to transmit data whereas the second mobile device may utilize an IEEE 802.11 protocol. Likewise, one and\/or both of the first and second mobile devices may comprise local storage and the sensory output may be received by the receiver when the mobile devices are plugged into a fiber optic or other transmission line.","At , the first and second sensory outputs are aggregated to produce aggregated data, and the aggregated data is reviewed to determine a detection instruction at . A detection instruction is configured to instruct at least one mobile device to detect sensory information differently and\/or to instruct a mobile device that has not detected particular sensory information to being detecting the particular sensory information. For example, the detection instruction may instruct a sensor of the mobile device to take a noise sampling every four minutes instead of every ten minutes. In another example, the detection instruction may instruct a device that is in a geographic location of interest (e.g., a remote area where few other mobile devices are located) to begin detecting the temperature.","The detection instruction may be transmitted to a third mobile device configured to receive the instruction. At , a third sensory output from the third mobile device is received. The third sensory output is indicative of sensory information detected in a third manner according to the detection instruction. That is, the detection instruction influences the manner in which sensory information is detected. For example, the detection instruction may instruct the mobile device how often to detect sensory information and\/or what sensory information to collect. In this way, sensory information detected by the third mobile device may be customized based upon the current needs of the sensory network (e.g., the computing system may inform the third mobile device what sensors it should use to detect sensory information that would be more useful for the computing system).","It will be appreciated that the third mobile device and the first mobile device may be the same device. In this way, the detection instruction may provide feedback based upon the received first sensory output (e.g., creating two-way communication). For example, if the computing system determines that the first mobile device could provide additional relevant information based upon the information obtained from the first sensory output, the computing system may generate a detection instruction that instructs the first mobile device to use additional sensors to detect the additional relevant information. Alternatively, the detection instruction may instruct the first mobile device to continue detecting sensory information in the same manner (e.g., the first and third manners are the same).","It will be understood to those skilled in the art that two-way communication between the computing system (e.g., that aggregates sensory outputs) and mobile devices (e.g., that serve as sensor nodes) may be an improvement upon currently implemented, one-way communication, sensor networks. For example, with two-way communication, the information that is collected may change depending upon time of day, location of the mobile devices, etc. In this way, the sensory network may be flexible and the sensory information that is gathered may be adjusted according to the community's interests (e.g., dynamically controlling the sensors of the sensor network). For example, during a concert, the community may be interested in how crowded the concert arena is, so sensors that detect location may be turned on (e.g., to count the number of people). However, after the concert, the community may be more interested in how traffic is flowing, so the computing system may instruct sensors that detect speed to turn on.","At , the aggregated data is transmitted to a first receiver configured to use the aggregated data to perform a function and\/or present a user with a trend, for example. In one embodiment, the first receiver is a desktop computer that controls a portion of the environment being monitored by the mobile devices. For example, the mobile devices may be located inside an industrial complex and may be configured to monitor temperature, and the aggregated data may be transmitted to a computer that controls the HVAC system of the industrial complex. In this way, the heating and cooling of a building may be controlled based upon sensors (e.g., cell phones sitting on desks) that are nearer people rather than by thermostats located in a fixed locations of the building.","At , the method ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100"]},"The system  comprises a collector  configured to receive sensory outputs, indicative of detected sensory information, from at least a first  and a second  mobile devices. The mobile devices  and  detect sensory information from sensors  and  operably coupled to their respective mobile devices  and . From the sensory information detected, the mobile devices  and  may respectively generate sensory outputs. It will be appreciated that multiple sensors may be operably coupled to a single mobile device.","The mobile devices  and  generally comprise a transmitter configured to transmit their respective sensory outputs to the collector . For example, one or both of the mobile devices  and  may be a cellular telephone configured to transmit sensory output through a 3G data connection, or similar data connection, for example, to a cellular telephone tower The tower may, in turn, transmit the sensory outputs to the collector . Likewise, one or both of the mobile devices  and  may be laptop computers configured to transmit sensory output through an IEEE 802.11 protocol, for example. In another example, one or both of the mobile devices  and  comprise local storage and the sensory output is stored in the local storage until the mobile device(s) are connected to a fiber optic transmission line.","Once the collector  receives the sensory outputs, it is transmitted to an aggregator  that aggregates the received sensory outputs and generates aggregated data. The aggregator  is configured to aggregate the information according to a common characteristic of the sensory outputs from two or more mobile devices. For example, the aggregator  may be configured to aggregate, or rather group, sensory output related to mobile devices on a bus to determine how crowded a bus is, or how loud it is inside the bus. It will be understood to those skilled in the art that the larger the network of sensors, the more reliable the aggregated data may be. For example, aggregated data based upon the sensory outputs of two mobile devices may be less reliable for determining the sound level of a building than aggregated data based upon a cluster of (e.g., 50 or more) mobile devices.","It will be appreciated that the aggregator  may aggregate all or less than all of the information received from the at least two sensory outputs using techniques known to those skilled in the art. For example, the aggregator  may discard sensory output that is related to sensory information that is not relevant to the community. For example, if a mobile sensor is inside a car, sensory output related to the noise level inside the car may not be relevant to the community (e.g., because no one other than those inside the car likely care about how noisy the car is) so the aggregator may discard sensory output related to noise level.","The aggregator  may be configured to aggregate information according to predefined categories of interest and\/or the aggregator may use learning techniques that train the aggregator to aggregate information according to the desired output. For example, people are more interested in a particular topic at certain times (e.g., based on search queries conducted on the internet), the aggregator  may determine that particular sensory information is more relevant, and accordingly, aggregate information into categories relevant to the topic.","It will also be appreciated that the aggregator  may be configured to aggregate information into user specific categories (e.g., the aggregator may aggregate the information according to a specific entity's request). For example, the owner of a building may request that the aggregator  aggregate sensory outputs from mobile devices in a first portion of a building to determine the temperature of the first portion building and aggregate sensory outputs from mobile devices in a second portion of the building to determine the acoustics of the second portion of the building. In this way, the owner of the building may use existing sensors (e.g., on the employees cellular phones) to cheaply determine how to make improvements on the building, for example.","The system  also comprises a reviewer component  operably coupled to the aggregator  and configured to review the aggregated data to determine a detection instruction that may be transmitted to a third mobile device . The detection instruction is configured to influence how the third mobile device  detects sensory information. For example, the detection instruction may instruct the third mobile device to detect sensory information every five minutes and\/or the detection instruction may instruct the third mobile device what sensor(s)  to activate to collect particular sensory information.","Influenced by the detection instruction, the third mobile device  may detect sensory information using a sensor  and generate sensory output that may be transmitted to the collector . This sensory output may then be transmitted to the aggregator , wherein the aggregator  may reaggregate the sensory outputs and generate second aggregate data, for example.","The system  may also comprises a transmitter  operably coupled to the aggregator  and configured to transmit the aggregated data to a receiver . The receiver  may be a mobile device, such as the first , second , or third  mobile devices and\/or it may be a more static device, such as a desktop computer, for example.","Aggregated data received by the receiver  may then be presented to a user in a user readable form and\/or may be used to assist the receiver  in performing a function (e.g., determining whether to activate a heating unit). For example, the aggregated data may be used by the receiver  to provide a user  with information on how crowded a bus is so that the user  can decide whether to drive to work or ride the bus. Likewise, the user  may be a bus company and the company may use the information to adjust throughput (e.g., by dispatching additional buses). In another example, the receiver  may provide a city planner with information about which portions of the city's roads have significant traffic backups.","While much of the information the receiver  provides to the user may be acquired through the current sensor networks (e.g., that utilize static sensor nodes dedicated to detecting particular sensory information), it will be appreciated that the exemplary system  may be more flexible, provide more information, and may be cheaper to implement than current sensor networks. For example, unlike static networks that utilize static sensor nodes, the mobile devices may be easily moved from location to location (e.g., following a user). It will also be appreciated that the data from the mobile sensors may be combined with static sensors (e.g., of an existing sensory network) to provide information about areas where the cost of implementation of sensor nodes has been prohibitive. For example, data from mobile sensors may be combined with data from an existing traffic network to generate a comprehensive traffic map for highways and residential streets where traffic networks generally do not exist (e.g., because the cost of setting up sensor nodes on residential streets outweighs the benefits).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","302","332","304","210","302","302","306"]},"The data contained in the sensory outputs  may vary between mobile devices based upon the types of sensors on the mobile device, the privacy restrictions a user of the mobile device has implemented, etc. In the illustrated example, the sensory outputs relate to location , temperature , heart rate , speed , and the volume , or rather acoustics of a room. It will be appreciated that the example list of information is not intended to be limiting and those skilled in the art will understand that other sensor information may be collected.","The received sensory output may be transmitted to an aggregator  (e.g.,  in ) that aggregates the information, using techniques known to those skilled in the art, and generates aggregated data . In the illustrated example, the aggregator  first correlates data related to the mobile devices' respective locations with mapping software to determine where the mobile devices are located. In the example, three of the mobile devices are located in Jones' Conference Room B , three are located on I-71 in Ohio between mile markers one hundred sixty and one hundred sixty-five , one is located on June Street , and one is located on May Lane . Once the mobile sensors location has been determined, the other data may be aggregated accordingly. For example, the speeds various mobile sensors on I-71 are traveling (e.g., 70, 65, and 66 respectively) may be averaged to determine an average speed  (e.g., 68 mph) of travel.","The aggregated data  may be transmitted to one or more receivers , , . The receiver may be configured to present at least a portion of the aggregated data in user-presentable form to a user. It will be appreciated that less than all of the aggregated information may be transmitted to a receiver , , . In one example, aggregated data related to a first data set is transmitted to a first receiver and aggregated data related to a second data set, different than the first data set, is transmitted to a second receiver. For example, the aggregated data related to Jones' Conference Room B  may be transmitted to a receiver  (e.g., a computer) owned by Jones that displays how many people are in the company's various conference rooms. In this way, the company can relatively easily determine whether the conference rooms are being utilized efficiently. Another receiver  may receive information related to traffic on I-71 so that alternative routes may be planned if cars are moving slow on I-71, for example. In the illustrated example, another receiver  tracks the progress of runners during a marathon and may monitor heart rate, speed, and other information that may be important to the marathon organizers. It will also be appreciated that while the illustrated receivers , ,  appear static (e.g., like desktop computers), one or more of the receivers may be a mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","408","412","400"]},"The system comprises a collector  (e.g.,  in ) that receives sensory outputs (e.g., related to detected sensory information) from a plurality of mobile devices. Sensory outputs received by the collector  are transmitted to an aggregator  that may aggregate the information based upon some predefined rules and\/or learned categories (e.g., as described with respect to ), for example.","Once the sensory outputs are aggregated, the aggregator  may generate aggregated data  (e.g.,  in ) that may be transferred to a receiver (e.g., as illustrated in ) and\/or a reviewer component  that reviews the aggregated data  and generates a detection instruction , . The detection instruction ,  may instruct a mobile device that has already transmitted sensory information to the collector  to detect sensory information in a different manner, and\/or the detection instruction ,  may instruct a mobile device that has previously not detected sensory information (e.g., and transmitted sensory output to the collector ). In this way, the aggregated data may be more relevant to the people and\/or entities that are ultimately going to view and\/or use the aggregated data .","In the illustrated example, the reviewer component  creates a detection instruction  for a first mobile device  to detect sensory information related to a user's heart rate by turning on an additional sensor in the first mobile device .

In the illustrated example, the reviewer component  generates a detection instruction  that instructs the mobile device  to turn on a positioning receiver, a speed sensor, and a heart rate sensor.
