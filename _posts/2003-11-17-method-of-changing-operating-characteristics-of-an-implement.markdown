{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY"],"p":["This invention relates generally to changing operating characteristics of an implement, and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for identifying the operational range of the operating characteristics of the implement and changing the operating characteristics within the operational range.","Work machines such as integrated tool carriers, skid steer loaders, backhoe loaders, excavators, and a wide variety of other work machines typically have a plurality of hydraulically controlled implements that may be interchangeably attached to the work machine to perform a particular work function. These implements are normally controlled through an implement control system having one or more hydraulic systems that are used to actuate and control the implement's lift mechanism, tilt mechanism, or auxiliary mechanisms. These implements are likewise controlled through the use of various operator input devices such as one or more implement control levers, foot pedals, or joysticks. Many of these implements have a need for changeable operating characteristics. For example, a stump grinder needs to be able to increase its hydraulic flow rate so as to increase the cutting head speed when grinding a very hard stump. It is, therefore, beneficial to have the ability to change the operating characteristics of an implement.","One known method of changing the operating condition of an implement of a power machine is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,213 issued to Loraas et. al. on Sep. 28, 1999. It discloses a power machine and an implement suitable for attachment to the power machine, the implement including an electronic controller attached thereon and a power actuator removably attached thereto. The implement with the electronic controller attached thereto is configured to control the power actuator based on operator input signals from operator inputs. Having an implement with an electronic controller restricts the flexibility of the operation of the work machine by restricting the use of implements with the power machine to only those that have the electronic controller. Dependency on the electronic controller being attached to the implement requires that either the implement be manufactured or retrofitted with the electronic controller. Both of these requirements will increase the overall cost of the implement as compared to an implement that does not require the electronic controller to be attached thereto.","The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth above.","The present invention is a method for changing operating characteristics of an implement, comprising providing the operating characteristics of the implement with a predetermined operational range consisting of a plurality of values, connecting the implement with a work machine, sending a first input signal identifying the operational range to an electronic control module, operating the implement at a first value within the operational range, sending a second input signal relating to a second value within the operational range to the electronic control module, and sending an output signal from the electronic control module to one of the work machine and the implement to change from the first value to the second value.","In another aspect of the present invention, a work machine is provided comprising a connectable implement having operating characteristics with a predetermined operational range consisting of a plurality of values, an electronic control module attached to the work machine, a first-end portion of a conducting device attached to the work machine, a second-end portion of the conducting device attached to the implement, wherein the attachment of the conducting device with the electronic control module and implement sets operation of the implement at a first value within the operational range, and signal means for changing from the first value within the operational range to a second value within the operational range.","Referring to the drawings, a method and apparatus for changing operating characteristics of an implement for use with a work machine  is shown. With particular reference to , the work machine  is depicted as a tracked skid steer loader. It should be understood, however, that the work machine  could be any sort of work machine that has hydraulically controlled implements that are removably attached thereto and not just those enumerated above. The work machine  has a body portion  having a front-end portion  and a rear-end portion . The work machine includes a plurality of ground engaging support members  that support the body portion  and an operator's compartment  supported on the body portion . Further, the work machine  includes a lift member assembly  pivotally attached to the body portion  and an implement  pivotally connectable with the lift member assembly . The implement  has operating characteristics having a predetermined operational range consisting of a plurality of values, including a predetermined operational range of hydraulic characteristics. The work machine  also includes an electronic control module  and a hydraulic system  both of which are attached to the work machine  and are connected to one another as shown by truncated wires in . Finally, the work machine  includes a conducting device such as a ground wire  having a first-end portion  connectable with the implement  and a second-end portion  connected to the electronic control module . It should be understood, however, that the conducting device might also be a cable, wire, rod, or other such mechanism.","As depicted in , the implement  includes at least one hydraulic hose  having a first-end portion  connectable with the implement  and a second-end portion (not shown) connected to the hydraulic system . Although a broom is depicted in , it should be understood that the implement  could be any hydraulically controlled implement with operational characteristics having a predetermined operational range, including an auger, broom, stump grinder, cold planer, or any other such implement. Further, it should be understood that the hydraulic operational characteristics could include hydraulic pressures, hydraulic flow rates, or any other hydraulic characteristic.","Further, in , the lift member assembly  includes a pair of laterally spaced side members  located at the rear-end portion  of the body portion  and a pair of lift arms  pivotally attached to the laterally spaced side members . The implement  is pivotally connectable with the lift arms  at the front-end portion  of the body portion .","Referring further to , the operator's compartment  has a bottom portion  and a first side portion  and a second side portion . The operator's compartment  includes a seat  attached to the bottom portion . The seat  includes an armrest  that is moveable between up and down positions so that when an operator (not shown) of the work machine  is seated in the seat  the armrest  can be moved into the down position to restrain the operator in the seat . The operator's compartment  also includes an instrument panel  located on the first side portion  adjacent the seat . The instrument panel  includes an operator input device such as a switch , lever, or other similar mechanism located thereon such that the operator can request a change in the operating characteristics of the implement  by actuating the switch . The operator's compartment  further includes at least one sensor  located therein and operably coupled to the electronic control module  such that the sensor  can sense when an operator is seated in the seat  or when the armrest  is in the down position or both. Such a system is described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,186,260 B1, entitled: \u201cARM REST\/SEAT SWITCH CIRCUIT FOR USE AS AN OPERATIONAL STATE SENSOR FOR A WORK MACHINE,\u201d issued to Schenck et al. and assigned to the assignee of this application. It should be understood that, alternatively, a first sensor may be used to sense when the operator is seated in the seat  and a second sensor may be used to sense when the armrest  is in the down position. Finally, the operator's compartment  includes an additional pair of operator input devices such as a pair of joysticks  located adjacent to the seat  and attached to the first side portion  and the second side portion  of the operator's compartment .","As depicted in , the hydraulic system  includes a portion of a propel hydraulic circuit , an implement hydraulic circuit , a boost hydraulic circuit , and a reservoir, such as a tank . The propel circuit  includes a first source of pressurized fluid, such as a variable displacement pump  in fluid communication with the tank .","The implement circuit  fluidly controls the lift and tilt functions of the implement  as well as the auxiliary functions. Auxiliary functions may include the vertical or horizontal rotation of the implement  in any direction, the clamping of an implement, or any other function. The implement circuit  includes a second source of pressurized fluid, such as a first fixed displacement pump . The first fixed displacement pump  is connected with the variable displacement pump  and both are in fluid communication with the tank .","The boost circuit  includes a third source of pressurized fluid, such as a second fixed displacement pump . The second fixed displacement pump  is also connected with the variable displacement pump  and both are in fluid communication with the tank . The boost circuit  further includes a two-position boost flow diverter valve  connected with the second fixed displacement pump  with a relief valve  interposed thereto. When the boost flow diverter valve  is in a first position the pressurized fluid returns to tank . When the boost flow diverter valve  is in a second position the pressurized fluid flows to a two-position boost flow control valve . When the boost flow control valve  is in a first position it is in a \u201cproportional flow\u201d position and the pressurized fluid flows to an auxiliary control valve . When the boost flow control valve  is in a second position it is in a \u201cfull flow\u201d position and the pressurized fluid flows to the implement circuit  to change the value of the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure of the auxiliary function of the implement  from a first value to a selected second value, e.g., to increase the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure to the selected second value. The auxiliary control valve  mentioned above is an infinitely variable valve having a first position a second position and a third position When the auxiliary control valve  moves toward the first position a proportional amount of pressurized fluid flows through conduits  in a first direction so as to change the value of the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure of the auxiliary function of the implement  from a first value to a second value. The proportional amount of pressurized fluid is directly related to the distance toward the first position the auxiliary control valve  moves. When the auxiliary control valve  is moved to the second position pressurized fluid flow is blocked. Finally, when the auxiliary control valve  moves toward the third position a proportional amount of pressurized fluid flows in an opposite direction of the first direction of the first position so as to change the value of the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure of the auxiliary function of the implement  from a first value to a second value. The proportional amount of pressurized fluid is directly related to the distance toward the third position the auxiliary control valve  moves. A pair of check valves , each located in the conduit , blocks all flow of the pressurized fluid when the auxiliary control valve  is in the second position ","The method of changing operating characteristics of the implement  includes connecting the implement  to the work machine  by connecting the implement  to the lift arms , connecting the first-end portion  of the ground wire  with the implement , and thus connecting the implement  to the electronic control module . The operator then climbs into the operator's compartment , sits in the seat , and lowers the armrest  to the down position. The operator then starts-up the work machine  so that it is in an operable condition.","Once the operator has started the work machine , the electronic control module  sends a signal to the implement  through the ground wire  requesting information as to the implement's  operating characteristics' operational range characteristics, in particular the implement's  hydraulic characteristics' operational range such as its hydraulic flow rate range and hydraulic pressure range. The implement  sends a first input signal back to the electronic control module  through the ground wire  advising it of the implement's  operating characteristics' operational range. Once this is accomplished, based upon the first input signal, the implement  begins operation at a first value within the operational range such as operating at a first value of hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure.","When the operator desires to change the implement's  operating characteristics the operator will actuate the switch  on the instrument panel  requesting the change. Before the operating characteristics can be changed, however, at least one predetermined condition must be met. In this embodiment, the predetermined conditions are the work machine  must be in operable condition and the operator must actuate switch . In order for the work machine  to be in an operable condition, the operator must be seated in the seat  and the armrest  must be in the down position. When the sensor  senses that the operator is in the seat  and the armrest  is in the down position and the operator has actuated the switch , the predetermined conditions have been met and a second input signal is sent from the work machine  to the electronic control module  requesting a change in the implement's  operating characteristics. For example, if the operator desires to control the hydraulic characteristics of the hydraulic system  such as increasing the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure, the operator can request such by actuating the switch  and having the work machine  in the operable condition. In other words, if the operator is using an implement such as the broom  depicted in , and the operator encounters heavier debris and the current rotational speed of the broom  is not sufficient, the operator can increase the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure to accelerate the rotational speed of the broom  by actuating the switch  and having the work machine  in the operable condition, thus brushing away the heavier debris.","Once the electronic control module  receives the second input signal signifying that the work machine  is in operable condition and that the operator desires a change in the operating characteristics, the electronic control module  sends an output signal to either the work machine  or the implement  to change the operating characteristics of the implement . For example, the electronic control module  receives the second input signal then sends the output signal to the implement  to change the hydraulic characteristics of the hydraulic system  by increasing the hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure. This is accomplished by responsively interfacing the hydraulic system  with the second input signal. More specifically, this is accomplished by responsively interfacing the boost flow diverter valve , boost flow control valve , and the auxiliary control valve  with the second input signal. The electronic control module  sends a signal to the boost circuit  to activate the boost flow diverter valve . Pressurized fluid from the second fixed displacement pump  is then sent to the boost flow control valve .","When the boost flow diverter valve  is in the first position the boost flow circuit  is not activated and the implement  does not receive increased hydraulic flow or hydraulic pressure. To vary the operating characteristics, the boost flow diverter valve  must be in the second position When the boost flow control valve  is actuated so that it is in the second position and the boost flow control valve  is actuated so that it is in the second position the boost flow circuit  is at \u201cfull flow\u201d and the pressurized fluid from the second fixed displacement pump  flows to the implement circuit  so as to change from the first value to the second value, e.g., increase the implement's hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure. When the boost flow diverter valve  is in the second position and the boost flow control valve  is in the first position the boost flow circuit is at \u201cproportional flow\u201d and the pressurized fluid from the second fixed displacement pump  flows to the infinitely variable auxiliary control valve . When the infinitely variable auxiliary control valve  is in the second position the boost flow circuit  is not activated and the implement  does not receive increased hydraulic flow or hydraulic pressure. When the infinitely variable auxiliary control valve  is actuated so that it moves toward the first position or the third position a proportional amount of the pressurized fluid flows to the implement circuit  so as to proportionally increase the implement's  hydraulic flow rate and hydraulic pressure. The amount of increase is related directly to the amount of movement of the infinitely variable auxiliary valve  toward the first position or the third position ","As described herein, the present method of changing operating characteristics of an implement has particular utility in any work machine  that operates with a plurality of different implements  or where a particular implement  functions under different operating characteristics.","Other aspects, objects and advantages of the invention can be obtained from a study of the drawings, the disclosure and the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a better understanding of the present invention, reference may be made to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
