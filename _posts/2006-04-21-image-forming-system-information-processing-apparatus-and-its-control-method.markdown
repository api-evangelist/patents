{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","First Embodiment","Second Embodiment","Third Embodiment"],"p":["The present invention relates to an image forming system having an image forming apparatus, a client computer and a network connecting these devices, and more particularly, to a technique for utilization of a postprocessing device existing on such network.","Generally, a printing system in which an image forming apparatus and a client computer are connected with each other, having finishers for cutting, bookbinding and the like, is known. In this type of printing system, various settings regarding finishers can be made upon generation of a print job, by utilizing characteristic information of postprocessing devices (finishers) available in the system. As methods for utilizing the finisher characteristic information upon generation of print job, (1) a method for controlling printing attribute(s) upon printing and (2) a method for controlling user interface function items of a printer driver, and the like are known.","In the above method (1), i.e., the method for controlling printing attribute(s) upon printing by utilizing the finisher characteristic information, a method for automatically setting printing attribute(s) by a printer driver in correspondence with the finisher characteristic information upon generation of print job is known. According to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-078449, the printer driver obtains the following two items regarding a bookbinder:\n\n","Further, as the above method (2), a method for controlling the user interface function items of the printer driver by utilizing the finisher characteristic information has been proposed. In this method, the type of a finisher attached to a printer is manually or automatically identified, thereby the user interface function items can be controlled.","Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-125765 discloses a user's selection of a bookbinding format, then converting print data for bookbinding in accordance with the bookbinding format selected by the user, then print-outputting the print data for bookbinding converted in accordance with the bookbinding format, and outputting a bookbinding original copy. According to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-125765, a preview screen of bookbinding product, generated based on the bookbinding format designated by the user, is displayed. Accordingly, the user's desired bookbinding original copy can be outputted without mistake, and improvement in working efficiency, cost reduction and resource conservation can be realized.","As described above, when printing is performed using a printer driver, the contents of works performed by the image forming apparatus such as a printer or a multi function peripheral device (MFP) and an in-line finisher connected to the apparatus can be set on a setting screen of the printer driver and print instruction can be performed. That is, the both image forming apparatus and in-line finisher can be controlled from the printer driver. Note that the in-line finisher is a postprocessing device which is physically connected with the image forming apparatus, as an optional device of the image forming apparatus, and which conveys a printed matter outputted by the image forming apparatus to the finisher without manual operation. Further, the in-line finisher by itself cannot perform communication with a host computer, however, the finisher can generate a print job where the content of processing in the finisher (for example, staple processing) is designated using the image forming apparatus or the printer driver.","However, for the user, to select such many devices and perform desired settings of these devices, it is necessary and troublesome to grasp functions of the devices and settings to be made. Accordingly, when the settings are complicated or when some settings have been omitted, outputting is performed again. Thus wasteful output may occur.","Further, in some cases, bookbinding work is performed by using a postprocessing device such as a near-line finisher or an off-line finisher to which a paper sheet outputted from the image forming apparatus is not automatically conveyed, in addition to the in-line finisher. Note that the near-line finisher has a unit for communication with an external device such as a computer or the image forming apparatus, and the content of processing by the finisher can be set from the external device. That is, in the near-line finisher, the content of processing can be set from an operation unit of the finisher, and further, the content of processing (job ticket) can be inputted and set from another device such as the host computer via the network. Note that the near-line finisher, which is different from the in-line finisher, is not physically connected with the image forming apparatus. A paper sheet outputted from the image forming apparatus is conveyed by an operator. Further, the off-line finisher is a postprocessing device which is not physically connected with the external device as in the case of the near-line finisher, and which has no unit for communication with the external device as in the case of the near-line finisher.","When the postprocessing device such as the near-line finisher or the off-line finisher is used, the abilities of these postprocessing devices cannot be recognized on the driver side, while the recognition of the abilities of the in-line finisher are considered as options upon printer driver design. Accordingly, it is necessary for the operator to determine a device to obtain a finally desired bookbinding form and perform print settings while imagining processings executed in the respective postprocessing devices. The operator's higher-level knowledge and experiences are required.","On the other hand, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-125765 discloses setting bookbinding data as an original copy of bookbinding product through plural selection screen images. However, in the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-125765, the operability for a user, who has an image of final bookbound product but who cannot perform determination of a device to be used and perform setting of the device based on the image, is not considered. According to the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-125765, an output format is selected in a predetermined bookbinder, and the output format processed based on settings selected by the user is displayed as a preview screen. Further, processing when the system configuration becomes complicated or changed is not disclosed. Further, when plural postprocessing devices are available, or when a new postprocessing device is added to the system and the number of available bookbinding formats is increased, processing cannot be performed in a flexible manner in accordance with such situation.","The present invention has been made in consideration of the above problems, and has its object to facilitate selection and setting of a device necessary to obtain a desired final product.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus connectable to an image forming system having plural devices corresponding to plural processing stages including at least printing stage and bookbinding stage, comprising: a holding unit configured to hold function information indicating abilities regarding plural function items of the plural devices; an interface unit configured to provide a user interface for displaying options based on contents of the function items of plural devices corresponding to one processing stage in accordance with the function information held in the holding unit; a narrow-down unit configured to narrow down available devices based on selection of the options; and a determination control unit configured to cause the interface unit and the narrow-down unit to function regarding different function items, more than once, for one processing stage, and determine a device to be used in the processing stage.","A printing system according to a first embodiment to be described below has image forming apparatuses, finishers, client computers in which a printer driver is installed, and a network connecting these devices. In the printing system, the printer driver performs finisher setting processing using a file describing the characteristic of a finisher. Further, in the present embodiment, as a wizard-format setting screen is provided, a user can determine a finisher to be used and an image forming apparatus, and can perform print setting by appropriately performing setting through the setting screen based on a desired final output form.","Also, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming system having plural devices corresponding to plural processing stages including at least printing stage and bookbinding stage, comprising: a holding unit configured to hold function information of the plural devices; an interface unit configured to provide a user interface for displaying options based on contents of the function items of plural devices corresponding to one processing stage in accordance with the function information held in the holding unit; a narrow-down unit configured to narrow down available devices based on selection of the options; and a determination control unit configured to cause the interface unit and the narrow-down unit to function regarding different function items, more than once, for one processing stage, and determine a device to be used in the processing stage.","Furthermore, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a control method for an information processing apparatus connectable to an image forming system having plural devices corresponding to plural processing stages including at least printing stage and bookbinding stage, comprising: an interface step of referring to a holding unit holding function information indicating abilities regarding plural function items of the plural devices, and providing a user interface for displaying options based on contents of the function items of plural devices corresponding to one processing stage; a narrow-down step of narrowing down available devices based on selection of the options; and a determination control step of performing the interface step and the narrow-down step regarding different function items, more than once, for one processing stage, and determining a device to be used in the processing stage.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same name or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.","A printing system according to a first embodiment to be described below has image forming apparatuses, finishers, client computers in which a printer driver is installed, and a network connecting these devices.

The in-line finisher is physically connected to the image forming apparatus. The in-line finisher has a structure where paper print-outputted from the image forming apparatus is passed through the conveyance passage (paper path) to the finisher directly and quickly. The off-line finisher is not physically connected to the image forming apparatus. Paper print-outputted from the image forming apparatus is temporarily buffered on a cart, tray, belt conveyer or the like, then set in an input unit of the finisher by the user. In the near-line finisher, paper is temporarily buffered and set in the input unit of the finisher by the operator as in the case of the off-line finisher.","[Printer Driver Construction]","The client PCs  and  are realized with a so-called personal computer. As the hardware construction of the personal computer is well known, the illustration and explanation of the hardware construction will be omitted.

The printer driver  starts a profile acquisition module through the API (Application Programming Interface) of the OS, then obtains a finisher profile from the image forming apparatus using the profile acquisition module, and stores the profile into the profile storage area . The profile acquisition module may be a module as a part of the printer driver , or may be provided as a part of the functions of the OS . Further, to make a finisher profile request or perform transmission of finished profile, a communication medium is used between the communication I\/F  on the client PC side and the communication I\/F  on the image forming apparatus side. Note that any protocol can be used in the communication as long as a finisher profile acquisition request can be made from the printer driver and transmission of the substance of finisher profile can be performed, and there is no designation of protocol. Next, a method for acquisition of a finisher profile from the image forming apparatus by the printer driver will be described with reference to a flowchart.  is a flowchart showing this procedure. The processing in  is performed when the power of the computer is turned on, when a print processing instruction is made by the user, or performed in accordance with the user's explicit instruction.","First, at step S, the printer driver  requests the image forming apparatus  obtain a finisher profile of a finisher which is connected to and registered in the image forming apparatus. In response to the acquisition request from the printer driver, the image forming apparatus  transmits a finisher profile stored in the finisher profile storage area  to the client PC  where the printer driver operates.","First, at step S, the image forming apparatus which has received the request (MFP in ) sequentially browses the finisher management table from the top, and thereby checks connection statuses of the respective finishers. For example, when the image forming apparatus has the finisher management table  shown in , the image forming apparatus  checks the connection status of the top \u201cFinisher-A\u201d at the first step. In this table, the finisher connection status is \u201cfalse\u201d meaning that the finisher is not available. Next, at step S, the connection status condition is determined. As the \u201cFinisher-A\u201d is in the \u201cfalse\u201d connection status, the process proceeds to step S. At step S, it is determined whether or not all the finishers have been checked. If all the finishers have not checked, the process returns to step S. This processing is similarly repeated for \u201cFinisher-B\u201d, \u201cFinisher-C\u201d and \u201cBinder-ABC\u201d.","Next, at step S, the connection status of the next entry \u201cFinisher-X\u201d is checked. As the connection status of the \u201cFinisher-X\u201d is \u201ctrue\u201d meaning that the finisher is available, in the condition determination at the next step S, the process proceeds to step S. At step S, the image forming apparatus transmits the finisher profile of each finisher managed in an available status (i.e., the finisher currently-checked on the finisher management table) to the printer driver. For this purpose, the image forming apparatus reads a corresponding finisher profile name \u201cfinisher-x-of-xyz.xml\u201d from the finisher management table . Then the image forming apparatus reads a file with this file name from the finisher profile storage area  and transmits the file to the printer driver (step S).","The processing at the above steps S to S is repeated on all the finishers registered in the finisher management table . When the last finisher in the finisher management table has been checked, information indicating the completion of all the finishers is transmitted to the printer driver at step S, and the processing of the flowchart ends.","On the other hand, the printer driver receives a response from the image forming apparatus (step S), to determine whether or not the content of the response is \u201cend\u201d (step S). When the response is not \u201cend\u201d, as the received data is a finisher profile, the printer driver stores the data in the storage area (step S). In this manner, the printer driver obtains a finisher profile of a near-line finisher in a connected status (i.e., available status) from the image forming apparatus.","Note that a profile of an in-line finisher can be obtained as in the case of the near-line finisher. Further, regarding the in-line finisher, as the number of in-line finishers connectable to the image forming apparatus is limited, it may be arranged such that the profiles of all the in-line finishers are previously stored in the image forming apparatus. In this case, an activation flag or the like is associated with the profile of a near-line finisher actually connected to the image forming apparatus, thereby the connection status is indicated. Accordingly, upon processing for finisher setting or the like, an activated in-line finisher is an available finisher.","Note that in the present embodiment, as the profiles of the near-line finishers are consolidately managed by the image forming apparatus , all necessary finisher profiles can be acquired from the image forming apparatus , however, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement. For example, it may be arranged such that the printer driver  directly access a near-line finisher to obtain a finisher profile. In this case, it is necessary for the printer driver  to obtain the address of the near-line finisher on the network , however, such address acquisition or the like is apparent for those skilled in the art. Further, in the above description, the printer driver obtains a finisher profile, however, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement. A print setting application or another acquisition unit may be employed to obtain a finisher profile.","The acquisition of finisher profile from the image forming apparatus  and the acquisition of finisher profile from a near-line finisher realized by the communication function of the printer driver  are described as above. The acquisition of finisher profile may be performed at arbitrary timing by e.g., polling, or may be performed upon e.g., wizard generation to be described below. Further, it may be arranged such that near-line finisher and off-line finisher may be manually registered. Note that as described above, in a case where the profiles of all the finishers (in-line finishers, near-line finishers and off-line finishers) available for the image forming apparatus  can be registered in the finisher management table , the printer driver  can obtain all the finisher profiles in the printing system from the image forming apparatus. Further, it may be arranged such that profiles of in-line finishers are notified from the image forming apparatus  to the printer driver  without management by the finisher management table  (in this case, the in-line finishers are not registered in the finisher management table ).","[Generation of Function Table]","The print setting application held on the client PC  generates a print setting wizard for the user to instruct print settings. The print setting wizard is generated based on the finisher profiles stored in the profile storage area  and the ability information of the image forming apparatuses held in the respective printer drivers. Note that in the present embodiment, the wizard is called the \u201cprint setting wizard\u201d, however, the wizard can be used upon setting for performing postprocessing such as bookbinding finishing on printed sheets using the respective finishers.","Note that the wizard means a function and its display screen to display an interactive guidance for a user and cause the user to make a selection among plural options in accordance with guidance thereby facilitate complicated software operation or setting. For example, a wizard screen upon installation of application software into a computer which sequentially displays installed functions and installation-destination directories is well known.","The print setting application first collects the finisher profiles and ability information of the image forming apparatuses, and analyzes the contents of the profiles by function. Then the print setting application generates function tables having information in function units such as print function, bookbinding function and cutting function. In the present embodiment, processing stages are classified into \u201cprint stage\u201d and \u201cpostprocessing stage\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 4","FIG. 10"],"b":["13","13","24","5","27"],"i":["a ","a"]},"In the present embodiment, the image forming apparatus  () is a color machine (also available as a monochrome machine), having a print speed of 100 sheets\/minute, and an available paper size of A4 and A3. Further, the in-line finisher is connected to the image forming apparatus , and as its abilities (), the available paper size is A4 and A3, the number of placeable sheets is , and the binding method is side stitching. The print setting application generates a device table  where these ability information are registered by device.","Next, the print setting application generates a function table  from the device table . For example, the print setting application classifies the processings in the printing system into plural processing stages such as print processing and print postprocessing, collects the ability information by processing stage function (print function or bookbinding function), and generates the function table . For example, the print setting application collects the ability information of the respective image forming apparatuses (ability information  of the image forming apparatus  and ability information  of the image forming apparatus ) and generates a printing table  where the print functions are collected. Further, the print setting application collects the ability information of the respective finishers (ability information  of the in-line finisher , ability information  of the near-line finisher , and ability information  of an off-line finisher (not shown)) and generates a bookbinding table  where the bookbinding functions are collected.  show the data structure of the function table (printing table () and bookbinding table ()) in the present embodiment.","[Generation of Wizard Screen by Wizard Generator]","The print setting application has a wizard generator  () to read the above-described function table  and construct the print setting wizard. The wizard generator  refers to the function table  and generates a wizard screen to be used upon print setting processing to be described later. As shown in , the function table  includes a bookbinding table  where finisher functions are collected, with a printing table  where image forming functions are collected. The wizard generator is an application to generate a wizard screen to be displayed on a display, and a control program where interscreen transition condition or the like is described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"]},"At step S, the wizard generator  determines whether or not a bookbinding table exists in the function table . When a bookbinding table exists, the process proceeds to step S, at which a wizard screen is generated for inquiry about execution\/non-execution of bookbinding.  is an example of the wizard screen.","Next, at step S, the wizard generator  determines whether or not plural bookbinding types exist in the bookbinding table . When there are plural bookbinding types, it is impossible merely based on the designation \u201cTO BE BOOKBOUND\u201d in the wizard screen generated at step S to determine a bookbinding type and a finisher to be used. Accordingly, at step S, when there are plural bookbinding types, the process proceeds to step S. Then a wizard screen for selection of bookbinding type is generated at step S.","Next, the determination at step S and the generation of the wizard screen at step S will be described more specifically. At step S, the contents of \u201cstitching function\u201d in the bookbinding table  are referred to, and it is determined whether or not plural stitching functions exist in the \u201cstitching function\u201d. In the \u201cstitching function\u201d of the bookbinding table  shown in , it is found that the in-line finisher has a function of side stitching, and the near-line finisher  has the function of side stitching and a function of saddle stitching. That is, as a bookbound product by side stitching and that by saddle stitching as the bookbinding forms can be produced, a selection is to be made from plural bookbinding types.","In this manner, when it is determined at step S that plural bookbinding types (bookbinding forms) exist, the process proceeds to step S. At step S, a bookbinding type selection wizard screen is generated for the user to select one of the plural bookbinding types determined at step S. In this example, as the two bookbinding types, side stitching and saddle stitching exist, a screen to select one of them is generated.  shows the wizard screen at this time.","At step S, if a single finisher has been determined as a result of the selection of function type in the wizard screen in , the device is set, and the process proceeds from step S to step S. That is, in a case where a finisher corresponding to the selected bookbinding type, selected from the plural bookbinding types displayed in the bookbinding type selection wizard screen generated at step S, the finisher to execute the user's desired bookbinding processing is determined at this stage.","On the other hand, when the wizard generator  determines at step S that a device (finisher) to be used cannot be determined only by selecting one bookbinding type, the process returns from step S to step S. Then, the wizard generator  generates a wizard screen for determination of a device to be used in accordance with a finishing device selection rule to be described later.","Next, there will be described a particular example of a case where a device (finisher) to be used cannot be determined only by selecting one bookbinding type. For example, when the bookbinding table  is referred to and \u201cside stitching\u201d is selected as a function type, this function can be realized by the in-line finisher and the near-line finisher . Accordingly, the device to be used cannot be determined at this stage. In the present embodiment, a wizard in accordance with the finishing device selection rule is generated at step S.","Further, in a case where only one type of stitching function exists, the stitching function is set. When a finishing device cannot be determined at this stage (for example, there are plural finishers having the same side stitching function), a wizard screen is generated in accordance with the finishing device selection rule to be described later. Note that at this time, it may be arranged such that the existing stitching function is indicated and at the same time a screen notifying that there is no choice of stitching function is generated.","Hereinbelow, the finishing device (finisher) selection rule will be described with reference to the function tables in . Note that the selection rule is merely an example and it does not pose any limitation on the present invention.","(Example of Finishing Device Selection Rule)","In a case where plural bookbinding devices exist in the bookbinding table , the functions of the respective devices are compared with each other in accordance with the order of predetermined inquiries. Then regarding devices having different contents of function information, a screen for inquiry about selection of function is generated. In the example of the bookbinding table in , two types of devices i.e., the in-line finisher and the near-line finisher  exist. In this case, for example, function comparisons are made in the order \u201cstitching function\u201d\u2192\u201cavailable paper size\u201d\u2192\u201cnumber of sheets\u201d . . . , and a wizard is generated only regarding different function information. Hereinbelow, the generation of wizard will be described more specifically. Note that in this example of finishing device selection rule, the processing at step S will be described.\n\n","By the processing at step S based on the above-described finishing device selection rule, when it is determined at step S that a finisher corresponding to the bookbinding type can be determined, the process proceeds to step S. At step S, a wizard screen for setting necessary setting conditions (stitching position, paper size, the number of sheets etc.) for use of the finisher corresponding to the bookbinding type is generated. This wizard screen may be a screen displaying all the setting items processible by each finisher, or may be a wizard screen group for stepwisely setting the respective items. For example, in a screen regarding the in-line finisher , various setting items including a stitching direction (long-side stitching or short-side stitching) and stitching position may be displayed in one screen. Otherwise, a screen for selection of stitching direction is generated first, then a screen for selection of stitching position is generated as a screen to be displayed next.","Note that in the above example, plural finishers having stitching functions exist, however, the finishers include a cutting machine to cut paper or the like. For example, when a cutting machine exists, a wizard screen is generated in accordance with \u201cwhether or not cutting function exists\u201d from step S in the flowchart of . Then, a transition condition between a wizard screen regarding the bookbinding function and a wizard screen regarding the cutting function is determined. That is, when the user has selected \u201cNot to be bound\u201d in the wizard screen in , linkage is made such that the screen changes to a wizard screen for selecting \u201cTo be cut\u201d or \u201cNot to be cut\u201d as a wizard screen regarding the cutting function. Further, when the user has selected \u201cTo be bookbound\u201d in the wizard screen in , linkage is made such that setting for the above-described bookbinding is made, then the screen changes to a wizard screen for selecting \u201cTo be cut\u201d or \u201cNot to be cut\u201d. When the user has selected \u201cTo be bookbound\u201d and the content of set bookbinding has not correspond with the ability of the cutting machine, a wizard regarding the cutting is not displayed, otherwise, a screen notifying the user that the cutting function cannot be utilized is generated, and linkage is made such that the screen is displayed when such setting has been made. For example, when the paper type determined by the user in a wizard screen regarding bookbinding is not an available paper type for the cutting machine, even if a wizard screen for inquiry about use of cutting function has been prepared, the screen is not displayed. Otherwise, a transition condition is previously determined such that a screen notifying \u201cpaper type determined in bookbinding setting is not available for cutting function\u201d is displayed.","By the above processing, the generation of wizard screen group for the purpose of setting of bookbinding and other postprocessing has been completed. Next, the processing changes to generation of wizard screen group for the purpose of print setting.","At step S, generation of a wizard screen for determining a printing device is performed. In this example, the generation processing will be described using a printing device selection rule.","(Printing Device Selection Rule)","When plural printing devices exist in one printing table, the functions of the respective devices are compared with each other in accordance with a predetermined order. Then a wizard screen for inquiry about selection of function is generated regarding different function information. In the present embodiment, the functions and abilities are compared in the order \u201ccolor selection\u201d \u201cavailable paper size\u201d \u201cprinting speed\u201d . . . , and a wizard is generated regarding different information. Hereinbelow, a particular procedure will be described using the printing table  in .\n\n","When color output has been selected in (1), as only the image forming apparatus  is capable of color printing, the image forming apparatus  is selected in the change screen. Accordingly, a screen, not for specifying a printing device, but for making various settings specific to the image forming apparatus , is generated. When monochrome printing has been selected, as an image forming apparatus cannot be specified, the wizard generator  generates a wizard screen corresponding to the \u201cavailable paper size\u201d. In this case, a wizard screen () for selecting output paper is generated. In this example, a paper selection screen by pull-down selection () is shown. When \u201cA3\u201d size has been selected, the image forming apparatus  incapable of A3-size output is excluded, and the image forming apparatus  is selected as a printing device. However, when \u201cA4\u201d size has been selected, a printing device cannot be specified.\n\n","Note that it may be arranged such that the user's preference (speed priority\/running cost priority or the like) is set. Otherwise, it may be arranged such that a screen to display a printing device which has become the last one is generated to cause the user to select the displayed device.\n\n","Then, the wizard screen generation processing ends.","The print setting wizard generation processing by the wizard generator  is as described above. Note that the wizard generated by the wizard generator  is stored as a print setting application in the host computer in . Further, the screen group and the transition conditions among the screens are also stored.","[Print Setting Processing Using Wizard]","Next, print setting using the wizard generated in the above-described procedure will be described. The user starts a \u201cprint setting wizard\u201d stored as an application. Then, the user causes the print setting wizard to recognize document data (e.g., a PDF file) that the user wants to print output. This processing is performed by the user's causing the wizard to display a reference screen for designation of a file and designating a data path of the document data. When a file has been specified, the screen shown in  is displayed on the screen of the client PC.","Then, the user changes the screen while inputting desired contents through the displayed screen, thereby a finishing device and a printing device are automatically determined.","Note that the setting information inputted through the wizard is stored by the OS in a temporary storage area owned by the wizard (print setting application). When a printing device has been determined, the print setting application stores the setting information stored in the storage area of the print setting application into the printer driver setting storage area  corresponding to the printing device. Thus, a status similar to that upon print setting via a general printer driver can be obtained.","In the above-described wizard, when all the setting has been completed, a screen for the user's designating \u201cwhether or not printing is to be started\u201d is displayed. When printing is to be started in this screen, the user input designation of \u201cstart printing\u201d.","When start of printing has been designated, the print setting application starts the printer driver of the printing device to be utilized. The printer driver receives the document data designated through the wizard using the print setting stored in the printer driver setting storage area .","Hereinbelow, a print job including the print subject data that reflects the print setting and commands for execution of instructions and controls for the device is generated.","The print job generated by the printer driver is transmitted via the network to the printing device, and printing is performed on the set printing condition.","Note that in the case of print setting using a near-line finisher, the setting information is notified to the near-line finisher. The notification of the setting information to the near-line finisher is made as notification of job control information describing the contents of postprocessing. The job control information, which is also referred to as a \u201cjob ticket\u201d, has a description in structured language interpretable for the near-line finisher. The job ticket generated by the printer driver is transmitted via the image forming apparatus or directly, to the near-line finisher. The near-line finisher receives the job ticket and interprets the job control information, thereby setting necessary for postprocessing of printed matter outputted from the image forming apparatus can be automatically performed. Note that in the present invention, any method can be used in the generation of the print job, and transmission of the print job from the printer driver to the image forming apparatus, the in-line finisher or the near-line finisher, and any data format of the print job can be used.","Note that in the above processing, the generation of the wizard is previously performed, and when the user performs printing, the user interactively sets the conditions from a final product using the wizard, thereby easily performs print setting and postprocessing device setting. However, it may be arranged such that a wizard screen is generated upon display of the wizard.","As described above, according to the first embodiment, the print setting wizard is generated for interactive input of necessary items from the user's desired final product, and the setting regarding printing and postprocessing is performed using the wizard, thereby the selection and setting of an image forming apparatus to obtain the desired final product and other necessary device can be easily performed.","Hereinbelow, the operation of the wizard generator  when a near-line finisher has been newly added to the construction of the first embodiment will be described as a second embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 1"],"b":["17","19","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["16","301"]},"Next, at step S, a user interface for changing the status of the connected finisher to a connected status by the operation panel of the image forming apparatus is displayed.

The list has a finisher name , a maker name , and a connection status . In the list, seven finishers are displayed at once. To browse finishers prior and subsequent to these seven finishers, buttons  and  to scroll up and down the display list are depressed.","The connection registration and cancellation of connection registration using the finisher registration screen in  are performed as follows. First, a subject finisher is set to a selected status by touching a part of a column displaying the subject finisher. In , a column  is in a selected status. In this status where the desired finisher is selected, the finisher in the selected status is connection-registered by touching a \u201cConnect\u201d button , and the connection status of the finisher in the selected status is released by touching a Disconnect button .","Hereinbelow, the connection registration of a Finisher-Y (near-line finisher ), a Finisher-A (near-line finisher ), a Finisher-B (near-line finisher ) with respect to the system configuration of the first embodiment () as shown in  will be described.","First, to register the Finisher-Y, the Finisher-Y is set to a selected status by touching a part of the column . Next, the finisher is connection-registered by touching the \u201cConnect\u201d button . Similarly, to connection-register the Finisher-A and the Finisher-B, the above registration operation is performed with respect to columns  and . In this manner, the Finisher-Y (near-line finisher ), the Finisher-A (near-line finisher ) and the Finisher-B (near-line finisher ) become in the \u201cConnect\u201d status.","Finally, when an \u201cOK\u201d button  is touched, the above-described setting is enabled, and the initial screen of the operation panel of the image forming apparatus main body is restored. Note that when the above registration operation is cancelled, a \u201cCancel\u201d button  is touched. By this operation, the contents of the above-described operation are cancelled, and an update operation of the finisher management table of the image forming apparatus to be described later is not performed.","By the depression of the OK button , the process proceeds to step S, at which the image forming apparatus updates the finisher management table . Hereinbelow, the update processing of the finisher management table  will be described. In the finisher connection registration screen in , as the user connection-registered the Finisher-Y by XYZ company, the Finisher-A by ABC company and the Finisher-B by ABC company, the finisher management table  in  is updated. In accordance with the connection registration, columns of management numbers #, # and # (Finisher-Y, Finisher-A and Finisher-B) are written from \u201cfalse\u201d to \u201ctrue\u201d.  shows the finisher management table  in which such update has been performed on the status in . As shown in , the connection status of the Finisher-A, the Finisher-B and the Finisher-Y of management numbers #, # and # as the management number  are changed to \u201ctrue\u201d.","In the above procedure, the connection registration of the finishers installed by the user is completed. Note that in the present embodiment, the user connects the finishers and then performs the finisher connection registration with the operation panel of the image forming apparatus, however, the setting can be performed by any other method as long as the finisher management table can be updated. For example, as the image forming apparatus and the finishers are connected via a communication medium, it may be arranged such that the image forming apparatus automatically connection-registers the finishers by defining a protocol upon connection and performing communication by the image forming apparatus and the finishers based on the protocol.","Thereafter, when the client PC  performs collection of ability information () at predetermined timing such as polling by the above-described finisher profile acquisition method, the updated ability information is obtained from the image forming apparatus . Accordingly, the client PC  updates the function table  in accordance with the obtained ability information.

Note that in this example, a cutting machine (near-line finisher ), and a folding machine (near-line finisher ) are displayed in the bookbinding table; however, these finishers may be managed in another function table.","In this manner, when the function table has been updated, the wizard generator  determines whether or not unconformity has occurred between the updated content and the generated wizard. When unconformity has occurred, i.e., new function(s) has been added or function(s) has been deleted, the wizard is re-constructed.","For example, as shown in , when a case bookbinding function has been added as a stitching function, \u201ccase bookbinding\u201d is added to the screen in which the user designates a bookbinding printing method as shown in , and at the same time, a screen for setting information specific to a case bookbinding machine is generated. Further, in addition to addition\/deletion of finisher, similar processing is performed for addition\/deletion of image forming apparatus.","As described above, according to the second embodiment, the update processing of the function table is performed and the wizard is re-constructed in a flexible manner, in correspondence with a change of printing system configuration.","[Dynamic Reconstruction by Wizard+DeviceConfig Information]","When the print setting application has been started, the status information of the respective devices stored in the profile storage area  or the device table is obtained. Then it is checked whether or not there is a device having a trouble in its operation (out of consumable goods, failure, busy or the like) based on the status information. When there is a device having a trouble in its operation, a flag is set in the function table so as to disable selection of the device.","When there is a device for which the above flag is set, the wizard generator specifies a screen related to the device in condition branching of a previously-generated wizard, and reconstructs the wizard screen not to select the device. Further, when there are other screens (setting conditions) influenced by the reconstruction of the wizard screen, the construction of the screens are sequentially changed.","As described above, according to the third embodiment, the wizard screen can be constructed in accordance with finisher status. For example, as the wizard screen can be constructed such that a finisher having a trouble in its operation is excluded from subjects of selection, a reliably available device can be automatically selected. Thus the operability is improved.","As described above, the present invention facilitates a user's selection and setting of a device necessary for obtaining the user's desired final product.","As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.","This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-128621 filed on Apr. 26, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["11","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"52"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A and 9B","b":["13","13","24"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"27","i":"a; "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["313","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"],"b":"2201"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 18"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
