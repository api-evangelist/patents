No. 12\/474,627 filed May 29, 2009 (which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/099,857, filed Sep. 24, 2008), U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/327,470 filed Apr. 23, 2010, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/355,960 filed Jun. 17, 2010, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/371,114 filed Aug. 5, 2010, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/390,573 filed Oct. 6, 2010, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/414,173 filed Nov. 16, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/434,356 filed Jan. 19, 2011, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for turning electronic wagering games into customer relationship management and marketing systems while the electronic game is inactive.","Electronic gaming machines (EGM), such as a slot machines, video poker, blackjack or keno machines, typically include an outer cabinet that houses a main controller, several peripheral devices, and wiring harnesses to electrically connect the peripheral devices to the main controller. The main controller may, for example, include one or more printed circuit boards carrying one or more processors, a plurality of logic devices, and one or more memory devices for storing executable program code and game data. The memory devices for storing executable code may, for example, include EPROMS, hard disk drives, SD-Cards, Compact FLASH cards, CD-ROMs, DVDs, and Smart Media cards. The stored executable code provides two basic functions, namely, providing an operating system for controlling the gaming machine and handling communications between the gaming machine and an external network, and the game code for conducting a game on the gaming machine. While not in use, the EGM is typically programmed to display a menu of the games offered on its main display screen.","The embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for providing an alternative presentation to the EGM display while the EGM is inactive.","In one embodiment, there is a support structure for a marketing device of the embodiments of the present invention. The support structure may be embodied by a housing or other suitable body for securing components of the embodiments of the present invention. The support structure may be installed anywhere on the interior or exterior of the EGM.","The marketing device of the embodiments of the present invention includes a connection with the EGM through the SMIB (Slot Machine Interface Board), or other EGM device which handles external communications between the EGM and an external network, for the purpose of detecting data signals (or the lack thereof) or another indicator of EGM inactivity.","In one embodiment, the marketing device is connected to the EGM via a SMIB or other printed circuit board in communication with the EGM by a serial cable or other data communication link to a port, such as an RS-232, RS422, RS485 ports, and is capable of detecting SAS communication in the form of protocol data signals which are generated by the EGM as a result of normal user-initiated EGM activity, such as using the bill validator, game start, access door open, depressing buttons, coin in, screen touch or other indication of entry by the EGM into a pre-game start mode. In some embodiments, the marketing device is connected so that it can detect SAS communication but is configured so that it does not impact such communications, that is, it only receives data passively without transmitting data or otherwise affecting the transmissions detected. In some embodiments, the marketing device connection with an EGM is independent of the EGM operating system, although the marketing device is able to detect communication or signals generated by the EGM operating system.","The marketing device of the embodiments of the present invention may further include a data communication intercept component which is configured to allow for the preemption of the transmission of display data from the main game control board, or other device for controlling the one or more games displayed on the EGM display, upon being triggered by the delivery of presentation data to the intercept component. So long as presentation data or content, or marketing data or content, is not delivered, the intercept component is configured to allow the display data to bypass the intercept component without disruption.","In one embodiment, the intercept component is configured to receive the VGA compatible cable or other data communication link which supplies the video data from the EGM main game control board and deliver the video data via a data communication link with the EGM main video monitor. The delivery of presentation data to the intercept component triggers a data stream switch so that the presentation data preempts the transmission of video data. Thus, the presentation data will be displayed on the EGM main video monitor rather than the typical inactive mode video data.","A memory device for storing or supplying the presentation data is operatively associated with the marketing device. The memory may be affixed to the support structure or may be an independent, remote memory device configured for supplying the presentation data to the marketing device through a wired or wireless connection. The memory device may be of any conventional kind for storing accessible data. The presentation data may consist of audio, graphics, video, or multimedia data. It is envisioned that the presentation data may be intended for advertising or promotional purposes, however, the presentation data may be intended for other purposes and directed to any subject.","The marketing device of the embodiments of the present invention may include control programming and a processor for recording or otherwise keeping track of the passage of time after detecting a first data signal through the connection with the EGM SMIB, and time sync with the video server and monitoring the passage of time thereafter, comparing the passage of time with a preset timing threshold value, triggering the transmission of presentation data to the data communication intercept upon the passage of time reaching the preset threshold value, and terminating the transmission upon detecting a second data signal.","Although the preset timing threshold value may be set to any value by the operator (e.g., seconds, minutes or hours), it is envisioned that a value is selected that best estimates the time at which the EGM is inactive, that is, a game is not being played by a user. In some embodiments, once the transmission of presentation data begins, it will continue until a data signal is detected through the connection with the SMIB, thus indicating that the EGM has been made active by user actuation.","In some embodiments, the EGM may include peripheral devices, such as a touchscreen, which do not generate SAS communication. In such embodiments, the marketing device may have additional connections for determining if such devices are activated. For example, if the EGM has a touchscreen, the marketing device can be configured to detect if the touchscreen is touched and terminate the transmission of presentation data and return to the normal EGM display in response. Thereafter, the marketing device may keep track of the passage of time and if no further activity is detected, the marketing device may again preempt the normal EGM display for the transmission of presentation data.","In this manner the marketing device does not change, alter or affect the manner or mode of play of the EGM. Rather, the marketing device only affects what the video monitor of the EGM will be displaying while the EGM is inactive and not being played by a user. The marketing device also does not change, alter or affect the game controller, the game erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), the game graphics or the theoretical hold of the EGM. The marketing device of the embodiments of the present invention is configured to remain inactive during all forms of interaction and play on the EGM by a user. The marketing device merely detects signals that are normally generated internally by the EGM, via the connection with the SMIB or any other suitable point at which such signals may be detected.","Some embodiments are directed to a system configured for an electronic gaming device having at least a controller, memory, game player interface and display. The system includes a gaming device status detector configured to passively detect the status of the electronic gaming device and differentiate between detected status conditions associated with gaming machine activity and detected status conditions associated with gaming machine inactivity. This embodiment also includes a marketing content supplying device configured to transmit marketing content to the display responsive to the detection of status conditions associated with gaming machine inactivity. The marketing content supplying device may further be configured to transmit the marketing content after the passage of a preset period of time from the detection of status conditions associated with gaming machine inactivity as well as cease the transmission of said marketing content to the display responsive to detection of status conditions associated with gaming machine activity by said detecting means.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned system may include a preemption device configured to prevent pre-existing internal gaming machine inactivity content from being displayed on the display in favor of displaying the transmitted marketing content on the display until the transmission of the marketing content ceases. In some embodiments, the detected conditions associated with gaming machine activity and gaming machine inactivity are preset to facilitate the differentiation thereof by the gaming device status detecting means.","In some embodiments, the gaming device status detector is in communication or otherwise connected with one or more components of the electronic gaming device for detecting various parameters relating to the components that can be used to determine the status condition, namely whether the gaming machine is active or inactive. In some embodiments, the detector in a system such as the aforementioned system is further configured to differentiate status conditions associated with game play by detecting data signals relating to one or more of the following: bill validator usage, game player interface usage, coin in detection, game card usage and touch screen usage.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned system further includes memory which can communicate with the marketing content supplying device and is configured for storing the marketing content.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned system further includes a device or configuration for receiving marketing content from a remote source.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned system further includes a data stream switch having multiple data stream inputs.

The data stream switch is configured to receive the transmission of marketing content actuated by the data processor as an input, wherein the data stream switch is further configured to output the marketing content for display on the electronic gaming device display by automatically preempting any pre-existing gaming device inactivity content input from being outputted for display on electronic gaming device while receiving the transmission of marketing content, among other things. It should be understood that the data processor of some embodiments may further embody or access control programming, firmware or software to facilitate the functions or configurations described herein.","The conditions detected, that is, conditions associated with either gaming device activity or inactivity, may include data signals generated by a component within the gaming device. The conditions detected may also include voltage or current changes within the electronic gaming device or relating to a component thereof.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned system further includes a data storage device in communication with the data processor and data stream switch for storing marketing content. In some embodiments, the data processor and data stream switch are mounted within the electronic gaming device, while in other embodiments one or both of these components are independent of the electronic gaming device.","In some embodiments, a data stream switch in a system such as the aforementioned system is configured for receiving marketing content from a remote source. The remote source may communicate via a wired or wireless connection with the data stream switch.","In some embodiments, a data processor in a system such as the aforementioned system is further configured to maintain records relating to the duration of time the marketing content is transmitted.","In some embodiments, wherein the data processor is further configured for determining the display characteristics of the pre-existing gaming device inactivity content or game idle content, and adjusting the display characteristics of the marketing content to substantially match the display characteristics of the pre-existing gaming device inactivity content for display on the electronic gaming device display.","Some embodiments are directed to a method of presenting marketing content via an electronic gaming machine including at least a controller, memory, game player interface and display. The method includes the steps of: detecting data signals generated by the electronic gaming device during play sessions and idle time; tracking time after detecting a data signals associated with idle time; triggering a transmission of marketing content to the display responsive to the tracked time after detection of the data signal exceeding a threshold period of time; and ceasing the transmission of said marketing content to the display responsive to detection of a subsequent data signal associated with play sessions.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned method further includes transmitting marketing content to the display from a remote source or local source, or a combination thereof.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned method further includes the step of preempting pre-existing internal game idle content from being displayed in favor of displaying said marketing content.","Some embodiments are directed to an EGM configured for providing an interactive game which includes a display, memory containing display content including game play content, a player interface for inputting information and player selections relating to the interactive game, and a game controller configured for facilitating game play of the interactive game, including receiving information from the player interface and providing game content on the display during game play. The aforementioned EGM further includes a data processor and a data stream switch. The data processor is configured for passively detecting data communication within the gaming machine, differentiating between the data communication associated with game play and the data communication associated with a game idle state, actuating a transmission of marketing content in response to the detection of data communication associated with a game idle state and ending the transmission of marketing content in response to the detection of data communication associated with game play, among other things.

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the embodiments of the present invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications of the inventive feature illustrated herein, and any additional applications of the principles of the embodiments of the present invention as illustrated herein, which would normally occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the present invention as claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","16","20","12"]},"Upon the monitored time period reaching the threshold value in step , the transmission of presentation data is triggered in step . As discussed above, the presentation data preempts the video data being provided to the EGM by the EGM control board and the presentation data is shown on the EGM display. If a second data signal is not detected, the transmission of presentation data continues, as shown in steps  and . However, if a second data signal is detected, the transmission of presentation is terminated, ceasing the preemption of video data so that the EGM display once again shows the video data as it had prior to the preemption by the presentation data, and the method restarts its detection of data signals at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","50","52","50","54","50"]},"In some embodiments, system  may determine whether the detected conditions indicate EGM activity or inactivity based on a comparison with preset parameters that are associated with either EGM activity or inactivity, such as for example, a voltage change or the characteristics of a data signal generated by one or more sources. Thus, if a condition associated with a preset parameter is detected, then system  would recognize whether the condition is associated with EGM activity or inactivity.","If it is determined that the EGM is not active, and marketing content is not already being transmitted, as shown by steps  and , then system  will begin to record the passage of time in step . As shown by step , the passage of time will be compared with a preset time threshold. If the threshold has been met in step , then in step  system  will transmit marketing content to the display.","In some embodiments the marketing content is transmitted to the display via a video switch which is configured to favor the marketing content transmission over any pre-existing EGM inactivity display content.","If the time threshold has not been met, then as shown by step , system  continues to detect conditions, determine whether the detected conditions are associated with either EGM activity or inactivity, and record the passage of time in steps , ,  and , respectively, if it is determined that the EGM is inactive. Thus, the transmission of marketing content in step  will not occur until the time threshold is met while the EGM is inactive. Likewise, the transmission of marketing content, once begun, will continue as shown particularly by steps  and  so long as the EGM remains inactive.","If it is determined that the EGM is active in step , then as shown in steps  and  the transmission of marketing content will discontinue and system  returns to detecting conditions in step . Also, as shown in steps  and , if it is determined that the EGM is active prior to meeting the time threshold in step  or before the transmission of marketing content in step , then system  returns to detecting conditions in step .","In other embodiments, the time period may be preset in the system according to the last activity associated with the EGM prior to the EGM becoming inactive. For example, if the EGM has just finished being serviced, the time threshold in step  may be increased or decreased. Alternatively, the system may require the meeting of a second time threshold in addition to the time threshold in step , based on the last activity associated with the EGM prior to the EGM becoming inactive.","In alternative embodiments, the transmission of marketing content may be paused at intervals, such as between the end of one advertisement, presentation or program included in the marketing content and prior to the start of another advertisement, presentation or program included in the marketing content. During the pause in the transmission of marketing content, the EGM may display the existing EGM inactivity content, which may consist of simulated game play, for example. In such embodiments, the transmission of marketing content may continue upon the passage of a second time period, that is, the meeting of a second time threshold. The second time period may be the same or different from the initial time threshold which had been met in step  prior to the start of the transmission of marketing content. Alternatively, the transmission of marketing content may not be paused, but rather, simulate a pause and display information regarding the game, EGM, marketing content and\/or indicate on the display that the game is available for play by presenting the appropriate text, such as \u201cpress any button or insert money to play game.\u201d In some embodiments, similar text, graphics or other information may be presented on the display during the transmission of marketing content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"110"},"It should be understood that the idle signal may comprise any signal or plurality of signals which indicate the EGM is inactive, that is, no longer being played by a player. In some embodiments, the idle signal may comprise \u201ckeep alive\u201d signals or other standard periodic connection check generated by the EGM. Thus, so long as the idle signals are detected, the transmission continues. However, should there be a signal detected that indicates either the EGM is active or a peripheral that does not generate a signal has been actuated, such as a touchscreen, the transmission ceases and the normal EGM display returns.","In this embodiment, an open game session in step  closes and the system begins recording time in step . As mentioned above, the threshold time period may vary depending on the event that closes the game session. Thus, the passage of time is compared with the appropriate preset threshold in step . In step , if the threshold has not been met and a data signal indicating a new game session is open is not detected in step , the method returns to step  and continues to compare the passage of time with the threshold value. If a new game session signal is detected in step , the EGM is active and in use by a user and the method starts over in step  until this new game session closes.","Once the monitored time period reaches the threshold value in step , the EGM goes into idle mode and an idle signal is generated by the EGM in step  which may also be detected in step . If the idle signal is not detected in step , the method returns to step  to determine whether a new game session has opened.

However, if a new game session signal is detected, the transmission of presentation is terminated, ceasing the preemption of video data so that the EGM display once again shows the video data as it had prior to the preemption by the presentation data, thus allowing the game session to be played by the player, as shown in step .","In one embodiment, a system of the embodiments of the present invention may include the components such as an interface board capable of instantly switching between an EGM video source and a secondary source of presentation or video data. The interface board may be configured with memory, processing devices, operating systems, communication devices and other hardware or software as necessary. The secondary video source may be an outside server or videos stored within the memory on the interface board.","The board may include a connection with the EGM for monitoring for the presence of game idle and game active signals, such as SAS protocol signals generated during EGM events. While the game is active, the EGM game video is played on the display. Upon detection of a game idle signal, the interface board switches video sources from the EGM video source to the secondary video source. The interface board is configured to decode or play videos from the secondary video source on the EGM display. Upon detection of a game active signal, the interface board switches video sources to the EGM video source and the playing of the video from the secondary video source is stopped. The memory may record the particular video played, how long it played or if it finished, the time and date for each video played, amount of times each video played, or other pertinent statistics or data relating to the provision of videos to the EGM display according to the embodiments of the present invention.","The switching of video sources may be accomplished by a physical hardware connection with the EGM game video source and\/or secondary video source or through software.","In one embodiment, video data is provided to the memory on the interface board through a periodic download from a video server. The downloading of data may be facilitated by wireless or wired connection. It is envisioned that the interface board will maintain a completely separate connection for transceiving data than the EGM. Thus, if a wired connection is used, it may be completely independent of the EGM connection with the central computer system used by the casino or gaming establishment, and may conform to applicable cabling standards.","In this embodiment, the video server may be connected with a plurality of interface boards, each being operatively associated with one or more EGMs. The video server may manage and control the provision of videos to the video displays through each interface board. It may also provide video data to each memory, remove video data, provide updates, or retrieve statistics relating to the provision of videos via the interface board.

Emulator  is also configured to receive data generated between the EGM and printer relating to normal operations, such as cashless wagering or routine polling signals, without interacting with such communication.","As shown by , the circuit board, which may be made by Intel or other circuit board manufacturer, is turned on and booted, admanager  begins the initial launch routine or otherwise starts from the \u201cinit.d run\u201d levels which may occur upon EGM inactivity being detected. This includes communication with touchscreen monitor TCHMON as shown by  for ultimately playing multimedia ads thereon. Emulator  is also launched from the run level system as shown by  after admanager  is started and locates the ports to be emulated, which include the communication ports between the EGM onboard printer and other EGM components. As shown by , emulator  will begin receiving packets of data from the EGM components and send them to the printer and vice versa, such as various commands, player cashouts, coupon printing etc. Emulator  simulates both EGM components and printer and causes no alarm issue.","As shown by , an ad is obtained from the ad database by adserver  and playing thereof on the EGM touch screen display begins. If a visual representation of a button is to be displayed then it will be presented on the touch screen along with the ad. As shown by , the ad may be played on the touch screen by one or more multimedia or movie players while one or more buttons may be presented on an overlay by additional media players. In this embodiment, the button may indicate that a ticket will be printed upon actuation thereof.","As shown by , when a touch is detected on the button area which is calculated from the width and height of the button, admanager  transmits a corresponding signal to adserver  to indicate the same. As shown by , adserver  is alerted to the touch event on the button and the media player responsible for the button holds the button in place as presented on the EGM display. In this embodiment, the ad will continue until a second touch event is detected. As shown by , emulator  transmits the appropriate code to the EGM printer to print the ticket corresponding to the button while polling the EGM or otherwise ensuring that an alarm or tilt state does not occur. As shown by , when the ad is finished playing or a second touch event is detected, the underlying EGM inactive game screen is shown on the EGM display again and printed ticket awaits removal as shown by .","In some embodiments, Admanager notifies Adserver when a displayed button has been touched by a player during presentation of an ad with a button on touch screen device as transmitted by Adserver. In some embodiments, Adserver responses to the notification that a button has been touched by halting further transmission of display data relating to that button from the separate media player, if any. Thus, the button will appear to freeze in place on the touch screen. Adserver sends instructions via Emulator to the printer on the EGM regarding the appropriate ticket to be printed, while Emulator also communicates with the EGM components so that it may operate the EGM printer without causing an internal alarm condition or \u201ctilt.\u201d After the ticket has been printed, Adserver continues the display of the ad until the touch screen is either touched again (presumably in an area outside of a button) or the ad is finished and the EGM content is displayed again on the touch screen.","In some embodiments, a marketing device such as marketing device  is in communication with a player tracking or player promotional system. In some embodiments, the marketing device is configured to be responsive to a touch event only if a player identifies themselves as having a player account or listing in the promotional system associated with the gaming establishment. In some embodiments, the marketing device is configured to notify or display a message on the EGM display screen indicating that the player must first insert a player card of otherwise identify themselves prior to executing the associated response in memory, such as printing a coupon or crediting the player account electronically, which may be at any time, such as after receiving a touch event in an object area or along with the presentation data without being triggered by a touch event. In such embodiments, the marketing device may be used to obtain and record a variety of data about each player, which may be maintained in connection with the identified player in the player tracking system or other memory. The data may include information relating to the time of the touch event, the type of EGM or game at which the touch event occurred, the nature of buttons or objects each player touches or otherwise expresses interest in, and the number of times the player has made use of the marketing device of the invention. Some embodiments may also be configured to keep a tally or record of the buttons pressed and coupons delivered for each player in order to perform a check prior to subsequent execution or coupon delivery for purposes of limiting the amount of responses or coupons to be made available to each player, among other things.","Systems and methods of the invention further provide various functionalities which include facilitating patron services through communication with EGM components as described above and herein below. In some embodiments, a system and method according to the invention is configured to utilize the EGM display screen hardware as a player\/operator interface as a means of communication.","In some embodiments, the systems and methods are configured to provide real-time notification to wagering game players of an anticipated reward, wherein the awarding of the reward is based on satisfying criteria largely independent of the game outcome, thus providing added incentive for the player to continue playing the wagering game to achieve the award.","Some embodiments of the invention are directed to systems, devices and methods for rewarding player loyalty and providing incentives for players to continue playing a wagering game by notifying a player that a bonus game play reward which will be awarded to the player independently of the outcome in the underlying wagering game, but wherein the awarding thereof depends on further game play of the underlying wagering game. By the term \u201cbonus\u201d it is meant an award, reward or the like. The bonus may have a variety of forms, including money, prizes such as tangible goods or free or reduced price goods or services, or points or other representative elements (tangible or intangible) which may be redeemed for goods, services and\/or money.","It is noted that bonuses, such as player loyalty rewards are also referred to as \u201ccomps\u201d because they are \u201ccomplimentary\u201d in that they do not necessarily depend on wagering outcomes or the satisfaction of specific obligations in order to be received by players. Rather, comps may be awarded to players based on the satisfaction of various criteria which is often considered a general measure of overall player interaction at the establishment over time. For example, a hotel room may be provided for free to a player as a comp in return for having played a certain number of wagering games in one day.","In some embodiments, the system and method of the invention as described above is operatively associated with an EGM in communication with a player tracking system. Generally, a player registers with the gaming establishment prior to commencing gaming. The gaming establishment issues a unique player-tracking card to the player and opens a corresponding player account that is stored in a player database in connection with the player tracking system. The player account typically includes the player's name and mailing address and perhaps other information of interest to the gaming establishment in connection with marketing efforts. Prior to playing at one of the EGMs, the player inserts their card into reader thus permitting the player tracking system to track player activity, such as amounts wagered, amounts won or lost, average wager and rate of play.","It should be understood that the player tracking system described above is a non-limiting example, and the invention may function with player tracking systems that differ as well as those which utilize other technology to identify players, such as systems which incorporate wireless identification, smart cards or RFID tags for example.","The player tracking system may comprise a single computer or a group of computers associated with one another on a network for monitoring one or more EGMs in one or more gaming establishments. Player data is obtained as players play games or otherwise interact with the gaming establishment in an identified manner so information regarding their interaction can be collected, that is, for example, by identifying themselves at the establishment with the player card. The player data is stored in connection with the player account in the player database.","In some embodiments, the invention is operatively associated with the player tracking system and configured for periodically conducting the steps of determining the aggregated player interaction data stored in the tracking system, determining reward criteria for implementing a player loyalty reward or \u201ccomp\u201d function, comparing the aggregated player interaction data with the reward criteria to determine whether all the reward criteria has been satisfied and notifying the player of any remaining criteria that must be satisfied in order to attain a reward, or alternatively, notifying the player that a reward criteria has been satisfied, and in some embodiments, automatically assigning a reward to the player.","The invention may in some embodiments include, among other things, a data input device for receiving data from the player tracking system, such as the aggregated player interaction data, a memory device for storing data, such as the reward criteria, a processor for comparing the aggregated player interaction data with the reward criteria to determine whether all the reward criteria has been satisfied and a data output device for notifying the player notifying the player of any remaining criteria that must be satisfied in order to attain a reward, or alternatively, notifying the player that a reward criteria has been satisfied.","The player interaction data and reward criteria often rely on point-based systems in which specific interactions are correlated with one or more reward points and reward point tallies are stored by the player tracking system in connection with each identified player in the player account. Thus, the reward criteria correspond with achieving one or more reward point amounts or levels.","It should be readily apparent that a player may acquire points based upon the extent of nature of their game play at the establishment, such as amounts bet, average wager, amounts won or lost, but different player selections or interactions may be associated with different point accumulation. For example, each game played may earn a player one reward point, while wagering the maximum amount in games played may earn a player additional reward points.","In some embodiments, the data input device is in communication for receiving reward point tally data from the player tracking system. Thus, as a player accrues reward points while, for example, playing at an EGM, and those points are stored in the player account, the data input device accesses the point data periodically to receive updated point tallies. The data input device may also receive reward criteria in the form of one or more reward point amounts which entitle the player to a reward. The reward point amount may be set by the establishment and stored in a reward criteria database operatively associated with the player tracking system and in communication with the data input device. Alternatively, the reward criteria may be stored in a separate memory. It should be understood that reward criteria in the form of reward point amounts may be changed, such as for example, to encourage play during times of the day or week in which the establishment seeks increase player participation. The reward criteria may also differ for each player or groups of players having certain demographics, characteristics or exhibit behaviors which make them more desirable patrons at the establishment. Also, the reward criteria may consist of a plurality of reward point amounts associated with a corresponding hierarchal reward structure.","The processor periodically compares the reward point tally with reward criteria in the form or reward point amounts as the player accrues points and determines the difference between the tally and reward point amount, which is the reward points necessary for the player to receive a reward. In some embodiments, the player is periodically notified by the data output device of the amount of reward points necessary as they are also accruing additional reward points. Thus, they are continually updated in near real-time of the amount of points remaining until a reward will be issued.","For example, if a player has 400 points and the reward point amount is 500 points, the processor will determine that 100 points are necessary to achieve a player loyalty reward and notify the player of the same. Alternatively, the notification may be expressed as a percentage of the reward point amount, so in the example above, a player may be notified they have 80% of the points needed to receive a player loyalty reward. As reward points continue to accrue, the processor will determine the difference or the percentage, as in the examples above, and notify the player as they get closer to achieving the reward point amount.","Once a reward point amount is reached by the player, a reward may be issued to the player from a reward database operatively associated with the player tracking system. Data regarding the reward issued to the player may also be received by the data input device and the player may be notified through the data output device of the reward.","In some embodiments, the system and method of the invention is configured to notify the player via a communication between the data output device and an EGM. The notification to the player may be any audio or visual cue that notifies the player of their relative proximity to the reward point amount. In some embodiments, the notification may consist of a scrolling text message on a portion of the main display or other EGM display screen. In some embodiments, the scrolling text may include any one or more of the player's most current point tally, amount of points the player must accrue to receive a reward, the reward point amount necessary to receive a reward, and information regarding the reward available to the player based on the player's current reward points. In some embodiments, a separate notification system including a display and\/or audio speakers may be operatively associated with an EGM for notifying the player according to the invention.","Thus, in the above embodiment, players will be updated of the amount of reward points necessary to receive a reward as points accumulate through their continued game play. It is envisioned that players will be further motivated to continue earning points as they are notified of how close their point tally is to a reward point amount, either through continued game play at an EGM or other player interactions with the establishment, to ultimately reach the reward point amount and receive a reward. It should be readily apparent that gaming establishments are continually seeking ways in which to please players, provide incentives and encourage additional game play and player loyalty.","In some embodiments, a player may be given the opportunity to earn bonus points if the player continues playing the game after having received a first reward or be offered the opportunity to play for a second reward by accruing sufficient reward points to reach a second reward point amount. It should be readily apparent that the period for comparing the reward point amounts and updating the player may be varied as desired by the establishment or necessitated by other factors, such as hardware or software limitations, or by order of a regulatory agency.","Some embodiments are configured to facilitate communication with players through a display of content on the display hardware. During typical operation the display screen of the EGM receives image data and presents a game-related main image display, such as a virtual representation of reel slots or playing cards, which is viewable to users. The main image display is created by a game-related video data stream provided by one or more EGM components and responsive at least in part to player interaction with the EGM. The main image display is typically centered on the display screen hardware, and may or may not result in an unused border area surrounding the main image display.","In some embodiments, the system is configured to communicate with the display screen hardware so that the display characteristics of the image data providing the main image display received from the EGM controller or other source will be adjusted to form an unused area or void on the display screen of a desired size located between an edge of the main image display shown in the display screen and the periphery of the display screen hardware. The system is further configured to provide a second image data stream to the display screen hardware which may be added to the main image display data, an overlay on the main image display, or otherwise provided as a separate image display stream adjacent to the adjusted main image display and presented for viewing in the unused area formed subsequent to the main image display adjustment. This secondary image display may be provided independently through communication connections with the EGM and a system according to some embodiments of the invention.","In some embodiments, the system communicates with the display screen hardware and\/or other components or data streams in the EGM to cause the main image display to be adjusted by resizing the main image display from between about 0.1% to about 5%. In other embodiments, the system causes the main image display to be adjusted by repositioning the game display to be moved off-center and closer to one edge of the display screen hardware. In some embodiments, the main image display is both resized and repositioned for presentation on the display screen hardware in order to form an unused area of a desired size for presenting the secondary display therein.","In some embodiments, the system communicates with the display screen hardware to consider various factors, such as the parameters of the display screen hardware and the main image display characteristics, in determining the optimal adjustment of the main image display to provide the desired unused area for the presentation of the secondary image display therein. The optimization may be set to determine the resizing and repositioning of the main image display that will result in the minimal resizing of the main image display on the display screen hardware while still providing the desired unused area for a desired secondary image display to be shown therein. The secondary image display may be an overlay image presented over the main image display on the display screen hardware.","The secondary image display may be provided by a system memory or through a remote source, and may include text or graphics. The system may communicate with a player tracking system to provide a secondary display customized to the player based on player data collected and stored in a player tracking database. Player data is typically obtained as players play games or otherwise interact with the gaming establishment in an identified manner so information regarding their interaction can be collected, that is, for example, by identifying themselves at the establishment with the player card.","In some embodiments, the system communicates with the player tracking system and, as described above, is configured for periodically conducting the steps of determining the aggregated player interaction data stored in the tracking system, determining reward criteria for implementing a player loyalty reward, comparing the aggregated player interaction data with the reward criteria to determine whether all the reward criteria has been satisfied and notifying the player of any remaining criteria that must be satisfied in order to attain a reward, or alternatively, notifying the player that a reward criteria has been satisfied, through the secondary image display. The system may be configured to periodically compare the reward point tally with reward criteria, in the form of reward point amounts, as the player accrues points from game play. The system determines the reward points necessary for the player to receive an award by calculating the difference between the tally and reward point amount and provides a secondary image display that includes a notification of the reward points necessary for the player to receive an award as players are also accruing additional reward points. Thus, they are continually updated in near real-time of the amount of points remaining until a reward will be issued.","In some embodiments, the secondary image display including the reward point notification is provided only upon a stoppage in play of the game on the main image display, that is, upon an outcome being determined. In some embodiments, the reward points necessary to obtain a reward may be updated by the outcome of the game which just occurred and the same may be included as a notification to the player in the secondary image display. For example, the secondary image display may include text, which may be scrolling or flashing on the display screen hardware, indicating that the player is 100 points away from a player loyalty award.","In other embodiments, the secondary image display may be used to provide messages or notifications of other things, such as discounts at restaurants or other things which may be of interest to players. Some of the notifications and messages may be customized or selected based on information known about the player, either by the player using their player card at the machine or based on the manner in which the player is playing the game. For example, information regarding the player stored in the player tracking base may be used to provide messages or graphics on the secondary image display which is most likely to be of interest to the player. In another example, the player's wagering nature or style may be used as a basis for selecting messages to be displayed in the secondary image display to that player.","In some embodiments in which the EGM display screens is a touch screen enabled device, the system provides graphics which are touch-enabled in the secondary image display. In some embodiments, the system is configured to detect the user touching the touch-enabled graphics, and is responsive to provide further information or options in the secondary image display accordingly. In other embodiments, the system is configured to either overlay or preempt the normal data stream which provides the main image display with a system data stream that provides a new main image display in response to detecting the user touching of a touch-enabled graphic in the secondary image display area. This new or player\/operator interface display may include a variety of information and further touch-enabled graphics. The system configuration may include a physical connection with the mechanism for communicating the normal EGM data stream and a video switching device that causes the preemption of the normal data stream in favor of the system's interface data stream.","For example, the interface display provided by the system data stream may comprise a menu of touch-enabled selectable options, including the option to place a drink order, make reservations at a restaurant, find out information about upcoming shows, view show schedules, purchase tickets to a show or other items, contact other players at other machines, view videos, access the Internet, view images taken in real-time from cameras showing the action at nightclubs, the pool or lines at the buffet, etc. Players may be provided with the option to change certain personal information in their account or add personal preferences. Players may be provided with the option to use their reward points towards complimentary services or items, which would then be subtracted from their reward points in their player tracking account.","In some embodiments, the interface display includes a menu which has been customized based on information known about the player, either by the player card accessing the player tracking database or through analysis of the player's interaction with the EGM. For example, options may be provided for certain services or particular products which have been selected by the player previously. In other embodiments, players may be assigned a status, such as VIP status, based on information stored in the player tracking database and made accessible to the system upon player identification via the player card. The system may provide options through the menu to players based on the assigned status. It should be readily apparent that the system of the invention may communicate with existing systems and databases within the gaming establishment to provide some of the features discussed herein. The system of the invention may further provide a portal for allowing management to change or customize system features, such as the menu options for example.","In some embodiments, a secondary image display or overlay may be shown while a game is being played along with the main image display or shown only between games or when the EGM is inactive. In some embodiments, any touch-enabled features are only available during the period after the outcome of one game has been determined and before another game is initiated by the player. Thus, in these embodiments the main image display is never interrupted during game play by the interface display.","In some embodiments, a system and method of the invention provides for the EGM main image display to be presented along with a secondary display on the EGM touch screen hardware display.  illustrates an EGM  with a display screen  presenting a main image display .

Players sign up for the tournament and are assigned an EGM number and a session time to play. All Players are given the same set amount of credits which must be played within the session time. Most EGMs include a preset tournament mode of operation that allows the EGM to be activated for the tournament and includes various selectable options, such as the duration of the tournament and starting credits. For example, a common tournament setup involves giving each player 1,000 credits on an EGM with 20 minutes to play them. Each time the player places a wager, the wagered amount will be deducted from their starting credits. The credits that the player wins from placing winning wagers will be tallied separately from the starting credits, as the players typically do not get to replay credits attributed to winning wagers. When the session time ends the EGM will usually enter a locked state so that no further play is allowed. Any credits not played by the player will be lost. The tally of credits from winning wagers is typically taken as the player's score in the tournament. Alternatively, the tally of credits from winning wagers and the amount of starting credits remaining at the end of the session are combined to form the player's score in the tournament. The score will be recorded by a tournament official and then compared to the scores of the other players in the tournament to determine a winner.","In this embodiment, the marketing device of the invention is configured to enter a tournament mode in which certain \u201cEGM tournament data\u201d is received or otherwise recognized by the marketing device for each EGM involved in a tournament, some of which may be presented in real-time to tournament players and officials.
