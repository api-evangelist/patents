{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to formal and informal modeling using graphical representation and, more particularly to annotation selection to be used in a diagram.","Diagrams are often used to facilitate communication and understanding in various domains of interests.","In the present disclosure a \u201cdiagram\u201d or a \u201cmodel\u201d is a visual illustration adhering a grammar of a modeling language. The grammar may be formal or informal, and the diagram may loosely adhere to it. Such modeling languages may be specified as a combination of the concrete syntax (i.e., graphical symbols), the abstract syntax (i.e., linguistic constructs), and a set of rules.","Model authors choose their notations from an arbitrary set of graphic symbols. However, some notations are often used for the same purpose. For example, a symbol of a cloud may often be used to represent the Internet, and thus when people view a model and see a cloud they may infer that it represents the Internet without having to review the legend or associated text.","One exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computer-implemented method performed by a processor, the method comprising: obtaining a contextual property of a notation to be used in a diagram, wherein the contextual property defines a context of a usage of the notation in the diagram; and searching in a notation-base for notations, whereby a search result set is obtained, wherein the search result set comprises notations that were previously used in a similar context to the contextual property, wherein the notation-base is stored in a data storage.","Another exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computerized apparatus comprising: a processor which is arranged to: obtain a contextual property of a notation to be used in a diagram, wherein the contextual property defines a context of a usage of the notation in the diagram; and search in a notation-base for notations, whereby a search result set is obtained, wherein the search result set comprises notations that were previously used in a similar context to the contextual property; and wherein the computerized apparatus is operatively coupled to the notation-base.","Yet another exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computer program product comprising: a non-transitory computer readable medium; a first program instruction for obtaining a contextual property of a notation to be used in a diagram, wherein the contextual property defines a context of a usage of the notation in the diagram; a second program instruction for searching in a notation-base for notations, whereby a search result set is obtained, wherein the search result set comprises notations that were previously used in a similar context to the contextual property, wherein the notation-base is stored in a data storage; and wherein said first, second, and third program instructions are stored on said non-transitory computer readable medium.","The disclosed subject matter is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the subject matter. It will be understood that blocks of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to one or more processors of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, a tested processor, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a non-transient computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the non-transient computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a device. A computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","One technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is to assist an author to use the most effective notations for a modeling script, which best represents for the audience the underlying modeling meaning assigned to it.","One technical solution is to monitor contextual properties associated with usage of notations in models. Another technical solution is to provide a contextual property based search of a notation-base, thus providing as results notations that were previously used for similar purposes. Yet another technical solution is to rank search results based on a past usage ranking criterion.","The disclosed subject matter may be used to determine that the most widely used illustration of the \u201cInternet\u201d is a cloud shape. Similarly, the most widely used illustration for \u201cstrategy\u201d is a \u201ctarget\u201d shape. Furthermore, based on an affiliation of an author of the model, different shapes may be determined For example, the term \u201cus\u201d may have a different meaning in different companies. As another example, the term \u201cmemory\u201d may be represented by different illustrations in different domains (e.g., a memory chip in a computer science domain v a brain in psychology domain).","One technical effect of utilizing the disclosed subject matter is improving effectiveness of notations. The disclosed subject matter enables selection of notations that most faithfully represent for the intended audience the underlying modeling meaning assigned to it.","Another technical effect is an increase in the repertoire of notations available to model authors when creating new modeling languages. The notation-base is updated with new notations and contextual information, thus accumulating collaborative contextual information of the notations.","Yet another effect is the creation of ad-hoc standards of notation usage. Upon the addition of new concepts, collaborative identification of notations to represent the new concepts is determined and recorded. The selected notations are promoted to be used by different authors and thus become an ad-hoc standard. Furthermore, the ad-hoc standards may be modified over time. For example, if a display used to be represented using a notation of a CRT, over time more and more authors use an LCD notation to represent the display and thus the ad-hoc standard is modified. The disclosed subject matter enables the creation and modification of an ad-hoc standard, which may vary between different domains and affiliations.","Yet another effect is a peer-production method of selecting notations to be used for a desired contextual intent. The disclosed subject matter may perform crowd-sourcing to determine an underlying meaning of notations based on usage thereof in similar models. Activity of authors may be monitored interactively and the underlying meaning of each notation may be updated based on new usages thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},"A Notation-base , such as retained in a data storage device, data server, network associated storage, or the like, may comprise a repository of notations useful in models and contextual information of usage thereof. In some exemplary embodiments, Notation-base  is based on a batch process of harvesting () a set of models, available in digital form, such as, for example, publicly available in the Internet . The harvesting process  may obtain a variety of existing models and for each such model index contextual properties of the model and elements comprised thereof. In some exemplary embodiments, the variety is a representative sample of conceptual modeling for one or more target domains.","In some exemplary embodiments, for a given model graphic symbols an associated descriptive text may be identified. Associated descriptive text may be identified in an associated textual label, in a text label that is placed in proximity of the graphic symbol or the like. The associated text may be useful for identifying underlying meaning of the symbol. As another example, text appearing on a first slide of a presentation which in many cases includes the venue where it is presented, author affiliation, title of a slide, title of the model, and similar information may be extracted to determine contextual property of each notation used in the model. In some exemplary embodiments, contextual properties of a sibling model may be used, such as the case when two models are counterparts of one another (e.g., different views of a same process or apparatus), two models appear on two slides of the same presentation or two pages of the same file, or the like. Furthermore, metadata of a file retaining the model may be used, such as a creation timestamp, metadata regarding user creating or updating the file, a file name, or the like.","A notation search () may be performed by a model author (not shown). The Notation-base  may be searched () for notations that are in accordance with search parameters. A result set () may be retrieved and displayed to the author.","The author may then select one of the notations retrieved or use a different notation (). In case the author uses a notation that was retrieved, Notation-base  may be updated () to reflect the context of usage that the author makes with the notation. Thus, Notation-base  may be improved to better suit the author's intent. Taking into account that many authors may search and use notations, Notation-base  may reflect cumulative underlying meaning of the notations, as collectively grasped by the authors.","Alternatively, the user may decide to use a different notation, such as one created by himself or obtained from a different source. Upon usage of the new notation, Notation-base  may be updated to include the new notation and contextual properties relating to usage thereof ().","It will be noted that the contextual property of an underlying meaning of the notation may be determined without explicit user input. As opposed to prior art databases which retain sets of notations that are manually identified using relevant keywords, the disclosed subject matter does not require such a manual effort.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["150","150"]},"An Identifying String Field  may be used to provide a text indicative of a usage of the notation. Any text may be provided to indicate a desired underlying meaning of a notation. As an example, the string \u201cdatabase\u201d may indicate searching for a notation that represents a database.","An Ontological Category Field  may be used to describe a type of symbol searched. Different ontologies may impose different ontological dimensions. In  the ontology differentiates between entities, relationships, actors, events and similar object types in the diagram. As opposed to the domain-neutral example given hereinabove, the ontology may be domain-specific. For example, in case of a diagram in the field of transportation, the ontology may be one of the following: a vehicle, an aircraft, a boat, etc.","A Filter Field  may be used to provide additional filtering criteria. As an example, desired visual characteristics of the notation may be provided, such as, color, grayscale, shape, dimension, iconic, pictures, size, or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, additional fields may be used to provide search criteria. For example, an affiliation field may be used to select author's role, organization, industry, community, or similar affiliation. Thereby, the search may be tuned to provide results that are tailored to the author's affiliation. In addition, the results may better be suited to the domain of the model.","It will be noted that in the present example, Identifying String Field  and Ontological Category Field  may be utilized to obtain different contextual properties from the user regarding the searched notation.","In response to a user clicking a Go Button , search process () may commence and a result set () may be displayed in a Result Pane . As can be appreciated, different notations may be provided (, , , ). In some exemplary embodiments, a user may select (e.g., using an input device such as a pointing device) a notation out of Result Pane . Based on user's selection and desired properties in Search Form  Notation-base  may be updated (). For example, in response to selection of notation , Notation-Base  may be updated to indicate that notation  is used to represent a database entity, in a domain of the model for which the selection was made, and by a user having the affiliation of the user that has selected notation . In some exemplary embodiments, usage of the selected notation is tracked and based thereon additional contextual properties may be extracted (e.g., affiliation, domain, and the like). Furthermore, based on usage of the notation, information that was not indicated in Search Form  may be determined, such as for example, underlying meaning of the notation as used (e.g., based on a text placed in proximity of the notation, it may be determined that the notation is used to represent a \u201cdatastore\u201d).","Additionally or alternatively, a user may decide not to select a notation from Result Pane . The user may create a new notation using a Create New Button . The user may draw a new notation, may select an existing image to be used as a notation, or the like. Upon addition of the new notation, the new notation may be added to Notation-base  (). The new notation may be added with contextual properties which are based on the selections in Search Form  and\/or actual usage of the new notation.","A Ranking Field  may be used to determine a metric to be used for ranking the result set in Result Pane . In some exemplary embodiments, Ranking Field  may enable a selection between Most Widely Used (MWU), Most Recently Used (MRU).","In some exemplary embodiments, MWU may be a metric in which total usage of the notation for the contextual property is measured. For example, the MWU may be a number of times in which the notation was used in a contextual property that as the desired contextual property defined by the user using Search Form . In some exemplary embodiments, it may be determined that different but substantially similar contexts of usage or considered the same as the desired contextual property. For example, a \u201cdatastore\u201d notation may be deemed as the same as a \u201cdatabase\u201d notation. Similarity of contextual properties may be based on rules, user preferences, or configurations.","In some exemplary embodiments, MRU may be a metric in which usage of the notation for the contextual property within a timeframe is measured. The MRU may be based on a timestamp of usage. The timestamp may be added during update () or addition (). In some exemplary embodiments, a timestamp may be based on metadata time information of files harvested (). In some exemplary embodiments, the timestamp may be indicative of creation time of the file. Additionally or alternatively, the timestamp may be indicative of modification time of the file, thus indicating that when modified the notation was still useful for its intended purpose. In some exemplary embodiments, the timeframe may be a month, a year or the like. In some exemplary embodiments, the timeframe may be based on rules, user preferences, or configurations. In some exemplary embodiments, the timeframe may be a function of maturity of the community, such that in a new field a relatively short timeframe may be used. As another example, in a field in which there are relatively small number of available models, a long timeframe may be used.","In some exemplary embodiments, MRU and MWU may be computed based on user preference and community preference.","In some exemplary embodiments, MRU and MWU are popularity metrics that measure usage popularity of the notation in specified contexts within a relevant community, domain, affiliation or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, ranking may be based MRU metric, MWU metric, additional metrics, combination thereof or the like. As an example, a text similarity metric may be used, such as using multiple Information Retrieval (IR) techniques, e.g. thesaurus construction, word association, semantic network or the like.","It will be noted that though Search Form  is depicted to have drop-down lists GUI elements for Ontological Category Field , Filter Field  and Ranking Field , other GUI elements may be used which may enable the user to make his selection between predetermined options. In some exemplary embodiments, the user may not be restricted to making a selection between predetermined options and may dynamically provide a different selection.","In some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, in response to a selection by a user of a notation, one or more suggestions of related notations may be provided. As an example, a message stating that \u201cother users who have used symbol S to denote A, have also selected the following symbols: S, S, and S, to denote A, A, and A respectively\u201d). This can be attained by extracting all the symbols in the notation-base that match the same community (e.g., affiliation) filtered out to include only model authors who have also performed the same selection as the one triggering the recommendation. Additionally or alternatively, notations that are often used in combination may be given higher ranking in future searches, such that if a search for A is performed, the notation S is given higher ranking due to the previous selection of S to denote A.","Referring now to  showing a flowchart diagram of steps in a method for contextual-based notation selection, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.","In step , one or more diagram collections, such as available over the Internet , may be harvested for notations and their usage context. Accordingly, Notation-Base  may be updated.","In step , contextual property may be obtained relating to usage of a notation in a diagram. The contextual property may include affiliation, domain, underlying meaning, ontology of the underlying object, or the like. In some exemplary embodiments, contextual property may be obtained using one or more fields of Search Form , such as for example Ontological Category Field . Without loss of generality, step  depicts obtaining one form of contextual property.","In step , a usage description of the notation may be obtained. In some exemplary embodiments, usage description may be obtained using Identifying String Field .","In step , filtering criteria may be obtained, such as relating to a desired graphical property of the notation. Filtering criteria may be obtained using Filter Field .","In step , ranking criteria may be obtained, such as MRU, MWU, or the like. The ranking criteria may be obtained using Ranking Field .","In step , Notation-Base  may be searched for a notation matching the one or more criterions obtained in steps -.","In step , the search results may be ranked based on the ranking criteria obtained in step . In some exemplary embodiments, the notations may be displayed in an order which is based on their respective ranking. Optionally, a rank of each notation may be displayed. In some exemplary embodiments, MWU\/MRU metrics for each contextual property may be retained within Notation-base  and updated based on newly harvested diagrams (e.g., step ) or interactive usage tracking (e.g., steps - depicted hereinbelow). In response to a search operation which requires some form of ranking, the applicable MWU\/MRU metric may be retrieved and used. Additionally or alternatively, the applicable MWU\/MRU metric may be computed dynamically in response to performing a search (e.g., step ).","In case the user uses a notation from the search result in the diagram, step  may be performed. In step , Notation-Base  may be updated with contextual information of usage in the diagram and\/or contextual information obtained from the user in steps -.","In case the user uses a different notation not appearing in the search result, step  may be performed. In step , the notation may be added to Notation-Base  along with contextual information of usage in the diagram and\/or contextual information obtained from the user in steps -.","In step , the user uses the notation in the diagram.","In some exemplary embodiments, usage of the notation may be tracked and Notation-Base  may be updated accordingly. For example, whenever a model author chooses to include a symbol in his model (e.g., drag-and-drop), a pop-up screen may prompt the user to specify contextual properties of the used notation. The contextual properties may be, for example, the name of the selected symbol, its type, or the like. In some exemplary embodiments, some contextual properties may be gathered automatically. This may include: the filename of the model, the name of the machine on which the model was edited, geographic location, or the like. In some exemplary embodiments, automatically gathered contextual properties may be extracted based on usage of the notation in the model, such as by examining adjacent text labels. Optionally, automatically gathered contextual properties may be displayed for the user who may verify or modify them.","In case the user searches for an additional notation steps - may be repeated.","Referring now to  showing a block diagram of components of a computerized apparatus useful for assisting a user in contextual-based notation selection, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.","In some exemplary embodiments, Apparatus  may comprise a Processor . Processor  may be a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a microprocessor, an electronic circuit, an Integrated Circuit (IC) or the like. Processor  may be utilized to perform computations required by Apparatus  or any of it subcomponents.","In some exemplary embodiments, Apparatus  may comprise an Input\/Output (I\/O) Module  such as a receiver, transmitter, transceiver, modem, an input device, an output device or the like. In some exemplary embodiments, I\/O Module  is utilized to connect to an I\/O device for providing input by or output to a human user. I\/O Module  may be operatively connected to a display, to a pointing device, a keyboard, or the like. It will however be appreciated that the system can operate without human operation. I\/O Module  may be operatively connected to Notation-Base  thereby enabling Apparatus  to retrieve information stored in Notation-Base  and update said information.","In some exemplary embodiments, Apparatus  may comprise a Memory . Memory  may be computerized memory, such as persistent or volatile, or a combination thereof. For example, Memory  can be a Flash disk, a Random Access Memory (RAM), a memory chip, an optical storage device such as a CD, a DVD, or a laser disk; a magnetic storage device such as a tape, a hard disk, storage area network (SAN), a network attached storage (NAS), or others; a semiconductor storage device such as Flash device, memory stick, or the like.

The components may be arranged as one or more executable files, dynamic libraries, static libraries, methods, functions, services, or the like, programmed in any programming language and under any computing environment.","A Contextual Property Obtainer  may be operative to obtain one or more contextual properties relating to a required notation to be used in a diagram. In some exemplary embodiments, Contextual Property Obtainer  may be operative to display a GUI element, such as Search Form , which may be responsive to user's input.","A Notation-Base Contextual Property-Based Search Module , also referred to as Search Module , may be operative to perform a search in Notation-Base  to notations which are useable in a specified one or more contextual properties. In some exemplary embodiments, Search Module  may perform the searching operation of step .","A MWU Ranker  and MRU Ranker  may be operative to rank search results based on MWU or MRU metric, respectively. Ranking of step  may be performed using the MWU Ranker , MRU Ranker , combination thereof, or the like.","An Interactive Notation-Base Updater  may be configured to update Notation-Base  in accordance with a user's interactive activity with the Apparatus , such as selecting a notation from a result set or adding a new notation. In some exemplary embodiments, Interactive Notation-Base Updater  may be operative to perform steps -.","A Batch Notation-Base Updater  may be configured to harvest diagram collections in order to enrich Notation-Base . Batch Notation-Base Updater  may extract notations utilized in the diagram, determine contextual properties of the notations, and update Notation-Base  accordingly. In some exemplary embodiments, Batch Notation-Base Updater  may be operative to perform harvesting of step .","An Automatic Contextual Property Recognition Module  may be configured to automatically determine one or more contextual properties of a notation based on its usage within a diagram. Automatic Contextual Property Recognition Module  may be utilized by Batch Notation-Base Updater  and\/or Interactive Notation-Base Updater . In some exemplary embodiments, Automatic Contextual Property Recognition Module  may determine contextual properties based on metadata of the diagram, its retaining file, text labels used within the diagram, sibling diagrams stored within the same file, or the like.","In some exemplary embodiments, the disclosed subject may be an implementation of the non-limiting exemplary formal definition provided hereinbelow. In general form, the notation-base is a tuple (C, S, M, F, G) such that:","C is a set of contextual properties (e.g., is_a=\u2018car\u2019, type=\u2018vehicle\u2019, shape=\u2018round\u2019, color=\u2018red\u2019, size=\u201810\u00d720\u2019, affiliation=\u2018IBM\u2019);","S is a set of symbols (e.g., an icon of the shape of a vehicle);","M is a set of usage metrics (e.g., usage frequency); and","F and G are two sets of mapping functions.","Each function \u0192\u03b5F is the contextual interpretation of a symbol such that \u0192:s\u2192c specifies for each symbol s\u03b5S a corresponding subset of contextual properties cC in the notation base.","Each function g\u03b5G is the usage interpretation of a symbol such that g:s\u2192m specifies for each symbol s\u03b5S a corresponding subset of usage metric values for each metric mM","In some exemplary embodiments, the notation-base may be accessed remotely (e.g., in a distributed environment). To support such settings, an Application Programming Interface (API) may be provided. The API may be, for example, as follows:","AddSymbol(s): insertion of a new symbol s to the notation-base S.","AddUsageMetric(s, m): the association of metric m to symbol s specified as a new function in G.","ClassifyAs(s, c): if not yet exists, the insertion of a new contextual property c into C and its association with symbol s specified as a new function in F.","SearchRankedBy(c, m): retrieves all the symbols in S that are associated with c in a function \u0192\u03b5F. The result is ordered according to the value of metric m.","UpdateMetrics(s, m): update the metrics m of a symbol s using function in G.","As an example, consider the harvesting process. Batch Notation-Base Updater  may receive as input a set of documents. Batch Notation-Base Updater  may utilize a parser for each document type (e.g., Micorsoft\u00ae PowerPoint\u00ae files may be parsed using a different parser than PDF files). The parser identifies model diagrams and may associate with the diagram contextual properties such as author name affiliation, keywords from title, etc. The diagram is then parsed using a layout analysis algorithm to associate contextual properties to each symbol. The contextual properties vary between graphical features of the symbol such as color, shape, contour, positioning and textual features such as textual texts associated with the symbol, multiplicity, etc. For each identified symbol the parser invokes AddSymbol (s) (if needed), ClassifyAs (s, c), Update Metrics (s, m). At the end of the process a tuple (C, S, M, F, G) is available.","Interactive Notation-Base Updater  may provide a GUI element, such as Search Form , to enable user interaction. Search Module  may invoke the SearchRankedBy(c,m). Each user selection is recorded and augmented with contextual properties associated with the user, the user search criteria and additional optional contextual properties which the user can add (e.g., using an appropriate form). In response to the user selection the following may be invoked: AddSymbol (s) (if needed), ClassifyAs (s, c), Update Metrics (s, m), such that results from recurrent invocation of SearchRankedBy (c, m) will take into account the input from the user. Thus, in fact each selection of the user enriches the notation base\u2014tuple (C, S, M, F, G) which may be shared by the user community.","The flowchart and block diagrams in the figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, each block in the flowchart and some of the blocks in the block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of program code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).
