title: Server side techniques for reducing database workload in implementing selective subfolder synchronization in a cloud-based environment
abstract: Techniques are disclosed for reducing database workload in implementing selective subfolder synchronization in a cloud-based environment. In one embodiment, a method comprises, in response to a selection, from a user, of a first synchronization state of a first folder in the workspace, synchronizing content of the first folder in the workspace with a corresponding folder on devices of a user (and collaborators) based on the first synchronization state. The workspace is shared among the user and one or more collaborators of the user. In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining the first synchronization state of the first folder based on synchronization states of one or more folders, other than the first folder, that are related to the first folder. The entries can be configured to identify hierarchical relationships between the one or more folders and the first folder on a per-user basis.

Client devices  typically include a display and\/or other output functionalities to present information and data exchanged between among the devices , and\/or the host server .","For example, the client devices  can include mobile, hand held or portable devices or non-portable devices and can be any of, but not limited to, a server desktop, a desktop computer, a computer cluster, or portable devices including, a notebook, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a palmtop computer, a mobile phone, a cell phone, a PDA, a smart phone (e.g., a BlackBerry device such as BlackBerry Z10\/Q10, an iPhone, Nexus 4, etc.), a Treo, a handheld tablet (e.g. an iPad, iPad Mini, a Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note II, Xoom Tablet, Microsoft Surface, Blackberry PlayBook, Nexus 7, 10 etc.), a phablet (e.g., HTC Droid DNA, etc.), a tablet PC, a thin-client, a hand held console, a hand held gaming device or console (e.g., XBOX live, Nintendo DS, Sony PlayStation Portable, etc.), iOS powered watch, Google Glass, a Chromebook and\/or any other portable, mobile, hand held devices, etc. running on any platform or any operating system (e.g., Mac-based OS (OS X, iOS, etc.), Windows-based OS (Windows Mobile, Windows 7, Windows 8, etc.), Android, Blackberry OS, Embedded Linux platforms, Palm OS, Symbian platform, Google Chrome OS, and the like. In one embodiment, the client devices , and host server  are coupled via a network . In some embodiments, the devices  and host server  can be directly connected to one another.","The input mechanism on client devices  can include touch screen keypad (including single touch, multi-touch, gesture sensing in 2D or 3D, etc.), a physical keypad, a mouse, a pointer, a track pad, motion detector (e.g., including 1-axis, 2-axis, 3-axis accelerometer, etc.), a light sensor, capacitance sensor, resistance sensor, temperature sensor, proximity sensor, a piezoelectric device, device orientation detector (e.g., electronic compass, tilt sensor, rotation sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer), or a combination of the above.","Signals received or detected indicating user activity at client devices  through one or more of the above input mechanism, or others, can be used by various users or collaborators (e.g., collaborators ) for accessing, through network , a web-based collaboration environment or online collaboration platform (e.g., hosted by the host server ). The collaboration environment or platform can have one or more collective settings  for an enterprise or an organization that the users belong, and can provide an user interface  for the users to access such platform under the settings .","The collaboration platform or environment hosts workspaces with work items that one or more users can access (e.g., view, edit, update, revise, comment, download, preview, tag, or otherwise manipulate, etc.). A work item can generally include any type of digital or electronic content that can be viewed or accessed via an electronic device (e.g., device ). The digital content can include .pdf files, .doc, slides (e.g., Powerpoint slides), images, audio files, multimedia content, web pages, blogs, etc. A workspace can generally refer to any grouping of a set of digital content in the collaboration platform. The grouping can be created, identified, or specified by a user or through other means. This user can be a creator user or administrative user, for example.","In general, a workspace can be associated with a set of users or collaborators (e.g., collaborators ) which have access to the content included therein. The levels of access (e.g., based on permissions or rules) of each user or collaborator to access the content in a given workspace can be the same or can vary among the users. Each user can have their own set of access rights to every piece of content in the workspace, or each user can be different access rights to different pieces of content. Access rights can be specified by a user associated with a workspace and\/or a user who created\/uploaded a particular piece of content to the workspace, or any other designated user or collaborator.","In general, the collaboration platform allows multiple users or collaborators to access or collaborate efforts on work items such each user can see, remotely, edits, revisions, comments, or annotations being made to specific work items through their own user devices. For example, a user can upload a document to a workspace for other users to access (e.g., for viewing, editing, commenting, signing-off, or otherwise manipulating). The user can login to the online platform and upload the document (or any other type of work item) to an existing workspace or to a new workspace. The document can be shared with existing users or collaborators in a workspace.","In general, network , over which the client devices  and the host server  communicate can be a cellular network, a telephonic network, an open network, such as the Internet, or a private network, such as an intranet and\/or the extranet, or any combination or variation thereof. For example, the Internet can provide file transfer, remote log in, email, news, RSS, cloud-based services, instant messaging, visual voicemail, push mail, VoIP, and other services through any known or convenient protocol, such as, but is not limited to the TCP\/IP protocol, Open System Interconnections (OSI), FTP, UPnP, iSCSI, NSF, ISDN, PDH, RS-232, SDH, SONET, etc.","The network  can be any collection of distinct networks operating wholly or partially in conjunction to provide connectivity to the client devices  and the host server  and can appear as one or more networks to the serviced systems and devices. In one embodiment, communications to and from the client devices  can be achieved by, an open network, such as the Internet, or a private network, such as an intranet and\/or the extranet. In one embodiment, communications can be achieved by a secure communications protocol, such as secure sockets layer (SSL), or transport layer security (TLS).","In addition, communications can be achieved via one or more networks, such as, but are not limited to, one or more of WiMax, a Local Area Network (LAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), a Personal area network (PAN), a Campus area network (CAN), a Metropolitan area network (MAN), a Wide area network (WAN), a Wireless wide area network (WWAN), enabled with technologies such as, by way of example, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Personal Communications Service (PCS), Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service (D-Amps), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Fixed Wireless Data, 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, IMT-Advanced, pre-4G, 3G LTE, 3GPP LTE, LTE Advanced, mobile WiMax, WiMax 2, WirelessMAN-Advanced networks, enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE), General packet radio service (GPRS), enhanced GPRS, iBurst, UMTS, HSPDA, HSUPA, HSPA, UMTS-TDD, 1xRTT, EV-DO, messaging protocols such as, TCP\/IP, SMS, MMS, extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP), real time messaging protocol (RTMP), instant messaging and presence protocol (IMPP), instant messaging, USSD, IRC, or any other wireless data networks or messaging protocols.","The embodiments disclosed herein recognize that, with the growing prevalence of the communication networks (e.g., the Internet) and smart portable devices (e.g., smart phones), there are many instances when a user want to selectively synchronize one or more subfolders in a workspace that is associated with the user, and especially when the workspace is shared among one or more collaborators of the user. Also, the user can have more than one user devices that are capable of connecting to the workspace, and sometimes not all data in the workspace are desirable or necessary to be shared to all devices because of nature of data (e.g., confidentiality, sensitivity, and\/or necessity), physical constraints of a particular device (e.g., screen size, computing power, or storage and\/or network limitations), or for other applicable reasons.","In particular, in a large institute setting (e.g., an international corporation) where potentially very large folders with a high volume of files and data are shared among users and collaborators, it is desirable to have the capability for a user (and each of the collaborators) to select only the content (e.g., subfolders or files) that he or she may be interested for synchronizing with one or more computing devices (e.g., a smart phone or a laptop computer) of his or hers, while leaving the remainder of the content stored in the cloud-based collaboration platform (e.g., a workspace hosted by the host server ).","Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods that enable selective subfolder synchronization in a cloud-based environment\/platform\/services (e.g., collaboration, file sharing, and\/or storage services) so that a user of the cloud-based environment can select individual folders for synchronizing according to his\/her own preference. The advantages provided by the techniques disclosed herein are particularly beneficial when a large number of files are stored in the workspace, because each person of a user and his or her collaborators, can select only the desired folder(s), subfolder(s), or file(s) in their commonly shared workspace to be synchronized on one or more devices of theirs.","In accordance with some embodiments, the host server  can selectively synchronize one or more subfolders in the workspace with a synchronization client (e.g., on the client device ). Specifically, the host server  can synchronize, in response to a selection of a first synchronization state of a first folder in the workspace from a user (e.g., of a client device ), content of a first folder associated with the user based on the first synchronization state regardless of a second synchronization state of a second folder in the workspace. The first folder is a subfolder of the second folder. For example, the host server  can selectively synchronize a folder and block synchronization for one or more subfolders within the synchronized folder. For purposes of discussion herein, a workspace of a cloud-based environment, which is hosted by the host server , is shared among the user and one or more collaborators of the user.","In one embodiment, the host server  also communicates relevant details to the synchronization client on the client devices  for selective synchronization, and the synchronization client can selectively synchronize one or more subfolders in the workspace with the host server . Specifically, in some embodiments, the synchronization client can receive from the host server  the user's selection for the first synchronization state of the first folder in the workspace. In response to the received selection, the synchronization client synchronizes content of the first folder associated with the user based on the first synchronization state regardless of a second synchronization state of a second folder in the workspace.","Further, in some embodiments, the user can select a folder that is stored on the client to be synchronized with the host server . The synchronization client can receive, at the synchronization client on the client device , the user's selection of a synchronization state of a folder on the client. In response to the selection, the synchronization client synchronizes content of the folder on the client with the workspace based on the selected synchronization state regardless of another synchronization state of another folder. The folder is a subfolder of the another folder.","In addition, the present embodiments also recognize that the amount of data that the host server  has to process in order to coordinate the synchronization statuses for all the folders among multiple users can increase dramatically with the increasingly large amount of folders and users involved in a shared space. This can quickly overload the storage and computing power the host server  in implementing the selective subfolder synchronization in certain situations, for example, when large amount of collaborators are subscribed to a folder that contains all the subfolders or files for all the users","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the host server  can employ a database structure (e.g., in the data repository ) that reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed in the database in implementing selective subfolder synchronization in a cloud-based collaboration environment. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the host server  can determine the first synchronization state of the first folder based on synchronization states of one or more folders, other than the first folder, that are related to the first folder. The determination can be performed on a per-user basis. In some implementations, the entries are configured to identify hierarchical relationships between the one or more folders and the first folder, so that a number of entries in the database can be less than a total number of folders that are related to the first folder.","More implementation details on the host server , the synchronization client, the workspace, the files and folders stored therein, and the relationship between the user and the collaborators are discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["250","215","235","255","205","225","245"]},"The web-based platform for collaborating on projects or jointly working on documents can be used by individual users and shared among collaborators. In addition, the collaboration platform can be deployed in an organized setting including but not limited to, a company (e.g., an enterprise setting), a department in a company, an academic institution, a department in an academic institution, a class or course setting, or any other types of organizations or organized setting.","When deployed in an organizational setting, multiple workspaces (e.g., workspace A, B C) can be created to support different projects or a variety of work flows. Each workspace can have its own associate work items. For example, workspace A  can be associated with work items , workspace B  can be associated with work items , and workspace N can be associated with work items . The work items , , and  can be unique to each workspace but need not be. For example, a particular word document can be associated with only one workspace (e.g., workspace A ) or it can be associated with multiple workspaces (e.g., Workspace A  and workspace B , etc.).","In general, each workspace has a set of users or collaborators associated with it. For example, workspace A  is associated with multiple users or collaborators . In some instances, workspaces deployed in an enterprise can be department specific. For example, workspace B can be associated with department  and some users shown as example user A  and workspace N  can be associated with departments  and  and users shown as example user B .","Each user associated with a workspace can generally access the work items associated with the workspace. The level of access will depend on permissions associated with the specific workspace, and\/or with a specific work item. Permissions can be set for the workspace or set individually on a per work item basis. For example, the creator of a workspace (e.g., one of user A  who creates workspace B) can set one permission setting applicable to all work items  for other associated users and\/or users associated with the affiliate department , for example. Creator user A  can also set different permission settings for each work item, which can be the same for different users, or varying for different users.","In each workspace A, B . . . N, when an action is performed on a work item by a given user or any other activity is detected in the workspace, other users in the same workspace can be notified (e.g., in real time or in near real time, or not in real time). Activities which trigger real time notifications can include, by way of example but not limitation, adding, deleting, or modifying collaborators in the workspace, uploading, downloading, adding, deleting a work item in the workspace, creating a discussion topic in the workspace.","In some embodiments, items or content downloaded or edited can cause notifications to be generated. Such notifications can be sent to relevant users to notify them of actions surrounding a download, an edit, a change, a modification, a new file, a conflicting version, an upload of an edited or modified file.","In one embodiment, in a user interface to the web-based collaboration platform where notifications are presented, users can, via the same interface, create action items (e.g., tasks) and delegate the action items to other users including collaborators pertaining to a work item , for example. The collaborators  can be in the same workspace A  or the user can include a newly invited collaborator. Similarly, in the same user interface where discussion topics can be created in a workspace (e.g., workspace A, B or N, etc.), actionable events on work items can be created and\/or delegated\/assigned to other users such as collaborators of a given workspace  or other users. Through the same user interface, task status and updates from multiple users or collaborators can be indicated and reflected. In some instances, the users can perform the tasks (e.g., review or approve or reject, etc.) via the same user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["302","322"]},"Each of users , , and  can individually use multiple different devices to access and\/or manipulate work items  in the workspace  with which they are associated with. For example users , ,  can be collaborators on a project to which work items  are relevant. Since the work items  are hosted by the collaboration environment (e.g., a cloud-based environment), each user can access the work items  anytime, and from any physical location using any device (e.g., including devices they own or any shared\/public\/loaner device).","Work items to be edited or viewed can be accessed from the workspace . Users can also be notified of access, edit, modification, and\/or upload related-actions performed on work items  by other users or any other types of activities detected in the workspace . For example, if user  modifies a document, one or both of the other collaborators  and  can be notified of the modification in real time, or near real-time, or not in real time. The notifications can be sent through any of all of the devices associated with a given user, in various formats including, one or more of, email, SMS, or via a pop-up window in a user interface in which the user uses to access the collaboration platform. In the event of multiple notifications, each notification can be depicted preferentially (e.g., ordering in the user interface) based on user preferences and\/or relevance to the user (e.g., implicit or explicit).","For example, a notification of a download, access, read, write, edit, or uploaded related activities can be presented in a feed stream among other notifications through a user interface on the user device according to relevancy to the user determined based on current or recent activity of the user in the web-based collaboration environment.","In one embodiment, the notification feed stream further enables users to create or generate actionable events (e.g., as task) which are or can be performed by other users  or collaborators  (e.g., including admin users or other users not in the same workspace), either in the same workspace  or in some other workspace. The actionable events such as tasks can also be assigned or delegated to other users via the same user interface.","For example, a given notification regarding a work item  can be associated with user interface features allowing a user  to assign a task related to the work item  (e.g., to another user , admin user , creator user  or another user). In one embodiment, a commenting user interface or a comment action associated with a notification can be used in conjunction with user interface features to enable task assignment, delegation, and\/or management of the relevant work item or work items in the relevant workspaces, in the same user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIGS. 1 and 3A-3B"],"b":"302"},"Work items  of  can be further organized into groups using one or more folders  within workspace . The folders  can have more than one levels of hierarchy including, for example, parent\/ascendant folder(s), child\/decedent folder(s) or subfolder(s), and\/or sibling folder(s). A person having ordinary skill in the art will understand that terminologies describing the hierarchy of the folders are used in a relative sense. For example, a parent folder can be a child folder of a grandparent folder, a particular child folder can be a parent folder of a grandchild folder, and so on. An example of first and second folders is illustrated on , where the first folder is a subfolder of the second folder. It is noted that the illustration of the two folders are merely exemplary; depending on the embodiments, there can be more than one level of hierarchy (e.g., the first folder is a grandchild folder of the second folder) between the first and the second folders, and that the second folder can be the root folder .","In accordance with some embodiments, the host server  provides the capability of selectively synchronizing an individual subfolder (e.g., a first folder in folders ) in addition to synchronizing everything that is included in the entire the root folder . Additionally, the host server  can selectively block the first folder from being synchronized, even when the first folder is within a parent folder (e.g., a second folder) that is synchronized. More specifically, the host server  can synchronize, in response to a selection of a first synchronization state of the first folder in the workspace , content of the first folder associated with the user based on the first synchronization state regardless of a second synchronization state of a second folder in the workspace , even if the first folder is a subfolder of the second folder. The user's selection can be received from the user via the user interface  (e.g., in forms of webpages) of the host server , via a synchronization client running on the client devices , or via any other suitable sources. In some embodiments, the host server  synchronizes, in response to the selection, content of other folders in the workspace  based on their respective synchronization states. For purposes of discussion herein, \u201ccontent\u201d of a respective folder (e.g., a root folder  of the workspace ) refers to files (e.g., files ) stored in the respective folder. According to some embodiments, all the files  or content in the respective folder have same synchronization states as the respective folder, and subfolders (e.g., folders ) within the respective folder each has its independent synchronization state.","It is noted that the terms \u201cuser\u201d and \u201ccollaborator\u201d are used in a relative sense. For example, a user  can be whoever that is currently performing operations on the workspace, and those who are sharing the same workspace are the user's collaborators , which can include the user  himself or herself.","In one or more embodiments, in addition to synchronizing content of the first folder in the workspace  with a corresponding folder on a device (e.g., devices -) of a user (e.g., creator ) based on the first synchronization state, the host server  also synchronizes content of the first folder in the workspace  with a corresponding folder on a device of a respective collaborator (e.g., another user) based on the first synchronization state. More specifically, the host server  can respond to a user's selection of the first synchronization state of the first folder, and synchronize accordingly content of the first folder on devices of the user and the collaborators based on the selection. This can be particularly useful when the folder being shared is owned by the user (e.g., creator  or administrator ), and therefore the collaborators (e.g., a regular user ) who are sharing the folder have lesser control privilege over the owner user. The technique can be complementary to the techniques discussed above, and is not mutually exclusive to the technique of allowing each of a user and his or her collaborators to selectively choose which content (e.g., folders, subfolders, or files) in the workspace that he or she desires to synchronize with his or her devices (e.g., smart phones, computers, etc).","In some embodiments, the host server  determines the first synchronization state of the first folder before the host server  synchronizes the first folder with the synchronization client(s). The first synchronization state can include one or more of: (i) synchronized, (ii) partially synchronized, or (iii) unsynchronized. Specifically, in one or more embodiments, the host server  assigns the first synchronization state as synchronized if the content of the first folder and all its subfolders are all synchronized. The host server  can assign the first synchronization state as unsynchronized if the content of the first folder and the subfolders are all unsynchronized, and can further assign the first synchronization state as partially synchronized if the content of the first folder and the subfolders are neither all synchronized nor all unsynchronized.","One or more embodiments provide that the host server  allows (e.g., by providing options or checkboxes to the user via the user interface ) the user to select the first synchronization state based on an original synchronization state of the first folder. For example, if the original synchronization state is synchronized, then the host server  allows the user to disable the first synchronization state to unsynchronized. If the original synchronization state is partially synchronized, then the host server  allows the user to either enable the first synchronization state to synchronized or to disable the first synchronization state to unsynchronized. If the original synchronization state is unsynchronized, then the host server  allows the user to enable the first synchronization state to synchronized.","Further, after receiving the user's selection, the host server  can automatically assign synchronization states to the first folder and\/or other folders in workspace  based on the user's selection. Specifically, in some embodiments, if the user enables the first synchronization state, then the host server  assigns synchronization states of all subfolders of the first folder as synchronized. If the user disables the first synchronization state, then the host server  assigns synchronization states of all subfolders of the first folder as unsynchronized.","Additionally, in response to the user's selection, the host server  can automatically update the synchronization state of the second folder, of which the first folder is a subfolder. For example, if all subfolders of the second folder are synchronized, then the host server  assigns the second synchronization state as synchronized. If all subfolders of the second folder are unsynchronized, then the host server  assigns the second synchronization state as unsynchronized. In response to the selection, if not all subfolders of the second folder are all synchronized or all unsynchronized, then the host server  assigns the second synchronization state as partially synchronized. In some embodiments, the update is recursively performed by the server  to all folders related to the first folder, including ascendant and\/or decedent folders.","In accordance with some embodiments disclosed herein, the user can select to create the first folder in the workspace  if it does not exist. When the first folder is created, the host server  can automatically assign the first synchronization state to the first folder based on the second folder's synchronization. If the second synchronization state is synchronized, then the host server  assigns the first synchronization state as synchronized. If the second synchronization state is not synchronized (e.g., unsynchronized or partially synchronized), then the host server  assigns the first synchronization state as unsynchronized. It is noted that, in some embodiments, the server 's operations of copying a folder is similar to that of creating a folder. Specifically, the original first synchronization state is ignored by the host server , and the host server  assigns a new synchronization state to the newly created folder based on the synchronization state of the parent folder of the newly created folder.","In another additional or alternative embodiment, the user can select to move the first folder (e.g., a moving folder) in the workspace  into another folder (e.g., a destination folder) in the workspace . The another folder can be any folder in the workspace  including the folders  and the root folder . According to some implementations, upon moving, the host server  can update the first synchronization state based on the synchronization state of the another folder. In one embodiment, the host server  assigns the first synchronization state as synchronized if the synchronization state of the another folder is synchronized. In addition, the host server  maintains the first synchronization state as is if the third synchronization state is not synchronized (e.g., unsynchronized or partially synchronized).","In yet another embodiment, if the synchronization state of another folder originally is unsynchronized, and if the first synchronization state originally is not unsynchronized, the host server  assigns the synchronization state of another folder as partially synchronized. If the another folder is the root directory  of the workspace , the host server can  maintain the first synchronization state as is. A table  which illustrates example synchronization states for moving the first folder to the destination folder is depicted in .","According to some embodiments, all files or content (e.g., files ) in the root directory  of the workspace  have synchronization states as synchronized, and the synchronization state of the root directory  is permanently set as partially synchronized.","Moreover, the host server  can display, on the user interface  of the server, an icon for a respective folder that distinctively indicates a synchronization state of the respective folder. For example, the host server  can use a first image for the state of the respective folder being synchronized, another image for the state of the respective folder being partially synchronized, and yet another image for the state of the respective folder being unsynchronized.","As previously mentioned, the host server  synchronizes the content of the first folder in the workspace  with a synchronization client on client devices ; the term \u201csynchronization client\u201d can refer to software, hardware, firmware, or any suitable combination thereof that can communicate with the host server  in performing the synchronization. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the client (e.g., client devices ) can receive from the host server  a selection from the user for the first synchronization state of the first folder in the workspace , and, in response to the received selection, the client synchronizes content of the first folder associated with the user based on the first synchronization state regardless of a second synchronization state of a second folder in the workspace . In response to the received selection, the client can additionally synchronize content of other folders in the workspace  with data stored on the client based on their respective synchronization states.","The synchronization client can further maintain, on the client, a directory tree that corresponds to a directory structure of the first folder. The directory tree on the client includes all folders having a higher hierarchy above the first folder. For example, if there is a folder named \u201cAlpha\u201d under the root folder  in the workspace , and inside that \u201cAlpha\u201d folder is a subfolder named \u201cBeta.\u201d Even if the user only enables the synchronization state for \u201cBeta\u201d but not for \u201cAlpha,\u201d then the directory structure of the Beta folder on the client can still be maintained as \u201cRoot\/Alpha\/Beta.\u201d","Furthermore, in some embodiments, if the user enables the first synchronization state and if a local folder that corresponds to the first folder in the workspace  does not exist on the client, the client can create the local folder on the client. Also, if (i) the user enables the first synchronization state and if the first folder is deleted in the workspace , or if (ii) the user disables the first synchronization state of the first folder, the client can delete the local folder that corresponds to the first folder from the local drive. For example, if a folder in the workspace  is disabled by the user from synchronization, the folder is to be removed locally, either immediately or at an appropriate time (e.g., when a next synchronization iteration is performed). Similarly, if a folder in the workspace  is enabled by the user for synchronization, it is to be added locally, either immediately or at an appropriate time (e.g., when the next synchronization iteration is performed).","Additionally or alternatively, the user can use the synchronization client to selectively synchronize one or more subfolders on the client with the host server . More precisely, the client can receive, at the client (e.g., client devices ), a selection from the user for a synchronization state of a folder on the client, and in response to the selection, the client synchronizes content of the folder on the client with the workspace  based on the synchronization state of the folder regardless of a synchronization state of another folder. In some embodiments, the folder is a subfolder of the another folder. In response to the selection, the client can further synchronize content of other folders on the client with the workspace  based on their respective synchronization states.","Also, one or more embodiments provide that the client maintains a directory tree in the workspace  that corresponds to a directory structure of the folder on the client. Similar to a manner described above, the directory tree in the workspace can include all ascendant folders having a higher hierarchy above the folder on the client. Specifically, the client communicates to the host server  relevant information for the server  to perform actions suitable to synchronize, in the workspace , the content and the directory structure of the first folder.","For instance, if the user enables the synchronization state of the folder on the client and if the folder is deleted, the client can communicate to the host server  to delete a folder in the workspace  that corresponds to the first folder on the client.","For another instance, the client may, in response to the user creating the first folder, if a folder that corresponds to the first folder does not exist in the workspace , then the client requests the host server  to create the folder that corresponds to the first folder in the workspace  for synchronization. On the other hand, if the folder that corresponds to the first folder already exists in the workspace , then the client requests the host server  to create a conflicting folder in the workspace  for synchronization. In this way, risk of accidental overwriting data can be minimized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIGS. 1, 3A-3B, and 3D"],"b":["360","361","365","361","365","110","130","110"]},"A typical but less desirable method for bookkeeping each folders synchronization states in a database in order to implement the selective subfolder synchronization techniques would be storing a row in the database for every single folder and subfolder (and potentially each file, if a file-level selective synchronization is to be implemented). However, because the collaborative nature of the cloud-based workspace , the amount of data that the host server  has to process in order to coordinate the synchronization statuses for all the folders among multiple users can increase dramatically with the increasingly large amount of folders and users involved in the workspace , This can quickly consume the storage and computing power the host server  in implementing the selective subfolder synchronization in certain situations, for example, when large amount of collaborators are subscribed to a folder that contains all the subfolders or files for all the users.","According to one or more embodiments, the host server  can determine the first synchronization state of the first folder based on synchronization states of one or more folders, other than the first folder, that are related to the first folder. The determination can be performed on a per-user basis. In some implementations, the entries are configured to identify hierarchical relationships between the one or more folders and the first folder, so that a number of entries in the database can be less than a total number of folders that are related to the first folder.","More specifically, because the workspace  are shared among a number of users\/collaborators in a collaborative environment, in some embodiments, the database  is configured to include a path identifier (ID) data structure system (e.g., as illustrated in the example entries -) so that a reduced amount of information can be stored in database . Information of synchronization states of other folders that are not recorded in the database  can be calculated or interpolated in ways that are discussed below.","In some embodiments, the host server  can determine a first synchronization state of a first folder based on synchronization states of one or more folders, other than the first folder, that are related to the first folder. For example, when the host server  needs to retrieve the synchronization state of a particular folder, and the entries (e.g., entries - in database ) storing the synchronization states may not include the folder of interest, then the host server  can determine (e.g., by calculation, by interpolation, or by other suitable means) from the database  what the synchronization state of the particular folder of interest.","For one example, if a user  wants to synchronize an entire folder tree (e.g., root folder ), because everything below the root folder  is also synchronized, then only such information at the uppermost level of that tree needs to be stored in the database . For another example, if a user  wants to synchronize only one folder (e.g., folder B) that has a number of sibling folders (e.g., Folder C, Folder D) in a tree, then the database  can mark just that one folder out of the set of siblings as synced. Conversely, if a user  wants to synchronize seven out of eight children folder in a folder tree, then the database  can mark all seven of those as synchronized, and can keep the one that is not synchronized out of the database  (e.g., so that it is regarded as not synchronized).","More specifically, the path ID column in the entries - are configured to identify the hierarchical relationship between the folders that are related to the particular folder of interest, so that the host server  can determine the location (and the synchronization status, whether synchronized, unsynchronized, or partially synchronized) of the folder of interest relative to other related folders in a particular user's account.","Take entry  as a specific example, for user A, Folder B is synchronized, and its directorial path back to its parental folders is A; now, if the host server  needs to determine the synchronization state for Folder E for user A, because for user A, Folder E's parent Folder B is synchronized (as indicated by entry ), the synchronization state for Folder E for user A is also synchronized.","The host server  can also calculate what folders are synchronized by using an identifier (e.g., a path ID) of a current folder and scanning the database  beneath the current folder to look for (in the entries) any folder that has the current folder in its path ID column. Then, the host server  can automatically determine that the folders found are descendants of the folder of interest, and can determine synchronization states for the folder of interest based on the scanning results. In some embodiments, the identifier of the folder of interest can be supplied from a client (e.g., running on device -) of the user.","Take entry  as an example, for user A, Folder F is synchronized, and its directorial path back to its parental folders is A\/B\/E; now, if the host server  needs to determine the synchronization state for Folder E for user A, because for user A, Folder E's parent Folder B's synchronization state is not yet recorded, but Folder E's only child Folder F is synchronized, the synchronization state for Folder E for user A is also synchronized. Contrarily, if not all Folder E's children folders are all synchronized, the synchronization state for Folder E for user A is partially synchronized. And, assuming all Folder E's children folders are unsynchronized, then the synchronization state for Folder E should be unsynchronized.","It is also noted that, in entry , for user A, Folder F is synchronized; however, because user A does not have the privilege to collaborate on the root Folder A, the path ID for Folder F for user A is only B\/E.","In this way, the techniques described above can effectively represent what is synchronized with a number of entries in the database  that is less than a total number of folders that are related to the first folder, resulting in having fewer entries in the database , which in turn decreases the time of queries the host server  has to send to the repository  in determining synchronization states of one or more folders of interest. After the host server  determines the synchronization state for a folder of interest, the host server  may include as a part of a response to the client(s) for synchronization purposes whether or not the folder of interest in synchronized, partially synchronized, or unsynchronized.","Additionally, because the collaboration nature of the workspace  (e.g., as being shared among different users), the database  can record the synchronization states on a per-user basis. By the same token, if an action takes place (e.g., move, delete, or uncollaboration) to one folder, the action may affect several different users (e.g., collaborators) that are participating in that folder, and the host server  together with the database  can make changes on corresponding folders on the user's and the collaborators' devices to appropriately reflect the action.","Therefore, in some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cdelete_sync( )\u201d function to clean up the entries in the database  for users and collaborators after a synchronized folder is deleted. More specifically, if the folder deleted was the only synchronized subfolder of a parent folder, then the parent folder will become marked as files-only synchronized (e.g., or in some instances, partially synchronized). Moreover, if the folder synchronized deleted is the only subfolder of the parent, then the parent folder will no longer have any subfolders and will get marked as fully synchronized.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cdelete_non_sync( )\u201d function to clean up the entries in the database  for users and collaborators after a non-synchronized folder is deleted. More specifically, if the deleted folder had siblings that are all synced, then the parent folder will become marked as synchronized and the entries for (or item sync rows) the sibling folders will be deleted. Moreover, if the parent folder ends up becoming synchronized, the entry can \u201cbubble further up the tree,\u201d or the synchronization state can populate to upper level folders, according to similar rules depending on the synchronization states of the parent folder's siblings.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201csync_folder( )\u201d function to synchronize a folder for a given user, and to clean up the entries in the database  to reflect the newly selected synchronization state. More specifically, if the folder to be synchronized has siblings that are all already synchronized, then a synchronization entry will be added to the parent folder and the entries for the sibling folders will be removed. It is noted that the synchronization entry can again \u201cbubble up the tree\u201d according to similar rules. Moreover, any entries for descendants of the synchronized folder would have their synchronization entries deleted.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cunsync_folder( )\u201d function to unsynchronize a folder for a given user, and to clean up the entries in the database  to reflect the newly selected synchronization state. More specifically, the host server  can delete any entries for the folder being unsynchronized and any that for its descendants. If the folder being unsynchronized has no siblings, then the parent folder will become marked as being \u201cfiles only\u201d synchronized (or in some instances, partially synchronized). If the folder being unsynchronized has sibling folders that are all synchronized, then the entries for the parent folder will be deleted, and entries for each of the siblings will be added.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cupdate_item_syncs_for_move( )\u201d function to clean up the entries in the database  for all users at both the source and destination of a move operation. More specifically, if the folder being moved is unsynchronized at its original location and the parent folder of the destination is unsynchronized, then the moved folder will remain unsynchronized. Moreover, if destination parent is synchronized, then the folder will be synchronized in its new location. If the destination parent is partially synchronized, then the moved folder will retain its original synchronization state from the source location. If the destination parent is fully synchronized, then the moved folder will be fully synchronized in its new location. The synchronization entries for the parents of the source folder may get reshuffled according to same rules as the \u201cdelete_sync( )\u201d function described above.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cuncollab( )\u201d function to clean up the entries in the database  for a collaborator he or she becomes removed from a folder.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201clower_collab_permission( )\u201d function to clean up the entries in the database  for a collaborator if his or her access permission changes so that the collaborator can no longer synchronize a folder.","In some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cdelete_user( )\u201d function to remove the entries in the database  for a user who is deleted.","Further, in some embodiments, the host server  is configured to perform a \u201cmark_update_timestamp_for_siblings( )\u201d function to change an update timestamp on a folder after its synchronization state changes.","It is noted that, in implementing the functions aforementioned, the host server  can perform one or more of low level functions that are used to compose higher level subfolder synchronization functionalities. Examples of these low level functions are:","1. functions used to get information about a folder's parent folders (ancestors) or sibling folders, such as:","(a) get_parent_id\u2014returns the folder id that is the parent of the specified folder.","(b) get_all_parent_ids\u2014returns a list of folder ids that are ancestors of the specified folder.","(c) get_siblings\u2014returns folders in the same folder as a specified folder.","(d) has_siblings\u2014returns whether there are other folders in the same folder as a specified folder.","(e) get_sync_path\u2014returns the path to a collaborated folder as seen from the collaborator's perspective.","2. functions used to get current sync state on one or more folders for one or more users, such as:","(a) get_sync_state\u2014returns the current sync state for a specified folder for a specified user (ie. \u201csynced\u201d, \u201cunsynced\u201d, \u201cpartially synced\u201d).","(b) get_sibling_sync_state\u2014returns the collective sync state of all the siblings of a specified folder for a specified user (ie. \u201cnon synced\u201d, \u201call fully synced\u201d, \u201call partially synced\u201d, \u201cno siblings\u201d, \u201cmixed sync status\u201d).","(c) get_sync_states_optimal\u2014returns the sync states for a set of specified folders for a specified user.","(d) make_sync_state_array\u2014returns a mapping of folder ids to current sync states for a list of specified folders for a specified user.","(e) get_sync_states_for_all_users\u2014returns the sync states of a specific folder for all collaborating users individually.","3. functions used to determine the \u201cedges\u201d of where the database is storing sync information about a user's folder tree, such as:","(a) is_in_item_sync_table\u2014determines if the database has an item sync row for a specific folder for a specific user.","(b) is_parent_in_item_sync_table\u2014determines if the database has an item sync row for any ancestors (parents) of a specific folder for a specific user.","(c) is_self_or_descendants_in_item_sync_table\u2014determines if the given folder or any children of that folder have database rows in the item sync table for a specified folder and user.","4.
