Thus, the toner selectively adheres to the surface of the photoreceptor body according to the potential pattern of the electrostatic latent image, whereby the electrostatic latent image is developed into a toner image (developing step).","Subsequently, the toner image is transferred onto the surface of the sheet (transfer step), and fixed to the surface of the sheet (fixing step). Thus, the image is formed on the surface of the sheet.","Further, a part of the toner remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor body after the transfer of the toner image is removed, for example by a cleaning blade or the like (cleaning step). Thus, the photoreceptor body is ready for the next image formation.","In the charging step out of the aforementioned process steps, a charging roller is used, which is kept in contact with the surface of the photoreceptor body to evenly electrically charge the surface of the photoreceptor body.","Widely used as the charging roller is an electroconductive roller having an outer peripheral surface to be kept in contact with the surface of the photoreceptor body, at least the outer peripheral surface being made of a crosslinking product of an electrically conductive rubber composition and having lower resistance.","Generally usable as the rubber composition for the electroconductive roller is a rubber composition imparted with ion conductivity by blending a rubber component including at least an ion conductive rubber (e.g., an epichlorohydrin rubber) and a diene rubber, a crosslinking component for crosslinking the rubber component, and the like.","In order to further reduce the resistance of the electroconductive roller, a slat of an anion containing a fluoro group and a sulfonyl group and a cation of a metal element, or an ionic liquid is often blended in the rubber composition (Patent Document land the like), or electrically conductive carbon is blended in the rubber composition.","Patent Document 1: JP2013-97117A","Patent Document 2: JP5063663","If the resistance of the overall electroconductive roller is reduced by blending the salt of the cation and the anion in the rubber composition, however, a great amount of the salt is required. This may result in cost increase of the electroconductive roller because the salt is expensive. In addition, the reduction of the resistance by the blending of a great amount of the salt has limitation (about 10\u03a9), and further reduction of the resistance is difficult.","Where an electron conductive agent such as electrically conductive carbon is blended in the rubber composition, the resistance of the electroconductive roller can be further reduced to less than the limitation. In this case, however, the voltage dependence of the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller is increased, making it difficult to handle the electroconductive roller. Further, the resistance of the electroconductive roller is steeply reduced by the addition of the electrically conductive carbon. Therefore, it is difficult to control the resistance of the electroconductive roller to a desired level. In addition, the electroconductive roller produced by blending the electrically conductive carbon has a higher hardness and, when being used as the charging roller, for example, cannot easily follow the surface unevenness of the photoreceptor body, failing to evenly electrically charge the photoreceptor body. This may result in uneven charging.","Patent Document 2 proposes that a surface layer containing graphite or carbon dispersion is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the electroconductive roller in order to stably electrically charge the photo receptor body for prevention of fogging of a formed image. However, it is difficult to further reduce the resistance of the electroconductive roller with the provision of the surface layer of the conventional structure.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an electroconductive roller which is imparted with lower resistance than the prior-art electroconductive roller without the addition of the expensive salt and the electron conductive agent liable to cause various problems or by adding the electron conductive agent in a smaller proportion that hardly causes the aforementioned problems, and to provide an image forming apparatus employing the electroconductive roller.","The present invention provides an electroconductive roller, which includes a tubular base layer made of an ion-conductive elastic material, and a surface layer provided on an outer peripheral surface of the base layer, wherein the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer and the surface resistance R(\u03a9) of an outer peripheral surface of the surface layer satisfy all the following expressions (1) to (3):\n\nlog \u2212log \u22672.5\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nlog \u22667.0\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nlog \u22664.0\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The present invention also provides an image forming apparatus which incorporates the inventive electroconductive roller as a charging roller.","According to the present invention, the electroconductive roller is configured such that the surface layer is provided on the outer peripheral surface of the flexible base layer, and the resistances of the base layer and the surface layer satisfy all the above expressions (1) to (3). Thus, the electroconductive roller is imparted with lower resistance than the prior-art electroconductive roller without the addition of the expensive salt and the electron conductive agent liable to cause various problems or by adding the electron conductive agent in a smaller proportion that hardly causes the aforementioned problems. The image forming apparatus employing the electroconductive roller is also provided.","Referring to (), an electroconductive roller  according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a tubular base layer  made of an ion-conductive elastic material and having a center through-hole , a surface layer  provided on an outer peripheral surface  of the base layer , and a shaft  inserted through and fixed to the through-hole .","The shaft  is a unitary member made of a metal such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy or a stainless steel.","The shaft  is electrically connected to and mechanically fixed to the base layer , for example, via an electrically conductive adhesive agent. Alternatively, a shaft having an outer diameter that is greater than the inner diameter of the through-hole  is used as the shaft , and press-inserted into the through-hole  to be electrically connected to and mechanically fixed to the base layer . Thus, the shaft  and the base layer  are unitarily rotatable.","In the present invention, the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer  and the surface resistance R(\u03a9) of an outer peripheral surface  of the surface layer  should satisfy all the following expressions (1) to (3):\n\nlog \u2212log \u22672.5\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nlog \u22667.0\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nlog \u22664.0\u2003\u2003(3)\n","In general, the electrical resistance is proportional to the volume resistivity and the length of a path along which electric current flows, and inversely proportional to the sectional area of the path.","In the case of an ordinary electroconductive roller  having no surface layer as shown in  for use as a charging roller, for example, the path of the electric current flowing through the electroconductive roller  is the shortest linear region (indicated by a broken line in ) through which a contact  with the photoreceptor body  is connected to a shaft  inserted through the electroconductive roller  as seen in the section of the electroconductive roller  and, hence, has a very small sectional area. Therefore, the reduction of the resistance has limitation, even if an attempt is made to reduce the volume resistivity by adjusting the composition of the material for the electroconductive roller.","In the inventive electroconductive roller  configured such that the surface layer  is provided on the outer peripheral surface  of the flexible base layer  as shown in () and the resistances of the surface layer  and the base layer  satisfy all the above expressions (1) to (3), on the other hand, the surface layer  serves as an electrical conductor directly connected to the contact  with the photoreceptor body . Therefore, as shown by broken lines in , the entire circumferential base layer  functions as the electric current path extending to the shaft  and, hence, the path has a significantly increased sectional area.","Therefore, the volume resistivity of the base layer  is significantly reduced to a lower level than the prior art without the addition of the expensive salt and the electron conductive agent liable to cause various problems (in the absence of the salt and the electron conductive agent) or by adding the electron conductive agent in a smaller proportion that hardly causes the aforementioned problems. Thus, the resistance of the electroconductive roller  can be further reduced to a lower level than the prior art.","More specifically, the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the overall electroconductive roller  including the base layer  and the surface layer  provided on the base layer  can satisfy the following expression (4):\n\nlog \u22664.7\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThat is, the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller  can be reduced to a level of not higher than 10\u03a9 that is unachievable by the prior art.\n","The roller resistance R(\u03a9) can be controlled at any intended level principally by properly selecting an ion-conductive elastic material for the base layer . Even if the electron conductive agent is blended in a material for the surface layer  in order to satisfy all the expressions (1) to (3), therefore, it is possible to easily control the roller resistance R(\u03a9) while reducing the voltage dependence of the roller resistance.","In addition, the surface layer  can be formed as having a significantly smaller thickness than the base layer . Where the electroconductive roller  is used as the charging roller, therefore, the electroconductive roller  can follow the surface unevenness of the photoreceptor body  to evenly electrically charge the photoreceptor body . Thus, the uneven charging can be suppressed.","In the present invention, the resistances of the base layer  and the surface layer  should satisfy all the expressions (1) to (3) for the following reasons. If at least one of the expressions is not satisfied, the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the overall electroconductive roller  cannot be sufficiently reduced due to the mechanism described above.","The difference log R\u2212log Rdefined by the expression (1) is preferably not greater than 5.5 in the aforementioned range.","In order to increase the difference log R\u2212log Rto greater than 5.5, it is necessary to increase the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer , or to reduce the surface resistance R(\u03a9) of the outer peripheral surface  of the surface layer .","In the former case, however, the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer  is liable to fall outside the range of log R\u22667.0 defined by the expression (2), making it impossible to reduce the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the overall electroconductive roller .","Even if the electron conductive agent such as the electrically conductive carbon is blended, the reduction of the surface resistance R(\u03a9) of the outer peripheral surface  of the surface layer  has limitation, making it substantially difficult to reduce the surface resistance R(\u03a9) as in the latter case to increase the difference log R\u2212log Rto greater than 5.5.","The roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer  defined by the expression (2) is preferably 5.5 log R\u22667.0.","If log Ris less than this range, it is necessary to reduce the surface resistance R(\u03a9) of the outer peripheral surface  of the surface layer  in order to maintain the resistance difference log R\u2212log Rat not less than 2.5. However, the reduction of the surface resistance R(\u03a9) has limitation, as described above, making it substantially difficult to reduce log Rto less than 5.5 while maintaining the difference log R\u2212log Rat not less than 2.5.","In order to further reduce the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the overall electroconductive roller , log Ris particularly preferably log R\u22666.0 in the aforementioned range of log R\u22667.0.","The surface resistance R(\u03a9) of the outer peripheral surface  of the surface layer  defined by the expression (3) is preferably 1.0\u2266log R\u22664.0.","It is substantially difficult to reduce log Rto less than this range.","<<Base Layer >>","The base layer  of the inventive electroconductive roller  may be made of any of various ion-conductive elastic materials.","Particularly, the base layer  is preferably formed from an ion conductive rubber composition which contains a rubber component including an epichlorohydrin rubber and a diene rubber.","<Epichlorohydrin Rubber>","Examples of the epichlorohydrin rubber for the rubber component include epichlorohydrin homopolymers, epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide bipolymers (ECO), epichlorohydrin-propylene oxide bipolymers, epichlorohydrin-allyl glycidyl ether bipolymers, epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether terpolymers (GECO), epichlorohydrin-propylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether terpolymers and epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-propylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether quaterpolymers, which may be used either alone or in combination.","Of these epichlorohydrin rubbers, the ethylene oxide-containing copolymers, particularly the ECO and\/or the GECO are preferred.","These copolymers preferably each have an ethylene oxide content of not less than 30 mol % and not greater than 80 mol %, particularly preferably not less than 50 mol %.","Ethylene oxide functions to reduce the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer .","If the ethylene oxide content is less than the aforementioned range, however, it will be impossible to sufficiently reduce the roller resistance R(\u03a9).","If the ethylene oxide content is greater than the aforementioned range, on the other hand, ethylene oxide is liable to be crystallized, whereby the segment motion of molecular chains is hindered to adversely increase the roller resistance R(\u03a9). Further, the base layer  is liable to have a higher hardness after the crosslinking, and the rubber composition is liable to have a higher viscosity when being heat-melted before the crosslinking.","The ECO has an epichlorohydrin content that is a balance obtained by subtracting the ethylene oxide content from the total. That is, the epichlorohydrin content is preferably not less than 20 mol % and not greater than 70 mol %, particularly preferably not greater than 50 mol %.","The GECO preferably has an allyl glycidyl ether content of not less than 0.5 mol % and not greater than 10 mol %, particularly preferably not less than 2 mol % and not greater than 5 mol %.","Allyl glycidyl ether per se functions as side chains of the copolymer to provide a free volume, whereby the crystallization of ethylene oxide is suppressed to reduce the roller resistance R(\u03a9) of the base layer .","However, if the allyl glycidyl ether content is less than the aforementioned range, it will be impossible to provide this function and hence to sufficiently reduce the roller resistance R(\u03a9).","Allyl glycidyl ether also functions as crosslinking sites during the crosslinking of the GECO. Therefore, if the allyl glycidyl ether content is greater than the aforementioned range, the crosslinking density of the GECO is increased, whereby the segment motion of molecular chains is hindered. This may adversely increase the roller resistance R(\u03a9).","The GECO has an epichlorohydrin content that is a balance obtained by subtracting the ethylene oxide content and the allyl glycidyl ether content from the total. That is, the epichlorohydrin content is preferably not less than 10 mol % and not greater than 69.5 mol %, particularly preferably not less than 19.5 mol % and not greater than 60 mol %.","Examples of the GECO include copolymers of the three comonomers described above in a narrow sense, as well as known modification products obtained by modifying an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide copolymer (ECO) with allyl glycidyl ether.

The xanthogen modification type CR is synthesized in substantially the same manner as the sulfur modification type CR, except that an alkyl xanthogen compound is used as the molecular weight adjusting agent.","Further, the CR is classified in a lower crystallization speed type, an intermediate crystallization speed type or a higher crystallization speed type depending on the crystallization speed.","In the present invention, any of these types of CRs may be used.
