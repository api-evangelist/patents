title: Conditional purchase offer management system
abstract: A conditional purchase offer (CPO) management system is disclosed for receiving CPOs from one or more customers, such as airline passengers, and for evaluating the received CPOs against a number of CPO rules defined by a plurality of sellers, such as airlines, to determine whether any seller is willing to accept a given CPO. A CPO is a binding offer containing one or more conditions submitted by a customer for purchase of an item, such as airline travel, at a customer-defined price. A CPO rule is a set of restrictions defined by a given seller, such as an airline, to define a combination of restrictions for which the seller is willing to accept a predefined price. The CPO rules may be securely stored by one or more servers. The CPO management system permits a seller to correct for forecasting errors, if necessary, or other competitive forces which have produced excess capacity, by providing inventory for sale to CPO customers.

No. 09\/507,262, entitled \u201cCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OFFER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,\u201d filed on Feb. 18, 2000, which in turn is a continuation of, and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 5,794,207 on Aug. 11, 1998, all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.","The present invention relates generally to a system for selling goods and services, such as airline tickets and, more particularly, to a method and system for managing the sale of such goods and services by a seller, such as an airline, to customers who have submitted an offer for the purchase of such items.","Airlines and other sellers have developed sophisticated revenue management systems (RMSs) to optimize revenue. Generally, when a flight is first added to an airline's flight schedule, the airline's revenue management system attempts to maximize revenue for the flight by establishing a plurality of fare classes and then allocating the number of seats and price assigned to each fare class. The revenue management system will thereafter continue to monitor the actual demand within each fare class relative to forecasted demand, to dynamically reevaluate the inventory allocation and pricing of each fare class for a given flight. In this manner, the airlines attempt to fly each aircraft as full as possible without allowing earlier-booking discount-fare passengers to displace later-booking full-fare passengers.","While conventional revenue management systems employ sophisticated tools to anticipate future travel, forecasting errors invariably lead to unanticipated excess capacity. In addition, an airline can utilize its revenue management system to forecast its anticipated excess capacity on a given flight associated with seats that are predicted to be empty. Furthermore, unexpected external events, such as a price war or extreme weather conditions, can also affect an airline's excess capacity. Thus, in an attempt to reduce such excess capacity, airlines periodically reevaluate the inventory allocation and pricing of each fare class for a given flight. An airline cannot simply discount the published fares for such unsold seats, however, without either starting a fare war or compromising its own underlying fare structure (i.e., without also reducing its full-fare prices for business travelers). Thus, there is currently no effective way for airlines to dispose of such excess capacity.","Although many airlines fill empty seats with \u201cstandby\u201d passengers, this practice is typically limited to instances where some oversight on the part of either the passenger or the airline has occurred. For example, the passenger's flight may have been overbooked, the passenger may have missed an original flight, or the passenger may have purchased a ticket at or near the time of the flight. Moreover, standby travel is costly for the airline and is inconvenient for the passenger because there is no guarantee that the passenger will get to fly on the same day. In addition, airlines attempt to sell excess capacity utilizing consolidators, who traditionally sell airline tickets at a discount. Since the terms of the relationship between the airlines and the consolidators are generally not flight specific and are typically defined months in advance, the sale of tickets through a consolidator does not provide a sufficiently dynamic mechanism for airlines to sell such excess capacity when actual demand fails to meet forecasted demand. Even assuming that the airlines could release the tickets for sale through the consolidators at the last minute, there is currently no effective way for the consolidators to announce the availability and price of such tickets to customers.","Airlines recognize that there is a large source of latent demand associated with leisure travelers who are willing to purchase tickets at a favorable price. There is currently no effective way, however, for an airline to receive an offer from a customer for leisure travel at a particular price set by the customer, below the airline's published fare. In particular, there is no effective way for the airline to be confident that if the airline accepts the customer's offer, the customer will book the ticket without using the information to ascertain the airline's underlying level of price flexibility, which, if known to an airline's competitors or customers, could dramatically impact the airline's overall revenue structure.","As apparent from the above deficiencies with conventional systems for selling goods and services, such as airline tickets, a need exists for a system that permits a seller to sell excess capacity when actual demand fails to meet forecasted demand. A further need exists for a buyer-driven system that permits an airline to sell tickets to leisure travelers at a price set by the customer, typically below the airline's published fare. Yet another need exists for a system that permits sellers to stimulate sales of excess inventory, without compromising the seller's published price structure. Another need exists for a system that permits sellers to capture and process consumer demand for each selling price of a given item, such as a given fare class on each airline flight.","Generally, according to one aspect of the invention, a conditional purchase offer (CPO) management system is disclosed for receiving conditional purchase offers from one or more customers, such as airline passengers, and for evaluating the received CPOs against a number of CPO rules defined by a plurality of sellers, such as airlines, to determine whether any seller is willing to accept a given CPO. A CPO is a binding offer containing one or more conditions submitted by a customer for purchase of an item, such as airline travel, at a customer-defined price.","A CPO rule is a set of restrictions defined by a given seller, such as an airline, to define a combination of restrictions for which the seller is willing to accept a predefined minimum price. The CPO rules are utilized by the CPO management system to render a decision to either accept, reject or counter a CPO on behalf of a particular seller.","In an illustrative airline embodiment, the CPO rules are preferably generated by the revenue management system (RMS) of the respective airline by evaluating current inventory, pricing and revenue information, as well as historical patterns, to forecast future travel. In alternate embodiments, the CPO rules may be generated by a yield management system, a profit management system, or any system which controls and manages inventory. The RMS may be embodied as a conventional RMS, as modified herein to generate CPO rules and to otherwise allocate and price airline tickets for sale to CPO customers. In one preferred embodiment, the RMS will periodically execute a CPO rule generation process to generate CPO rules that encourage the sale of tickets to CPO customers.","The CPO management system preferably includes a CPO management central server and one or more secured airline servers. Each secured airline server may be associated with one or more airlines and each server stores, among other things, the CPO rules defined by any associated airlines. Each secured airline server may be remotely located from the CPO management central server, or may be integrated with the CPO management central server. In one remote embodiment, the secured airline server associated with one or more airlines may be physically located at a processing facility secured by the particular airline.","The CPO rules contain sensitive information, including price flexibility and available capacity, which, if known to an airline's competitors or customers, could dramatically impact the airline's overall revenue structure. Thus, according to a feature of the present invention, the CPO rules may be securely stored by each airline server, to prevent one airline from accessing, obtaining or altering the CPO rules of another airline. In one embodiment, the secured airline servers utilize encryption techniques and database access control mechanisms.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the CPO management system prevents customers from submitting multiple CPOs containing a progressively increasing price in order to identify the airline's defined minimum price for a given flight. For example, if a CPO will be binding upon the customer if accepted by any airline, the customer will be discouraged from \u201cpinging\u201d the CPO management system to identify the airline's underlying price flexibility. In addition, the CPO management system can limit the number of CPOs which any customer can submit within a predefined time period. In alternate embodiments, the customer or travel agent can be charged a fee or a penalty if a ticket is not booked when at least one airline has accepted the CPO or the CPO management system can evaluate a rating of the customer containing information regarding the likelihood that said customer will book a ticket corresponding to said CPO. In this manner, the airline can be confident that if the airline accepts the customer's offer, the customer will book the ticket without using the information to ascertain the airline's underlying level of price flexibility.","Customers may contact the CPO management system by means of telephone, facsimile, online access, e-mail, in-person contact or through a travel agent, to provide the CPO management system with the terms of their CPO. In one preferred embodiment, the customer  may contact the CPO management system  by means of a telephone, with the CPO management system  collecting information from the customer  related to the CPO using an interactive voice response unit (IVRU) (not shown). Once the terms of the CPO have been received by the CPO management system, the CPO management central server will execute a CPO management process to compare the received CPO against the CPO rules of each airline, to determine whether to accept, reject or counter the CPO. Thereafter, the customer is notified of the response of the airlines to the CPO. If an airline accepts the CPO, or if the customer accepts a counteroffer from an airline, a ticket is then booked by the CPO management system with the appropriate restrictions.","The CPO management system may optionally access a central reservation system (CRS) or proprietary airline reservation systems (ARSs) of each airline, to perform itinerary queries that will identify particular flights which satisfy a given itinerary, and to make reservations.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the minimum requirements of a CPO may be designed to discourage utilization of this system by business travelers, last-minute travelers and other passengers who are typically willing to pay full-fare. For example, business travelers will be discouraged if the CPO rules require a Saturday night stay or significant flexibility by the customer on both the departure and return portions of the customer's itinerary. In this manner, business travelers, who are typically unwilling to lose up to a full day at either end of their trip, will be discouraged from purchasing such discounted tickets. Thus, the present invention permits airlines to fill otherwise empty seats in a manner that stimulates latent and unfulfilled leisure travel demand while leaving underlying fare structures of the airlines intact","According to a further aspect of the invention, an airline can correct for forecasting errors, if necessary, or other competitive forces which have produced unanticipated excess capacity, by releasing tickets for sale to CPO customers. Due to the confidential nature of the CPO rules, and the discouraged use of CPO tickets by full-fare business travelers, the airlines can sell such excess capacity at a discount, without undermining its existing published fare structure.","A more complete understanding of the present invention, as well as further features and advantages of the present invention, will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","120","130","100","110","130"]},"As used herein, a CPO is a binding offer containing one or more conditions submitted by a customer  for the purchase of an item, such as air travel, at a customer-defined price. In the illustrative airline embodiment, the customer-defined conditions would include itinerary parameters, such as the origin and destination cities; acceptable dates and times of departure and return; and whether connecting flights or stopovers are acceptable to the customer. In addition, the parameters of a CPO may allow a customer to specify one or more preferred airline(s), flights, seat assignments, seat class, aircraft type, refund\/change rules, or maximum layover time.","As discussed further below, a CPO rule is a set of restrictions defined by a given seller, such as an airline, to define a combination of such restrictions for which the seller is willing to accept a predefined minimum price. In a preferred embodiment, the CPO rules are generated by the revenue management system  of the respective airline. In alternate embodiments, the CPO rules may be generated by a yield management system, a profit management system, or any system which controls and manages inventory.","As discussed more fully below in conjunction with and , the revenue management system  will employ a CPO rules generation process  to generate CPO rules by evaluating current inventory, pricing and revenue information, as well as historical patterns and external events, to forecast future travel. Thereafter, the CPO rules are utilized by the CPO management system  to render a decision to either accept, reject or counter a CPO on behalf of a particular airline. According to a feature of the present invention, the CPO rules are dynamic in nature and may be updated by a given airline, as necessary.","For example, a CPO rule for a given airline can specify that the airline will accept any CPO for travel between Newark, N.J. (EWR) and Orlando, Fla. (MCO) during the month of October, 1997, provided that (i) the customer travels between Tuesday and Thursday, (ii) the tickets are booked within 21 days of departure, (iii) the price is at least $165 per ticket, (iv) K-class inventory is available on all flight segments of the customer's itinerary, and (v) there are at least two (2) passengers travelling together.","Although the CPO management system  is illustrated herein as a system for selling airline tickets, the CPO management system  could be utilized to sell any good or service, such as automobiles, insurance, computer equipment, or hotel accommodations, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill. For a more detailed discussion of a general CPO management system for selling such items, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/707,660, filed Sep. 4, 1996, the parent application to the present invention, which is incorporated by reference herein. It is noted that in such alternate embodiments, the revenue management system , discussed below in conjunction with through , may be embodied as an inventory management system or any other system utilized by the seller to establish pricing and inventory information for the respective item.","As shown in , the CPO management system  preferably includes a CPO management central server  and one or more secured airline servers . As discussed further below in conjunction with , each secured airline server  may be associated with one or more airlines and each server  stores, among other things, the CPO rules defined by any associated airlines, such as the airline . Each secured airline server  may be remotely located from the CPO management central server , as shown in , or may be integrated with the CPO management central server . In one remote embodiment, the secured airline server  associated with each airline may be physically located at a processing facility secured by the particular airline, or at the physical location of a third party.","The particular location of the secured airline servers  will dictate the nature of the information that is transmitted between the airlines ,  and the CPO management system , as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill. For example, if the secured airline servers  are integrated with the CPO management central server , or are otherwise remotely located from the respective airlines , , then the respective airline ,  will transmit the CPO rules to the location of the airline's associated secured airline server  for storage of the CPO rules and application of the CPO rules against each received CPO. Likewise, if the secured airline servers  are physically located at the processing facility secured by the associated airline, then the CPO management central server  will transmit the CPOs to each airline for processing and the airlines will return the response for each CPO to the CPO management central server .","The CPO rules contain sensitive information, including price flexibility and available capacity, which, if known to an airline's competitors or customers, could dramatically impact the airline's overall revenue structure. Thus, according to a feature of the present invention, the CPO rules are preferably securely stored by each airline server , if necessary, to prevent one airline  from accessing, obtaining or altering the CPO rules of another airline . In one embodiment, the secured airline servers  utilize computer security techniques, such as database access control mechanisms. In this manner, the integrity and confidentiality of the CPO rules are maintained in the potentially hostile computing environment.","In addition, according to a further feature of the invention, the CPO management system  prevents customers  from submitting multiple CPOs containing a progressively increasing price in order to identify the airline's defined minimum price for a given flight. For example, if the CPO will be binding upon the customer  if accepted by any airline , the customer  will be discouraged from \u201cpinging\u201d the CPO management system  to identify the airline's underlying price flexibility. In addition, the CPO management system  can limit the number of CPOs which any customer  can submit within a predefined time period.","In alternate embodiments, the customer or travel agent  can be charged a fee or a penalty if a ticket is not booked when at least one airline has accepted the CPO or the CPO management system  can evaluate a rating of said customer  containing information regarding the likelihood that said customer  will book a ticket corresponding to said CPO. For a more detailed description of a suitable rating system, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/811,349, filed Mar. 4, 1997, entitled AIRLINE PRICE INQUIRY METHOD AND SYSTEM, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment, the evaluated rating comprises a ratio of bookings to purchase offers by said customer . In this manner, the airline can be confident that if the airline accepts the customer's offer, the customer will book the ticket without using the information to ascertain the airline's underlying level of price flexibility. The particular location of a given secured airline server  may also impact the level of security measures that the associated airline(s) may desire for the sensitive CPO rules. For example, if a given secured airline server  is dedicated to a single airline and is physically located at a processing facility secured by the associated airline, then the respective airline may implement its own minimal security measures to control the processing of each CPO against its own CPO rules, if desired, and thereby maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the price-sensitive information incorporated into the CPO rules. If, however, a given secured airline server  stores the CPO rules for a plurality of airlines and is remotely located from such airlines, then the importance of implementing computer security and database access control mechanisms may be increased, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill.","As discussed further below, each customer  contacts the CPO management system , for example, by means of telephone, facsimile, online access, e-mail, in-person contact or through a travel agent, and provides the CPO management system  with the terms of their CPO. It is noted that each customer  may employ a general-purpose computer for communicating with the CPO management system . The general-purpose computer of each customer  is preferably comprised of a processing unit, a modem, memory means and any software required to communicate with the CPO management system .","Once the terms of the CPO have been received by the CPO management system , the CPO management central server  will execute a CPO management process , discussed below in conjunction with through , to compare the received CPO against the CPO rules of each airline. A result of this comparison, the CPO is either accepted, rejected or countered. Thereafter, the customer  is notified of the response of the airlines to the CPO. If an airline accepts the CPO, or if the customer  accepts a counteroffer from an airline, a ticket is then booked by the CPO management system  with the appropriate restrictions which meet the conditions defined by the customer .","According to a further feature of the present invention, the minimum requirements of a CPO are designed to discourage utilization of this system by business travelers or last-minute travelers who are typically willing to pay full-fare. For example, business travelers will be discouraged if the CPO rules require a Saturday night stay or significant flexibility by the customer  on the time of both the departure and return portions of the customer's itinerary. In this manner, business travelers, who are typically unwilling to lose up to a full day at either end of their trip, will be discouraged from purchasing such discounted tickets. Thus, the present invention permits airlines to fill otherwise empty seats in a manner that stimulates latent and unfulfilled leisure travel demand while leaving underlying fare structures of the airlines ,  intact","Likewise, in embodiments where the CPO management system is utilized for the sale of any item, the minimum requirements of a CPO are preferably designed to discourage utilization of this system by customers who are typically willing to pay the full retail price. For example, when selling fashion items, CPO customers can be required to purchase fashions from the previous season. Similarly, the CPO rules can be designed to require the purchase of multiple quantities of a given item, and thereby discourage use by consumers looking for one item, who are more likely to pay the full retail price.","In a preferred embodiment, the CPO management system  may optionally access a central reservation system (CRS) , discussed below in conjunction with , to perform itinerary queries that will identify particular flights which satisfy a given itinerary, and to make reservations. The central reservation system (CRS)  may be embodied, for example, as an existing conventional reservation system, such as Apollo, Sabre, System One or Worldspan.","In addition, the CPO management system  could alternatively access the proprietary airline reservation systems (ARSs)  of each airline to perform such itinerary queries and to make reservations with the respective airline. The airline reservation systems (ARSs)  maintained by each airline , are each essentially a subset of the central CRS . Thus, in view of the overlapping functions and capabilities of the CRS  and the proprietary reservation systems  of each airline, the CPO management system  could access any of such systems to obtain required information, and the terms \u201cCRS\u201d and \u201cARS\u201d are used interchangeably herein.","As shown in , each airline , , also has a revenue management system (RMS) , discussed further below in conjunction with through . The RMS  may be embodied as a conventional RMS, as modified herein to generate CPO rules and to otherwise allocate and price airline tickets for sale to CPO customers.","Generally, the revenue management systems (RMSs)  are utilized to optimize revenue per flight, in a known manner. An RMS performs seat inventory control by periodically adjusting nested booking limits (\u201cbuckets\u201d) for the various fare classes, in order to optimize the passenger mix and thereby maximize the generated revenue.","The CPO management system , customer , airlines ,  and central reservation system  (collectively, the \u201cnodes\u201d) preferably transmit digitally encoded data and other information between one another. The communication links between the nodes preferably comprise a cable, fiber or wireless link on which electronic signals can propagate. For example, each node may be connected via an Internet connection using a public switched telephone network (PSTN), such as those provided by a local or regional telephone operating company. Alternatively, each node may be connected by dedicated data lines, cellular, Personal Communication Systems (\u201cPCS\u201d), microwave, or satellite networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","205","210","220","225","230","240","250","260","205"]},"The CPU  may be embodied as a single commercially available processor, such as Intel's Pentium 100 MHz P54C microprocessor, Motorola's 120 MHz PowerPC 604 microprocessor or Sun Microsystem's 166 MHz UltraSPARC-I microprocessor. Alternatively, the CPU  may be embodied as a number of such processors operating in parallel.","The ROM  and\/or data storage device  are operable to store one or more instructions, discussed further below in conjunction with , which the CPU  is operable to retrieve, interpret and execute. For example, the ROM  and\/or data storage device  preferably store processes to accomplish the transfer of required payments, charges and debits, between the airlines ,  and customers . In particular, as discussed below in conjunction with , the CPO management process  preferably transmits the credit card information associated with a given customer  to the credit card issuer for payment, if a ticket is actually issued to the customer . The processing of such accounting transactions are preferably secured in a conventional manner, for example, using well known cryptographic techniques.","The CPU  preferably includes a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a CPU local memory storage device, such as, for example, a stackable cache or a plurality of registers, in a known manner. The control unit is operable to retrieve instructions from the data storage device  or ROM . The ALU is operable to perform a plurality of operations needed to carry out instructions. The CPU local memory storage device is operable to provide high-speed storage used for storing temporary results and control information.","As discussed further below in conjunction with , respectively, the data storage device  includes a customer database , an airline database , a flight schedule database , and a CPO database .

The airline database  preferably stores information on each airline which is registered with the CPO management system  to sell airline tickets to CPO customers, including address and contact information. The flight schedule database  preferably stores specific flight information for each O & D Pair. Finally, the CPO database  preferably contains a record of each CPO being processed by the CPO management system , including the terms of the CPO and the associated status.","In addition, the data storage device  includes a CPO management process , discussed further below in conjunction with . Generally, the CPO management process  receives each CPO from a customer , compares the CPO against the CPO rules of each airline , , and determines whether to accept, reject or counter the CPO on behalf of an airline.","The communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to the central reservation system (CRS)  and the proprietary reservation systems (ARSs)  maintained by each airline , . The communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to individual customers and travel agents, such as the customer , for example, by means of an Internet connection using the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to any remote secured airline servers . The communications ports , ,  each preferably include multiple communication channels for simultaneously establishing a plurality of connections. It is noted that although the CPO management central server  is illustrated as having three separate communication ports , , , the CPO management central server  could alternatively be implemented with a single connection to an ethernet network, which in turn provides the central server  with a connection to the various nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","100","300","120","130","300","305","310","320","325","330","340","345"]},"As previously indicated, in one embodiment, the CPO rules may be stored in a secure database to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the highly sensitive information included in each CPO rule.

In one embodiment, a separate fare class can be established by the RMS  for selling tickets to CPO customers. Since tickets to CPO customers are generally sold at a discount, the RMS  preferably only initially allocates seats to the CPO fare class which are forecasted to be empty or unlikely to be sold when the flight actually departs. As is well known, an airline can utilize a conventional RMS  to predict, based on available historical data, whether or not there will be empty seats on a given flight.","As shown in , the airline reservation system (ARS)  will access the established pricing and restrictions database  and seat allocation database  to perform itinerary queries. In addition, as tickets are sold by the airline , the ARS  will preferably decrement the available inventory in the seat allocation database . In this manner, the seat allocation database  maintains an up-to-date representation of the available inventory on each flight.","The RMS  will continue to monitor the actual demand  within each fare class relative to forecasted demand , as illustrated by , to dynamically reevaluate the inventor) allocation and pricing of each fare class for a given flight in order to minimize the unanticipated excess inventory delta . The RMS  monitors current actual demand information by retrieving detailed inventory data from the seat allocation database  or summary information from the forecast and demand analysis database . In addition, the RMS  will utilize the historical demand information stored in the forecast and demand analysis database  for prior periods, which essentially provides a demand curve for each selling price of a given fare class on each flight. For example, when allocating and pricing inventory for a given flight, the RMS  may analyze demand trends for similar flights from previous relevant time periods, in a known manner. It is also noted that conventional RMSs typically respond to competitive forces and other external events, such as price wars or increased demand due to a large event, such as the Olympics, as shown in ","According to a feature of the present invention, an airline  can correct for forecasting errors, if necessary, or other competitive forces which have produced unanticipated excess capacity , by releasing tickets for sale to CPO customers. Due to the confidential nature of the CPO rules, and the discouraged use of CPO tickets by full-fare business travelers, the airlines ,  can sell such excess capacity at a discount, without undermining its existing published fare structure.
