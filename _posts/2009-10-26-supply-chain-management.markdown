No. 10\/028,542, filed on Dec. 19, 2001, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/297,018, filed on Jun. 8, 2001, the entirety of these applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference for the teachings therein.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.","Certain marks referenced herein may be common law or registered trademarks of third parties affiliated or unaffiliated with the applicant or the assignee. Use of these marks is by way of example and shall not be construed as descriptive or limit the scope of this invention to material associated only with such marks.","The present invention relates to techniques for coordinating a supply chain and, more particularly, to supply chain management.","Vertically integrated, centrally managed business models are rapidly giving way to decentralized business models leveraging outsourcing. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are responding to cost and competitive issues by divesting operations and outsourcing key functions, such as manufacturing, distribution, logistics, service, and inventory management. The rationale behind outsourcing is simple: focus on core competencies, and for everything else, transfer responsibility to various types of service providers (or \u201cpartners\u201d) who can employ economies of scale and provide geographic coverage for product distribution, service, and manufacturing.","In addition to its common sense appeal, outsourcing has delivered significant financial value to both the OEMs and the growing clusters of companies that support them. Outsourcing, however, along with globalization and system\/application proliferation, has caused a dramatic increase in complexity across supply chains due to the lack of information systems to coordinate operations. Consequently, many companies have instituted enterprise and collaborative planning across supply chains.","Recent initiatives in outsourcing and collaborative planning have exposed a critical flaw in today's extended supply chains: they are not configured for the efficient execution that was once possible when companies were vertically integrated. Managing a supply chain has become an extremely complex task that previously developed systems with an enterprise-focused approach cannot adequately support. These enterprise systems were designed to support one centralized, static, standardized business process, as opposed to business processes governed by individual business agreements. Furthermore, collaborative planning solutions do not coordinate execution across supply chains. Instead, they focus on macro-level parameters, long planning horizons, and data that is frozen days or even weeks before and after events actually occur. The primary challenge remains unmet: effectively coordinating execution of actions and events across a supply chain even as service and lead-time requirements become more stringent and partners come and go.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for managing a supply chain is provided. A request for a transaction involving an enterprise and at least one partner in a supply chain is received from an end-user or the partner. Real-time data relevant to the transaction is accessed from an existing partner system. A context for the transaction is generated using real-time data. The request is processed in the context for the transaction.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a system for managing a supply chain is provided. The system may include an interface and a processing facility. The interface is operable to receive the request for the transaction from the end-user or the partner. The interface is in communication with the processing facility. The processing facility is operable to access real-time data relevant to the transaction from an existing partner system, to generate a context for the transaction using the real-time data, and to process the request in the context for the transaction.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the system may include a database and an execution process engine. The database is operable to store real-time data relating to one or more transactions and to maintain a respective context for each transaction. The execution process engine is operable to execute a respective workflow in the context for each transaction using the real-time data. Each workflow may include a plurality of tasks to be performed by the enterprise or the partner in order to fulfill the respective transaction.","In still another embodiment of the present invention, the system may include a database, at least one process workflow executing on a processing facility, and a data access layer. The database is operable to store real-time data relating to the transaction. The process workflow is operable to process the transaction. The data access layer is operable to provide the process workflow access to the real-time data relating to the transaction, thereby providing a context for the transaction during processing.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the system may include a network execution component and a network domain gateway. The network execution component is operable to administer a transaction involving an enterprise and at least one partner in a supply chain. The network execution component is in communication with the network domain gateway. The network domain gateway is operable to communicate with a partner coordinator component integrated with an existing system of the partner to provide real-time data relevant to the transaction from the existing system of the partner to the network execution component.","The embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to  of the drawings. Like numerals are used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.","Turning first to the nomenclature of the specification, the detailed description which follows is represented largely in terms of processes and symbolic representations of operations performed by conventional computer components, such as a local or remote central processing unit (CPU), processor, server, or other suitable processing device associated with a general purpose or specialized computer system, memory storage devices for the processing device, and connected local or remote pixel-oriented display devices. These operations may include the manipulation of data bits by the processing device and the maintenance of these bits within data structures resident in one or more of the memory storage devices. Such data structures impose a physical organization upon the collection of data bits stored within computer memory and represent specific electrical or magnetic elements. These symbolic representations are the means used by those skilled in the art of computer programming and computer construction to most effectively convey teachings and discoveries to others skilled in the art.","For purposes of this discussion, a process, method, routine, or sub-routine is generally considered to be a sequence of computer-executed steps leading to a desired result. These steps generally require manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, although not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, or otherwise manipulated. It is conventional for those skilled in the art to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, text, terms, numbers, records, files, or the like. It should be kept in mind, however, that these and some other terms should be associated with appropriate physical quantities for computer operations, and that these terms are merely conventional labels applied to physical quantities that exist within and during operation of the computer.","It should also be understood that manipulations within the computer system are often referred to in terms such as adding, comparing, moving, searching, or the like, which are often associated with manual operations performed by a human operator. It must be understood that no involvement of the human operator may be necessary, or even desirable, in the present invention. The operations described herein are machine operations performed in conjunction with the human operator or user that interacts with the computer or system.","In addition, it should be understood that the programs, processes, methods, and the like, described herein are but an exemplary implementation of the present invention and are not related, or limited, to any particular computer, system, apparatus, or computer language. Rather, various types of general purpose computing machines or devices may be used with programs constructed in accordance with the teachings described herein. Similarly, it may prove advantageous to construct a specialized apparatus to perform one or more of the method steps described herein by way of dedicated computer systems with hard-wired logic or programs stored in non-volatile memory, such as read-only memory (ROM).","Network for Managing a Supply Chain","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrates a network  for managing a supply chain, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In particular,  depicts a number of domains communicating in a communication network , including a network domains , one or more enterprise domains , one or more partner domains , and a customer domain . The network  allows integration of the one or more partner domains  with an enterprise domain .","Communication network  can include any portion of one or more suitable networks for communicating information or data. For example, such a network can be a telecommunications network or the Internet. The Internet is an interconnection of computer \u201cclients\u201d and \u201cservers\u201d located throughout the world and exchanging information according to Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), Internetwork Packet eXchange\/Sequence Packet eXchange (IPX\/SPX), AppleTalk, or other suitable protocol. The Internet supports the distributed application known as the \u201cWorld Wide Web.\u201d Web servers maintain websites, each comprising one or more web pages at which information is made available for viewing. Each website or web page can be identified by a respective uniform resource locator (URL) and may be supported by documents formatted in any suitable language, such as, for example, hypertext markup language (HTML), extended markup language (XML), or standard generalized markup language (SGML). Clients may locally execute a \u201cweb browser\u201d program. A web browser is a computer program that allows the exchange of information with the World Wide Web. Any of a variety of web browsers are available, such as NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR from Netscape Communications Corp., INTERNET EXPLORER from Microsoft Corporation, and others that allow convenient access and navigation of the Internet. Information may be communicated from a web server to a client using a suitable protocol, such as, for example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP).","A telecommunications network may include telephony and voice services, including plain old telephone service (POTS), digital services, cellular service, wireless service, pager service, etc. The telecommunications network allows communication via a telecommunications line, such as an analog telephone line, a digital T1 line, a digital T3 line, or an OC3 telephony feed. The telecommunications network may include a public switched telephone network (PSTN) and\/or a private system (e.g., cellular system) implemented with a number of switches, wire lines, fiber-optic cable, land-based transmission towers, spaced-based satellite transponders, etc. In one embodiment, the telecommunications network may include any other suitable communication system, such as a specialized mobile radio (SMR) system. As such, the telecommunications network may support a variety of communications, including, but not limited to, local telephony, toll (i.e., long distance), and wireless (e.g., analog cellular system, digital cellular system, Personal Communication System (PCS), Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD), ARDIS, RAM Mobile Data, Metricom Ricochet, paging, and Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR)). The telecommunications network may utilize various calling protocols (e.g., Inband, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) call protocols) and other suitable protocols (e.g., Enhanced Throughput Cellular (ETC), Enhanced Cellular Control (EC), MNP10, MNP10-EC, Throughput Accelerator (TXCEL), Mobile Data Link Protocol, etc.). Transmissions over the telecommunications network may be analog or digital. Transmissions may also include one or more infrared links (e.g., IRDA).","Domains , , , and  are part of a supply chain. Each domain corresponds to a particular entity in the supply chain. These entities may include an enterprise, one or more partners who provide services or products to the enterprise, possibly an entity which maintains or operates one or more systems of the network for the enterprise and\/or partners, and one or more customers of the enterprise. The enterprise may be a manufacturer of goods, such as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), or a provider of services to businesses or consumers buying products from OEM companies, such as an electrical utility or a telecommunications company. These companies rely on efficient supply chains both for inbound materials and goods and services. A partner may be a supplier of raw materials or parts, a third party logistics (3PL) vendor such as a warehouse hub, a carrier, or a service provider, a third party maintainer (3PM) such as field service, third party repair center, third party returns handling center, or a third party fulfillment provider such as a distributor. A customer may purchase goods or services from the enterprise. Associated with each domain may be one or more functions that are performed by the respective entity. Each entity may have its own systems (e.g., computer systems) to implement some aspects of the functionality, whereas some entities may lack its own systems to implement some aspects of the functionality.","Furthermore, a network system of network  may be implemented at least in part at each of enterprise domain , partner domains , network domain , or customer domain  to execute the functionality of the respective domain. One or more subsystems  of the network system supports communication with the network domain  and each of the enterprise domain , a partner domain , or the customer domain . In a typical application, the various domains (e.g., enterprise, partner, and customer) can be implemented with heterogeneous systems, such as, for example, with different operating systems, platforms, applications, protocols, and the like (essentially, different hardware and software combinations).","The network domain  may be linked through a gateway to another network domain . For example, one network domain  may be associated with a service network, and another network domain  may be associated with an inbound or supplier network. The service network may be linked to the supplier network through the respective network domains  to route transactions between the networks.","An enterprise operating through the enterprise domain , partner domains , network domains , and customer domain  of network  manages execution of one or more tasks, processes, events, or actions (e.g., receiving orders, manufacturing products, warehousing products, delivering products, etc.) by the enterprise or its supply chain partners. In one embodiment, one or more subsystems  can be implemented, at least in part, with agents for providing the ability to manage some part of one or more domains. These agents may run at respective domains for managing the associated entities. Network  provides a framework for connecting different operating systems and sub-networks (in various domains) and communicating between them. Network  defines the infrastructure needed to support the management and deployment of the services for management of a supply chain. As such, network  facilitates the management of the supply chain by the enterprise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["10","34","36","38"]},"As depicted, the inbound network  may involve, for example, contract manufacturers , suppliers , and logistics providers . Contract manufacturers , suppliers , and logistics providers  may cooperate to manufacture and deliver products to an enterprise . The contract manufacturer  may manufacture parts for goods manufactured by the enterprise . The supplier  may supply raw materials to contract manufacturer  and\/or the enterprise . Logistics providers  may be needed to deliver parts, raw materials, or finished goods to the enterprise .","The fulfillment network  and the service network  include various entities which may cooperate with the enterprise  in delivering goods and services to customers . The fulfillment network  may involve, for example, call centers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, hubs, distributors, wholesalers, or retailers who cooperate to take and fulfill orders from one or more customers. The service network  may include, for example, call centers, customer support, field service, repair vendors, or logistics providers who cooperate to provide services (e.g., repair, replacement, warranty, installation, etc.) for one or more customers. Logistics providers  may work with the fulfillment network  and the service network . Logistics providers  may include, for example, warehousers or delivery services.","The entities of the supply chain include the enterprise  and one or more partners, which can be contract manufacturers , suppliers , logistics providers , , other service providers, customers, etc. Each entity in the supply chain may have its own systems for performing at least some of the functions or tasks for which the entity is responsible. The network  allows integration of an existing system of the enterprise  with existing systems of its partners and existing systems of its end-users (e.g., customers). An existing enterprise system may be a system such as an enterprise resource planning (ERP), material requirements planning (MRP), supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), warehouse management systems (WMS), or enterprise application integration (EAI) application or subsystem or a legacy system with which a partner coordinator component  (described below) can be integrated for communication with the network . An existing partner system may be a system such as ERP, MRP, SCM, CRM, WMS, or EAI application or subsystem or a legacy system with which a partner coordinator component  (described below) can be integrated for communication with the network . An existing customer system may be a system such as ERP, MRP, SCM, CRM, WMS, or EAI application or subsystem or a legacy system with which a partner coordinator component  (described below) can be integrated for communication with the network . Each existing enterprise, partner, or customer system, subsystem, or legacy system may be distinct and have its own separate protocols, interfaces, processes, routines, and the like, running on respective platforms or architectures. The network system may include, for each partner, a subsystem , which is physically located at that partner's site. In one embodiment, the subsystems  of the network system logically allow integration of the diverse partner domains with the enterprise domain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["10","32","34","36","38","10","32","50","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","40","52","42","44","54","58","56","62","66","48","32","72","74","76"]},"With regards to the various embodiments depicted in , network  integrates seamlessly with an existing infrastructure of an enterprise , one or more partners, or a customer , and it is compatible with the previous information technology (IT) efforts of an enterprise , one or more partners, or a customer . The network  may overlay on an enterprise's existing infrastructure, thus enhancing what an enterprise has already invested in. As described herein, a framework is provided for a scalable, reliable, flexible network by defining standard ways of network-management in a supply chain and for achieving interconnectivity across potentially heterogeneous systems and sub-networks. Network  is thus able to manage diverse equipment and software associated or located at different domains throughout the supply chain, thus providing a view of a significant portion of the network infrastructure for the supply chain (from end to end). Ultimately, this enables the accurate measurement of statistics for overall supply chain performance.","In one embodiment, the network  can be constructed primarily in Java applications and may be supported by industry-standard technologies such as browsers, Web servers, Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)-based transaction servers, and relational database management systems (RDBMSs). The network  may have a Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) web infrastructure, providing the ability for customized portal access and wireless technology. The J2EE framework provides a coherent model for applications development and deployment, unlike the hybrid models in the client\/server world, which have evolved into a complex layer of unrelated technologies. J2EE also provides support for the client\/server interfaces to make it easy to co-exist with Microsoft-based ecosystems. The network  can fully exploit the advanced features of J2EE, such as network directories for security and business policies, component-based architecture for networked business components, and Java Messaging Services to loosely couple a network of applications residing on different processors and networks. The value of J2EE is providing a networked infrastructure with configuration flexibility.","The network  can be built as a grid to allow multiple dynamic routing policies and events to travel at different cycles of execution between redundant processors, which may reside at the enterprise domain  and the network domain . The network  allows multiple dynamic routing policies\u2014each entity can coordinate and propagate decisions in real time without disrupting the integrity of the enterprise-focused system and data repositories of other supply chain entities. The network  is secure, reliable, scalable, and customizable to support the individual needs of a business partnership between the enterprise and a partner. This partnership is embodied in the form of a contractual agreement with a clear definition of a business process, business policy rules, and service-level agreements, ensuring support of an enterprise's mission-critical business processes. This customization model is different from enterprise applications, which are designed to support one centralized, static, standardized business process and business policy rules. With the network's  dynamic framework for managing routing and other forms of business policies and events, an enterprise can build intelligence into its supply chain network  to manage each partner's operation as an extended enterprise business unit (EBU). The agreement between the enterprise and the EBU becomes the governance mechanism to enforce business policies and monitor contract compliance for service level agreements. The business processes are policy-driven. This allows an enterprise to benefit from automated governance of the extended supply chain.","In one embodiment, to implement the network , an integrated network application suite may be designed and architected as a complete closed-loop system. This application suite may incorporate all of the features in one package required to execute and coordinate transactions accurately in the network  and be able to monitor the performance of any given partner. It may function as the \u201cTraffic Cop\u201d or \u201cAir Traffic Controller\u201d for a dynamic network. The application suite can sit transparently on top of existing IT infrastructures, rather than replace applications.","The network  allows for a non-intrusive business-to-business (B2B) integration. The network  offers partners multiple connection options to minimize IT investment, reduce overhead, and increase adoption rates among partners. The noninvasive system components do not replace the infrastructure of an enterprise or a network, but instead integrate seamlessly with and enhance the existing infrastructure of an enterprise or a partner. The network  can support direct, real-time connections to a number of enterprise resource planning (ERP), material requirements planning (MRP), supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), warehouse management systems (WMS), and enterprise application integration (EAT) applications or subsystems for direct back-end system integration. Furthermore, the network can support connections to databases, spreadsheets, and other software systems used to manage supply chain operations. Communication with any existing system is possible using multiple electronic connection protocols, including enterprise application integration (EAT), electronic data interchange (EDI) files, flat files, and application connectors. Because the network  does not require users to install and run software from their systems, even companies with limited IT capabilities can use the network  through an electronic connection protocol or a browser with access to personalized web functions. The network  can leverage existing connectivity with EAI, database, direct VPN, existing EDI standards, and leading XML-based industry standards, including ebXML and RosettaNet.","The network can provide a standards-based interchange that supports a variety of data transmission formats and provides translation services between the various standards. Using the network , any number of trading partners, using any number of standard data formats\u2014e.g., ANSI X.12 and EDIFACT, SAP IDOC, RosettaNet, XML, and custom flat files\u2014can automatically share data between systems. With minimal change to their existing systems, trading partners can eliminate the need for time-consuming and error-prone manual processes.","For entities that do not need or which cannot support integration with back-end systems, the network  can provide immediate access to these services via the Internet. Using a web browser, for example, partners can access the network's services to view and communicate with other entities in the supply chain. With the network , an entity can immediately participate in the supply chain community and get value from the network , implementing deeper back-end systems as the entity's requirements or abilities evolve.","Allowing for separation of partners, the network  lends itself to no single point of failure. This ensures rapid deployment, while still allowing a high degree of personalization. The network  provides an error-free, highly secure, mission-critical, and always-on solution to an enterprise and its partners.","The network  provides consolidated data repositories. Transactional, reference, and configuration data can be stored in a relational database or a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) repository, allowing data accuracy beyond data exchange and manual reconciliation. The business repository can act as a proxy for the enterprise or partner applications within the network.","Data can be shared in real-time, thus providing up-to-date information or data that allows better management over events, actions, or transactions in a supply chain. The present invention provides real-time visibility and control of data content and the business processes from end to end. The network  enables an enterprise and its partners to view accurate supply chain information in real-time. The network  can provide total visibility into the conglomeration of enterprise-class and legacy systems within a supply chain. Because contract manufacturers, suppliers, and third party logistics (3PLs) all rely on shared data, synchronization, validation, and enrichment are desirable.","The network  can provide real-time monitoring that alerts an entity when the reality of events or conditions in the supply chain deviates from an entity's plan or business process. It allows an entity to assess the impact of exception conditions, effect their resolution, and ensure that the entity's resolution decisions propagate throughout the supply chain due to the business context management provided by the network .","The network  can provide transactional processing for monitoring, reporting, and alerting. The business context of all transactions is maintained in the network repository and process state managers to be used for real-time validation of the content of transactions to ensure high degrees of execution accuracy. A business context provides a complete view into a supply chain. Such business context may comprise information and data for the transaction, such as, for example, the type of transaction (e.g., purchase order, service request, installation request, warranty matter, replacement request, etc.); the names, addresses, and contact information of the partners involved in the transaction; the name, address, and contact for an end-user (e.g., consumer) which initiated the transaction; the purchase\/service request order number for the transaction; the date on which the transaction was initiated; the dates on which the partners involved in the transaction was notified; the dates on which the involved partners completed tasks related to the transaction (e.g., shipped product, made service call to end-user's location, completed installation of new product, etc.); and the like. For example, a purchase order line item is matched against supplier shipment records and warehouse receipts in real-time, rather than post-transaction matching of transactions to verify accuracy. Thus, a perpetual view of inventory is maintained across the entire supply chain, reducing expedite fees, while increasing service levels due to increased accuracy of data and process execution. Lost sales due to inability to deliver are reduced, service levels are increased, and inventory and expedite fees are decreased.","The network  supports real-time reporting of status, events, or conditions in a supply chain. The network  can provide business metrics and trend analysis, such as real-time metrics and reporting request confirmation, part ship, inventory, WIP, part delivered, and cancellation. A user can view historical supply chain metric data with drill-down capabilities. Pre-configured business metrics, such as reports, graphics, and alerts based on process exceptions, can be available in real time. Personalized, real-time alerts can be delivered anywhere, such as to a graphical user interface, a pager, a phone, or e-mail. The improved visibility leads to lower costs and maximized service levels.","The network  can provide a uniform business context across an enterprise and partners. The network  can maintain the context of complex multi-company transactions for catching errors at the source, thus minimizing post-processing of data to match and reconcile transactions. This allows business users a consistent view of relevant supply chain information, whether the information originated in an enterprise application or a partner application. Reconciliation and matching can be provided in real-time, as opposed to batch post-processing, saving significant process cycle time.","The network  can be based on a distributed and layered architecture, rather than a client or server model. The layered architecture enables better fault tolerance and isolation, as each layer is built with a full set of error compensation and diagnostics capabilities. Each functional layer can also be optimized for performance and scalability, thereby eliminating system bottlenecks and enabling more robust load balancing schemes. The network  is designed to have full horizontal and vertical scalability across any layer with no single point of failure.","Supply Chain",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","48","82","84","32","84","90","14","92","14","84","14","94","102","84","102","96","108","110","48","98","14","14","100","84"]},"The checks, orders, updates, requests, etc. that are provided or exchanged in the supply chain can be conveyed in the form of transaction messages for notifying, updating, alerting, or otherwise informing various entities of the status of transactions, tasks, events, or other actions in the supply chain. At least some of the transaction messages can be associated with workflows that are initiated or triggered, for example, by the order of a product or a request for service. The transactions, tasks, events, or other actions in the supply chain can be governed by or performed pursuant to contracts or agreements between two or more entities (e.g., an enterprise and one or more partners, such as an extended enterprise business unit) involved in the supply chain. These contracts or agreements may include terms which specify time-based service levels, expectations, obligations, or business policies, which must be met by the different entities.","The OEM  may operate or maintain a system which includes applications or subsystems for enterprise resource planning (ERP)  and customer relationship management (CRM) . The ERP application  may provide or support functionality that is related to a core competency of the OEM , such as, for example, the manufacturing of a particular article or product. The customer resource management application  may support or maintain a database with information for one or more customers  of the OEM . The 3PL provider  may operate or maintain a system which includes applications or subsystems for a warehouse management system (WMS)  and a CRM . The WMS application  supports inventory management and other functionality associated with storing products in a warehouse. Each of OEM  and 3PL provider  may have a respective domain in the supply chain.","The OEM , the 3PL provider , or any other partner in a supply chain may maintain real-time data related to the supply chain. This real-time data may include reference data and transaction data. Reference data can specify, for example, inventory levels and parts numbers. Transaction data can specify, for example, numbers for purchase orders, shipping receipts, invoices for various transactions in which the respective partner is involved; the dates and times at which the partners were notified, alerted, or requested to take actions or work on tasks; the kinds of tasks, actions, and the like required to be performed by the partners (e.g., pulling a product from inventory, packaging a product, delivering a product, making a service call to a customer, installing a machine at a customer site, repairing a machine, etc.); the dates and times at which the actions or tasks were completed; and the like.","Each of the ERP , CRM , WMS , and CRM  of the OEM  or 3PL can be existing partner systems into which systems of the present invention can be integrated. These existing partner systems can be information technology infrastructure for the respective partners. At least some portion of the existing partner systems can be legacy systems. In one embodiment, systems of the present invention may provide the real-time data maintained at the existing partner systems to the network domain .","The network domain  may use the real-time data from the existing partner systems to coordinate, initiate, or otherwise manage actions and events associated with the supply chain. As depicted, the network domain  may include applications or subsystems for a graphical user interface (GUI)  (labeled \u201ccockpit\u201d), a network domain gateway , an inbound network component , a fulfillment network component , a service network component , an alert and exception management component , and a network application management platform . The network domain gateway  may facilitate communication between the network domain  and one or more partner domains , enterprise domains , or customer domains . The graphical user interface  may be a graphical interface that allows an user to access and interact with the network domain . The inbound network component , fulfillment network component , and service network component  may be dedicated application layers that may support communication or interactions with inbound network , fulfillment network , and service network , as shown in , B, and .","The network application management platform  in network domain  may comprise or support databases or subsystems, such as a partners subsystem , a knowledge subsystem , a processes subsystem , and a performance subsystem . The partners subsystem  may provide or maintain information on the various partners involved in the supply chain. The knowledge management subsystem  may provide fault determination and root cause analysis at the application level. The processes subsystem  manages the state of business processes governing the flow of business objects relating to transactions, events, or actions which occur in the supply chain. These objects may be generated by an enterprise application, by third-party systems, or by the network domain . The processes subsystem  may also provide enforcement of the policies and procedures for the enterprise and one or more of its partners. This allows automated inter-enterprise communication and collaboration in real time. The performance management subsystem  may provide the ability to monitor the system performance statistics for each partner in the network domain .","The alert and exception management component  manages alert- and exception-related actions, which may occur within the supply chain. The alert and exception management component  may provide sophisticated alert handling, exception management, and event management capabilities. Alerts may relate to actions and trigger conditions, such as order volumes exceeding a specified amount, maximum time allowed for an activity being reached, or a service level agreement (SLA) being violated. Alerts are classified by severity according to specific business process and\/or product control thresholds.

A subsystem is a cohesive functional package of hardware or software applications that provides behavior, for example, through interfaces. Application properties may be easily administered from within a single file (which can be formatted in LDAP or Java Native Directory Interface (JNDI)). An application can be configured from an external configuration file.

The data may be segregated into logically consistent areas that usually correspond to business functions. In this manner, the data can be understood and structured within the scope of respective business functions. For those relationships that transcend a business function, data from other subject areas are \u201cborrowed\u201d to demonstrate the relationship.","The policy data repository  may identify business policies (rules) that govern how to distribute, perform, deliver, or initiate work, transactions, events, actions, etc. (e.g., repair orders) to specific entities (e.g., enterprise business unit (EBU)) from among many potential entities. A policy may be implemented by many rules. There may be many conditions that invoke a rule, and a rule may trigger one or more actions, carried out by an entity. An action may result in one or more state transitions within a business process.","There may be policies that govern how (e.g., protocols) the work is communicated to the Enterprise Business Unit (EBU) or other entity of choice. This may require knowing the format used or capable of being handled by the EBU, such as, for example, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP). In addition, policies may govern the relationship between specific transactions. This may be used to manage an iteration of the business process and determine the alerts that are generated when the process violates one or more policies. For instance, if a partner which specializes in repair attempts to replace an item, but a policy prohibits replacing items that are out of warranty, the policy statement can be stored in this subject area. Another example is a relationship policy.
