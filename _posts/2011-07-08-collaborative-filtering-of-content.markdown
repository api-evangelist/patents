{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Social networks enable communities of people to interact socially online. Social media networks use highly accessible and scalable communication techniques, including the use of web-based and mobile technologies. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks. A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that facilitates the building of social networks. Examples of social networking service providers include Facebook, Twitter, Orkut, Bebo, Myspace, Hi5, Flickr, etc.","In addition to sharing user profiles, users of social networks may share interests and\/or activities. For example, on Facebook, users may post \u201clikes\u201d for different content such as websites, comments, etc. A user typically logs onto the social network site. If the user comes across a content item such as a webpage or comment, etc., that the user likes, the user may click on a \u201clike\u201d button to let other users know that the user likes the content item. To view a given users likes, one would typically log onto a social network site, go to the profile page of the given user, and view the activity list of the given user. The given user's activity list may include likes, among other user actions.","Embodiments generally relate to aggregating mentions. In one embodiment, a method includes retrieving a plurality of mentions from a social networking service, where each mention is associated with one or more users of the social networking service. The method also includes aggregating the mentions, and displaying the mentions based on one or more formats.","A further understanding of the nature and the advantages of particular embodiments disclosed herein may be realized by reference of the remaining portions of the specification and the attached drawings.","Embodiments described herein provide users with aggregated peer information (e.g., likes, recommendations, etc.) associated with particular content (e.g., videos, TV shows, movies, songs, books, etc.). For example, in one embodiment, a system retrieves such peer information, also referred to herein as \u201cmentions,\u201d where each mention indicates a user's level of interests in, affinity for, or aversion to particular content (e.g., friend A likes video A, friend B recommends movie B, friend C likes song C, etc.). The system then aggregates the mentions.","In one embodiment, the system may display the mentions to a particular user based on one or more formats. For example, the system may display the mentions on the same screen as the content that the particular user is viewing. The system may also display different mentions next to content labels in an electronic programming guide (EPG). The system may also display the mentions based on popularity, based on user names, or based on the particular user. Particular embodiments are described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100","110","112","114","116","118","100","110","112"]},"For ease of illustration,  shows one block for each of TV , computer , and mobile device .

In one embodiment, a given mention may be associated with metadata such as a tag or hash tag that indicates whether the mention is a like, a dislike, a follow, an interest, a recommendation, etc. Social networking service  stores the mentions in an appropriate memory location.","In one embodiment, system  may retrieve mentions from social networking service  at various times. For example, in one embodiment, system  may retrieve mentions for a user when the user logs on to social networking service . In one embodiment, system  may retrieve mentions at any time using an authorization token established by the user. In one embodiment, the authorization token may expire after a predefined time period. In one embodiment, the user may configure the authorization token to never expire. As along as the authorization token remains valid, system  may perform this step at any time.","In one embodiment, system  functions as an intermediate application programming interface (API) between user devices (e.g., TV , computer , mobile device , etc.) and the API of social networking service . In one embodiment, system  manages API information including updating APIs, adding new APIs, etc.","In block , system  aggregates the mentions. In one embodiment, the system may store the aggregated mentions in database , or in any other appropriate location.","In block , system  displays the mentions based on one or more formats. In one embodiment, system  may display a number of mentions for a particular content item. As described in more detail below with respect to , system  may display the mentions in a variety of user interfaces (UIs) having varying formats.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","402","404","402","404","406"]},"Screen shot  shows one way that system  may display aggregated mentions. This particular UI enables the user to not only see which other users like the video, but the UI also to enables the user to indicate that the user likes the video. For example, if the user currently viewing the video also likes it, the user may select the like button . This would add the user to list of users who like the video. In one embodiment, system  may push or send the mention (e.g., new like) to social networking service  for appropriate updating at the social network service .
