title: System and method for providing a game of chance over messaging services
abstract: A system and method are described for providing a game of chance over messaging services. In one embodiment a method is disclosed for receiving a mobile message from a first user to participate in a game of chance. The mobile message may include an identifier of a second user. A mobile message may be sent to the second user to invite the second user to participate in the game of chance by providing an identifier of another user. A winning identifier is identified from a set of identifiers. A mobile message is sent to the first user and the second user if the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier satisfies a winning threshold. The mobile message may include an indication that the first user and the second user won a prize.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The mobile phone may be increasingly important as an information and content access device. Mobile phones may be used for phone calls, messaging, such as short messaging service (SMS) messaging, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messaging, and email, and to browse the web. These features provide the users of the mobile devices access to other people and to content. Carriers may be introducing content services, multimedia services and applications, such as games, as a means of generating new revenue streams, retaining and attracting customers, increasing returns on investment, and extending and differentiating their service offerings to consumers. The emergence of these new services may be creating unique opportunities for mobile carriers and publishers to generate additional revenue streams through new and existing customers. Advancements in mobile phone technology have allowed carriers to provide graphics rich games and multimedia content to mobile phone users. However, the majority of mobile phone users may not have mobile devices capable of accessing these games and content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":"110"},"At step , the system may notify the second user that the first user entered the identifier of the second user into the game of chance. The system may also invite the second user to enter the identifier of another user into the game of chance. For example, the system may send a mobile message to the second user notifying the second user that the first user entered the identifier of the second user into the game of chance. The mobile message may also invite the second user to participate again in the game of chance by responding to the mobile message with the identifier of another user. By inviting both users to enter another identifier, the system creates a viral environment where each user whose identifier is entered into the game may then enter an identifier of another user into the game. The system may also send a message to the first user confirming that the first user is entered into the game with the identifier of the second user. The mobile message may also invite the first user to participate again in the game of chance by responding to the mobile message with the identifier of another user.","At step , the system may determine at least one winning identifier. If the identifier of the second user is a phone number the winning identifier may be a winning phone number. Alternatively, the system may determine multiple winning identifiers. The system may randomly select at least one winning identifier from a set of identifiers. The set of identifiers may be the identifiers received from the users. Alternatively, if the identifiers are phone numbers, the set of identifiers may be a set of active phone numbers in the geographic location where the phone number of the second user originates from. Alternatively, the set of identifiers may be a set of active phone numbers which are associated with the same country code as the phone number of the second user. Generally the set of identifiers may be any set of identifiers which includes the set of identifiers entered into the game as a subset.","At step , the system may determine the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier. If the identifiers are phone numbers the amount by which the phone numbers match may be based on the number of digits of the phone numbers that match. For example, if five digits of the phone number of the second user match the winning phone number, then the amount by which the second phone number matches the winning phone number may be five. Alternatively, the amount by which the second phone number matches the winning phone number may be the percent of the second phone number that matches the winning phone number. If the second phone number has ten digits, and five of the digits match the winning phone number, then the amount by which the phone number of the second user matches the winning phone number would be fifty percent.","At step , the system determines if the amount by which the second phone number matches the winning phone number satisfies the winning threshold. The winning threshold may identify the minimum amount by which the phone number of the second user must match the winning phone number in order to win the game. The operator may set the winning threshold based on the amount of prizes awarded for the game. For example, if there are a large number of prizes awarded, then the winning threshold may be set lower, which would typically result in more winners of the game. However, if there are a small number of prizes awarded, then the threshold may be set higher, which would typically result in less winners of the game. For example, if the amount by which the phone number of the second user matches the winning phone number is seven, and the winning threshold is at least six, then the amount by which the phone number of the second user matches the winning phone number would satisfy the threshold.","If, at step , the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier satisfies the threshold, the system moves to step . At step , the system determines the prize awarded to the first user and the second user based on the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier. For example, the prize may increase as the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier increases. The prizes may be arranged in tiers. For example, in the case of phone numbers, a phone number which matches all of the digits of the winning phone number would receive the largest prize, a phone number that matches all but one of the digits would receive a smaller prize, and so on. Alternatively, the system may select multiple winning identifiers. In this case, each winning identifier may be associated with a different prize amount. The system may only award the prize associated with each winning identifier if an identifier entered by a user exactly matches one of the winning identifiers.","At step , the system notifies the first user that the first user won a prize because the identifier of the second user, provided by the first user, matches the winning identifier. The system may also provide the prize to the first user. For example, the system may send an electronic payment in the amount of the prize determined in step  to the first user. At step , the system notifies the second user that the second user won a prize because the identifier of the second user, provided by the first user, matches the winning identifier. The system may also provide the prize to the second user. For example, the system may send an electronic payment in the amount of the prize determined in step  to the second user.","If, at step , the amount by which the identifier of the second user matches the winning identifier does not satisfy the winning threshold, the system moves to step . At step , the system determines that the identifier of the second user did not win. The system may notify the first user and the second user that the identifier of the second user did not win. The system may also invite the first user and the second user to enter another identifier into the game. For example, if the identifiers are phone numbers, the system may send a mobile message to the first user and the second user informing the users that the phone number of the second user did not win. The mobile message may also invite the first and second user to participate in another game by replying to the mobile message with a phone number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"The system  may include a game provider , one or more mobile network operators (\u201cMNOs\u201d) A-N, more commonly referred to as mobile carriers, or simply carriers, and one or more users AA-NN, such as mobile subscribers or consumers. The game provider  may provide games to the mobile users AA-NN, such as games of chance.","The users AA-NN may pay a fee to the game provider  to participate in the games provided by the game provider , such as games of chance played over mobile messaging, or generally any games capable of being provided over mobile devices. Alternatively, the user AA-NN may pay a fee to the MNOS A-N to participate in the games provided by the game provider , and the MNOs A-N may pay all or part of the fees to the game provider . The game provider  may provide the games to the mobile users AA-NN over the mobile web, mobile messaging, mobile applications, such as an APPLE IPHONE mobile application, an interactive voice response system, or generally any medium for communicating with users of mobile devices. In addition, the game provider  may maintain a web portal, which may allow the mobile users AA-NN to access the games provided by the game provider  over the interne. The game provider  may also allow the mobile users AA-NN to access the games through the postal service. For example, a mobile user AA-NN may send a postcard to the game provider  to participate in a game of chance.","The game provider  may maintain a mobile portal and\/or a web portal where the game provider  may display information related to the games provided by the game provider . For example, the portal may display the games currently available to the users AA-NN, the results of previous games provided to the users AA-NN, entry forms for games provided by the game provider , rules of games provided by the game provider , or generally any information related to the games provided by the game provider . In the case of games provided to the mobile users AA-NN, the game provider  may share revenue with the MNOs A-N of the users AA-NN for providing the games to the users AA-NN, such as by providing the games over mobile messages sent through the mobile infrastructure of the MNOs A-N. The revenue may be collected from the users AA-NN by the game provider and\/or the revenue may be collected from the users AA-NN by the MNOs A-N.","The MNOs A-N may provide a mobile network to the users AA-NN which may provide a variety of services to the users AA-NN, such as the ability to send and receive phone calls, send and receive mobile messages, to access the interne and\/or the mobile web, or generally any service that may be implemented on a mobile device. The MNOs A-N may store data describing the users AA-NN, such as billing addresses, call histories, messaging histories, or generally any data regarding the users AA-NN that may be available to the MNOs A-N.","The game provider  may provide an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to the MNOs A-N to allow the MNOs A-N to access the mobile services of the game provider , such as mobile games. The MNOs A-N may provide the mobile games of the game provider  to the users AA-NN. The mobile games may be provided transparently to the mobile users AA-NN such that the users AA-NN are unaware that the mobile games originated from the game provider .","The users AA-NN may be mobile users who may engage in messaging with one another, such as through a short message service (\u201cSMS\u201d), a multimedia messaging service (\u201cMMS\u201d), enhanced messaging service (\u201cEMS\u201d), J-PHONE's Skymail, NTT DOCOMO'S Short Mail, or generally any service for sending messages to\/from mobile devices. The mobile messages may be routed through the MNOs A-N. The users AA-NN may wish to participate in games over the mobile messaging services. For example, the mobile devices of the users AA-NN may be technologically limited such that the devices are not capable of playing graphically intensive games, or games which require high bandwidth. Thus, the users AA-NN may only be able to participate in games provided over mobile messaging services or other low-bandwidth services.","The users AA-NN may interact individually with the game provider , through the mobile network operators A-N, such as via a mobile phone or any mobile device capable of communicating with the mobile network operators A-N. The users AA-NN may interact with the game provider  via a mobile web based application, a mobile standalone application, a mobile messaging application, or any application capable of running on a mobile device. The game provider  may communicate mobile messages to the users AA-NN over the mobile infrastructure provided by the MNOs A-N.","The game provider  may send mobile messages to the users AA-NN notifying the users AA-NN of currently available games. For example, the game provider  may notify the users AA-NN of an open registration for a game of chance over mobile messaging. The users AA-NN may respond to the mobile message with the identifier of another user to participate in the game of chance. In one example, a first user AA may respond with a mobile message containing an identifier of a second user BB, such as the mobile phone number of the second user BB. The game provider  may send a mobile message to the second user BB informing the second user BB that they have been registered for the game of chance. The message may notify the second user BB that they may participate in the game of chance by responding to the mobile message. If the mobile number of the second user BB wins the game of chance, both the first user AA and the second user BB are rewarded with a prize.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The system  may include one or more mobile applications, such as mobile messaging applications and\/or mobile browsers, which may be running on one or more mobile devices AA-NN.
