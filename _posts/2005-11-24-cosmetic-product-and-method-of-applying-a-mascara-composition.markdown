title: Cosmetic product and method of applying a mascara composition
abstract: A cosmetic product includes a mascara composition and a treatment device, whereby the mascara composition is applied to the eyelashes by softening the mascara composition via heat. The mascara composition is solid at room temperature, however is softened at elevated temperature, so it may be applied to the eyelashes. The treatment device includes an applicator for receiving, heating to soften, and applying the softened mascara composition to the eyelashes. Once the softened mascara composition is applied to the eyelashes, the mascara composition is quickly cooled and thus solidified by the atmosphere. The mascara composition thus applied to the eyelashes provides a firm film covering the eyelashes, which is not softened at body temperature, and thus provides enhanced wearability. A cap detachable to the applicator is provided with a loading mechanism for delivering pieces of the mascara composition one by one to the applicator.

","Fifth Embodiment","FIG. "],"p":["The present invention relates to a cosmetic product including a mascara composition and an eyelash treatment device, whereby the mascara composition is applied to the eyelashes by fluidizing the mascara composition via heat generated by the eyelash treatment device. The product provides improved performance of a mascara composition, while also being safe for the general consumer to use. The present invention further relates to a method of applying a mascara composition to the eyelashes.","Mascara products are used to enhance the beauty of a person's eyes by coating the eyelashes to primarily thicken, lengthen, color, and define the individual eyelashes. For the last 60 years, mascara products have been provided in the form of mascara applicators having an applicator brush attached to a handle, the applicator brush portion dipped in a package, such as a tube, containing a liquid to semi-solid mascara composition. Mascara compositions typically take the form of emulsions or dispersions of waxes and pigments in water or other volatile carriers. Mascara composition and delivery systems are limited by emulsion or solution chemistry and film forming technologies that are applied wet and then dried to create a film of mascara that sets and holds the eyelashes.","These mascara compositions which are liquid to semi-solid have a low viscosity profile and low yield point, such that they are inherently prone to smearing and smudging after application to the eyelashes. The solid components dispersed in the composition, such as waxes, may also be difficult to apply, as clumping and globbing may occur due to lack of film smoothness of the solid components.","From another aspect, solvents and carriers of the composition that do not evaporate in timely manner may also provide smearing and smudging after application to the eyelashes. The so-called waterproof mascaras intend to solve such problem by employing volatile hydrocarbon solvents. While such volatile hydrocarbon solvents provide wear benefits, the application and beauty benefits may be compromised. Further, the volatile hydrocarbon solvents may cause odor and safety concerns.","One solution for providing a mascara composition having improved application and improved wearability, is to provide the composition solid, wherein the composition is heated prior to application to the eyelashes, for softening, and\/or smoothing the composition upon application. Such heating would also benefit in shortening the evaporation time required after application. The solid film provided on the eyelashes after application would have a much higher yield point than films made by conventional mascara compositions, thereby being less prone to smearing and smudging.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a mascara product which can apply a solid mascara composition to the eyelashes in a safe and effective manner. It would be further beneficial to provide the solid mascara composition in a predetermined dosage form, such that the user is easily provided with an adequate amount of composition to apply to the eyelashes.","Meanwhile, there have been proposed in the art eyelash curling devices, such as WO 99\/22782 including a applicator brush and heater combination. However, the applicator brush is designed to curl the eyelashes by application of heat, while applying the mascara composition of liquid or semi-liquid condition fetched from a container. Due to the absence of the idea and structure for heating and fluidizing the solid mascara composition, the applicator brush is practically impossible to use in combination with the mascara composition proposed by the present invention. There is a need of providing a dedicated treatment device which takes the full benefit of the mascara composition to apply the fluidized composition successfully and uniformly to the eyelashes. There is a further need of providing such a treatment device which also comprises a loading means for providing a predetermined dosage form of mascara composition upon use.","None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.","The present cosmetic product comprises a mascara composition and an eyelash treatment device, whereby the mascara composition is applied to the eyelashes by softening the mascara composition via heat, the applied mascara composition forms a solid film on the eyelashes, which film has improved wearability. The product provides improved performance of a mascara composition, while also being safe for the general consumer to use.","The mascara composition is solid at room temperature, however is softened at elevated temperature, so it may be applied to the eyelashes. The eyelash treatment device comprises a heater for providing enough heat to the mascara composition, yet safe for application to the eyelashes, even in accidental situations where the user inadvertently touches the device with the eyelids or eyeballs. The eyelash treatment device comprises an applicator for receiving, heating (softening), and applying the mascara composition.","Once the softened mascara composition is applied to the eyelashes, the mascara composition is quickly cooled and thus solidified by the atmosphere. The mascara composition thus applied to the eyelashes provides a firm film covering the eyelashes, which is not easily softened at body temperature, and thus provides enhanced wearability.","In particular, the mascara composition of the present invention fulfills the above performances by incorporation of a solid hydrophobic component which gives a unique rhelogical profile to the composition. The rheological profile of the composition is defined in terms of a needle penetration as measured according to ASTM (American Society for Testing and Material) Test Method D5, a yield stress, and a viscosity. The mascara composition of the present invention is prepared to have the needle penetration of from about 1 to about 40, the yield stress of at least about 1500 Pa at 25\u00b0 C., and the viscosity of between about 1 mPas and about 10,000,000 mPas at 100\u00b0 C. The mascara composition with the above rheological profile can be therefore applied to the eyelashes by being softened via heat and is then solidified on the eyelashes to provide a firm film on the eyelashes.","The mascara composition may be prepared in the form of an oil mixture in which the solid hydrophobic component forms an oil phase. The composition may be alternatively in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion additionally including water and an emulsifier.","Further, the composition may be added with a pigment and\/or a film forming polymer for enhanced aesthetic appeal and wearability.","The device of the present invention is specifically designed to give a structure that is configured to soften the mascara composition and to hold the softened mascara composition for applying it to the eyelashes uniformly. The device includes an applicator equipped with a heater for softening the mascara composition, and a comb arranged along the length of the applicator. The comb is arranged along the length of the applicator to be coated with the softened mascara composition. Whereby the softened mascara composition can be successfully delivered to the eyelashes from the entire length of the comb, leaving the solid mascara film on the eyelashes.","The device of the present invention is further equipped with a loading means for delivering a predetermined dosage form of mascara composition upon use. The loading means may be provided in a cap fitted over the applicator. By providing the device with the loading means of predetermined dosage, the user may easily apply an adequate amount of composition to the eyelashes. The loading means is configured to hold a plurality of mascara pieces and to load the mascara piece one by one to the applicator for delivering the adequate dosage of the mascara composition.","The cap includes a sheath fitted over the applicator and formed with an opening communicating with the applicator. The loading means includes a carrier which has a plurality of compartments each storing the mascara piece. The carrier is movable relative to the sheath in order to make one of the compartments selectively in registration with the opening for delivering the mascara piece to the applicator through the opening. Thus, the mascara piece can be easily delivered to the applicator simply by manipulating the carrier.","Preferably, the carrier is prepared in the form of a sleeve coaxial with the sheath to be rotatable about the axis of the sheath. In this instance, the sleeve may be equipped with a plurality of gates which normally close the compartments and are movable to open the associated compartments for delivering the mascara piece.","The opening may be provided with a normally-closed valve. In this instance, the loading means is provided with a plunger which forces the mascara piece to temporarily open the flap valve for delivering the mascara piece to the applicator.","The carrier may take the form of a disc which is rotatable about an upright axis perpendicular to the axis of the sheath, and has a plurality of compartments arranged about the upright axis. Also with this arrangement, the mascara piece can be delivered simply by rotating the disc about the upright axis perpendicular to the axis of the sheath or the applicator.","The mascara piece may be retained in each of the compartments by means of a breakable seal. In this connection, the loading means is provided with a plunger which forces the mascara piece out of the breakable seal for delivering the same to the applicator. With the use of the breakable seal, the mascara composition can be kept in good condition over a long period, but is easy to be loaded to the applicator.","The compartments formed in the disc may be spaced circumferentially as well as radially such that a set of radially aligned compartments comes into registration with the opening elongated along the axis of the sheath. With this arrangement, more than one mascara piece can be delivered to axially spaced points on the applicator.","Rather than utilizing the movable carrier holding the mascara pieces, the loading means may include a feeder in the form of a screw-in piston that drives the mascara pieces linearly towards the opening with the normally-closed flap valve. The loading means is further provided with a plunger that forces the mascara piece just around the opening against the flap valve to temporarily open the valve. Thus, the mascara piece can be delivered by a combination of manipulating the feeder and the plunger.","Instead of the screw-in piston, the feeder may be in the form of a spring-biased piston so that the mascara piece can be delivered simply by pressing the plunger.","Further, the loading means may be configured to include a hopper formed at one end of the sheath away from the opening to contain the mascara pieces in the form of pellets, and a screw-conveyor extending into the compartment for feeding the pellets from the hopper to the opening. Thus, the mascara composition can be delivered simply by manipulating the screw-conveyor, and by an adequate amount or dosage by adjusting the movement of the conveyor.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure with the appended claims.","While the description concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed that the present invention will be better understood from the following description.","A product in accordance with the present invention is a combination of a mascara composition and an eyelash treatment device.","Mascara Treatment Device","Now referring to , there is shown an eyelash treatment device in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The device uses a solid mascara composition which is solid at room temperature, namely 25\u00b0 C., and is softened with elevated temperature such that it can be applied to the eyelashes. By \u201csolid\u201d herein for describing the mascara composition, what is meant is that the composition has a certain hardness to retain its structure, and also that the composition is stable against stress or shear. The mascara composition goes through a transition change in terms of rheology between 25\u00b0 C. and 100\u00b0 C., such that during these temperatures, there is a range of temperature and rheology in which the composition is suitably softened for application to the eyelashes. The softened state of the mascara composition is fluid enough to be applied to the eyelashes, however, is viscous enough to stay on the applicator upon application, and on the eyelashes after application.","The device includes an elongated hand grip  carrying at its one longitudinal end an applicator  for applying the softened mascara composition to user's eyelashes. The applicator  is elongated to have a length generally aligned with a length of the grip , and includes a heater  which is configured to heat the mascara composition for softening the composition after it is loaded to the applicator  on one hand, and to heat the eyelashes for curling on the other hand. The mascara composition is provided in the form of a solid piece and is held in a cap  detachable to the applicator. The cap  is configured to include a loading mechanism for loading or delivering the mascara piece one by one onto the applicator, details of which will be discussed later.","The applicator  is composed of a head  extending integrally from the grip , and a comb attachment  detachably fitted on the head . The head  is made of a dielectric plastic material and carries the heater  composed of a resistor coil  wound around a U-shaped core  of dielectric material to give two parallel vertical rows running in the length of the applicator . The coil  is electrically connected to a voltage source, i.e., a battery within the grip  and is energized by manipulating a switch handle  on the side of the grip . The comb attachment  is made of a dielectric plastic material and is fitted on the head  in thermal transfer relation with the heater  so as to be heated to an elevated temperature for softening the mascara composition. The comb attachment  is shaped to have a rounded top face provided with a comb having a plurality of comb teeth  which are arranged along the length and width of the applicator for applying the softened mascara composition to the eyelashes while smoothening the eyelashes. A ditch  is formed in the width center of the top face to extend the length of the applicator  for receiving an upper part of the heater  and also for providing a space within which the softened mascara composition can be retained. The softened mascara composition is thereafter allowed to flow over the comb teeth, climbing-up to the comb teeth  by the action of a surface tension to be ready for being delivered to the eyelashes as the comb teeth  smoothen the eyelashes.","In operation, the applicator  is firstly placed in a position with the comb attachment  just below the eyelashes, as shown in . Then, the applicator  is raised and twisted to some extent for smoothing the eyelashes with the comb teeth , as shown in , thereby applying the softened mascara composition to the eyelashes, while lifting the same. In this condition, the top face of the comb attachment  comes into contact with the eyelashes for heating and curling the eyelashes. As soon as the applicator  is moved away from the eyelashes, as shown in , the softened mascara composition is cooled quickly to give a firm film of the solidified mascara composition on the eyelashes. Thus, the above single operation can give the effect of forming the mascara film as well as curling the eyelashes.","The heater  is controlled to heat the comb attachment  to a temperature of about 50\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. for softening the mascara composition. At the elevated temperature, the softened mascara composition exhibits a viscosity of 1 mPas to 10,000,000 mPas, sufficient for coating the eyelashes, but being kept from flowing out of the applicator  for assuring a safe application of the mascara composition.","Mascara Composition","All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore do not include carriers or by-products that may be included in commercially available materials.","All ingredients such as actives and other ingredients useful herein may be categorized or described by their cosmetic and\/or therapeutic benefit or their postulated mode of action. However, it is to be understood that the active and other ingredients useful herein can, in some instances, provide more than one cosmetic and\/or therapeutic benefit or operate via more than one mode of action. Therefore, classifications herein are made for the sake of convenience and are not intended to limit an ingredient to the particularly stated application or applications listed.","The mascara composition of the present invention is solid at room temperature, namely 25\u00b0 C., and is softened with elevated temperature such that it can be applied to the eyelashes. By \u201csolid\u201d herein for describing the mascara composition, what is meant is that the composition has a certain hardness to retain its structure, and also that the composition is stable against stress or shear. The present composition has a needle penetration, as measured according to the American Standard prescribed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Test Method D5, of from about 1 to about 40, and a yield stress of no less than about 1500 Pa, both measurements at 25\u00b0 C., preferably at 35\u00b0 C.","The principle of the measurement of the needle penetration according to the ASTM D5 consists of measuring the depth, expressed in tenths of a millimeter, to which a standard needle (weighing 2.5 g and placed in a needle holder weighing 47.5 g, i.e., a total of 50 g) penetrates when placed on the composition for 5 seconds. The principle of the measurement of yield stress consists of measuring oscillation stress sweep for understanding flow behavior and viscoelastic character for fluids and semi-solids as a function of stress, shear rate, or temperature. In the present invention, the yield stress is measured using a TA Instrument Rheometer AR-500 using a 40 mm Al Parallel Plate (Gap: 600 mm) at 1 Hz. At 25\u00b0 C., the present composition preferably has no measurable yield point under stress or shear.","The mascara composition changes rheology as it is heated, and finally reaches a point where it is liquid by 100\u00b0 C., preferably by 90\u00b0 C. By \u201cliquid\u201d herein for describing the mascara composition, what is meant is that the composition has a viscosity of between about 1 mPas and about 10,000,000 mPas. The present mascara composition goes through a transition change in terms of rheology between 25\u00b0 C. and 100\u00b0 C., such that during these temperatures, there is a range of temperature and rheology in which the composition is suitably softened for application to the eyelashes. The softened state of the mascara composition is fluid enough to be applied to the eyelashes with an average number of strokes of an applicator holding the composition, however, is viscous enough to stay on the applicator upon application, and on the eyelashes after application. When the composition is too thin or watery, the composition is difficult to hold on the applicator, and amount of composition applied to the eyelashes decreases.","The mascara composition is designed to have a rheology profile which gives suitable rheology during the temperature band to which the eyelash treatment device is heated. The temperature band may be selected to provide suitable balance of applicability of the mascara composition and eyelash curling\/lifting benefit. Typically, the temperature band is between about 50\u00b0 C. and about 100\u00b0 C.","The components for the composition are selected in order to provide the desired rheology profile. The composition comprises at least a solid hydrophobic component for providing the essential physical characteristics of the present invention. The composition may be made solely by the solid hydrophobic component.","The composition may take the phase form of an oil mixture, the oil being mainly made by the wax, or a water-in-oil emulsion. Water-in-oil emulsion forms are suitable for encompassing water-soluble or water-dispersible components.","Alternatively, the mascara composition may comprise an outer shell comprising at least a solid hydrophobic component having the unique rheological profiles described above, and an inner core which has a certain viscosity. The mascara composition in room temperature is in solid form encasing a fluid inner core. After heating, such embodiment composition is believed to provide an adequate crystallization time before solidifying, thereby allowing the user to have adequate time to apply and fix the composition on the eyelashes. Such longer \u201cplay time\u201d allows the user to achieve the desired appearance of eyelashes.","The inner core may be an aqueous continuous composition containing 15% to 95% water by weight of the inner core. Such aqueous continuous phase inner core is easy to remove with soap and water. The inner core may also be an oil continuous composition containing 30% to 50% volatile liquid oil by weight of the inner core. Such oil continuous phase inner core provides waterproof benefit.","Solid Hydrophobic Component","The present composition comprises a solid hydrophobic component for providing the solid characteristic of the mascara composition. Solid hydrophobic components are typically used at levels from about 25% to about 100% in oil mixture forms, and from about 25% to about 95% in water-in-oil emulsion forms. Suitable solid hydrophobic components include waxes and fats.","Waxes are defined as lower-melting organic mixtures or compounds of high molecular weight, solid at room temperature and generally similar in composition to fats and oils except that they contain no glycerides.

The sheath  is shaped to have a non-circular bore  within which the applicator  is slidable but is rotatively fixed so that the applicator  has its widthwise center held into constant confrontation with the opening . The carrier  is in the form of a sleeve which is coaxial with the sheath  and is rotatable relative to the sheath . The carrier  is formed with a plurality of circumferentially spaced compartments  each storing the mascara piece . The carrier  is rotatable relative to the sheath to make one of the compartments  selectively in registration with the opening for allowing the mascara piece  to drop onto the applicator  through the opening , thereby loading the mascara piece one by one to the applicator . The carrier  is composed of a rotating shell  rotatably coupled to the sheath , and a jacket  forming outer bottoms of the compartments .
