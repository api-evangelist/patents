Each year, millions of taxpayers meet with a tax return preparer for the purpose of providing relevant tax information needed in the preparation of the tax return. For convenience, this tax information is frequently provided to the tax preparer by mail or other form of delivery. When this occurs, the tax preparer typically first asks for and receives a copy of the individual's tax return for the previous year. This permits the tax preparer to solicit the relevant tax information for the current year in a form using a format specifically designed for the individual taxpayer.","In recent years, taxing authorities have increasingly automated the tax collecting and tax return filing process. In particular, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has instituted a system for the electronic filing of tax return data. In conjunction with that system, the IRS has arranged to pay refunds by electronic funds transfer using the United States' Treasury automated clearing house (ACH) origination system. While this has greatly improved the tax filing and refund process it still requires a period of three to six weeks from the filing of an individual's tax return to the time of receipt of a refund check. In contrast, the system of the invention shortens the time from filing to receipt of a refund to as little as one day.","There is still a growing need, however, for a more comprehensive on-line system that facilitates the tax-filing process.","A system, method and article of manufacture are provided for tax form submittal verification. First, a tax form of a user is sent to a third party government entity utilizing a network. Next, a record of the sent tax form is stored in a database. Thereafter, a request for the record is received from the user utilizing the network. An identity of the user is then authenticated utilizing the network. Upon the successful authentication of the identity of the user, the record is sent to the user utilizing the network.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the record may be formatted for being printed by the user. Further, a notification relating to the record may be sent to a mail server of the user utilizing the network. Still yet, the identity of the user may authenticated using a digital certificate. Such digital certificate may be stored on a computer of the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"eFiling of Returns ","ePayments (by direct debit) ","a comprehensive customer information system ","This solution draws on a wide experience of both integrated taxation processing and eCommerce type solutions.

The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use.","Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer may still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications.

ROS involves new use of the internet to transact Revenue's core business, with all the consequent concerns about security and confidentiality of Revenue and customer information. Customers and Revenue may be able to trust the solution. The proposed ROS solution is secure. Access to ROS services on the ROS site is by means of digital certificate only. Messages are fully encrypted. The ROS database is separate and distinct from the core tax processing databases. A full audit trail is retained of transactions on the system.","The Proposed Technology","ROS has been developed to be accessible from a broad range of technical platforms. Key features of the technology which underlies the proposed ROS system are its:\n\n","With reference again to , the various components thereof may be described in greater detail.","Client Architecture","Pages are displayed on the client side using HTML. The use of this well proven technology minimizes the potential customer support overhead for the on-line system. In addition, the .pdf format is used for documents received from the existing Revenue processing systems. The .pdf format is readable using Adobe Acrobat Reader. Adobe Acrobat Reader comes as standard on the typical computer. The Adobe Acrobat Reader is also available free on the web. The Baltimore toolkit, J\/PKI-Plus is used to attach the customer's digital signature to returns being filed. This feature ensures the security of returns whether they are entered on-line or off-line.","Server Architecture","Server software has been built with Java technology. This enables the server to be deployed on many different platforms. The ROS application code has been developed using Java Server Pages and Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs). These run with BEA's WebLogic Server.","Technical Overview","BEA WebLogic Server is an application server. Application servers are deployed by businesses critical, transaction based services on the web. The application server provides scalability and high availability. Typically, the application server distributes application processing across a cluster of servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and to support failover. The application server also minimizes the number of connections required to the database by sharing connections across multiple services. The application may be dynamically scaled (i.e. CPU's may be added to the hardware configuration without impacting the application code). The application server automatically balances the processing load across the available cluster.","The ROS Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are currently coded to operate with both Oracle and Ingres databases using JDBC drivers.","In implementing the ROS solution, Revenue may opt to use an alternative application server product. Assuming the application server supports EJBs, the effort required to replace the WebLogic Server is not significant. However, should the chosen server not support EJB technology, re-work may be used to integrate the components of the new architecture and to re-write the application code that has been pre-built.","WebLogic Server was selected as the application server for the present invention because of it's capability to scale and the fact that it is the only application server currently available with a proven ability to operate in a clustered environment. A clustered configuration is typically used for critical transaction based systems such as ROS. In addition, WebLogic Server, unlike some other application servers, does not restrict the choice of webserver.","The Solution is Adaptable","The entire ROS technical architecture has been designed to enable the solution to adopt new technology as internet technology evolves. However, it is believed that the proposed solution components reflect the best combination currently available.","The ROS technical architecture is designed to be flexible\u2014it does not prescribe for Revenue the particular architecture components which may be used.","Different architecture components may be easily \u2018plugged in\u2019 or \u2018plugged out\u2019. For example, on the client side, the return filing components, currently operating in HTML, may be easily replaced with custom form software (e.g. Jetforms or UWI) if such customization is required.","The system itself is built using platform independent components. This solution may be based on either a UNIX or an NT environment. In addition, the ROS solution does not impose restrictions on the choice of web server or the firewall.","The Solution is Scalable","Revenue's stated long term target for ROS is that 50% of tax returns may be filed using the ROS system. Internet applications by their nature have an unpredictable user population size. This is unlike traditional in-house systems where the user population is predictable. The unpredictable nature of the user base makes it essential that core business web applications can easily scale if demand suddenly increases. It is vital that the ROS solution is easily scalable by operations staff to enable one to achieve this goal. The present solution has been designed with scalability in mind\u2014this is the key reason why an application server has been chosen to support ROS.","WebLogic server has a proven capability to support high volume processing. It is an industrial strength application server for high volume transaction processing websites (e.g. Amazon.com, Schwab.com, etc.). It includes built-in load balancing features to support peak processing requirements.","The Solution is Reliable","The WebLogic application server underpins the reliability of the proposed ROS solution based on the present invention. WebLogic unlike other web servers runs on a clustered configuration. This makes it possible to build redundancy into the technical architecture, effectively preventing unscheduled downtime.","Overview of ROS Interfaces","The ROS system has been built to make interfacing easy. The ROS database is designed to be consistent with the well established integrated approach of Revenue's ITP database. The database is, however, separate and distinct from the core Revenue processing systems.","The approach to the interfaces draws on the deep understanding of the core Revenue systems. The ROS database closely mirrors the existing ITP database. Wherever possible, ROS data is held using the same structures and format as ITP data. This approach has significant benefits which become even more apparent in the future when the Income Tax and Corporation Tax systems are within ITP. Benefits include the following:\n\n","By choosing to implement ROS, Revenue will significantly reduce the risks attached to interface design, development and delivery.","Interfaces to ROS","As outlined in the RFT, the key interface from the existing tax processing systems to ROS is a regular (typically nightly) update. The interfaces for ROS may be built in 2 phases in line with overall project plan.","The key Phase 1 interfaces to ROS are customer registration details and returns issue activity. The phase 1 interfaces also include documents requested by customers using ROS and outputs automatically issued for ROS Customer Information Services (CIS).","Phase 2 interfaces to ROS include additional financial information to support the enhanced CIS available in Phase 2.","Interfaces from ROS","Interfaces from ROS to the existing Revenue systems contain returns details, payment details, ROS registration information and requests for statements. The extracts to different systems are independent. The ROS extracts specifically format the payments and returns data to match the normal input formats for the payments and returns reception systems in the existing Revenue systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0236","num":"0345"},"figref":"FIG. 18A","b":["1800","1802"]},"The page displays how many new items  the user has in their Inbox.

The system is simple to understand and follow. With a single click, a customer accessing ROS, equipped with a digital certificate, reaches the services page. This offers a customized choice of returns to file, information on any new correspondence received from Revenue and the ability to immediately request a Statement of Account.","ROS is informative. Familiar terms and codes are used throughout the system. An on-line demo is available taking the customer on a tour of the main functions. A frequently asked questions button is always within reach. Information icons which offer immediate help on filling the fields on a form are also provided.","ROS has been architected with proven web technology. It relies on the proven stability of HTML to provide the customer interface. Scalability and strength are provided by the use of a proven application web server, BEA WebLogic server. WebLogic server is the engine that drives almost all the well known and established high volume transaction processing sites (e.g. Amazon.com, Compaq).","ROS is attractive to use. Filling in forms on ROS is easy and quick. The layout of the forms is clear and uncluttered. Customers are only offered valid periods in which to file. RSI numbers validation and other validation occurs when the user populates the field. Name and address fields are pre-filled.","ROS has been designed using the principles underlying the integrated tax solutions that have been applied throughout the world. Designing one system to cater for multiple taxes ensures the overall stability of the system. New taxes and new forms may be added without upsetting the underlying look and feel of the system. Menus are dynamic. Key screens are carefully designed to be applicable to multiple taxes.","ROS is Revenue's On-Line Service for the future. ROS is therefore specifically architected in the knowledge that web technology has evolved rapidly and will continue to do so. Therefore, the underlying technical components, including the front end, the application server and the database in the system may be upgraded or indeed replaced. Even the operating system on which ROS runs may be changed. Customers with a browser capable of supporting digital certificates, regardless of their hardware platform may access and use ROS. Browsers supporting digital signatures include:\n\n","Macintosh users may use a Netscape browser as Internet Explorer for Macintosh does not support digital certificates.","Customer Front-End Design Attributes","Ease of Use","ROS is easy to use. The system is intuitive. It is menu driven and offers the customer help at all times. It uses familiar terms and codes. The layout of forms is clear and uncluttered. Navigation throughout the system is obvious. Customers are never in doubt as to where they can go. Customers can move through the system with confidence. No transactions are completed without the customer being requested to confirm the transaction.","The usability testing of the solution developed to date confirms that the system is intuitive and self-explanatory.","Users may work on-line or off-line when filling in more complex forms. Users may batch the forms they complete off-line and submit multiple forms at once.","ROS provides off-line customers with alternative approaches to filling in complex forms off-line. The present invention recognizes the distinct requirements of both the professional tax agent who files multiple returns and the customer who files once a year on his own behalf.","The P45 form is available off-line for the customer to complete.","The design of this form is appropriate for the customer familiar with the traditional paper P45. The form looks and feels familiar. Key fields are validated as the user completes the form.","The more complex ROS forms (Form 11, CT1) have different user constituencies and therefore may offer the user flexibility in completing the form.","The Form 11 may also be adopted. The approach enables the customer and tax agents to navigate rapidly through the form while also providing new views of the data on the return (e.g. a single view summarizing all sections of the form).","The approach offered enables the Form 11 and CT1 to be downloaded and to run on all the common platforms, operating systems and web browsers. The P45 form built for ROS Phase 1 demonstrates this flexibility.","Stable and Consistent Design","ROS is an on-line integrated tax system. The same design principles that apply to building integrated tax systems for internal Revenue users apply in developing ROS. this systems is designed to be easily extensible for new taxes and forms. They are parameter driven to enable the fast customization of forms required to meet budget revision targets.","Using expertise in this area ensures that ROS is a stable system. The ROS menus are dynamic where appropriate. The key ROS screens are designed to be generic across multiple taxes and to support new taxes and new tax forms.","The ROS design is also consistent. The style of the site is based on the Revenue corporate colors and style guide.","ROS is built to satisfy a broad constituency of user hardware. In order to support various platforms, design principles have been adopted which ensure that the ROS web page offers a consistent view to users across the full spectrum of screen resolutions from 640\u00d7480 up.","Access to Services","The ROS home page identifies the services offered by ROS and offers the customer access to all the services specified. The home page includes:\n\n","The services page is secure and may only be accessed by customers with an approved digital certificate. The services offered are:\n\n","ROS adheres to Revenue's corporate image and standards. The new corporate style guidelines for the web due in December will dictate the ultimate style of the site. One of the members of the team is Interact. They will provide design input to ensure ROS is compliant with the Revenue site standard that they are currently defining.","On-Line Tutorials and Help","ROS offers help on a number of levels:\n\n","The present invention extends the help currently provided with ROS to support the remaining functions. In addition, work may be done to amend the current help texts where required.","Menu Driven System","ROS is a menu driven system. ROS has been designed to make extensive use of links in line with best practice web interface design.","As commonly found in web applications, ROS also includes many different approaches to linking. These include the following:\n\n","The services page, multiple registration page and the agents customer list pages are examples of linkage provided through traditional lists. The lists are dynamic and are tailored specifically for the customer (or agent) accessing the system. They are extensible to cater for new taxes, new registrations within a customer, new customers for an agent and new forms.","In addition the customer has the facility to use the standard back and forward buttons on the browser.","Error Handling","ROS is error tolerant and offers clear explanations on how to fix problems. Field validation takes place wherever possible before the customer leaves a field. Therefore the customer can immediately correct a field level error.","Application errors (e.g. access denied if a customer does not have a valid digital certificate) are reported clearly to the user.","System level errors (e.g. the central ROS server is not reachable) are also reported clearly to the customer.","Required Equipment","ROS customers may use a broad range of equipment. One may have specified that customers may use digital certificates ROS supports the browsers that provide this functionality. These include:\n\n","ROS therefore can run on over 92% of browsers in use worldwide according to the current industry estimates on browser coverage. Macintosh users may use a Netscape browser as the Internet Explorer version for Macintosh does not support digital signatures.","The customer may choose to operate on a Windows, Macintosh or UNIX platform. An open choice of customer platforms is particularly important for ROS as Macintosh technology has achieved a small but still significant penetration of the Irish SME market. Macintosh platforms are also manufactured in Ireland.","The system has been specifically designed to cater for the full spectrum of screen resolutions from 640\u00d7480 up.","Users are continuously reassured when using ROS. No transaction is submitted without offering the customer the opportunity to confirm what has just been entered.","ROS transactions are atomic. This means that a ROS business transaction is completed in one update of the database. Therefore transactions are not stored in an incomplete state of the database. ROS confirms to the user that a transaction has been completed. Therefore users are in no doubt about their current progress.","The off-line applications supporting complex forms will include a system map icon showing the user the progress that has been made towards completing the form.","Transaction Handling and Cancellation","Every ROS window includes an exit button to exit the secure area and return to the home page. ROS business transactions are written to the database with a single click. The system does not write partially completed transactions to the database. Customers exiting the system therefore do not have the potential to abandon a transaction causing a loss of data or corruption or loss of system integrity.","Return windows have a cancel button in addition to the exit button. The cancel button returns the user to the main services page (within the secure area).","Revenue Internet Site","ROS resides within the Revenue internet site and complies with the site standards and guidelines.","Health and Safety Requirement","The present invention confirms that the current health and safety standards and legislation may be complied with in connection with the system.","Euro","Forms in Euro and IR\u00a3 formats","Return forms are provided in both Euro and IR\u00a3 formats. ROS identifies the currency format required based on the customer's ROS record, which is a copy of their Common Registration System (CRS) record. The currency displayed at any time is clearly identified.","Choice of Currencies for Viewing","ROS pages which can contain monetary amounts include a \u2018radio button\u2019 which allows the user to \u2018toggle\u2019 or switch view between the Euro and IR\u00a3 currencies. Forms which the customer has already filed and which they are now accessing through the ROS Customer Information Services are displayed to the customer in the format and currency in which they were submitted.  illustrates an interface  including the radio buttons  used by ROS to allow a customer toggle between Euro and IR\u00a3 currencies.","Irish Language","Irish Language Forms","The ROS system supports the production of tax forms in the English and Irish languages. Two separate versions of each tax form are provided. Phase 1 of ROS provides both English and Irish language versions of the VAT 3, VAT RTD, P30 and P35 forms\u2014the forms a customer can currently receive in Irish. When the user selects one of these forms for completion, the ROS system checks the customer's ROS record to determine whether the customer has indicated a preference for receiving tax return forms in Irish. The customer is presented with the Irish version of the form for completion, if they have expressed a preference for Irish. ROS includes an architecture service to support multiple languages.","Performance","Response Times","The ROS system is designed to support Revenue's requirement for rapid response times. Clearly a number of the components outside the scope of this tender including the choice of hardware, operating system, web server and firewalls will influence performance.","The choice of application server is particularly important in ensuring performance. The current ROS solution is built using WebLogic Server as the application server. This server offers superior performance primarily because of its ability to scale without impacting the application. WebLogic has recently been benchmarked by BEA against it's competitors. It produced performance figures over 4 times better than it's nearest competitor. It also minimizes both client and database connections. This assists the performance of the underlying hardware and the database.","For transactions which may take more than a few seconds (i.e. those which send a large volume of information between the customer front end and the ROS server) ROS provides a \u2018countdown\u2019 mechanism which displays to the user the percentage of the transaction completed. ROS may be performance tested in the Revenue environment as part of Phase 1 development to ensure that it satisfies Revenue's response time requirement.","Availability","The ROS system is an industrial strength application designed to support core business systems. The use of an application server which supports clustered configurations and the dynamic allocation of server requests ensures single points of hardware failure do not impact system availability.","The ROS database can support on-line refreshing of data from the source systems if this becomes a future requirement. Such an approach is simplified by the fact that the ROS database is closely modeled on ITP, the database which will eventually be the source of almost all the data to be refreshed. In addition, the choice of CA\/Ingres II as the back end database enables the ROS and ITP databases to be matched even more closely.","For the initial ROS release, the refresh of the ROS database may be performed on a nightly batch basis. As in the case of the on-line refresh, the fact that the ROS and ITP databases are closely aligned greatly simplifies the nightly refresh. The refresh of the core ROS data can therefore be equated to the copy of key tables from ITP. The copying of entire tables is an efficient process. Indicative figures for the update of the ROS database for Phase 1 would be in the range of 30-60 minutes. The actual figures depend on the underlying hardware and also the consequent database configuration.","The extract of data for the core processing systems does not impact system availability.","Scalability","The ROS system is scalable to cater for the peak return processing volumes specified in the RFT and can be expanded to meet future growth requirements.","Analysis of the return filing statistics indicates that the demands on the system may be greatest in the late January\/early February period, particularly on January 31. The peaks achieved on this day may be very significant as agents throughout the country file batches of returns.","An appropriate application server is the key to ensuring the scalability of the system. The choice of database, web server, and firewall software will also impact scalability.","BEA WebLogic enables new servers to be easily and dynamically added to the configuration as necessary to meet increasing user demand. The overall request load is optimally distributed among the servers so that resources remain fully utilized. The addition of new servers does not require amendment to the ROS application.","Flexibility","ROS allows for the easy addition of new return types and customer information services. Flexibility is a key driver in the design of ROS. ROS is an on-line integrated tax system. The same design principles that apply to building integrated tax systems for internal Revenue users apply in developing ROS. Systems such as the present invention are designed to be easily extensible for new taxes and forms. They are parameter driven to enable the fast customization of forms required to meet budget revision targets.","Changes in tax calculation on forms are transparent to the customer. Where more significant changes are involved, including changes to the physical layout of the form, the customer is presented with the new form.","ROS menus are dynamic where appropriate. The key ROS screens are designed to be generic across multiple taxes to support new taxes and new tax forms.","The ROS database will continue to mirror ITP. The choice of BEA WebLogic Server will enable code developed under Tuxedo for the ITP database to be directly reused in ROS. ROS may therefore mirror enhancements to ITP where appropriate.","Existing ITP applications which run under Tuxedo will in the future potentially be able to re-use ROS. The next version of BEA's WebLogic Enterprise product may support both Tuxedo services and application code written using Enterprise Java Beans\u2014EJB's.","Open Architecture","The ROS system is very open. Over 92% of browsers currently in use worldwide (according to latest industry estimates) may be able to access ROS. This figure may grow to almost 100% by the time ROS goes live.","Customers may use a browser that supports digital certificates. These are:\n\n","Macintosh customers may use a Netscape browser as Internet explorer versions for Macintosh do not support digital signatures. ROS can run in Windows 95 or greater, Windows NT and Apple Macintosh environments. ROS can support UNIX. An open choice of customer platforms is particularly important for ROS as Macintosh and UNIX technology have a small but significant penetration of the business market.","On the server side, ROS is built using Java. This allows ROS to run on any platform supporting Java including UNIX and NT. ROS using the WebLogic Server may run on a cluster of different machines (e.g. an NT machine and an UNIX machine).","ROS is built with one set of components. These components may be replaced with ease. The following are potential component choices available to Revenue with the ROS solution:","Database: The present invention is developed to support both Oracle and CA\/Ingres II databases. the current ROS solution runs on CA\/Ingres II as this database best suits the ROS interface development and performance.","Application Server: the current ROS solution runs on WebLogic Server. However the application code may be ported to any application server supporting EJB technology (e.g. IBM's Websphere application server is likely to support EJB's from October 1999).","Security: The current ROS solution is based on X.509 certificates issued by a Certificate Authority. However the solution may support X.509 certificate from any authorized Certificate Authority.","User Interface: The front end logic is primarily coded using HTML. However, the HTML forms could be readily replaced with forms from a proprietary forms product if required. It may also be conceived that ROS may evolve towards an XML based front end over time.","Web server: The ROS solution does not prescribe any limitations on the web server choice.","Firewall: The ROS solution does not prescribe any limitations on the firewall choice.","Obsolescence","ROS enables Revenue to take advantage of developments in internet technologies. The main components of ROS\u2014database, application server etc.\u2014can be replaced by appropriate alternatives if required.","Reliability","The present invention is very much aware of the importance of reliability in the ROS system. Both the architectural components and the demonstrated commitment to delivering a quality product indicate the future reliability of the offering.","All of the components of the present invention are well established products. These are product leaders in their field and are well proven on site. The CA\/Ingres II database product is proven within the Revenue environment and forms the basis for the ITP system. BEA products are also currently in use in Revenue (e.g. Tuxedo for ITP) and have a strong track record of reliability. HTML is in common use throughout the web and is very stable.","Recovery","ROS recovery procedures may cover the recovery of the application in the event of a hardware or application failure.","The procedures include specifications for the operator describing the recovery process. These include how to perform a full system shutdown, procedures for database roll-forward and system re-start. They also include messages to be posted to Revenue's Homepage informing customers of the system shutdown.","WebLogic Server is the only application server with a proven ability to run on a clustered configuration, i.e. the system runs on multiple linked computers. Revenue chose to adopt a clustered configuration for ITP and a similar configuration is likely to be required for ROS. The choice of WebLogic Server enables Revenue to take advantage of clustering, thereby significantly reducing the impact of a hardware component failing and reducing the probability of system shutdown due to hardware error. WebLogic enables the automatic restarting of all applications, which were running on the failed machine, on a support server in the cluster, without operator intervention.","In the event of failure the ROS recovery systems cover the following features:\n\n","In the event of a problem with the customer's own hardware or operating system, the www internet, or the internet service provider for ROS, there exists no practical means of communicating the nature of the problem to the customer. Certain software problems with the user's PC can be reported to the user. Both the off-line return applications and the on-line ROS system may report difficulties with the user's configuration where practicable.","Copies of all transactions conducted through ROS are available to the customer in CIS. Therefore, if a customer is in doubt about the success of a transaction, the customer can refer to the latest output in the inbox to establish if the transaction was successfully completed.","ROS business transactions which update the database are not broken up over multiple screens. One click completes a transaction. Therefore, if the user is unsuccessful in completing a transaction, there is no tidy-up of data required. At the server side, partially completed transactions may not be committed to the ROS database should the ROS server become inoperable during a transaction.","The recovery of data affected by system failure does not arise as ROS transactions cannot be left in an incomplete state.","Communication to Customer by ROS","Communication System","ROS provides a safe and secure electronic communications method to the customer. Communication by ROS to the customer takes place primarily when the customer accesses CIS. They are prompted to access CIS by an e-mail automatically issuing from ROS informing them that correspondence from Revenue has been received. For security reasons the e-mail does not describe the nature of the correspondence, but invites the customer to access ROS to read their correspondence.","In order to receive an e-mail from ROS, the customer may have registered with ROS stating their wish to receive Revenue correspondence electronically. Correspondence accessed on the ROS server cannot be repudiated as the system tracks access to documents.","The customer may log on to the secure ROS system using their digital certificate and password in order to access their CIS inbox. The ROS system tracks whether a customer has accessed any individual item sent by ROS to their ROS CIS inbox. ROS may, if required, be configured to mark a communication as \u201caccessed\u201d when the actual customer, as opposed to their agent, accesses the communication.","Access to ROS Secure Services","The successful implementation of the security requirements outlined for the ROS system would place this system at the leading edge of Revenue on-line services systems worldwide.","The use of authorized certificate authorities to validate and secure business transactions marks a watershed in the development of eCommerce.","Access to ROS Secure Services","ROS services may only be accessed by a customer in possession of a Revenue approved digital signature. However, the ROS home page which describes the ROS services and which is the gateway to the secure services area is accessible by any web user.","Customers may have a recognized digital certificate to access ROS. Customers with no certificate or those with an invalid certificate are given a reason explaining why access to ROS secure service is denied.","Linking Customer Digital Signature","There are a number of different approaches which may be used to link the customer's digital signature to their Revenue records. Two alternatives may now be briefly outlined which may meet the requirements.","The first approach involves Revenue capturing and storing the unique serial number of each customer's (or agent's) digital certificate. The digital certificate number is held on a secure table in ROS which associates certificate numbers with customer and agent numbers. A secure channel could be established to enable Revenue receive updated revocation files from Certificate Authorities on a timely basis.","Advantages of this approach include:\n\n","One alternative approach would involve Revenue providing the approved public certification authority with a unique customer number to enable the authority or authorities to incorporate the Revenue customer number as a \u2018hidden field\u2019 in the digital signature issued. For tax agents, the tax agent identification number would be incorporated into the tax agent's digital certificate, again on the basis of information supplied by Revenue to the approved authority.","Deciding the approach to linking digital signatures is one of the tasks to be completed in the early stages of Phase 1 ROS development. The current ROS solution assumes that Revenue capture the digital certificate numbers and associate these with the customer or agent identification.","Management Statistics","Management statistics may be provided either directly from ROS or using Revenue's corporate information facility (CIF). A limited number of fixed format reports may be generated directly from the ROS database and the transaction log. Reports such as the following can be prepared to support the statistics outlined in the RFT\n\n","The RFT indicates however that the reporting requirements are more open-ended. CIF is in receipt of all the base transaction information from ROS. CIF is equipped with user driven query and analysis tools which enable ad-hoc reports to be generated in a timely manner.","Information on Revenue Tax Numbers","The experience in the development of both CRS and ITP gives a full understanding of the different tax numbers which Revenue currently use.","The customer's name and the appropriate Revenue tax head number appear at the top of each ROS page once a customer enters ROS secure services using their digital certificate. The rules used to determine which registration numbers to display in the header for ROS screens are currently a speculative interpretation of the potential preferences for registration number display in ROS.","Filing Customer's Tax Returns","ROS may be easily extended to support new forms in the future as requirements arise.\n\n","On-Line Forms:","Simple once-off forms (e.g. VAT3, P30, P35) may be completed on-line by customers. These forms are available now. The VAT RTD is also assumed to be an on-line form.","Off-Line Forms:","Complex forms (Form 11 and CT1) and those returned in large numbers are best supported off-line by providing a downloadable form. The off-line forms may be submitted in batches generated either from ROS software or from third party software. The format defined from the third party software generating these forms is identical to the format of the batch files created by ROS.","Tax Return Selection, Completion and Filing Functions","Access Return Filing Module","Any web user may access the ROS home page containing \u2018non confidential\u2019 information on available ROS services, frequently asked questions etc. Only customers or agents with an appropriate digital certificate may go beyond this to access ROS secure services, including the return filing facility. On choosing the \u2018Enter on-line services\u2019 button from the ROS home page, the user is prompted to identify the digital signature they wish to use and the associated password. Users who fail this check cannot access return filing or the other secure ROS facilities.","Customers who have an approved digital certificate but who do not have appropriate direct debit arrangements in place may not be offered those returns for filing which require a direct debit.","Customer's Tax Returns Selection","The ROS system checks the ROS database to determine the returns a particular customer is entitled to file, based on two criteria:\n\n","The customer is presented with their list of valid returns on the ROS services page. They select the return they wish to file and they are taken to that return form. Only periods where returns are outstanding are offered for selection by default to the customer. Muti-reg customers do not go directly to the return form screen from the ROS services page. The are required to select the registration they wish to file for on a registration list screen.  illustrates the list of valid returns for a customer on the ROS services page. As shown, a personalized interface  includes a list of valid returns  that a customer may file by simply selecting an icon  associated therewith.","On accessing the return form for the particular return type the customer wishes to file, the taxation period defaults to the most recent outstanding return. ROS provides a drop down list of dates attached to the taxation period. If the customer wishes to file for an outstanding \u2018back period\u2019, he\/she selects the appropriate period from the list and completes the return.","The return form displayed may reflect any changes which may have taken place to the form calculation and validation in the interim period\u2014i.e. the customer is presented with the form appropriate to the period for which they are filing.","Major changes in the format of a return form are rarer occurrences. Where this situation arises, customers may be asked to select the return type on services page (e.g. select a pre-2005 VAT3 or a current VAT3 if the VAT3 were to change dramatically in format in 2005).","Agent Tax Return Selection","Agents accessing this screen on behalf of a particular customer are presented only with the returns they are entitled to file and access for that customer. For example, an agent may be entitled to file their corporation tax. The ROS agent and customer relationships defined in CRS, determine the taxes\/returns which an agent is entitled to file for a particular customer.","Multiple VAT and PAYE-Employer Registrations","The ROS system identifies cases where the customer has more than one registration number for PAYE-Employer or VAT\u2014based on the customer information held on the ROS system. When a customer with multiple PAYE-Employer or VAT registrations chooses to file a PAYE-Employer or VAT return, the \u2018multiple registrations\u2019 ROS page is displayed, and the customer is asked to choose the specific registration number they want to file against.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0381","num":"0530"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 21"],"b":["2100","2102","2104","2106","2108","2102"]},"Automatic Return Completion","The ROS system is designed to minimize data entry by customers and agents. An underlying principle of ROS is that the user should not be required to re-enter information which they have already supplied to Revenue. When the user is first presented with a tax form for completion, the customer name, address (depending on the form type), tax head registration number and default tax period are already completed, as is the IR\u00a3\/Euro currency indicator.  shows an initial display  of the VAT3 return page, with the information automatically completed by the ROS system. As shown, the various fields  and associated descriptions  are tailored based on the selection of the Euro radio button .","In the case of the downloaded P45 form, the customer is not required to enter the employer registration number or the employer name and employer address as this may be automatically filled when the return is filed.","Partially Completed Return Forms","ROS enables customers to save partially completed off-line and on-line returns. Customers may save the longer more complex forms which are completed off-line (e.g. P45, P35L, FORM11 and CT1) on their PC. Customers completing the simple forms which are filled in on-line (e.g. VAT3, P30, P35) are less likely to require a partial save facility. However, ROS also enables partially completed on-line return forms to be saved (this function is not yet available).","The issues associated with partial return filing are outlined below:\n\n","Calculation of return form contents is supported by ROS, using calculation logic embedded in the form. Such calculations are done locally on the client side of the ROS application. A simple example is the calculation of the \u2018net payable (T3)\u2019 or \u2018net repayable (T4)\u2019 amount on the VAT 3 form. The same approach may be used for forms which have significantly more complex calculation requirements, such as the Income Tax Form 11 and Corporation Tax Form CT1. The calculation is again done on the client side, with the calculation rules embedded as Java executables in the downloaded forms.","Return Form Validation","The ROS system incorporates sophisticated validation for each of the different return forms. Individual field validation includes alpha\/numeric checks, mandatory entries, maximum and minimum value checks and registration number check character validation.","Any validation requirements are built into the relevant return form pages in ROS. Cross reference validation is performed to ensure that the information on the form is internally consistent. Each form is also validated against data held on the ROS system to check the customer's authority to file the selected return, check that the return is being filed for a valid period, etc.","When errors are detected in a form, the form is returned to the user with an error message displayed, indicating invalid field entries.  illustrates an interface  showing how error messages  are displayed using the P35 return page from the ROS system.","Duplicate Returns","Customers may file both supplementary and amended returns.","ROS enables a customer to file a \u2018duplicate\u2019 return\u2014i.e. where a return has already been made for a period\u2014by clicking on the \u2018duplicate\u2019 button on the return form. This presents the user with a list of all valid periods for the last 2 years. If the user selects a period for which a return is already filed, the user is prompted to indicate whether the new return is an \u2018amendment\u2019 or a \u2018supplementary\u2019 return. The form is then completed in the normal way.","Printing a Return Form",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0392","num":"0546"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2400","2402"]},"The customer may also at any time access the ROS Customer Information Services (CIS) system and view or print any return they have previously filed. Forms are designed to print on \u2018blank\u2019 A4 stationery.","\u2018Save\u2019 a Copy of the Completed Return Form","The ROS system saves completed return forms centrally. Customers may access return forms which they have previously filed using the ROS CIS system. In addition customers may also save completed return forms locally in HTML format.","Digitally Signing the Return","When a customer submits a completed return form, ROS prompts them for a final confirmation of the details submitted. The customer is presented with the key information from the return\u2014i.e. return type, taxation period, amount payable\/repayable, etc. If the customer then confirms that they want to submit the form, ROS prompts the customer to explicitly sign the form using their digital signature and associated password.

The system has a distinct page header throughout, clearly identifying the system as a test system. This system may be accessed by customers using their own digital certificates. The test system is populated with standard test cases, similar to those available for the purposes of evaluating the ROS. All customers are set up for the purposes of the test system as \u2018agents\u2019 of the test customers. They may therefore choose the customer they wish to access. As the test system has general availability, a facility to test forms such as the Form 11 and the CT1 on an annual basis is readily available.","Customers are notified if test data fails using the normal error reporting processes in the ROS system.","Tax Return Validation","Validation of Customer's Identity","Any web user may access the ROS home page, and from it some \u2018non confidential\u2019 information on available ROS services, frequently asked questions etc. Only customers or agents with valid digital certificates with valid digital certificates may go beyond this to access ROS secure services, including the return filing facility. On choosing the \u2018Enter on-line services\u2019 button the user is prompted to supply their unique digital signature and associated password. Users who fail this check cannot access return filing or the other secure ROS facilities.","Validation of Customer's Authority","The ROS system checks the ROS customer information to determine the returns a particular customer is entitled to file, based on the tax heads the customer is registered for. The customer is presented with their list of valid returns. They may then select the return they wish to file. For example, a customer who is an employer can only complete and return forms P45 if they are registered for PAYE-Employers.","ROS also checks that the customer's authority to file is valid in respect of the following conditions:\n\n","Sophisticated period validation is also built into ROS to ensure that customers and agents can only file for periods for which they are registered.","Validation of Tax Return Entries","The ROS system incorporates sophisticated validation of each of the different return forms. Individual field validation includes alpha\/numeric checks, mandatory entries, maximum and minimum value checks and registration number check character validation. Any validation requirements are supported in the relevant return form pages in ROS. Cross reference validation is performed to ensure the information on the form is internally consistent.

This notifies the user that the batch has not been accepted for processing.","Full validation of the individual return forms in a batch is performed by Revenue's existing tax processing systems such as ITP.","Filing Period Validation","The ROS system includes filing period validation to ensure that customers and agents can only file for periods for which they are registered.","The ROS system is designed to ensure that a customer only files a \u2018duplicate\u2019 return if that is what the customer intends to do. To file a \u2018duplicate\u2019 return, the customer explicitly clicks on the \u2018duplicate\u2019 button on the return form in question. This presents the user with a list of all valid periods for the last 2 years\u2014including those for which returns have already been filed. The user is prompted to indicate whether the new return is an \u2018amendment\u2019 or a \u2018supplementary\u2019 return. The form is then completed in the normal way. The customer may change the period if required before the form is submitted by selecting another period from the drop down list box.

The list is prepared based on the standard filing dates for the tax or the customers specific year end. Validation for overlapping periods is therefore not required for ROS returns.","Individual Tax Return Form Requirements","The present invention recognizes the complexity of the Form 11 and the interest in capturing additional accounts data as part of the return filing process.","ROS supports the current year's and the preceding year's Form 11 and CT1. In addition up to 150 fields of account data are captured if required.","Reception and Storage of Customer Returns","ROS holds customer returns and payment data in a standard format. The ROS extract programmed formats the extracted data to match the particular system for which the data is being extracted. The extract is driven from a codes table enabling the format and structure of the data on the returns to be changed with minimal change to the extract programs. The extract programs are therefore generic allowing many different types of return data, return forms and extract formats to be handled using a standard extract programmed. This approach supports the forwarding of different types of data including:\n\n","Customer returns and payment data is held on the ROS database in standard returns tables. Data is extracted from these tables for the various payment and returns reception systems in the core processing systems. The data extracted is formatted to match the particular system for which the data is being extracted.","\u2018Batch\u2019 Returns","ROS can receive batches of returns from customers\/agents and \u2018unpack\u2019 the individual returns in the batch. The unpacked returns are stored on the ROS database pending extract to the core processing systems. These returns are uploaded to the core systems periodically in the same way as individual return forms.","Rejected Returns","Returns submitted on-line to ROS may not be rejected by ROS after submission. This is because the front end ROS validation\u2014both client and server side\u2014is comprehensive and may notify the customer of any error condition before the form is submitted.","The same applies to batch validation. The detailed validation of the individual return forms within a batch, is handled by the existing Revenue systems\u2014ITP, etc. If an individual return in a batch fails this detailed validation, the existing system issues the appropriate notification to the customer\u2014the notification may be routed to the customer's ROS CIS inbox, if required.","Acknowledge Receipt of Returns","ROS presents an acknowledgement to the customer to confirm successful transmissions\u2014i.e. to confirm that ROS has received the digitally signed form.","System generated Processing Reference Number (PRN)","Acknowledgements confirming successful transmissions include a PRN","Date of Receipt of Return","The ROS system captures the date each return was filed. This is passed to the relevant Revenue tax application systems along with the return.","Store\/Archive Return Details","The ROS system maintains an archive log file. The files stores all messages received by the system in the format in which they were received.","Access and Print Facilities for Archived Returns","The ROS CIS system can be used to retrieve any filed return or batch of returns. This form or batch of returns can be printed.","Files can also be retrieved directly from the archive log and printed.","View Return Status","Return status can be checked by customers on-line in ROS CIS immediately after the return is filed.","Separating Data Contained in ROS Returns","Returns data is stored in duplicate on the ROS database. The data is stored in one table for extract to CIF and on another table for extract to the appropriate core processing system.","This enable the processes of extracting data for CIF and for the core processing systems to be performed independently of one another.","As specified in the request for tender, the provision of the Customer Information Service (CIS) for ROS may be in two phases.","The Phase 1 version of CIS is already is already developed. The Phase 1 CIS system provides the customer with a facility to view documents on-line. The range of documents available is dependent on the output made available from ITP. The range potentially includes the following documents:\n\n","ROS provides a facility for customers to view documents on-line, \u2018the inbox\u2019. The inbox can handle multiple document types and standards.","In developing Phase 2, one can make extensive use of the experience in developing ITP.

The periodic Statement of Accounts may be available in CIS and also, a notification e-mail may issue to the customer.","It should be noted that there is a possibility that Revenue may be in a position to provide copies of Statement of Accounts for all ROS users for storage on ROS. The additional development required for this function is also minimal. The customer however, would require a recognized digital certificate to access their inbox to view the statement.","Phase 2 Request Responses","The information provided in CIS services for Phase 2 may be real-time based on the information in ROS at that time. The information may be consistent with the data on the source database (i.e. ITP) at the time of the last extract.","ROS Presentation Style","Outputs from ROS may follow an agreed format. Outputs created by the core processing systems in .pdf format may remain unchanged when presented in ROS. If the requirement to redesign .pdf formats to a ROS style is confirmed, the most cost efficient approach to changing the .pdf formats is to generate the .pdf image directly for ROS in the existing tax application system.

ROS supports .pdf format and HTML format. The ROS inbox may be viewed at many levels. The customer may view new correspondence relating to particular registrations or document type.","Functional Requirements","Issue Electronic Reminder to File Returns","ROS issues an electronic reminder to customers to file a return, based on the information received from the core processing systems.","The receipt of a return reminder from the tax application system automatically generates a reminder for the customer through ROS. The reminder is presented in CIS. A corresponding mail is sent to the customer informing him of the existence of the correspondence.","Issue Second Reminder to File Returns","ROS issues a second reminder to file a return. The reminder is in the standard format issued by the core processing system (e.g. a .pdf file for output from ITP).","The reminder is included in the customer's inbox, and the customer may access the reminder in the same way that they access the Statement of Account. In addition, a corresponding e-mail is sent to the customer informing them of the new correspondence.","Issue Electronic Payment Compliance Correspondence","The approach to payment compliance correspondence mirrors the approach for returns reminders.","For ITP customers, the payment compliance correspondence created by the ITP system is made available to ROS in the form of .pdf files. The files include reminders and demands. The receipt of output in .pdf format for customers generates a corresponding e-mail to be sent to the customer.","Payment compliance correspondence is also issued by the Income Tax and Corporation Tax collection systems. Files notifying ROS of correspondence are generated by the collection systems. The files follow an agreed format. A matching e-mail also issues in this case.","Issue Electronic Return Compliance Correspondence","The approach to returns compliance correspondence is the same as the approach for returns reminders.","For ITP customers, the returns compliance correspondence created by the ITP system is made available to ROS in the form of .pdf files. The files include estimates. The receipt of output in .pdf format for customers generates a corresponding e-mail to be sent to the customer.","Returns compliance correspondence is also issued by the Income Tax and Corporation Tax collection systems. Files notifying ROS of the correspondence are generated by the collection systems. Files follow an agreed format for the customer's inbox in ROS. A matching e-mail also issues in this case.","Issue Electronic Receipts","Customers making payments on ITP receive confirmation of the payment in two stages. The customer enters the payment, signs his submission and then receives notification from the system that the payment has been accepted together with a unique PRN number. This confirms to the customer that the transaction has been successfully entered into ROS. The payment is then processed by the existing systems overnight. The payment reception process generates a receipt within ITP or the Collection systems.","The ITP receipts are issued in the form of .pdf files. These .pdf files are interfaced down to ROS and populate the customer's inbox. A corresponding notification e-mail to the customer is also issued.","A file identifying the receipts issued by the Income Tax and Corporation Tax collection systems is also interfaced to ROS. The receipt files follow an agreed format. A corresponding e-mail to the customer may also be issued.","Issue Notice of Assessment","Electronic notices of assessment generated by the Income Tax and Corporation Tax assessing systems are issued by ROS. The process is similar to that for compliance documentation.","The electronic notice of assessment is inserted into the customer's inbox. An e-mail issues to the customer notifying him of the correspondence.","ROS System Interfaces","Overview","Interfaces associated with the present invention include:\n\n","The ROS database closely mirrors the existing ITP database. Wherever possible the ROS data is held using the same structures and format as ITP. This approach has significant benefits which may become even more apparent in the future when the Income Tax and Corporation Tax systems are within ITP. The benefits include:\n\n","The extract from ITP is therefore a quick and easy series of table copy statements\n\n","The ROS interfaces include:\n\n","The CIS system for Phase 2 bears much similarity to the information available in ITP in terms of presentation and content. Given the knowledge and understanding of ITP, one may reuse the object code developed for ITP to support the CIS queries.","On-Line Interfaces","These interfaces are consistent with the remainder of the Revenue website and are aligned with corporate standards. They are based on ROS. Where appropriate, the interface design may draw on the resources of specialized internet interface companies. Interact, who are currently defining the future appearance of the Revenue website are part of the team.","The ROS interface is built using HTML. The use of this standard format for navigation through ROS and for filling forms ensures that the entire Revenue site contains a consistent look and feel. In preparing the response to this tender, the choice of HTML was based on the following factors:\n\n","Those customers who wish to complete returns off-line are provided with a downloadable form implemented as a Java applet. The same considerations that determined the choice of HTML for the on-line interface (i.e flexibility, reliability and cost) also underpin the choice of Java for the off-line interface.","The batch interface for third party application software files to be submitted to ROS is a simple flat file. ROS customer information service is designed to support multiple different outputs from Revenue. It fulfils the Phase 1 requirements for ROS CIS.","ROS Database","The ROS database is closely aligned with ITP. The extracts to populate the database from ITP are simplified by the fact that the ROS database mirrors ITP. This simplification expedites development testing and overall performance.","Data Extracted from the Core Processing Systems",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0502","num":"0705"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3000","3002"]},"The ROS database design follows the integrated approach adopted for ITP. This positions ROS for the future, when all the major taxes may be included in ITP. The data relating to the IT and CT taxes, which are currently not in ITP, are stored on integrated database tables  in ROS.","Adopting an integrated design for ROS which is based on ITP offers the following benefits:\n\n","The data captured by ROS is held on a set of database tables which are distinct from those tables populated by extracts from the core processing systems. This division of the data simplifies the interfaces between the existing systems. The processes of extracting data from the existing systems and loading data up from the existing systems are therefore entirely independent. This independence eliminates any operational dependencies between the ROS extract of the return and other information for the legacy systems and the ROS uploading of the current tax data from the existing tax systems.","Extracts Provided by Revenue","Phase 1 Extracts","The extracts required for ROS Phase 1 are as follows:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0507","num":"0716"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":"3100"},"Phase 2 Additional Extracts","The extract from ITP for Phase 2 includes financial details to support CIS in Phase 2. As the ROS database is aligned with ITP, this extract is straightforward for ITP taxes. The advantages outlined for the Phase 1 extract are speed of development, testing and speed of operation.","The registration data to support ROS for Phase 1 comes from ITP. Extracts from DRS and PAYE are not required.","Other Extracts","The extracts for the Income Tax assessing, Corporation Tax assessing and Income Tax\/Corporation Tax collection system are specified as required.","ROS Output to Customers",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0511","num":"0720"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},"It is assumed that the output issued from the core processing systems to ROS may be based on .pdf images. Output presented in other formats could be reformatted by ROS to a HTML format. However it is assumed that this may not be necessary. CIS provides a customer information service where customers may view the latest output from Revenue. This facility caters for multiple types of output including both HTML based output and output produced in a .pdf format. Both of these outputs may be printed. ROS identifies that a mail has been accessed by the customer. The mail therefore cannot be repudiated. The current design distinguishes between a customer and their agent accessing the mail.","E-mail\u2014correspondence issuing from the core processing systems and delivered to ROS triggers an automatic e-mail to the customer. The e-mail informs the customer that a mail has been delivered to CIS. The customer accesses ROS to read the output. It is not mandatory for customers who register for ROS to enter a mailbox.","Interfacing ROS Return Details to Revenue Systems","ROS returns and their associated payments are interfaced back to the following core processing systems:\n\n","The interface files are in an agreed format.","The payment and return details are interfaced back to the existing assessing systems via a nightly batch interface. The interface may be run in advance of the nightly updates for the corresponding system.","ROS payment files are also extracted. These are submitted to the existing collection systems for processing. In the case of the P30, the return file corresponding to the payment file is not necessary. The payments need to be processed by the existing payment reception system. The files are in a format suitable for direct input into the existing payment reception systems where feasible.","Updates to Revenue Systems","The updates to the core processing systems for both returns and payments are handled by ICTD and potentially outside contractors.","For ROS Phase 1 an alternative approach is to interface the ROS customer indicator directly to ITP.","Changes Needed to CIF","Agreed interface files to update CIF are periodically produced by ROS. Data captured by ROS is held on separate tables for extract to CIF.","A possible future alternative approach is to store and forward individual transactions to CIF on a continuous basis. This approach is particularly feasible if the ROS and CIF databases are built using same underlying database, CA\/Ingres II.","Many P45s (part 1) may continue to be submitted to Revenue on paper. An additional benefit of ROS is that Revenue users could potentially use ROS to enter these P45s on-line. This facility in ROS creates the potential to capture all P45s on-line.","AIM System","The direct debit tape for the bank is created currently by the AIM system. ROS payments are interfaced to AIM. It is assumed that the payment file for AIM is generated by the appropriate payment processing systems (ITP and IT\/CT Collection).","DRS","An interface file for the DRS system is produced by ROS. The interface with the DRS system is not required for Phase 1 as repayments for VAT and PAYE-Employer are handled by the ITP system. The interface file caters for Income Tax and Corporation Tax repayments to customers.","Access Control System for Tax Agents and Companies","Security is a vital component of the ROS system. Both Revenue and the customer can be satisfied that the security arrangement for ROS prevents unauthorized access to information or unauthorized return filing.","The approach to the access control system for tax agents and companies maintains a consistent security strategy throughout the system. Employees within tax agents and companies who have been authorized by their management to access the systems, may access ROS on the basis of their individual employee digital certificate. Companies may therefore have multiple certificates as required.","The ROS system recognizes one key digital certificate registered with Revenue by the company as the primary certificate. The holder of the primary certificate within a company, presumably a member of senior management, may be entitled to set up in ROS additional certificates for employees to access the company's data. The primary certificate holder may add, amend and delete the authority given to an employee of a company.","Functional Requirements","The ROS secure access control system is used for both tax agents and company management. Tax agents may however have an additional function which allows them to restrict the customers which their employees may access.","The primary certificate holder specifies the identifier of the certificate that they wish to add, amend or delete in the ROS access control system. Tax agents who are adding or amending a certificate are then offered a screen where they specify the customers to which the new certificate may not have access. the research in the taxation market indicates that, in general, tax agents allow employees access to the majority of their customers.","The ROS access control maintains a consistent level of security throughout the system. All users (whether they are individual customers acting on their own behalf, agents, employees of agents or company employees) may have unique digital certificates which individually identify their actions. All returns are signed when submitted. Company employees and agent employees may have a unique digital certificates, in order to operate on the system. The primary certificate for the company or agent is only held by senior management.","Access Control","The administrative function for access control may be performed by the holder of the organization's primary certificate.","The administrator function may include a list which identifies all the certificates currently authorized to access that company's information. When adding or amending a certificate the administrator may attach a name to the certificate. The name is used to identify the certificate to the administrator in the future.","The administrator in a tax agency may restrict access at either customer level or registration level. The administrator within a company can also restrict access at registration level. The administrator grants particular privileges at registration level. The privileges include the following:\n\n","The control and management of the administrator function is entirely at the company or tax agent's discretion. An employee joining the agent or company may require a digital certificate in order to enable them to work on the system. The administrator may revoke a digital certificate at any time. This facility is required when an employee leaves the company. This approach entitles the company or agent to recover the digital certificate that the employee used whilst working for that company. This prevents the employee from using that certificate after their period of employment. As already stated, the company may also revoke a certificate's authority should they not be satisfied with recovering the certificate itself.","The control and management function in ROS is entirely within the control and ownership of Revenue.","Access System Security","The use of individual and unique digital certificates for accessing the system ensures that the user of the system is clearly identified and authenticated. The integrity and confidentiality of data entries is assured through the digital certificate signing mechanism. Under current legislation, the use of a digital certificate is recognized as a form of legal commitment and therefore cannot be repudiated.","The system security and audit trail functions are built for ROS. The audit trail reporting mechanisms developed for individual users of ROS remain in place for company employees and agent employees. The database of access authorities and privileges is maintained within ROS.","Agent is No Longer the Registered Agent of the Taxpayer","The nightly refresh of the ROS database ensures that the customer-agent relationships held on ROS correlate to those held on CRS. When an agent logs onto the system the agent is offered a list of customers which he can access. The agent may also short cut the selection process by entering an RSI number directly. Under either circumstance the agent may only be entitled to access customers with whom he is registered in CRS.","The agent-customer relationship is defined in CRS at registration level. ROS access is therefore also defined at registration level. Therefore, if an agent is only entitled to file returns for a limited range of that customer's registrations, only those registrations may be available to the agent for use.","ROS System Security","Security is key to the success of ROS. Modern electronic intruders are prepared and organized. Intruders exploit passwords, attack protocol flaws, examine source files for security flaws, abuse anonymous FTP, seek to break into web servers, and e-mail. Intruders also use sophisticated toolkits, such as \u2018packet sniffers\u2019, which look for information in connections between machines. The security system for ROS addresses these risks comprehensively.","ROS addresses the two main security areas involved in a netcentric solution:\n\n","Secure Protocols. This involves protecting information exchanged over networks. It includes the following topics:\n\n","This issue is described in more detail in the Government publication on security referenced in the RFT \u2018A Secure and Trusted Electronic Business Environment for Government\u2019.","This involves protecting systems connected to networks. The infrastructure design for security includes both hardware and software. Hardware protection includes the provision of firewalls and the provision of separate machines for the public and secure areas in a system. Software protection focuses on locating code to maximize security. Therefore sensitive code which may be the subject of attack is located in secure areas of the system.","Other considerations that ROS addresses are non-repudiation and traceability. These are important as the objective of ROS is to handle transactions with legal validity over the internet.","Authentication Application Protection","Use of Digital Signatures","Strong authentication over the internet involves the use of digital certificates. To prevent unauthorized use of a digital certificate, a password is requested each time a secure session begins in ROS. The credibility of the digital signature and therefore the ROS solution is based on the assumption that the digital certificate has been issued to the correct entity. Therefore, the role of Certificate Authorities is key to the success of ROS. ROS data is signed using the RSA SHA1 algorithm, in accordance with the X.509 standard.","The ROS system may guarantee the integrity of data","Integrity is supported through the use of digital signatures.","A digital signature is a bit stream generated using the source document and the user private key. If a single bit is changed in the source to be signed, the bit stream may, be completely different so it is impossible for somebody to change the source without invalidating the digital signature.","ROS ensures the integrity of data transmissions to and from the customer. The approach is in line with the paper published by the Government entitled \u2018A Secure and Trusted Electronic Business Environment for Government\u2019.","Identification and Authentication","ROS guarantees the identification and authentication of the communication. Identification is based on the use of a digital certificate to identify both the customer and ROS server.","There are two types of authentication, server authentication and client authentication. Server authentication deals with ensuring that the server is who it claims to be. Client authentication deals with ensuring that the client (user) is who they claim to be. Both types of authentication are included in the ROS System.","Server Authentication This type of authentication ensures that the customer can be certain that communication with ROS is actually going to the authentic ROS server and not to a system that \u2018simulates\u2019 the ROS System. This is accomplished using the SSL protocol and server digital certificates issued by an approved Certificate Authority (CA). This is a well known procedure and is implemented in almost all web browsers.","Proposed solution: SSL+X.509 Server Digital Certificates","Client Authentication Allows the ROS server to ensure that communication is being performed with the identified customer and not anybody else.","This is accomplished using the SSL protocol and client digital certificates issued by an approved Certificate Authority (CA). A second level of security is obtained by requesting a user to type in a password when the digital certificate is used. In addition to these two authentication methods, a session timeout automatically logs users out of the system if they are without activity for a given period of time.","Proposed solution: SSL+X.509 Client Digital Certificates+PIN or Password+Session Time Out protection","Non-Repudiation","ROS communications and transactions cannot be repudiated by the customer. Communications to the customer are accessed through the customers inbox in CIS. The ROS system tracks whether or not a document has been previously accessed.","Transactions cannot be repudiated as each transaction is explicitly signed using customers digital certificate. Each transaction is written to an archive in the form in which it was received by ROS. ROS adheres to the requirements for digital signing defined by the 1999 Finance Act (Section 917F). When submitting return, ROS requires the customer to sign a text package that comprises the relevant field name and the data filled by the user. This transaction cannot be repudiated.","Encryption \/Decryption","Encryption ROS guarantees the confidentiality of data using encryption and decryption. As the internet is a shared communications infrastructure, the only way to prevent non-members of the communication understanding (or changing) the information is encryption.","There are a lot of methods (protocols) to encrypt the information that flows between two points. The most commonly used over the web is SSL. It is implemented on all web browsers.","40-bit SSL, with which the ROS solution is currently built, has been demonstrated to be insecure under exceptional circumstances. Large numbers of high end computers have broken the code after several months processing time. The 128-bit SSL protocol should ideally be used to ensure that is not possible to decrypt the communication channel. This protocol cannot be exported outside USA and Canada except by Government and Banking organizations who can request permission to use 128-bit SSL.","Proposed solution: 128-bit SSL","Audit Trail and Transaction Logs","The Application Server includes an audit trail to store all the packets received and sent to the Internet. A transaction log is built as part of the Technical Architecture, conforming to the ROS functional requirements.","System and Data Recovery","System and data recovery is provided for in the ROS technical architecture. The key to approaching this problem is to minimize the possibility of failure occurring. The architecture enables the hardware configuration for ROS to be clustered.","The availability of the system can be guaranteed using clusters. If one component of the system breaks, another copy of the component, operating in the same machine or in another machine of the cluster may take the control over the current transaction. BEA WebLogic supports clustering. System failure therefore may only occur in the event of an unlikely coincidence of multiple failures across all the machines in the ROS cluster.","BEA WebLogic also supports transaction isolation. Transactions are therefore fully rolled back if a severe application error is encountered ensuring that the database retains a consistent state. Recovery procedures are specified for possible failure conditions. Procedures for communicating a system failure to customers may be agreed with Revenue. These may include the use of a back-up facility.","System Security","Revenue Integrity",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0565","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0127","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0127-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0128","list-style":"none"},"li":["Firewalls perform the function of:","Virus checking","Hacking monitoring and protection."]}}}},"Statistics on performance may be available to enable performance monitoring.","The database includes strict referential integrity rules to guard against corruption.","Revenue System Security","The core Revenue system is not directly linked to ROS. Files transferred to the main Revenue system may be virus checked before transmission.","The method for transferring files may be agreed during the design process. The chosen method may balance the risk of attack against the operational inconvenience of the various methods.","ROS System Security","ROS is built with a flexible architecture. This enables Revenue to procure the best of breed web servers and firewalls to protect the ROS system.","All data written to the system comes from a customer with a digital certificate issued by an approved Certificate Authority. The data itself is validated before being written to the database.","Certificate Authority revocation lists may be checked to ensure the digital certificate used by a customer is still valid.","Both Software (Anti-virus, Firewall software) and Hardware (Screening routers, Firewalls) can be installed to ensure the integrity of the system. There are a number of recommended firewalls that protect the system against hacker attacks (e.g. spoofing, port scanning).","Customer's Computer System Security","The software supplied by ROS may not compromise a customer's computer system. The ROS client configuration system requirements are minimal and standard. The downloaded forms are Java applications running on a Java virtual machine (also downloaded if required). This software is thoroughly checked for viruses prior to release to live.","Session Security","Customer Session \u2018Time-Outs\u2019","BEA WebLogic, as well as other Application Servers, has a feature to determine a time-out interval for the transactions initiated on the system. Any time-out produced may be caught by the application and the whole transaction could be rolled back or saved as uncompleted work. The time-out period can be controlled and adjusted by Revenue. A visual guide to time remaining is included in ROS.","Response \u2018Time-Outs\u2019","If the Revenue site is stalled, ROS is dependent on the client machine to recognize this fact. The client browser is the controlling software in this situation on the client machine.","Slow Response Recovery","The customer may exit the ROS system at any time.","Where a customer has already submitted a transmission to Revenue, he does not have the option to cancel the submission, regardless of the response time. There is no \u2018fast path\u2019 available on the internet to enable a transmission to be intercepted.","Uncompleted Work","Only the information that arrives at the ROS system prior to a time-out can be saved as a partial return. Time-out can occur because of the network failure. The information does reach the ROS system in this case.","Additional Security Features","Supplier Proposed Security Feature","It is important to note that the approach to security is twofold:\n\n","Sensitive code is located carefully on secure parts of the system.","In an alternate embodiment, business data may be filed separate from the forms filed. The present invention may thus take the form of a consolidation of information and more of a business of processing information based on a-priori information and filling using the information repository. The information repository could file Sales and Use Tax based on provided information to a central application. The present invention may thus meet the needs that deal with the centralizing of information and distribution by the application on the part of the taxpayer.","The present invention may also provide estimates of tax liability based on previous fillings, and afford the ability to indicate if the filling is out of line with past filings. This provides a means to use the gathered data from prior interactions the taxpayers benefit. This is preferably accomplished without making private data public, but rather using to server the consumer and assist in their interaction with the government.","Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail herein, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Therefore, the present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims.","As set forth earlier, the principles of the present invention may be easily applied to accommodate a tax service of any country including the United States of America. Additional information will now be set forth regarding such implementation.","The present invention which may comprise the bulwark of a Taxpayer Service Center (TCP) that may consist of an updated and modified market offering. Using the existing shell, the structure may be extended and modified to meet the general requirements of US State governments. This may include optional digital certificate\/UserID PIN entry functions, partial form completion and save functions for the online user, broad range of payment structures to include the possible addition of packages for credit card, EFT and electronic check, or the passing of the proper information to a legacy application that processes these payments. Further, the system may be enhanced to allow reporting of financials at multiple levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0587","num":"0811"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["3300","3302","3304","3306"]},"The security process may be aligned to allow both certificate recognition across a defined set or where ID and PIN are used, to allow access based on group definition for the agent.","The Digital Certificates process may be based on the standards defined by the CCITT X.509; this may allow certificates to be read or written by any application complying with X.509. Digital Certificates use public key encryption techniques that use two related keys, a public key and a private key. In public key encryption, the public key is made available to anyone who wants to correspond with the owner of the key pair. The public key can be used to verify a message signed with the private key or encrypt messages that can only be decrypted using the private key. The security of messages encrypted this way relies on the security of the private key, which may be protected against unauthorized use. This process allows the system to recognize multiple certificates against a single user, an Individual or Business. It is necessary that the concept of multiple users exists to support the business concept and that of the Preparation Agent. In both these cases, more then one individual might have the rights to act on and for the individual. This treats a business as a de-facto individual with more than one responsible agent. The same is established for the individual and thus the agent may act for others as an agent or for him\/herself as an individual.","The system may also be robust enough to support the concept of partial completion activity. There may be the ability to partially complete an activity and still come back at a later time to complete the activity. This is readily supported in the Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) environment as the Stateful Session Bean that represents the activity can be streamed to a database to be retrieved at a later time. This ability is based on the general concept of what a Stateful Session Bean is and how it interacts in the system. The Stateful Session Bean carries the state of the action it is responsible for. Thus, with the knowledge of the Per-quiescent data related to the activity and the state of the action in process, the bean and its unique identifiers can be place in quiescent state for a period of time and restored when appropriate. There is one limitation to this process and that is that the system or application suspending the activity may be substantially the same to restore. There could be version issues as the systems change over time. This would require careful planning to upgrade the system and ensure that any saved work is migrated with the changes in the system. One would anticipate at this time that saved work under this practical completion scenario would only exist for some period of time (ie: 7 days) to simplify this process.","Enterprise JavaBeans Technology","Enterprise JavaBeans\u2122 (EJB) technology defines a model for the development and deployment of reusable Java\u2122 server components. Components are pre-developed pieces of application code that can be assembled into working application systems. Java technology currently has a component model called JavaBeans\u2122, which supports reusable development components. The EJB architecture logically extends the JavaBeans component model to support server components. The architecture provides three basic elements: properties, methods, and events. Objects are built on three basic components: Session Beans (both stateless and stateful) and on Entity Beans. The stateless session beans are responsible for executing functions for which no state is required. This could be a calculation of return on investment based on stock yield or just the printing of a document. The stateful session beans carry a state and understanding of who they act for. This could be the act of buying stocks and adding them to the users portfolio. This type of interaction spans multiple conversations or method requests and the state of these conversations may be carried with the activity. The third component is the entity bean, which is the persistent component on the architecture. Unlike the session beans which have a useful life that basically spans the users session, the entity bean may exist for the life of the data.","Server Components","Server components are application components that run in an application server. EJB technology is part of Sun's Enterprise Java platform, a robust Java technology environment that can support the rigorous demands of large-scale, distributed, mission-critical application systems. EJB technology supports application development based on a n-tier, distributed object architecture, in which most of an application's logic is moved from the client to the server. The application logic is partitioned into one or more business objects that are deployed in an application server.","Java Application Servers","A Java application server provides an optimized execution environment for server-side Java application components. By combining traditional OLTP technologies with new distributed object technologies, a Java application server delivers a high-performance, highly scalable, robust execution environment specifically suited to support Internet-enabled application systems.","Estimating Factors","The Object structure of the Taxpayer Service Center (TSC) forms process component consists of two basic elements. This first is the core element which comprise the entity identification functions. This is the element that identifies who or what is being dealt with. There are three component elements. These core elements identify who the actions may be performed for in the TSC. Once the ore functions are completed, the remaining activity is related to the actions performed for these entities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0595","num":"0819"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 33"]},"The process of building an EJB application is the controlled development of the EJB components to perform the intended functions. The general rule of thumb is that there is an 80-20 relationship between the number of stateless and stateful session beans and that for most general applications the entity beans comprise no more the percent of the developed components. These are just general rules and the complexity of the individual application can change these numbers. There are significant reasons for maintaining the ratio's. The cost to the system performance is impacted by the stateful session beans and finally by the entity beans in that order. The cost to the system is a direct relation to the data persistence interactions. The more data carried or retrieved\/added to the persistent store, the greater the cost to the performance of the system. The development complexity of EJB components is greatest for entity beans, stateful beans followed by stateless beans. The Sales Tax component can be used as an example of the costs to development. The estimation model is based on the code complexity of the standard Java development or C++. One part of the estimation process that should not be overlooked is the reusability of these components. There are approximately four basic form types: Business\/Financial, Compliance, Permit and Licenses. Once the basic form has been defined, there is only the necessity to make minor modifications to meet the new requirements.","The overall system consists of two major components: the core demographics and personalization (D&P) module and the forms (FM) modules. The D&P is the component that identifies who the participant is and what is known about the individual or business. Through this module the system handles security, payments, information exchange and portal personalization. The FM module is directly responsible for the handling, processing and submission of all forms.","General Issues","There are a few cost items that have not been included in the above. These items are related to the general management of a Internet Project and include Graphics, Project Management and Planning, QA and Legal Review, Training Development and up front requirements, development and design.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0599","num":"0823"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0600","num":"0824"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},"The third and most complex form type is one that requires data from multiple external sources and may support complex interactions with data and backend systems. The Washington D.C. Corporation Franchise Tax Return requires the detailing of income, tax, details of corporation books including loss and details to support incentive program eligibility. The form also requires that compensation for corporation officers be detailed. The complexity is a direct relation to the number and type of calculations and interrelated data capture required to complete the form.

This may be required if the TSC is not the primary repository of registration data. The TSC would retain a complete record of all users entering through the TSC and based on the requirements those registrants would be known to the parent system. It would be the assumption that this would be loaded from the legacy system in most cases during conversion and then new additions added on a periodic process basis. The system is capable of receiving and processing transactions based on registration if the legacy system is capable of providing the data. This form of data input requires alterations to most legacy systems and may be driven by requirements. If requirements allowed registration then a two way interface would need to be developed with some conflict resolution procedure between the two systems. The base solution does not include a PIN number distribution process. Security would be assumed to be outside this system.","Form Filing ()","The Form Filing interface is normally related to the submission process and would occur once the forms are complete. The interface can be extended in those cases where interrelated activities would require that information on one submission might require additional input by the registrant. The interface may be capable of providing positive response of submission and forms acceptance by the responsible agency. The handshaking between the submission and delivery may be handled through the interface with the legacy system and may require additional development on both ends of the interface. Base approach would be file would be completed and submitted to the legacy system. At that time the completed form would be translated into a PDF image that would be sent to the user mailbox. Old form entry data may not be accessible through the form sub application after a specified period of time.","On-line Payment ()","The online payment process can be integrated with existing payments systems which exist in the legacy environment or can be developed independently as part of the TSC. This is a primary design requirement that may be defined prior to development start.","Account Balance ()","The Account Balance process is intended to provide the registrant with the ability to examine existing activity, returns\/applications, payments made through the TSC and any and all payment made to the agency. This requires a high degree of integration between the legacy systems and the TCP. This is one of the most complex components and leads to requirements definitions related to the level of transaction transparency. The normal interface would provide a summarized view that provides a complete picture of the account and activity. Transactions are normally summarized based on activity types and do not include all detail. The idea in this area is a representation of the users account rather than detailed transactions as those would require a filter of corrections or amendments from the legacy system. Nothing in this architecture would prevent detail if the State would prefer that approach. It would require some changes to the data model in terms of the account section and a substantial increase in the processing of the transaction data.","Infrastructure","The TSC requires an UNIX Sun Server and Operating systems properly sized for the expected site activity. This includes all communications, storage, production support and infrastructure support. This may be identified and priced based on system load and uptime requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0610","num":"0835"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00026","num":"00026"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Item","Costing","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Server Digital","Priced by MIPS","This is the server side certificate"]},{"entry":["Certificate",{},"required to authenticate clients"]},{"entry":["Client Digital","By Client","The clients certificate, purchased"]},{"entry":["Certificate",{},"and owned by end user"]},{"entry":["WebLogic","Priced by MIPS","EJB Application Server"]},{"entry":"Application"},{"entry":"Server"},{"entry":["Oracle 8","Priced by MIPS"]},{"entry":"Database (Web"},{"entry":"Enabled)"},{"entry":["Payment","Processing","The payment systems are priced"]},{"entry":["Processing","Speed","based on speed at which the"]},{"entry":["System",{},"payments are processed"]},{"entry":["Symantec","OEM","Used for maintenance of"]},{"entry":["Visual Cafe",{},"application components"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The TSC has a standard install base that handles the general system functions, interfaces and data persistence issues.
