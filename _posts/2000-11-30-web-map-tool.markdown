title: Web map tool
abstract: A method of mapping at least a part of one or more web sites having web objects and web links is provided, whereby web objects and links are mapped as nodes and edges, respectively, in one or more web maps, each object being mapped to at least one corresponding node. The method allows a user to re-display selected items in a web map such that the item are distinguished from other items in the web map and are displayed in a clarified form. This enables a web map to be de-cluttered.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The present invention concerns a method of representing the structure of one or more internet or intranet web sites.","The internet is a communications network which connects millions of computers around the world. Many organisations host web sites that can be accessed via this communications network. Each web site can contain a variety of web objects, including plain text, hypertext, images, audio, video, and other multimedia information. In particular, hypertext documents written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and similar languages are referred to as web pages. Many web objects\u2014in particular, web pages\u2014contain links to other web objects, including objects on other web sites. The collection of all web sites and the links between them are known as the World-Wide Web (WWW).","Web sites are accessed using a web browser. To access a web object, a user simply needs to input into a browser the \u201caddress\u201d of the object, which is specified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), the most common form of which is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).","A user of a web site often has needs which are different from the needs of the host of the web site. For example, a user of a corporate web site may be looking for an interactive, interesting and efficient way of accessing information, while the web site host may be interested in raising revenue through sales on the web site, imparting particular product information to the user, or increasing brand recognition with the user. Web site designers therefore face the challenge of meeting the objectives of both the web site host and the users. Web site designers often strive to design a site such that a user can enter the site and quickly retrieve the information that they require, and preferably be provided with other information which is related to the retrieved information. If the web site is poorly designed, or suffers from problems of structural quality and integrity, the user may give up and seek an alternative way of finding the information they require.","Designing and managing a corporate web site can be particularly difficult as such sites are typically large and complex. Information contained in web sites may quickly become out of date, and is frequently added to, changed, or removed. Coordinating these changes can be difficult, as many people can be involved in the process, and many managers and technical staff may not fully understand the structure and organisation of their corporate web site. The web site is usually understood as a complex collection of web pages and links. However, the linking structure of a web site is critical, as it directly affects how well a user can make use of the information provided by the organisation.","A well-designed and well-maintained linking structure that is free from errors has the following benefits:\n\n","Unfortunately, large web sites often have a poorly-designed and poorly-maintained linking structure, and may exhibit any of the following common problems:\n\n","These problems reduce the effectiveness of the web site and leave the user with a poor impression of the organisation hosting the web site.","An intranet is a web site hosted by an organisation for internal use only, such as for employees. Many organisations have intranet web sites that are much larger than their public web site, as the internal need for information within the organisation may be more urgent than the need to provide information to the public. As a result, the inconsistencies that occur in a typical internet web site are of even more concern within intranet web sites.","Web maps have been developed as a tool to help a user understand the structure of a web site. A web map can represent how a user might navigate between pages in the web site. In this context, web maps are also referred to as navigation maps or access paths.","A web map is a representation of one or more web sites, or parts thereof. A web map can be created by scanning one or more web sites, examining the web objects encountered, and recording the linking structure associated with these objects. Each web object may be represented in a web map by a node, which can be an icon, symbol, shape or text. Often, the node is labelled with the filename, title, or URL of the associated web object. One or more links between a pair of web objects can be represented in a web map by an \u201cedge\u201d, which is drawn as a line between the associated nodes. Typically, an arrowhead is placed on the line to indicate the \u201cdirection\u201d of the link from the object containing the link (called the source of the link) to the object referenced by the link (a URL, called the destination of the link). If there are links running in both directions between a pair of web objects, the corresponding edge may have arrowheads on both ends.","Definitions","A web site includes a collection of web objects which may provide information via an internal network (an intranet web site) or to the general public via the internet (an internet web site). A web site may also have facilities for obtaining information from its users. Note that a web site may consist of more than one physical machine. For example, a corporation called Acme may have two machines whose internet addresses are, respectively, www.customers.acme.com and www.products.acme.com, and there may be many links that relate web objects across the two machines. The organisation may consider both machines to constitute a single logical web site.","A web object is any document that can exist on a web site. This includes, but is not limited to, plain text, hypertext, images, audio, video and other multimedia objects, executable applications, and database information. A web object may be a static file or database entry residing on a machine hosting the web site, or it may be dynamically generated by the web site as needed.","A directory structure of a web site is the physical arrangement of web objects on the machine or machines hosting the web site. The term directory structure is used herein not only in the context of web objects stored in traditional file systems, but also for web objects stored in relational databases, object-oriented databases, and any other structured storage of web objects.","A linking structure of a web site is the arrangement of web objects and links which form a web site.","A web map is a representation of the linking structure of one or more web sites or parts thereof.","A \u201cdirectory distance\u201d between two web objects is given by the length of the shortest path between the two objects in the directory structure of the web site. For example, \u201cwww.abc.com\u201d and \u201cftp.abc.com\u201d would be in the same virtual directory, namely \u201c.abc.com\u201d, and \u201c.com\u201d is a common grandparent directory.","A \u201clink distance\u201d between two web objects is the length of the shortest path between the two objects in the linking structure of the web site.","Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d, or variations such as \u201ccomprises\u201d or \u201ccomprising\u201d, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers.","A first aspect of the present invention provides a method of mapping at least a part of one or more web sites having web objects and web links, whereby web objects and links are mapped as nodes and edges, respectively, in one or more web maps, each object being mapped to at least one corresponding node, and there being only one corresponding object for each node, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","The method according to the first aspect of the invention may be performed on or with the aid of a computer.","Steps (a) and (b) of the method may be either automatic, or guided in response to instructions from a user, and may comprise selecting and displaying either all of the nodes and links in the at least one section of the web map, or a subset of those nodes and links. Preferably, the steps (b) and (d) of the method comprise displaying items in a graphical format. In some cases, web maps may partially or substantially overlap such that one or more items is common to a plurality of web maps. An object may therefore be mapped as more than one corresponding node. However, for each node there is only one corresponding object.","Steps (c) and (d) have the advantage that they can be used to display a web map in a clarified format, making the information in the web map easier to digest. For example, the method provides the option of omitting nodes and\/or edges which are not of interest in a web map, thereby \u201cde-cluttering\u201d a web map. A user is thus able to focus on the remaining parts of a web map without distraction. Such methods have numerous applications, as even well-designed web sites may result in web maps which each contain hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges.","Items may be selected in step (c) directly, such as by designating items and selecting the designated items. Alternatively, items may be selected indirectly by designating items, and selecting all items which are not designated. Step (c) offers the option of displaying a subset of items in a web map. Step (c) may comprise searching through items in the one or more web maps and filtering out items which are not to be selected. Step (d) may comprise one or more of the following sub-steps:\n\n","Alternatively, step (c) may not necessarily involve selecting a subset of items in a web map. In one embodiment, step (c) comprises selecting all items in one or more web maps. In this embodiment, all of the items are re-displayed in step (d). Step (d) may comprise a sub-step of rearranging the selected items. For example, the selected items may be sorted or categorised accordingly to instructions from a user.","Step (c) may be carried out in one or more of the following ways:\n\n","The one or more sets of items may be selected in step (a) according to the following sub-steps:","(a1) for each of the objects in the part(s) of the web site(s) to be mapped, adding a node to the sets of items such that similar nodes are added to the same set, wherein the similarity of any pair of nodes is a function of one or more of the following:\n\n","(a2) for each first object which corresponds to a node added to a set, adding a new node to the set for any object which is either the source of a link to the first object, or a destination of a link from the first object;","(a3) for each pair of nodes in each web map, adding an edge between the pair of nodes if there is a link between a pair of objects corresponding to the nodes.","Preferably, the contributions of the link distance and the directory distance to the similarity criterion of pairs of nodes can be adjusted, depending on the type of web map required. Preferably, the adjustment can be made by a user.","Sub-steps (a1)-(a3) offer the possibility of creating web maps which simultaneously represent both the directory structure and the linking structure of one or more web sites. In one embodiment, the similarity of a pair of nodes is controlled by a parameter \u03b1, wherein:\n\n","An example of an equation in which the link distance L and directory distance D are combined to give the overall distance x(a, b) between web objects a and b is:\n\n()=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The resulting distance x(a, b) can then be used as a \u201cdissimilarity measure\u201d in a geometric clustering algorithm, such as the PAM (Partition Around Medoids) algorithm or the CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomised Search) algorithm. Alternatively, the distance x(a, b) can be used as a weighting factor for the edges in a map which combines directory structures and linking structures of a web site. Such a graph can be partitioned using a weighted graph partitioning algorithm, such as the Ratio Cut algorithm. The resulting clusters of nodes are then assigned to separate web maps.","Step (c) may comprise sub-steps of searching through some or all types of items in a web map and determining, based on predetermined selection criteria, whether each item should be selected. Known searching tools may be used to implement these sub-steps. The selection criteria may be set by a user, and may be based on specifying a set of properties that the selected items should possess, or alternatively, should not possess. Properties which may be used in the selection criteria include one or more of the following:\n\n","A graphical representation of a node may consist of an icon, symbol, shape, text, or any combination of these. Graphical properties of a node include the number, types, sizes, colours, intensities, textures and relative positions and orientations of its components and its overall size.","The directions of links to or from a designated set of nodes may be used as a selection criterion. For example, nodes may be selected if they are the source of one or more edges having destinations in a subset of nodes designated by a user. Further, nodes may be selected if they are the destination of one or more edges having sources which are among a designated subset of nodes. Further, nodes may be selected if they are either the source or destination of one or more edges having destinations or sources, respectively, among a designated subset of nodes. Preferably, if a node is not selected, all edges for which that node is either a source or destination are also not selected.","Items may also be selected in step (c) as a result of executing a third party program, function or routine which communicates with a web mapping system through an application programming interface (API). The third party program may be:\n\n","In determining which nodes are to be selected, the third party program may have access to the following information in a web map through the API:\n\n","Similarly, items selected in step (a) or step (c) may be displayed as a result of executing of a third party program, function or routine which communicates with a web mapping system through an application programming interface. The third party program may display selected items using web maps, graphs, charts, tables, reports, or other known diagram types, or may provide page and link information in conjunction with corresponding web maps. The third party program may have access through the application programming interface to various properties and attributes of the web maps, including properties and attributes of nodes and edges.","Step (d) may involve creating an overview web map. Creating an overview web map may comprise the following sub-steps:\n\n","The overview web map provides the advantage that it can be used to jump to an arbitrary web map, and provides a high-level description of the web sites represented by the set of web maps. Preferably, the overview web map is such that if a user selects any one of the map-nodes, the web map corresponding to that web node is displayed. An overview web map may be displayed alongside one or more normal web maps.","The method of the present invention may be used to map a directory or sub-directory containing a large number of \u201cpages\u201d, that is, web objects which do not link beyond the directory. For example, a directory may include  or more pages and a web map of such a directory would be far too cluttered to identify node attributes if all pages were displayed. Step (c) may be used to select and display more manageable subsets of nodes representing pages, such as 15 nodes at a time. In one embodiment of step (c), provision is made for a user to arbitrarily select and display subsets of nodes.","For example, steps (a) and (b) may display all of the pages in a condensed format, such as with \u201coverview nodes\u201d which each represent a subset of nodes, such as 10 nodes. This enables amuser to select and display any one of the subsets of nodes by designating an appropriate overview node. The condensed format has the advantage of allowing a user to move from one subset of pages to another, thereby providing \u201cloosely-coupled\u201d web maps. Step (d) may involve displaying a selected web object or objects in a viewing tool, such as a web browser.","A further embodiment of step (c) comprises selecting web map items which have changed over a given time interval. A web map item may be selected if one or more of the following circumstances exists:\n\n","Step (d) may be subjected to the following additional constraints:\n\n","This embodiment may be initiated upon the occurrence of one or more of the following:\n\n","The method of the present invention may further comprise the following step:\n\n","Step (e) may comprise gathering and displaying additional information related to operation or performance of a web map or corresponding web sites. Step (e) may also comprise generating a report which may be displayed to a user automatically or on demand. The preselected items may be the items selected in step (c). Alternatively, step (e) may comprise a sub-step of preselecting items from the one or more web maps. Information is only provided in respect of the preselected items.","Step (e) may occur in response to a query from a user. The information may be obtained by interrogating relevant parts of the corresponding web site(s). The query may be a request for specific information, such as data about items selected in step (c). For example, a user may request to know how many and which of the selected nodes correspond to objects with a size in a particular range. In one embodiment, step (c ) comprises selecting a subset of web map items and step (e) comprises performing a search limited to the selected items.","Alternatively, the query may be a two-part query, a first part of the query being a preselection, and the second part of the query being a request for information about items found (ie. preselected). As with step (c), the preselection sub-step in step (e) may be made manually, semi-automatically, automatically, or combinations of these. The preselection sub-step may involve searching through some or all types of items in a web map, and deciding, based on predetermined selection criteria, whether each item should be preselected. Known searching tools may be used for this purpose. The preselection criteria may be set by a user, and may be based on specifying a set of properties that the selected items should possess, or alternatively, should not possess. The same properties which may be used as selection criteria in step (c) may also be used as preselection criteria in step (e).","Results provided in response to a search query may be presented in a graphical format. For example, preselected nodes or edges may be highlighted in some way, such as by using a different colour, size, shape or pattern. Information about the preselected items may be presented using graphs, charts, diagrams, or other known techniques. A statistical analysis of the data may also be provided using known techniques. The results of a search query may include a calculated relevancy value for each item found. The calculation of each relevancy value may be based on a comparison of the properties of each web object with the search criteria used. The relevancy value of each searched item may be presented in a number of ways, including tabulated data, graphs or charts in respect of the searched nodes, or by graphically altering a representation of each searched node (colour, size, shape or pattern). The web pages corresponding to preselected nodes may be displayed, possibly highlighting parts of the documents which \u201cmatched\u201d the search criteria.","An embodiment of step (e) comprises the sub-step of calculating the amount of information in each web object which corresponds to a pre-selected node. The amount of information in each web object may be determined by combinations of one or more of the following:\n\n","This information is useful for identifying overly large web pages, which are a sign of a poorly-designed web site, and may cause difficulty when a user attempts to access them. For example, the size of each web object may be represented by the size of the icon of its corresponding node.","Calculations on the amount of information in each web object may be used to determine:\n\n","In a further embodiment, step (e) comprises counting, for each pair of objects corresponding to preselected nodes in the web maps, the number of links for which one of the objects is a source and the other of the objects is a destination. For example, the number of links between two web objects may be represented by the number of arrowheads on the corresponding edge. The counted number of links may be used to determine properties of the edge between the pair of nodes corresponding to the pair of web objects.","In a further embodiment, step (e) comprises providing information, either in a web map or in a report, about links existing between two preselected web objects corresponding to two designated nodes. For example, a user may preselect two nodes by designating an edge between the two nodes in a web map. The provided information may comprise:\n\n","In a further embodiment, step (e) comprises displaying web pages containing links which correspond to a preselected edge in a web map. Optionally, highlighting may be provided in sections of the web pages which contain one of the links. For example, the appropriate web pages may be displayed as a result of a user preselecting an edge in a web map.","A further embodiment of step (e) comprises providing information about links corresponding to edges whose common destination is a preselected node in a web map, and about web objects which are the sources of these links. The information may be displayed in a web map or a report, and may include:\n\n","A further embodiment of step (e) comprises determining the number of hits to one or more web objects corresponding to preselected nodes over a predetermined time interval and presenting this information to a user. For example, a user may specify a time interval, and a server log file or some other web-server-based repository of information may be examined to determine the number of hits over the time interval. Step (e) may further comprise updating the properties of each node to represent the number of hits to the corresponding web objects. Information about the number of hits is useful for web designers, as it lets them identify the \u201cpopular\u201d web objects from which they can guide users to order forms and other priority web objects. It also clearly shows those web objects which are rarely accessed, and may need to be repositioned or discarded. For example, the number of hits to a particular web object may be represented by a \u201chalo\u201d around the icon of the web object\u2014the darker the halo, the more hits were recorded to that web object within the given time interval.","A further embodiment of step (e) comprises determining an approximate aggregate usage of links corresponding to preselected edges over a predetermined time interval and presenting this information to a user. Where an edge corresponds only to links in a single direction, the properties of the edge may be updated to represent an aggregate of the corresponding links. Where an edge corresponds to links in both directions, the edge may be graphically divided into two segments, such that:\n\n","For example, a user may specify a time interval, and a server log file or some other web-server-based repository of information may be examined to determine the approximate aggregate usage of links.","A further embodiment of step (e) comprises determining the number of form submissions to at least a part of a web site (corresponding to preselected items in a web map) over a predetermined time interval and presenting this information to a user. Submissions may be aggregated according to:\n\n","If submissions are aggregated according to 1, the properties of the node corresponding to the web page containing the form may be updated. If submissions are aggregated according to 2, the properties of the node corresponding to the program which processes the form may be updated. If submissions are aggregated according to both 1 and 2, the properties of the edge corresponding to the link between the web page containing the form and the program which processes the form may be updated.","A further embodiment of step (e) comprises presenting information about web objects corresponding to preselected nodes. The information may be presented in the web maps or a report, and may include:\n\n","A further embodiment of step (e) comprises presenting information about the directory position of each web object within the directory structure of the web sites. The information may be denoted in each web map by:\n\n","The method according to the present invention may further comprise the following step:","(f) modifying the one or more web sites in response to a modification of a corresponding web map by a user.","One embodiment of step (f) comprises the sub-step of presenting a selected web object in a hypertext editor, or some other editing tool appropriate to the type of web object, in response to a selection of the corresponding node by a user. The user is preferably permitted to edit the object when it is presented, and thereby change the web site. The web maps may be updated to maintain their consistency with respect to the changes made to the web site.","In another embodiment of step (f), web objects may be moved by a user from one directory to another by any combination of the following:\n\n","Each link in the web sites whose destination is one of the moved web objects may be updated to reflect the new directory containing the web object. The web maps may be updated to maintain the consistency of the directory position information presented therein. This embodiment may be used to insert a new web object into a web sites at a particular directory position by selecting the corresponding node, edge or web map. For example, the user may be required to specify the type of web object to be created and then invoke a hypertext editor, or some other editing tool appropriate to the type of the new web object, to create the contents of the object. Preferably, the web maps are then updated to include the new web object.","A further embodiment of step (f) comprises deleting a user-selected subset of one or more nodes from web maps, and deleting all web objects which correspond to the deleted nodes. Preferably, any link whose source or destination is one of the deleted web objects is also deleted from the web sites. For each such link, if its source web object is not among the deleted web objects, then the user is preferably able to invoke a hypertext editor, or some other editing tool appropriate to the type of source web object, to remove the context of the link. The web maps are preferably also updated to maintain their consistency with respect to deleted web objects and the new linking structure.","In a further embodiment of step (f), the destination of one or more links can be changed by combinations of one or more of the following:\n\n","A hypertext editor, or some other editing tool appropriate to the type of web object containing a link, can be invoked by the user to change the context of the link to be consistent with its new destination web object. Preferably, the web maps are updated to maintain their consistency with respect to the new linking structure.","In a further embodiment of step (f), a new link can be added to web sites by combinations of one or more of the following:\n\n","A hypertext editor, or some other editing tool appropriate to the type of web object containing a link, can be invoked by the user to create the context of the link to be consistent with its new destination web object. A web browser, hypertext editor, or some other viewing or editing tool appropriate to the type of web object which is the destination of the link, can be invoked by the user to specify the section of the destination web object to link Preferably, the web maps are updated to maintain their consistency with respect to the new linking structure.","In a further embodiment of step (f), one or more edges can be selected from the web maps corresponding to links which are then deleted from the web sites. If there are multiple links corresponding to a selected edge, the user can select from among these links by:\n\n","Step (f) may invoke a hypertext editor, or some other editing tool appropriate to the type of web object containing the link, to remove the context of the link. Preferably, the web maps are updated to maintain their consistency with respect to the new linking structure.","The method according to the present invention may further comprise the following step:","(g) re-displaying at least one web map after the web map has been modified in step (f).","In one embodiment of step (g), a web map is re-scaled to best occupy space provided for its display after the web map has been modified by any of the above methods. The re-scaling may occur even where modifications have only been made in decorations of nodes and edges.","Step (b) and \/or step (d) may involve displaying a web map in three-dimensions. For example, each node may be drawn as one or more three-dimensional shapes, objects, surfaces or text (for example, spheres cubes and cones) or any combination of these. The graphical properties of each node may include the number, types, sizes, colours, intensities, textures and relative positions and orientations of its components, and its overall size and orientation. Each edge may be drawn as a pipe, tube, line or some other elongated shape, or a continuous sequence of such shapes, which may be decorated with three-dimensional shapes, objects, surfaces or text\u2014in particular, three-dimensional arrowheads\u2014or any combination of these. The graphical properties of each edge may include the cross-sections, thicknesses, continuities, colours, intensities and textures of its shapes, and the number, types, sizes, colours, intensities, textures and relative positions and orientations of its decorations. All of the above methods which are applicable to web maps are also applicable to three-dimensional web maps by simple modifications of the appropriate graphical properties.","A second aspect of the invention provides a method of providing information to a third party computer program about at least a part of one or more web sites having web objects and web links, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","Virtual nodes, virtual links and virtual web maps may be any means of representing the information contained in the corresponding web site(s) without visually displaying the information.

The third step  involves creating a new web map  by selecting items  from the items  initially displayed in the web map . This step allows a user to simplify the web map  by highlighting items of interest  and deleting items which are not of interest. In the example shown in , a user has only selected node H, plus those nodes which are the destination of a link from node H, but not the source of a link to node H. Only three nodes satisfy this selection criteria, namely nodes C, G, E and H. Nodes D, I, M, L, K are the destination of a link from node H, but are also the source of a link to node H, and are therefore not selected. In the fourth step , only the selected items are re-displayed in the new web map .","A second embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS.  and -. The first step  comprises three sub-steps . The first sub-step  involves adding \u201csimilar\u201d nodes to the same set.  shows three sets  of similar nodes  which correspond to different sections of a web site. The distance between each pair of nodes  is measured as a function of both the directory distance and the link distance between corresponding objects in the web site. Nodes are \u201csimilar\u201d when they correspond to objects which are close to each other relative to other objects when proximity is measured as a combination of the directory distance and link distance.","The second sub-step  () comprises adding new nodes  to the sets  for each object which is either the destination of a link whose source corresponds to one of the earlier nodes , or the source of a link whose destination corresponds to one of the earlier nodes . The third sub-step  () comprises adding edges  to the sets  between any pair of nodes ,  for which there is a link between corresponding objects in the web site(s). The three sets  of nodes ,  and edges  shown in  are the items which are subsequently displayed in three web maps in the second step  of the method. Particular items in the web maps can then be selected and re-displayed (third and fourth steps ,  of the method shown in ) as with the first embodiment.","Another application of sub-steps  will now be described with reference to . A set of web maps  is shown representing a web site. The web site consists of four directories: a Home directory ; a Products directory ; an Employees directory ; and a Clients directory . However, the Products directory  contains two separate clusters in the linking structure: a Sales cluster (Products, Specifications, Prices and Orders), and an Incentives cluster (Free Software and Free Offers). In using web mapping techniques of the prior art, this structure would not be revealed. Directory-only partitioning methods would group Sales and Incentives in a single map. Linking-only partitioning would group Employees and Incentives into a single group because there is a direct link between Employees and Free Software. Simultaneously partitioning by directory structure and link structure in accordance with the method shown in  produces four web maps, namely Clients , Sales , Incentives  and Employees , and effectively reveals the structure of the web site.  illustrates the Sales web map  after the third and fourth steps ,  of the method shown in  have been applied. In this example, all nodes have been selected except the Home node  in the Sales web map .","A further embodiment of the invention will now be described in which the method shown in  includes a fifth step of providing information about web objects and\/or links which correspond to preselected items in a web maps.  shows an application of the fifth step in which information is provided about the size of each object. The size of each object is proportional to the size of an icon  representing each corresponding node.  makes it clear that the Products web object  is the largest object, while the Copyright object  is the smallest.","In a further embodiment, information is provided about links, such as the position of a link within an web object, the type of link, the full text of the link, and any attributes or parameters associated with the link in the web object. In ) the number of links between two objects Prices.html  and Index  is represented by the number of arrowheads  on the corresponding edge . In ) information is provided about each of the links between two web pages , . The label Product list  is the name of the first link from the Index  to the Prices  pages. When a user clicks on the \u201ceye\u201d icon  next to the Product list  label, the menu  in  appears. This menu shows an itemised list of the links contained in the Index page whose destinations are in the Prices.html page . This menu can be used to select one of the links about which more information may then presented.","In a further embodiment, information is provided about the links whose destination is a given web object, and about those web objects which are the sources of these links. For example, in  when the user clicks on the eye icon  next to the Order node , a menu can be invoked showing an itemised list of the links  whose destination is the Order page. Such a menu can be used to select one of the links about which more information can then be presented.","In a further embodiment, information is provided about the dynamic usage (\u201cweb traffic\u201d) of web objects and links in one or more web sites. Information about the number of times each web object is accessed (its number of \u201chits\u201d) within a given time period is useful for web designers, as it lets them identify popular web objects from which they can guide users to order forms and other priority web objects. It also clearly shows those web objects which are rarely accessed, and may need to be repositioned or discarded. For example,  shows the number of hits in a web site. In this example, the number of hits to each web object is represented by a halo  around the corresponding icon . A solid halo  represents a large number of hits, a thick dashed line  represents a medium number of hits, and a thin dashed line  represents a low number of hits to a web object within a given time interval. From the web map shown in , it can be clearly seen that the Home page recorded the most hits, followed by Free Software, Products, and then the Employees and Free Offers. In other embodiments, the number of hits is proportional to either the colour, brightness, or line thickness of the halo. It will be understood that many other known methods may be used to graphically indicate the number of hits to each object.","In a further embodiment, information is provided about the number of times each link has been followed within a given time period. In addition to showing how often the destination web object of the link has been accessed, this method shows the web designer the paths of links taken by the users when navigating the web site.  shows the usage of the links in a web site. In this example, the thickness of the line  and arrowhead  making up the half of an edge  closest to its destination node  is used to represent the usage of the corresponding link. It can clearly be seen that most users navigate from the Home page to the Free Software page, and many then go on to the Free Offers page.","In a further embodiment, information is provided in response to a search query from a user. The search query may be about keywords, topics, ideas and other properties or constraints.  shows a method of representing the relevance of each web object  with respect to the search query. The relevance of web objects is represented by a halo  around the corresponding nodes of the web map. The line thickness and line type in the halo provides a measure of the relevance of each object. This method presents the collection of relevant web objects in a more useful way than methods of the prior art, which typically just list the file names or URLs of the relevant web objects.","In a further embodiment, a subset of the web objects in a web map can be selected by allowing the user to select web objects. A search limited to the selected objects can then be carried out. Limiting the scope of a search in this way can greatly reduce the time taken to perform the search, as well as reducing the number of relevant web objects to be considered by the user after the search is completed. For example,  shows a web map  in which four nodes  are selected, namely Employees, Specifications, Products and Purchase.  shows the relevance (using halo ) of selected nodes  resulting from the search.","In a further embodiment, information is provided about changes in the structure of a web site over time. For example,  shows a web map  of a web site as it existed at time A, and  shows a web map  of the same web site as it existed at a later time B. In this example, objects corresponding to the Employee Search and Client Search nodes  have been added to the web site these are shown in inverse colours in . New links have also been added to the web site\u2014these are shown as hollow lines  with hollow arrowheads  in this example. Finally, the links from the Employees and Large Clients web objects to the Home web object have been deleted\u2014these missing links are represented in  with circles  around their arrowheads. This method is extremely useful in the maintenance of web sites, and is much more intuitive than the prior art methods, which typically involve a direct comparison with web objects which make up the web site.","A further embodiment of the invention includes a sixth step of modifying a web site in response to a modification of a corresponding web map by a user. One embodiment comprises invoking an external editing program through a web map and using this to modify the represented web sites. In another embodiment, each web map or a section of each web map is associated with a directory in the directory structure of the web sites being represented. By manipulating a node in the web maps, the user can change the directory containing the corresponding web object. This method allows web designers to re-organise the directory structure of a web site without affecting its linking structure. Such re-organisation is often required as a web site grows over time. This is a difficult process using prior art methods, often requiring tedious manual editing of many web objects.","For example,  shows two web maps ,  the web map  on the left represents the Products directory of a web site, while the web map  on the right represents the Sales directory of the same web site. If the web designer decides to move the Brochures web object into the Sales directory, the node  corresponding to the Brochures web object may simply be moved into the web map representing the Products directory.  shows the result of this move.","In another example, the method is used to change the destination of a link. For example, the left side of  shows a web map  representing a web site. To change the link between the Prices web object and the Tractors web object into a link between the Prices web object and the Online Order web object, the web designer simply needs to select the corresponding edge and then select its new destination node. The resulting web map  is shown in the right side of .","Information about a web site can be presented in a three-dimensional web map.  shows an example of a three-dimensional web map  of a web site. In this example, each web object is represented by a cone , where the width of the base  of each cone is proportional to the number of links whose destination is the corresponding web object, and the height of each cone is proportional to the number of links whose source is the corresponding web object. The base  of each cone is also labelled with an icon  representing the type of the corresponding web object, and either its title or its URL. Each link is represented by a pipe  running from the top  of its source cone to the base of its destination cone , giving the visual impression that the link flows down from its source to its destination.","All of the methods of the present invention can be implemented with a system which comprises hardware, such as a PC, and appropriate software. In one embodiment, shown in , the hardware  comprises a graphics display device , input devices , and a system chassis  which includes memory , a processor , and a medium  such as a disk drive for storing files. The processor  generates a display on a screen  of the display device  by executing a program stored in the memory . The program uses data which is also stored in the memory . At least some of the data for a web map may be obtained from a non-local web site via a network connection . If the program is interactive, execution of the program is controlled by inputs from interactive input devices  which in this example comprise a keyboard  and mouse  with three buttons . A pointer  on the screen  follows the movement of the mouse. The pointer  can be used to manually select nodes or edges in a web map.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0213"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0214"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0215"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0216"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0217"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0218"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0219"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0220"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0221"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0222"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0223"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0224"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0225"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0226"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0227"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0228"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0229"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0231"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0232"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0233"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0234"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0235"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0236"},"figref":"FIG. 24"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
