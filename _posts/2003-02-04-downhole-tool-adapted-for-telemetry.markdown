title: Downhole tool adapted for telemetry
abstract: A cycleable downhole tool such as a Jar, a hydraulic hammer, and a shock absorber adapted for telemetry. This invention applies to other tools where the active components of the tool are displaced when the tool is rotationally or translationally cycled. The invention consists of inductive or contact transmission rings that are connected by an extensible conductor. The extensible conductor permits the transmission of the signal before, after, and during the cycling of the tool. The signal may be continuous or intermittent during cycling. The invention also applies to downhole tools that do not cycle, but in operation are under such stress that an extensible conductor is beneficial. The extensible conductor may also consist of an extensible portion and a fixed portion. The extensible conductor also features clamps that maintain the conductor under stresses greater than that seen by the tool, and seals that are capable of protecting against downhole pressure and contamination.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. DE-FC26-01NT41229 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","None","This invention relates generally to downhole tools joined in a tool string and forming a downhole telemetry network. These tools often have components that are displaced in rotation and translation during use. More particularly, this invention relates to downhole tools comprising transmission rings connected by an extensible transmission line that permits signal transmission during the operation of the tool.","Real time telemetry via a downhole network has long been desired by the oil, gas, and geothermal well drilling industries. Although there is much literature on the subject, until now, a commercial system offering real time high-speed data rates has not been available. This invention is an application of the first successfully demonstrated downhole high-speed telemetry network. This enabling technology allows real-time bidirectional telemetry all along the drill string between the drill bit and the surface. The investigator is directed to the applicants' U.S. Pat. No. 6,392,317, pending U.S. Application 20020075114A1, and pending PCT application WO2001US0022542, incorporated herein by this reference, for further details concerning the nature and application of the invention.","This invention pertains to drilling tools that undergo rotational or extensional cycling, either continuously or on demand in the drilling operation. A modern drill string, or tool string, is made up of many different tools. Some of them are passive, while others are active, performing drilling functions in addition to providing a torque connection between the drill bit and the surface platform. The objective of this invention is to provide a means for accommodating the cycling of such tools while enabling transmission of data along the string. Examples of tools that undergo rotational or extensional cycling, either continuously or on demand in the tool string are found in the following U.S. Patents.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,481,495, to Evans, discloses a downhole tool known as a hydraulic drilling Jar. It teaches the use of a telescoping mandrel positioned in the housing of the tool. The mandrel provides an annulus housing the active components of the tool. The tool also provides for a conductor member positioned in association with the mandrel for transmitting an electronic signal through the tool. The conductor is insulated from the conductive drilling fluid by means of a sealed chamber filled with a non-conductive fluid. The disclosure goes on to teach that the conductor is designed to elongate as the tool cycles. The means for providing elongation of the conductor is supplied forming the conductor cable into a helix. This disclosure relies on a variety of direct contact components to complete the electrical path through the tool.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,396,965, to Hall et al., one of the inventors herein, discloses a downhole hammer for use in a drill string. The abstract of the invention discloses the general nature of the hammer and its use downhole. According to its broadest aspect, the invention is a down-hole mud actuated hammer for use in a drill string, which includes a housing with an upper end having means for connecting to the drill string. A throat is located within the housing, which throat includes a main flow passage to allow high pressure drilling mud to pass there through. A piston is provided which is adapted to move axially within the housing means to reciprocate between an up position and a down position. The piston is moved between the up and down position by a minor portion of the high pressure mud, which portion passes from the main flow passage into at least one piston actuating chamber. This minor portion of mud is exhausted from the piston actuating chamber to a low pressure region out of the housing without being returned to the main flow passage. The present invention teaches how this tool may be adapted for inclusion in a downhole network.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,940, to Anderson, discloses a downhole shock absorber for use in a drill string. The tool employs both rotationally and translationally actuated components to dampen the drill string vibrations present in drilling deep wells. The tool comprises multiple segments that are threadably connected together to provide a tool compatible with standard drill string components and makeup. The assembly allows for longitudinal telescoping movement of the active components of the tool which are housed in an annulus that is defined by an axial flow passage and by the tool's housing. The flow passageway permits the circulation of drilling fluid through the tool and the tool's housing. The operation of the tool is described as follows. If the shock wave impinges on the tool, a mandrel telescopes into the drive cylinder. This allows continued rotational movement while simultaneously absorbing, by both mechanical and hydraulic means, the energy of the shock. The shock is dampened by the movement of the mandrel into the annular space provided by the drive cylinder, connector sub and compression cylinder. The present invention teaches how this tool may be adapted for inclusion in a downhole network.","This invention, therefore, provides a means for adapting downhole tools that undergo rotational or translational cycling for inclusion in a high-speed telemetry network down hole. Real time data may then be transmitted to and from the drill bit and other sensors and equipment along the drill string.","This invention constitutes a downhole tool that is fitted with transmission rings that are joined by an extensible transmission line. The transmission line may also be joined to rings and sensors. The classes of tools that may benefit from this invention are those that cycle during operation in either rotation or translation. Such tools are Jars, hydraulic hammers, shock absorbers, and mud motors. Many other tools are likely to benefit from this invention such as mud pulsers and sirens, steering tools, blowout preventors, and downhole generators. Some passive tools may also benefit from the invention where the strain on the tool is so great that an extensible transmission line would be beneficial.","The transmission rings are either contact or non-contact depending on the specific application. Contact rings are those that generally have smooth mating surfaces and propagate the signal by the direct contact of one ring against another. Coupling rings are those that rely on a shared electromagnetic field as a means for transmitting the signal. Coupling rings may also contact one another or they may be designed so that a gap is always present between the mating surfaces.","All downhole tools in a drill string are joined together by means of box and pin end tool joints. Most tool joints rely on an annular shoulder to create the torque required to withstand the stresses of the drill string. When the joint is made up, that is when a pin end is screwed into a box end, the respective shoulders contact one another. Therefore, the mating shoulders are a suitable location for the transmission rings. The rings are then attached to a transmission line that runs the length of the tool. The transmission line may be flexible or rigid or a combination of both.","The purpose of this invention is to disclose a tool that is adapted for the transmission of an electronic signal. The particulars of this invention and its application will become apparent in reference to the following explanation associated with the following figures. These figures are by way of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of this invention. Those skilled in the art will undoubtedly recognize additional application for the concepts presented herein. This disclosure is intended to incorporate those concepts as well.","The detailed description of this invention will be in reference to the following figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","13","14"]},"The active components of the tool must be constrained to the geometry of the downhole tool. In some tools, this requires that two or more sections are joined together using modified tool joints in order to a length consistent with standard drilling tools. For example, as noted above, a drilling jar, mud hammer, or shock absorber may consist of multiple sections wherein are housed the active components of the tool. When the sections are joined together, the outside appearance of the tool should be similar to that shown in , in order for it be compatible with other tools in the string. An objective of this invention, therefore, is to provide a transmission network that allows drill string components to be made up using standard practices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","30","21","31","22","32","21","31","23","33","24","34","25","35","25","26","35","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["40","41","42","43","44","45","46","45","45","43","23","33","47","48"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["50","52","51","52","53","52","54"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["60","61","62","63","64","63","64","65","65","61","61","63","64","65"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["70","64","71","63","79","81","72","80","70","71","75","79","81","83","79","78","73","76","77","70","71","82","78","71"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5"],"b":["84","85","86","87","87","86"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["90","91","92","93","94","95","100","101","102","96","96","104","104","104","99","96","104","97","98","97","98","102"]},"In cases where the box and pin ends of a tool undergo continuous or cyclic rotation, an electromagnetic coupler ring is provided in a closely-spaced, non-contact configuration.
