The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the HDAC inhibitors, to methods of increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy comprising contacting the cell with one or more of the HDAC inhibitors, and to therapeutic methods of treating conditions and diseases wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit, for example, a cancer, an inflammation, a neurological disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, stroke, traumatic brain injury, allograft rejection, autoimmune diseases, and malaria, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a present HDAC inhibitor to an individual in need thereof.","Inhibitors of HDACs modulate transcription and induce cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) also enhance the cytotoxic effects of therapeutic agents used in cancer treatment, including radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, recent research indicates that transcriptional dysregulation may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and other peripheral neuropathies, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, and ischemia. For example, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been shown to penetrate into the brain to dramatically improve motor impairment in a mouse model of Huntington's disease, thereby validating research directed to HDACIs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, selective HDAC6 inhibitors have been shown to rescue the CMT phenotype, restore proper mitochondrial motility, and correct the axonal transport defects observed in transgenic mice. Selective HDAC6 inhibitors also induce the re-innervation of muscles and increase the number of observed neuromuscular junctions in these same models (C. d'Ydewalle et al., 2011).","A recent review summarized evidence that aberrant histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and HDAC activity may be a common underlying mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover, from a mouse model of depression, the therapeutic potential of HDACs in treating depression is discussed. See WO 2008\/019025, designating the United States, incorporated herein in its entirety.","Eleven isozymes in the HDAC family of enzymes, which can be grouped into classes by their evolutionary relationships, have been identified. Structure and function appear to be conserved among members of the various classes. The HDAC family is made up of class I HDACs, including HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8; class IIa, including HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9; class IIb, including HDAC6 and 10; and a class IV enzyme, HDAC11 (A. J. de Ruijter et al., 2003, 370(Pt), 737-749).","The class I HDACs are found primarily in the nucleus and are expressed in all tissue types, except for the muscle cell-specific HDAC8. The class I HDACs interact with many key transcription factors regulating gene expression, including CoREST and NuRD. Class IIa HDACs have tissue specific expression, and are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Unlike the other isozymes, the class IIb HDAC6 does not extensively associate with transcription factors, and acts as a deacetylase on non-histone proteins, including \u03b1-tubulin, HSP90, cortactin, and the peroxiredoxins (O. Witt et al., 2008; R. B. Parmigiana et al., 2008).","HDACs form multiprotein complexes with many regulatory proteins inside the cell. For example, HDAC4, 5, and 7 actually lack intrinsic deacetylase ability, and gain activity only by interacting with HDAC3. Each isozyme interacts with a specific series of regulatory proteins and transcription factors and has a specific set of substrates, and thus each regulates a specific series of genes and proteins (O. Witt et al., 2008). The design of selective HDAC isozyme inhibitors allows preferential inhibition of only the isozyme(s) relevant to a particular disease or condition, thereby reducing the probability of counterproductive and\/or adverse effects resulting from an unwanted and undesired inhibition of other HDAC isozymes.","HDAC6 is the most abundant histone deacetylase isozyme in the human body, and along with HDAC7, is the most commonly expressed isozyme in the brain (A. J. de Ruijter et al., 2003, 370(Pt), 737-749). Structurally significant features of HDAC6 include two deacetylase domains and a zinc finger motif. It is most commonly found in the cytoplasm, but can be shuttled into the nucleus via its nuclear export signal. A cytoplasmic retention signal, which sequesters the enzyme in the cytoplasm, also was found (A. Valenzuela-Fernandez et al., 2008, 18(6), 291-297). The functions of HDAC6 are unlike any of the other HDAC isozymes. Many non-histone substrates are deacetylated by HDAC6, including \u03b1-tubulin, HSP90, cortactin, and peroxiredoxins (O. Witt et al., 2008; R. B. Parmigiani et al., 2008, 105(28), 9633-9638).","The design of HDACIs focuses on the three major domains of the enzyme molecule. A zinc binding group (ZBG) of the HDACI typically is a hydroxamic acid, benzamide, or thiol, although other functional groups have been used. This ZBG moiety of the inhibitor chelates the zinc cofactor found in the active site of the enzyme. The ZBG moiety typically is bonded to a lipophilic linker group, which occupies a narrow channel leading from the HDAC surface to the active site. This linker, in turn, is bonded to a surface recognition, or \u2018cap\u2019, moiety, which typically is an aromatic group that interacts with residues at the surface of the enzyme (K. V. Butler et al., 2008, 14(6), 505-528).","Consideration of each structural element is important in the design of HDACIs (37). Alteration of the ZBG has profound effects on inhibitor potency. The most potent inhibitors frequently feature a hydroxamic acid ZBG, though other groups such as ketones, amides, and thiols effectively inhibit the enzyme with lower potency. Low molecular weight compounds having carboxylic acid ZBGs, such as valproic acid, inhibit HDACs at micromolar potency, but have profound effects in vivo when given in high doses. Hydroxamic acids chelate zinc in a bidentate fashion and hydrogen bond with H142 and H143 (HDAC8), as revealed by crystal structure data. Computational studies have refined this description of chelation, demonstrating that the hydroxamic acid carbonyl coordinates zinc more strongly than the hydroxyl group. Energetically favorable interactions between hydroxamic acid and the active site provide for high potency inhibition, but the hydroxamic acid functional group has some undesirable properties from a drug design perspective. Hydroxamic acids are potentially mutagenic, and have given positive results in the Ames test. Hydroxamic acids also are promiscuous zinc chelators and potently inhibit many zinc-containing metalloproteins. The replacement of hydroxamic acid with a different potent ZBG is an active area of research in HDACI design and development.","The linker region typically is a hydrophobic aryl or alkyl scaffold, which occupies the hydrophobic HDAC catalytic channel. Most reported HDACIs, including SAHA, feature an alkyl chain linker, mimicking the lysine alkyl chain. Aromatic groups are frequently included in the linker region of an HDACI, for example, in the HDACIs panbinostat and belinostat.","Manipulation of the cap group can greatly increase potency because this group has the potential to interact with multiple residues at the enzyme surface. The most potent inhibitors typically feature an aryl cap group scaffold. Biaryl and heteroaromatic cap group scaffolds have been extensively investigated. The large tetrapeptide motif of apicidin imparts high potency, and gives high potency with a number of diverse ZBGs. The tetrapeptide cap group motif is common to natural product HDACIs, and has been engineered to produce libraries of tetrapeptide HDACIs for use in screening protocols.","Currently, at least eleven HDACIs are in clinical development. These HDACIs can be divided into at least five chemical classes, illustrated below, based on their structure, and in most cases they broadly and nonselectively inhibit class I\/II HDACs with varying efficiency. These five chemical classes are hydroxamates, cyclic tetrapeptides, cyclic peptides, short-chain fatty acids, and benzamides. Typically, known HDACIs fail to show prominent HDAC isozyme selectivity, which as stated above can cause serious problems in a clinical setting, especially in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein a prolonged drug administration of an HDACI is required. For example, it has been found that some HDACIs enhance lung and microglial inflammation (TSA and SAHA), as well as high glucose-induced inflammation. If this effect is linked to specific HDAC isozymes, the use of certain HDACIs would be contraindicated in various diseases and conditions, such as diabetes and asthma.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"175.77mm","wi":"73.74mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"148.67mm","wi":"70.95mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Additional HDACI's include",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"208.11mm","wi":"72.90mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"113.11mm","wi":"61.81mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"The following table summarizes some HDACIs that presently are in clinical trials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Inhibitor","Indications"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["SAHA","T-cell lymphoma (Approved)"]},{"entry":["Romidepsin","T-cell lymphoma (Approved)"]},{"entry":[{},"Multiple myeloma (Phase III)"]},{"entry":[{},"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (Phase III)"]},{"entry":[{},"Refractory renal cell cancer (Phase II)"]},{"entry":["Valproic Acid","Bipolar disorder (Approved)"]},{"entry":[{},"Acute myeloid leukemia (Phase I\/II with all trans-"]},{"entry":[{},"retinoic acid)"]},{"entry":["PCI-24781","Leukemia (Phase I\/II)"]},{"entry":["ITF-2357","Hodgkins lymphoma (Phase II)"]},{"entry":[{},"Follicular lymphoma (Phase III, with yttrium-90-"]},{"entry":[{},"ibritumomab)"]},{"entry":[{},"Juvenile arthritis (Phase II)"]},{"entry":[{},"Myeloproliferative Diseases (Phase II)"]},{"entry":["MS-275","Melanoma"]},{"entry":[{},"Lymphoma (halted due to dose limiting toxicities)"]},{"entry":[{},"Advanced acute leukemias (Phase 1)"]},{"entry":[{},"Combination trials with DNA methyltransferase"]},{"entry":[{},"inhibitors and 5-azacitidine in non-small cell lung cancer"]},{"entry":[{},"(Preclinical)"]},{"entry":["Panbinostat","T-cell lymphoma (Phase II)"]},{"entry":[{},"Prostate cancer (Phase I with docetaxel)"]},{"entry":["Belinostat","Solid tumors (Phase I)"]},{"entry":[{},"Mesothelioma (Abandoned)"]},{"entry":["MGCD0103","Solid tumors (Phase II with gemcitabine)"]},{"entry":[{},"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Phase II)"]},{"entry":["EVP-0334","Parkinson's disease (Phase I)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Clinical trial information relating to HDACIs is published in J. Tan et al., & 3:5 (2010) and L. Wang et al., 8:969-81 (2009).","HDAC-regulated factors have been implicated in the mechanisms of major central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In Parkinson's disease (PD), \u03b1-synuclein binds to histones and inhibits HAT activity, causing neurodegeneration. Application of HDACIs to PD neurons blocks \u03b1-synuclein toxicity. Dysregulation of histone acetylation, involving CBP, a neuroprotective transcription factor with histone acetyltransferase activity, has been found in Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (T. Abel et al., 2008, 8(1), 57-64). In a cellular model of AD, cell death was accompanied by loss of CBP function and histone deacetylation. The mutant HD protein, htt, interacts with CBP, inhibiting the HAT activity and causing cell death. Treatment with an HDACI helps to restore histone acetylation, protecting against neurodegeneration and improving motor performance in a mouse model of HD (C. Rouaux et al., 2004, 68(6), 1157-1164).","Various studies directed to the application of HDACIs in the context of CNS disorders have implicated the class II HDACs, particularly HDAC6, as potential therapeutic targets. One investigation revealed that inhibition of HDAC6 could be beneficial as a treatment for HD, a disease for which no pharmacological treatment is available. The mutant htt protein found in HD disrupts intracellular transport of the pro-survival and pro-growth nerve factor, BDNF, along the microtubule network, causing neuronal toxicity. Inhibition of HDAC6 promotes transport of BDNF by promoting tubulin hyperacetylation. TSA (trichostatin A), a nonselective HDAC inhibitor, was found to facilitate transport and release of BNDF-containing vesicles (J. P. Dompierre et al., 2007, 27(13), 3571-3583). These results provide a biological basis for the identification and development of HDACIs, and particularly HDAC6 selective inhibitors, as a treatment for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.","HDACIs prevent or delay neuronal dysfunction and death in in vitro and in vivo models thereby indicating that HDACIs are broadly neuroprotective. For example, HDACIs have shown therapeutic efficacy in the polyglutamine-expansion disorder Huntington's disease. While the neuroprotective mechanisms of the HDACIs in rodent models are not yet understood, it is clear that HDACIs induce the expression of certain genes that confer neuroprotection. The upregulation of HSP-70 and Bcl-2 through the inhibition of HDAC has been observed in the cortex and striatum of rats after focal cerebral ischemia. HSP-70 expression has been found to result in neuroprotection in a number of disease models including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). In addition, HDAC6 inhibition leads to the acetylation of peroxiredoxin and increases its antioxidant activity which may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of these compounds (R. B. Parmigiana et al., 2008).","Studies also provide good evidence that HDACI-induced p21cip1\/waf1 expression may play a significant role in HDACI-mediated neuroprotection. It recently was reported that p21cip1\/waf1 overexpression protects neurons from oxidative stress-induced death, that p21cip1\/waf1 is induced in the rodent brain by HDAC inhibition, and that homozygous loss of p21cip1\/waf1 exacerbates damage in a mouse MCAO\/reperfusion model of ischemic stroke. In a similar study, the HDAC inhibitor TSA was shown to increase gelsolin expression in neurons, and that gelsolin expression is necessary for neuroprotection in an oxygen\/glucose deprivation model of neurodegeneration and a mouse MCAO\/reperfusion model of ischemic stroke.","Alternatively, unrelated to histone acetylation and gene upregulation, proteins such as \u03b1-tubulin and HSP90 are targets for acetylation and become acetylated when HDACs are inhibited. In tumor cells, the acetylation of HSP90 has been shown to decrease the ability of HSP90 to interact with certain client proteins and thereby abrogate chaperone function. With regard to stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases, the inhibition of HSP90 is predicted to have a positive effect on neuronal survival. Indeed, the pharmacological HSP90 inhibitor, Geldanamycin, and its analogs have been shown to be neuroprotective in a number of stroke models. HSP90 inhibition and the consequent release of heat-shock factor (HSF) to the nucleus may also, in part, explain an upregulation of HSP70 in the brain during focal ischemia and HDACI treatment.","In addition, HDACIs are useful in the treatment of cancers. For example, histone acetylation and deacetylation play important roles in chromatin folding and maintenance (Kornberg et al., Bjorklund et al., 1999, 96:759-767; Struhl et al., 1998, 94:1-4). Acetylated chromatin is more open and has been implicated in the increased radiation sensitivities observed in some cell types (Oleinick et al., 1994, 66:523-529). Furthermore, certain radiation-resistant human cancer cells treated with the HDACI inhibitor TSA were sensitized to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Thus, HDACIs appear useful as radiation sensitizing agents.","WO 2008\/055068, designating the U.S. and incorporated herein in its entirety, discloses numerous diseases and conditions treatable by HDACIs, including the underlying science and reasoning supporting such treatments.","HDAC6 therefore has emerged as an attractive target for drug development and research. (C. M. Grozinger et al., 1999, 96, 4868-73; and C. Boyault et al., 2007, 26, 5468-76.) Presently, HDAC6 inhibition is believed to offer potential therapies for autoimmunity, cancer, and many neurodegenerative conditions. (S. Minucci et al., 2006, 6, 38-51; L. Wang et al., 2009, 8, 969-81; J. P. Dompierre et al., 2007, 27, 3571-83; and A. G. Kazantsev et al., 2008, 7, 854-68.) Selective inhibition of HDAC6 by small molecule or genetic tools has been demonstrated to promote survival and re-growth of neurons following injury, offering the possibility for pharmacological intervention in both CNS injury and neurodegenerative conditions. (M. A. Rivieccio et al., 2009, 106, 19599-604.) Unlike other histone deacetylases, inhibition of HDAC6 does not appear to be associated with any toxicity, making it an excellent drug target. (O. Witt et al., 2009, 277, 8-21.) Tubacin, an HDAC6 selective inhibitor, used in models of disease, has helped to validate, in part, HDAC6 as a drug target, but its non-drug-like structure, high lipophilicity (ClogP=6.36 (KOWWIN)) and tedious synthesis make it more useful as a research tool than a drug. (S. Haggarty et al., 2003, 100, 4389-94.) Other compounds also have a modest preference for inhibiting HDAC6. (S. Schafer et al., 2009, 4, 283-90; Y. Itoh et al., 2007, 50, 5425-38; and S. Manku et al., 2009, 19, 1866-70.)","In summary, extensive evidence supports a therapeutic role for HDACIs in the treatment of a variety of conditions and diseases, such as cancers and CNS diseases and degenerations. However, despite exhibiting overall beneficial effects, like beneficial neuroprotective effects, for example, HDACIs known to date have little specificity with regard to HDAC inhibition, and therefore inhibit all zinc-dependent histone deacetylases. It is still unknown which is (are) the salient HDAC(s) that mediate(s) neuroprotection when inhibited. Emerging evidence suggests that at least some of the HDAC isozymes are absolutely required for the maintenance and survival of neurons, e.g., HDAC1. Additionally, adverse side effect issues have been noted with nonspecific HDAC inhibition. Thus, the clinical efficacy of present-day nonspecific HDACIs for stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, neurological diseases, and other diseases and conditions ultimately may be limited. It is important therefore to design, synthesize, and test compounds capable of serving as potent, and preferably isozyme-selective, HDACIs that are able to ameliorate the effects of neurological disease, neurodegenerative disorder, traumatic brain injury, cancer, inflammation, malaria, autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive therapy, and other conditions and diseases mediated by HDACs.","An important advance in the art would be the discovery of HDACIs, and particularly selective HDAC6 inhibitors, that are useful in the treatment of diseases wherein HDAC inhibition provides a benefit, such as cancers, neurological diseases, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative disorders and other peripheral neuropathies, stroke, hypertension, malaria, allograft rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammations. Accordingly, a significant need exists in the art for efficacious compounds, compositions, and methods useful in the treatment of such diseases, alone or in conjunction with other therapies used to treat these diseases and conditions. The present invention is directed to meeting this need.","The present invention relates to HDACIs, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the HDACIs, and methods of treating diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit, such as a cancer, a neurological disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, a peripheral neuropathy, stroke, hypertension, an inflammation, traumatic brain injury, rheumatoid arthritis, allograft rejection, autoimmune diseases, and malaria, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an HDACI to an individual in need thereof. The present invention also relates to a method of increasing the sensitivity of a cancer cell to radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy. The present invention also allows for the use of these HDACIs inhibitors in combination with other drugs and\/or therapeutic approaches.

Such modifications are encompassed by the claims below.","The term \u201ca disease or condition wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit\u201d pertains to a condition in which HDAC and\/or the action of HDAC is important or necessary, e.g., for the onset, progress, expression of that disease or condition, or a disease or a condition which is known to be treated by an HDAC inhibitor (such as, e.g., TSA, pivalolyloxymethylbutane (AN-9; Pivanex), FK-228 (Depsipeptide), PXD-101, NVP-LAQ824, SAHA, MS-275, and or MGCD0103). Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to, cancer, psoriasis, fibroproliferative disorders (e.g., liver fibrosis), smooth muscle proliferative disorders (e.g., atherosclerosis, restenosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's chorea, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, spino-cerebellar degeneration, Rett syndrome), peripheral neuropathies (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN)), inflammatory diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis), diseases involving angiogenesis (e.g., cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy), hematopoietic disorders (e.g., anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalasseimia), fungal infections, parasitic infections (e.g., malaria, trypanosomiasis, helminthiasis, protozoal infections), bacterial infections, viral infections, and conditions treatable by immune modulation (e.g., multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diabetes, lupus, atopic dermatitis, allergies, asthma, allergic rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease; and for improving grafting of transplants). One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether a compound treats a disease or condition mediated by HDAC for any particular cell type, for example, by assays which conveniently can be used to assess the activity of particular compounds.","The term \u201csecond therapeutic agent\u201d refers to a therapeutic agent different from a present HDACI and that is known to treat the disease or condition of interest. For example, when a cancer is the disease or condition of interest, the second therapeutic agent can be a known chemotherapeutic drug, like taxol, or radiation, for example.","The term \u201cHDAC\u201d refers to a family of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from a protein, for example, the \u03b5-amino groups of lysine residues at the N-terminus of a histone. The HDAC can be a human HDAC, including, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC8, HDAC9, HDAC10, and HDAC11. The HDAC also can be derived from a protozoal or fungal source.","HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) typically contain three structural elements which are analogous to the structure of acetyllysine. These three structural elements are a zinc binding group (M), which is responsible for chelation of zinc in the active site, a linker region (L), which binds to the hydrophobic channel that connects the active site to the outer enzyme surface, and a capping group (Cap), which interacts with residues at the outer enzyme surface.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d \u201ctreatment,\u201d and the like refer to eliminating, reducing, relieving, reversing, and\/or ameliorating a disease or condition and\/or symptoms associated therewith. Although not precluded, treating a disease or condition does not require that the disease, condition, or symptoms associated therewith be completely eliminated, including the treatment of acute or chronic signs, symptoms and\/or malfunctions. As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d \u201ctreatment,\u201d and the like may include \u201cprophylactic treatment,\u201d which refers to reducing the probability of redeveloping a disease or condition, or of a recurrence of a previously-controlled disease or condition, in a subject who does not have, but is at risk of or is susceptible to, redeveloping a disease or condition or a recurrence of the disease or condition, \u201ctreatment\u201d therefore also includes relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis. The term \u201ctreat\u201d and synonyms contemplate administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to an individual in need of such treatment. A treatment can be orientated symptomatically, for example, to suppress symptoms. It can be effected over a short period, be oriented over a medium term, or can be a long-term treatment, for example within the context of a maintenance therapy.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d or \u201ceffective dose\u201d as used herein refers to an amount of the active ingredient(s) that, when administered, is (are) sufficient, to efficaciously deliver the active ingredient(s) for the treatment of condition or disease of interest to an individual in need thereof. In the case of a cancer or other proliferation disorder, the therapeutically effective amount of the agent may reduce (i.e., retard to some extent and preferably stop) unwanted cellular proliferation; reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., retard to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., retard to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; reduce HDAC signaling in the target cells; and\/or relieve, to some extent, one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To extent the administered compound or composition prevents growth and\/or kills existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic.","The term \u201ccontainer\u201d means any receptacle and closure therefor suitable for storing, shipping, dispensing, and\/or handling a pharmaceutical product.","The term \u201cinsert\u201d means information accompanying a pharmaceutical product that provides a description of how to administer the product, along with the safety and efficacy data required to allow the physician, pharmacist, and patient to make an informed decision regarding use of the product.

By \u201cconcurrently,\u201d it is meant that each agent is administered either simultaneously or sequentially in any order at different points in time. However, if not administered simultaneously, it is meant that they are administered to an individual in a sequence and sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect and can act in concert. For example, a present HDACI can be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time as a second therapeutic agent. A present HDACI and the second therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. When a present HDACI and the second therapeutic agent are not administered concurrently, it is understood that they can be administered in any order to a subject in need thereof. For example, a present HDACI can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapeutic agent treatment modality (e.g., radiotherapy), to an individual in need thereof.

In certain preferred embodiments, the present HDACIs interact with and reduce the activity of one histone deacetylase (e.g., HDAC-6), but do not substantially interact with or reduce the activities of other histone deacetylases (e.g., HDAC-1, HDAC-2, HDAC-3, HDAC-4, HDAC-5, HDAC-7, HDAC-8, HDAC-9, HDAC-10, and HDAC-11).","The present invention therefore provides HDACIs for the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions wherein inhibition of HDAC has a beneficial effect. Preferably, a present HDACI is selective for HDAC6 over the other HDAC isozymes by a factor of at least 2, at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 50, at least 100, at least 500, at least 1000, at least 2000, at least 3000, and preferably up to about 4000. For example, in various embodiments, a present HDACI exhibits an ICvalue versus HDAC6 that is about 350 or about 1000 times less than the ICvalue vs. HDAC1, i.e., a selectivity ratio (HDAC1 IC\/HDAC6 IC) of about 350 or about 1000.","Other assays also showed a selectivity of a present HDACI for HDAC6 over HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 11 of about 1000.","The ICvalues for compounds of structural formula (I) vs. HDAC1 and HDAC6 were determined as follows:","The HDAC1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 assays used isolated recombinant human protein; HDAC3\/NcoR2 complex was used for the HDAC3 assay. Substrate for HDAC1, 2, 3, 6, 10, and 11 assays is a fluorogenic peptide from p53 residues 379-382 (RHKKAc); substrate for HDAC8 is fluorogenic diacyl peptide based on residues 379-382 of p53 (RHKK). Acetyl-Lys(trifluoroacetyl)-AMC substrate was used for HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9 assays. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and tested in 10-dose ICmode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 30 \u03bcM. Control Compound Trichostatin A (TSA) was tested in a 10-dose ICwith 3-fold serial dilution starting at 5 \u03bcM. ICvalues were extracted by curve-fitting the dose\/response slopes. Assays were performed in duplicate and ICvalues are an average of data from both experiments.","Materials","Human HDAC1 (GenBank Accession No. NM004964): Full length with C-terminal GST tag, MW=79.9 kDa, expressed by baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells.

After incubation with HDAC, deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate such that, in a second step, treatment with the detection enzyme produces a fluorophore. HDACs 1 and 6 were expressed as full length fusion proteins. Purified proteins were incubated with 50 \u03bcM fluorescently-labeled acetylated peptide substrate and test compound for 2 hours at RT in HDAC assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl, 1% DMSO, and 1% BSA.","Reactions were terminated by the addition of the Developer after 2 hours, and the development of fluorescence signal, which was relative to the amount of deacetylated peptide, was monitored by time-course measurement of EnVision (PerkinElmer). The HDAC activity was estimated from the slope of time-course measurement of the fluorescence intensity. The slope of no-enzyme control (substrate alone) was served as background, and % Enzyme activity was calculated using background-subtracted slope of no inhibitor control (DMSO) as 100% activity.","To date, HDACIs have demonstrated a relatively non-specific inhibition of various HDAC isozymes. Most HDACI so far identified primarily inhibit HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8, producing an antiproliferative phenotype which is useful for oncology applications, but not for the many non-oncology applications of HDACIs. (K. B. Glaser et al, 2003, 310, 529-36.) The potential toxicities associated with the inhibition of certain HDAC isozymes can lead to additional difficulties for the clinical development of pan-HDAC, i.e., nonselective HDAC, inhibitors. Because the network of cellular effects mediated by acetylation is so vast and because inhibition of some HDAC isozymes may lead to undesirable side effects, HDAC isozyme selective inhibitors hold a greater therapeutic promise than their nonselective counterparts.","As illustrated below, many HDACIs of the present invention exhibit selective inhibition of HDAC6 compared to other HDAC isozymes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0453","num":"0453"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

ISOX was previously found to have a low picomolar ICat HDAC6. When ISOX was tested in these assays, an HDAC6 ICvalue of 2.4 nM was observed. After investigating the source of this discrepancy, it was found that lack of a detergent (Triton X100) in the original assay caused the anomalously high activity.","The present HDACIs demonstrate excellent HDAC6 potency and selectivity, often exhibiting an ICof 1 to 5 nM at HDAC6 and 1000- to 2000-fold selectivity against HDAC1. For example, 4 demonstrated an ICof 2.5 nM at HDAC6 and 2125-fold selectivity against HDAC1.","Ligand efficiency is an important metric to judge the value of potential drugs. Ligand efficiency was proposed after finding that the average molecular weight of successful drugs was lower than those at an early clinical phase, thereby establishing an association between lower molecular weight and a higher chance of clinical success. (C. Abad-Zapatero, et al., 10:464-9, 2005; M. C. Wenlock, et al., 46:1250-6, 2003). This observation led to the use of ligand efficiency values as an important value for determining lead and clinical candidate selection. Ligand efficiency relates binding free energy to the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the equation: \u0394g=AG\/N, where N is the number of non-hydrogen atoms, and \u0394g is ligand efficiency. A closely related value used in the analysis of deacetylase inhibitors is binding efficiency index, defined as BEI=pIC50\/MW, MW (molecular weight) in kDa.","With the aim of improving ligand efficiency, cap group size was reduced while maintaining potency and selectivity. Table 3 shows that indole, 2-methylindole, and 3-methylindole cap groups had a potency at the target under 10 nM, while maintaining high HDAC6 selectivity. BEI was higher for the indole capped compounds compared to Tubastatin. Substitution at the indole 3\u2032 position with ethyldimethylamine or benzyl did not enhance potency at HDAC6 relative to the 2\u2032-unsubstituted indole. Notably, the benzoyl substituted compound had very low activity at HDAC1, below the cutoff value for the assay. The importance of rigidity in the cap group also was investigated through synthesis of compound 55. The diphenylamine cap group of compound 55 is not locked in a planar conformation. The diphenylamine capped compound 55 in Table 3 was more potent and selective compared to an analogous carbazole compound.","Table 3 also shows that the indole and the diphenylamine cap had reduced HDAC8 activity relative to Tubastatin. For compounds to be especially useful as molecular probes of HDAC6 activity, the activity at HDAC8 should be minimized. The diphenylamine capped compound was greatly enhanced in this respect, with over 500-fold selectivity for HDAC6 vs HDAC8 Likewise, the 2-methyl and 3-methylindole cap groups had greater selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC8 compared to Tubastatin.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0460","num":"0460"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"HDAC6 Inhibitors Featuring an Indole Scaffold."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"HDAC1 ","HDAC6 ","HDAC8 ",{}]},{"entry":[{},"IC(\u03bcM)","IC(\u03bcM)","IC(\u03bcM)","BEI"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Tubastatin","16.4 \u00b1 2.6\u2002","0.015 \u00b1 0.001","0.854 \u00b1 0.040","23.3"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00157","num":"00157"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00157","he":"43.43mm","wi":"29.63mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00157.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"5.83 \u00b1 0.70","0.0097 \u00b1 0.0003","0.417 \u00b1 0.040","30.1"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00158","num":"00158"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00158","he":"43.52mm","wi":"35.22mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00158.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"5.34 \u00b1 0.16","0.0025 \u00b1 0.0004","0.397 \u00b1 0.099","30.7"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00159","num":"00159"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00159","he":"47.16mm","wi":"29.63mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00159.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"6.79 \u00b1 0.29","0.0051 \u00b1 0.0008","0.911 \u00b1 0.042","29.6"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00160","num":"00160"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00160","he":"49.28mm","wi":"40.56mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00160.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"5.86 \u00b1 1.19","0.013 \u00b1 0.002","0.422 \u00b1 0.044","23.4"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00161","num":"00161"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00161","he":"50.04mm","wi":"33.02mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00161.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},">30 ","0.035 \u00b1 0.003","NT","20.9"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00162","num":"00162"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00162","he":"48.01mm","wi":"37.25mm","file":"US09249087-20160202-C00162.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"6.66 \u00b1 0.51","0.0045 \u00b1 0.0004","2.38 \u00b1 0.25","26.3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Values are the mean of two experiments.

ICvalues were extracted by curve-fitting the dose\/response slopes. Assays performed by Reaction Biology Corp.","The present compounds have been evaluated for their activity at HDAC6 and their selectivity for HDAC6 compared to HDAC1. It previously was shown that selective HDAC6 inhibitors are implicated in a variety of disease states including, but not limited to, arthritis, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory disorders, cancer, neurological diseases such as Rett syndrome, peripheral neuropathies such as CMT, stroke, hypertension, and diseases in which oxidative stress is a causative factor or a result thereof. It also was shown that selective HDAC6 inhibitors, when administered in combination with rapamycin, prolonged the lifespan of mice with kidney xenografts. This model was used to evaluate the immunosuppressant properties of the present compounds and serve as a model of transplant rejection. Furthermore, it was previously shown that selective HDAC6 inhibitors confer neuroprotection in rat primary cortical neuron models of oxidative stress. These studies identified selective HDAC6 inhibitors as non-toxic neuroprotective agents. The present compounds behave in a similar manner because they also are selective HDAC6 agents. The present compounds demonstrate a ligand efficiency that renders them more drug-like in their physiochemical properties. In addition, the present compounds maintain the potency and selectivity observed in prior HDACIs.

Administration of a pharmaceutical composition, or a neat HDACI of the present invention, can be performed during or after the onset of the disease or condition of interest. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions are sterile, and contain no toxic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic compounds that would cause an adverse reaction when administered.","In many embodiments, a present HDACI is administered in conjunction with a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of a disease or condition wherein inhibition of HDAC provides a benefit. The second therapeutic agent is different from the present HDACI. A present HDACI and the second therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. In addition, a present HDACI and second therapeutic agent can be administered from a single composition or two separate compositions. A present HDACI and the second therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially to achieve the desired effect.","The second therapeutic agent is administered in an amount to provide its desired therapeutic effect.

Such cancers include, but are not limited to, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, Ewing's sarcoma, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, larynx cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharynx cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, rectal cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, or other CNS neoplasms.","In still another embodiment, the cancer being treated has demonstrated resistance to radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy or is known to be refractory to radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy. A cancer is refractory to a therapy when at least some significant portion of the cancer cells are not killed or their cell division is not arrested in response to therapy. Such a determination can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells, using the art-accepted meanings of \u201crefractory\u201d in such a context. In a specific embodiment, a cancer is refractory where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced or has increased.","Other cancers that can be treated with the compounds and methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, cancers and metastases selected from the group consisting of solid tumors, including but not limited to: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiornyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, oral cancer, nasal cancer, throat cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, lung cancer, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma multiforma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, skin cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma; blood-borne cancers, including but not limited to: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute monoblastic leukemia, acute erythroleukemic leukemia, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, acute myclomonocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocyctic leukemia, acute undifferentiated leukemia, chronic myclocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and multiple myeloma; acute and chronic leukemias: lymphoblastic, myelogenous lymphocytic, and myelocytic leukemias; lymphomas: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; multiple myeloma; Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia; heavy chain disease; and polycythemia vera.","The present HDACIs can also be administered to prevent progression to a neoplastic or malignant state, including but not limited to the cancers listed above. Such prophylactic use is indicated in conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer, in particular, where non-neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most particularly, dysplasia has occurred (for review of such abnormal growth conditions, see Robbins and Angell, 19762d Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 68-79). Hyperplasia is a form of controlled cell proliferation involving an increase in cell number in a tissue or organ, without significant alteration in structure or function. For example, endometrial hyperplasia often precedes endometrial cancer and precancerous colon polyps often transform into cancerous lesions. Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell. Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells. A typical metaplasia involves a somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium. Dysplasia is frequently a forerunner of cancer, and is found mainly in the epithelia; it is the most disorderly form of non-neoplastic cell growth, involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in the architectural orientation of cells. Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large, deeply stained nuclei, and exhibit pleomorphism. Dysplasia characteristically occurs where chronic irritation or inflammation exists, and often is found in the cervix, respiratory passages, oral cavity, and gall bladder.","Alternatively or in addition to the presence of abnormal cell growth characterized as hyperplasia, metaplasia, or dysplasia, the presence of one or more characteristics of a transformed phenotype, or of a malignant phenotype, displayed in vivo or displayed in vitro by a cell sample from a subject, can indicate the desirability of prophylactic\/therapeutic administration of the composition of the invention. Such characteristics of a transformed phenotype include, for example, morphology changes, looser substratum attachment, loss of contact inhibition, loss of anchorage dependence, protease release, increased sugar transport, decreased serum requirement, expression of fetal antigens, disappearance of the 250,000 dalton cell surface protein.","In a specific embodiment, leukoplakia, a benign-appearing hyperplastic or dysplastic lesion of the epithelium, or Bowen's disease, a carcinoma in situ, are pre-neoplastic lesions indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention.","In another embodiment, fibrocystic disease (cystic hyperplasia, mammary dysplasia, particularly adenosis (benign epithelial hyperplasia)) is indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention.","The prophylactic use of the compounds and methods of the present invention are also indicated in some viral infections that may lead to cancer. For example, human papilloma virus can lead to cervical cancer (see, e.g., Hernandez-Avila et al., (1997) 28:265-271), Epstein-Ban virus (EBV) can lead to lymphoma (see, e.g., Herrmann et al., (2003) 199(2):140-5), hepatitis B or C virus can lead to liver carcinoma (see, e.g., El-Serag, (2002) 35(5 Suppl 2):572-8), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I can lead to T-cell leukemia (see e.g., Mortreux et al., (2003) 17(1):26-38), human herpesvirus-8 infection can lead to Kaposi's sarcoma (see, e.g., Kadow et al., (2002) 3(11):1574-9), and Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) infection contribute to cancer development as a consequence of immunodeficiency (see, e.g., Dal Maso et al., (2003) 4(2):110-9).","In other embodiments, a subject exhibiting one or more of the following predisposing factors for malignancy can be treated by administration of the present HDACIs and methods of the invention: a chromosomal translocation associated with a malignancy (e.g., the Philadelphia chromosome for chronic myelogenous leukemia, t(14;18) for follicular lymphoma, etc.), familial polyposis or Gardner's syndrome (possible forerunners of colon cancer), benign monoclonal gammopathy (a possible forerunner of multiple myeloma), a first degree kinship with persons having a cancer or procancerous disease showing a Mendelian (genetic) inheritance pattern (e.g., familial polyposis of the colon, Gardner's syndrome, hereditary exostosis, polyendocrine adenomatosis, medullary thyroid carcinoma with amyloid production and pheochromocytoma, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, neurofibromatosis of Von Recklinghausen, retinoblastoma, carotid body tumor, cutaneous melanocarcinoma, intraocular melanocarcinoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, ataxia telangiectasia, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, albinism, Fanconi's aplastic anemia, and Bloom's syndrome; see Robbins and Angell, 19762d Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 112-113) etc.), and exposure to carcinogens (e.g., smoking, and inhalation of or contacting with certain chemicals).","In another specific embodiment, the present HDACIs and methods of the invention are administered to a human subject to prevent progression of breast, colon, ovarian, or cervical cancer.","In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating cancer comprising (a) administering to an individual in need thereof an amount of a present HDACI; and (b) administering to the individual one or more additional anticancer treatment modality including, but not limited to, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery or immunotherapy, such as a cancer vaccine. In one embodiment, the administering of step (a) is prior to the administering of step (b). In another embodiment, the administering of step (a) is subsequent to the administering of step (b). In still another embodiment, the administering of step (a) is concurrent with the administering of step (b).","In one embodiment, the additional anticancer treatment modality is radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy. In another embodiment, the additional anticancer treatment modality is surgery.","In still another embodiment, the additional anticancer treatment modality is immunotherapy, such as cancer vaccines.","In one embodiment, a present HDACI or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered adjunctively with the additional anticancer treatment modality.","In a preferred embodiment, the additional anticancer treatment modality is radiotherapy. In the methods of the present invention, any radiotherapy protocol can be used depending upon the type of cancer to be treated. Embodiments of the present invention employ electromagnetic radiation of: gamma-radiation (10to 10m), X-ray radiation (10to 10m), ultraviolet light (10 nm to 400 nm), visible light (400 nm to 700 nm), infrared radiation (700 nm to 1 mm), and microwave radiation (1 mm to 30 cm).","For example, but not by way of limitation, X-ray radiation can be administered; in particular, high-energy megavoltage (radiation of greater that 1 MeV energy) can be used for deep tumors, and electron beam and orthovoltage X-ray radiation can be used for skin cancers. Gamma-ray emitting radioisotopes, such as radioactive isotopes of radium, cobalt and other elements, can also be administered. Illustrative radiotherapy protocols useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, stereotactic methods where multiple sources of low dose radiation are simultaneously focused into a tissue volume from multiple angles; \u201cinternal radiotherapy,\u201d such as brachytherapy, interstitial irradiation, and intracavitary irradiation, which involves the placement of radioactive implants directly in a tumor or other target tissue; intraoperative irradiation, in which a large dose of external radiation is directed at the target tissue which is exposed during surgery; and particle beam radiotherapy, which involves the use of fast-moving subatomic particles to treat localized cancers.","Many cancer treatment protocols currently employ radiosensitizers activated by electromagnetic radiation, e.g., X-rays. Examples of X-ray-activated radiosensitizers include, but are not limited to, metronidazole, misonidazole, desmethylmisonidazole, pimonidazole, etanidazole, nimorazole, mitomycin C, RSU 1069, SR 4233, EO9, RB 6145, nicotinamide, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), bromodeoxycytidine, fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), hydroxyurea, cis-platin, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancers employs visible light as the radiation activator of the sensitizing agent. Examples of photodynamic radiosensitizers include the following, but are not limited to: hematoporphyrin derivatives, PHOTOFRIN\u00ae, benzoporphyrin derivatives, NPe6, tin etioporphyrin (SnET2), pheoborbide-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, naphthalocyanines, phthalocyanines, zinc phthalocyanine, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.","Radiosensitizers can be administered in conjunction with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds in addition to a present HDACI, such compounds including, but not limited to, compounds that promote the incorporation of radiosensitizers to the target cells, compounds that control the flow of therapeutics, nutrients, and\/or oxygen to the target cells, chemotherapeutic agents that act on the tumor with or without additional radiation, or other therapeutically effective compounds for treating cancer or other disease. Examples of additional therapeutic agents that can be used in conjunction with radiosensitizers include, but are not limited to, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, oxygen, carbogen, red cell transfusions, perfluorocarbons (e.g., FLUOSOLW\u00ae-DA), 2,3-DPG, BW12C, calcium channel blockers, pentoxifylline, antiangiogenesis compounds, hydralazine, and L-BSO.","In a preferred embodiment, a present HDACI or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered prior to the administration of radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy.","In another preferred embodiment, a present HDACI or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered adjunctively with radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy.","A present HDACI and additional treatment modalities can act additively or synergistically (i.e., the combination of a present HDACI or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an additional anticancer treatment modality is more effective than their additive effects when each are administered alone). A synergistic combination permits the use of lower dosages of a present HDACI and\/or the additional treatment modality and\/or less frequent administration of a present HDACI and\/or additional treatment modality to a subject with cancer. The ability to utilize lower dosages of a present HDACI and\/or an additional treatment modality and\/or to administer a compound of the invention and the additional treatment modality less frequently can reduce the toxicity associated with the administration without reducing the efficacy of a present HDACI and\/or the additional treatment modality in the treatment of cancer. In addition, a synergistic effect can result in the improved efficacy of the treatment of cancer and\/or the reduction of adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the administration of a present HDACI and\/or an additional anticancer treatment modality as monotherapy.","In one embodiment, the present HDACIs may act synergistically with radiotherapy when administered in doses typically employed when such HDACIs are used alone for the treatment of cancer. In another embodiment, the present HDACIs may act synergistically with radiotherapy when administered in doses that are less than doses typically employed when such HDACIs are used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer.","In one embodiment, radiotherapy may act synergistically with a present HDACI when administered in doses typically employed when radiotherapy is used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In another embodiment, radiotherapy may act synergistically with a compound of the invention when administered in doses that are less than doses typically employed when radiotherapy is used as monotherapy for the treatment of cancer.","The effectiveness of the HDACIs as HDAC inhibitors for sensitizing cancer cells to the effect of radiotherapy can be determined by the in vitro and\/or in vivo determination of post-treatment survival using techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, for in vitro determinations, exponentially growing cells can be exposed to known doses of radiation, and the survival of the cells monitored. Irradiated cells are plated and cultured for about 14- about 21 days, and the colonies are stained. The surviving fraction is the number of colonies divided by the plating efficiency of unirradiated cells. Graphing the surviving fraction on a log scale versus the absorbed dose on a linear scale generates a survival curve. Survival curves generally show an exponential decrease in the fraction of surviving cells at higher radiation doses after an initial shoulder region in which the dose is sublethal. A similar protocol can be used for chemical agents when used in the combination therapies of the invention.","Inherent radiosensitivity of tumor cells and environmental influences, such as hypoxia and host immunity, can be further assessed by in vivo studies. The growth delay assay is commonly used. This assay measures the time interval required for a tumor exposed to radiation to regrow to a specified volume. The dose required to control about 50% of tumors is determined by the TCDassay.","In vivo assay systems typically use transplantable solid tumor systems in experimental subjects. Radiation survival parameters for normal tissues as well as for tumors can be assayed using in vivo methods known in the art.","The present invention provides methods of treating cancers comprising the administration of an effective amount of a present HDACI in conjunction with recognized methods of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapies, including, for example, chemical-based mimics of radiotherapy whereby a synergistic enhancement of the effectiveness of the recognized therapy is achieved. The effectiveness of a treatment can be measured in clinical studies or in model systems, such as a tumor model in mice, or cell culture sensitivity assays.","The present invention provides combination therapies that result in improved effectiveness and\/or reduced toxicity. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention relates to the use of the present HDACIs as radiosensitizers in conjunction with radiotherapy.","When the combination therapy of the invention comprises administering a present HDACI with one or more additional anticancer agents, the present HDACI and the additional anticancer agents can be administered concurrently or sequentially to an individual. The agents can also be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of one or more anticancer agents for a period of time, followed by the administration of one or more different anticancer agents for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration, i.e., the cycle, in order to reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the anticancer agents of being administered, to avoid or reduce the side effects of one or more of the anticancer agents being administered, and\/or to improve the efficacy of the treatment.","An additional anticancer agent may be administered over a series of sessions; anyone or a combination of the additional anticancer agents listed below may be administered.","The present invention includes methods for treating cancer comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a present HDACI and one or more additional anticancer agents or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

In another embodiment, a present HDACI is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent(s).","In the present methods for treating cancer the other therapeutic agent may be an antiemetic agent. Suitable antiemetic agents include, but are not limited to, metoclopromide, domperidone, prochlorperazine, promethazine, chlorpromazine, trimethobenzamide, ondansetron, granisetron, hydroxyzine, acethylleucine monoethanolamine, alizapride, azasetron, benzquinamide, bietanautine, bromopride, buclizine, clebopride, cyclizine, dimenhydrinate, diphenidol, dolasetron, meclizine, methallatal, metopimazine, nabilone, oxyperndyl, pipamazine, scopolamine, sulpiride, tetrahydrocannabinols, thiethylperazine, thioproperazine, and tropisetron.","In a preferred embodiment, the antiemetic agent is granisetron or ondansetron. In another embodiment, the other therapeutic agent may be an hematopoietic colony stimulating factor. Suitable hematopoietic colony stimulating factors include, but are not limited to, filgrastim, sargramostim, molgramostim, and epoietin alfa.","In still another embodiment, the other therapeutic agent may be an opioid or non-opioid analgesic agent. Suitable opioid analgesic agents include, but are not limited to, morphine, heroin, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, metopon, apomorphine, normorphine, etorphine, buprenorphine, meperidine, lopermide, anileridine, ethoheptazine, piminidine, betaprodine, diphenoxylate, fentanil, sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, levorphanol, dextromethorphan, phenazocine, pentazocine, cyclazocine, methadone, isomethadone, and propoxyphene.

Suitable anxiolytic agents include, but are not limited to, buspirene, and benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, oxazapam, chlorazepate, clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam.","In addition to treating cancers and sensitizing a cancer cell to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the present HDACIs are used in methods of treating diseases, conditions, and injuries to the central nervous system, such as neurological diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). In preferred embodiments, a present HDACI is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier to inhibit HDAC in the brain of the individual.","It has been shown that HDAC6 inhibition protects against neuronal degeneration and stimulates neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion neurons, therefore indicating methods of treating CNS diseases. Accordingly, present HDACI compounds were examined in a model of oxidative stress induced by homocysteic acid (HCA). This model leads to depletion of glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant. HDAC6 inhibition rescues neuronal death in this model, possibly by causing hyperacetylation of peroxiredoxins. Previous work reported that nonselective, hydroxamic acid HDACIs displayed considerable toxicity to the primary cortical neurons. (A. P. Kozikowski et al., 2007, 50, 3054-61.)","In the HCA-induced neurodegeneration assays, TSA was moderately neuroprotective at 0.5 \u03bcM, although protection declined at higher concentrations due to dose-dependant neurotoxicity (). Compounds of the present invention displayed dose-dependent protection against HCA-induced neuronal cell death starting at 10 \u03bcM with near complete protection at 10 \u03bcM (). This compares well with published results showing that Tubacin induces \u03b1-tubulin acetylation at 5 \u03bcM and protects prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced death at 8 \u03bcM via peroxiredoxin acetylation. (R. B. Parmigiani et al., 2008, 105, 9633-8.) Importantly, when tested at all of the concentrations shown, the present HDACI compounds exhibited no toxicity, indicating that neurotoxicity is likely a product of class I HDAC inhibition, and not a property inherent to hydroxamic acids. These results demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition provides a method for treating neurodegenerative conditions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0522","num":"0522"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},"The data summarized in  was obtained according to the following neuroprotective assay. Primary cortical neuron cultures were obtained from the cerebral cortex of fetal Sprague-Dawley rats (embryonic day 17). All experiments were initiated 24 hours after plating. Under these conditions, the cells are not susceptible to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. For cytotoxicity studies, cells were rinsed with warm PBS, then placed in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 5.5 g\/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 \u03bcM cystine. Oxidative stress was induced by the addition of the glutamate analog homocysteate (HCA; 5 mM) to the media. HCA was diluted from 100-fold concentrated solutions that were adjusted to pH 7.5. In combination with HCA, neurons were treated with either TSA or a present HDACI compound at the indicated concentrations. Viability was assessed after 24 hours by the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method.","The present HDACI compounds also provide a therapeutic benefit in models of peripheral neuropathies, such as CMT. HDAC6 inhibitors have been found to cross the blood nerve barrier and rescue the phenotype observed in transgenic mice exhibiting symptoms of distal hereditary motor neuropathy. Administration of HDAC6 inhibitors to symptomatic mice increased acetylated \u03b1-tubulin levels, restored proper mitochondrial motility and axonal transport, and increased muscle re-innervation. Other peripheral neuropathies include, but are not limited to, giant axonal neuropathy and various forms of mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies, autonomic neuropathies, and neuritis.","The present HDACI compounds also ameliorate associative memory loss following A\u03b2 elevation. In this test, mice were infused with A\u03b242 via cannulas implanted into dorsal hippocampus 15 minutes prior to training. The test compounds are dosed ip (25 mg\/kg) 2 hours before training. Fear learning was assessed 24 hours later.","Contextual fear conditioning performed 24 hours after training shows a reduction of freezing in A\u03b2-infused mice compared to vehicle-infused mice. Treatment with a present compound ameliorates deficit in freezing responses in A\u03b2-infused mice, and has no effect in vehicle-infused mice. A test compound alone does not affect the memory performance of the mice. In addition, treatment had no effects on motor, sensorial, or motivational skills assessed using the visible platform test in which the compounds are injected twice a day for two days. During these experiments, no signs of overt toxicity, including changes in food and liquid intake, weight loss, or changes in locomotion and exploratory behavior, are observed.","These results demonstrate that the HDACIs of the present invention are beneficial against impairment of associative memory following A\u03b2 elevation.","The present HDACIs therefore are useful for treating a neurological disease by administration of amounts of a present HDACI effective to treat the neurological disease or by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising amounts of a present HDACI effective to treat the neurological disease. The neurological diseases that can be treated include, but are not limited to, Huntington's disease, lupus, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, dentatorubralpallidoluysian atrophy (DRRLA), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and fine spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3\/MJD (Machado-Joseph Disease), SCA6, and SCA7), drug-induced movement disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, cortico basal degeneration, dystonia, myoclonus, Tourette's syndrome, tremor, chorea, restless leg syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonian syndromes, anxiety, depression, psychosis, manic depression, Friedreich's ataxia, Fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular dystrophy, Rett syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Wilson's disease, multi-infarct state, CMT, GAN and other peripheral neuropathies.","In a preferred embodiment, the neurological disease treated is Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal muscular atrophy, lupus, or schizophrenia.","A present HDACI also can be used with a second therapeutic agent in methods of treating conditions, diseases, and injuries to the CNS. Such second therapeutic agents are those drugs known in the art to treat a particular condition, diseases, or injury, for example, but not limited to, lithium in the treatment of mood disorders, estradiol benzoate, and nicotinamide in the treatment of Huntington's disease.","The present HDACIs also are useful in the treatment of TBIs. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious and complex injury that occurs in approximately 1.4 million people each year in the United States. TBI is associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms and disabilities, including a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.","TBI produces a number of pathologies including axonal injury, cell death, contusions, and inflammation. The inflammatory cascade is characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and activation of microglia which can exacerbate other pathologies. Although the role of inflammation in TBI is well established, no efficacious anti-inflammatory therapies are currently available for the treatment of TBI.","Several known HDAC inhibitors have been found to be protective in different cellular and animal models of acute and chronic neurodegenerative injury and disease, for example, Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). A recent study in experimental pediatric TBI reported a decrease in hippocampal CA3 histone H3 acetylation lasting hours to days after injury. These changes were attributed to documented upstream excitotoxic and stress cascades associated with TBI. HDACIs also have been reported to have anti-inflammatory actions acting through acetylation of non-histone proteins. The HDAC6 selective inhibitor, 4-dimethylamino-N-[5-(2-mercaptoacetylamino)pentyl]benzamide (DMA-PB), was found to be able to increase histone H3 acetylation and reduce microglia inflammatory response following traumatic brain injury in rats, which demonstrates the utility of HDACIs as therapeutics for inhibiting neuroinflammation associated with TBI.","The present HDACIs therefore also are useful in the treatment of inflammation and strokes, and in the treatment of autism and autism spectrum disorders. The present HDACIs further can be used to treat parasitic infections, (e.g., malaria, toxoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, helminthiasis, protozoal infections (see Andrews et al. 2000, 30(6), 761-768).","In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention can be used to treat malaria. A present HDACI can be co-administered with an antimalarial compound selected from the group consisting of aryl amino alcohols, cinchona alkaloids, 4-aminoquinolines, type 1 or type 2 folate synthesis inhibitors, 8-aminoquinolines, antimicrobials, peroxides, naphthoquinones, and iron chelating agents.

In a preferred embodiment, the antimalarial compound is chloroquine.","The present HDACIs also can be used as imaging agents. In particular, by providing a radiolabeled, isotopically labeled, or fluorescently-labeled HDACI, the labeled compound can image HDACs, tissues expressing HDACs, and tumors. Labeled HDACIs of the present invention also can image patients suffering from a cancer, or other HDAC-mediated diseases, e.g., stroke, by administration of an effective amount of the labeled compound or a composition containing the labeled compound. In preferred embodiments, the labeled HDACI is capable of emitting positron radiation and is suitable for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Typically, a labeled HDACI of the present invention is used to identify areas of tissues or targets that express high concentrations of HDACs. The extent of accumulation of labeled HDACI can be quantified using known methods for quantifying radioactive emissions. In addition, the labeled HDACI can contain a fluorophore or similar reporter capable of tracking the movement of particular HDAC isoforms or organelles in vitro.","The present HDACIs useful in the imaging methods contain one or more radioisotopes capable of emitting one or more forms of radiation suitable for detection by any standard radiology equipment, such as PET, SPECT, gamma cameras, MRI, and similar apparatus. Preferred isotopes including tritium (H) and carbon (C). Substituted HDACIs of the present invention also can contain isotopes of fluorine (F) and iodine (I) for imaging methods. Typically, a labeled HDACI of the present invention contains an alkyl group having a C label, i.e., a C-methyl group, or an alkyl group substituted with F, I, I, I, or a combination thereof.","Fluorescently-labeled HDACIs of the present invention also can be used in the imaging method of the present invention. Such compounds have an FITC, carbocyamine moiety or other fluorophore which will allow visualization of the HDAC proteins in vitro.","The labeled HDACIs and methods of use can be in vivo, and particularly on humans, and for in vitro applications, such as diagnostic and research applications, using body fluids and cell samples. Imaging methods using a labeled HDACI of the present invention are discussed in WO 03\/060523, designating the U.S. and incorporated in its entirety herein. Typically, the method comprises contacting cells or tissues with a radiolabeled, isotopically labeled, fluorescently labeled, or tagged (such as biotin tagged) compound of the invention, and making a radiographic, fluorescent, or similar type of image depending on the visualization method employed, i.e., in regard to radiographic images, a sufficient amount to provide about 1 to about 30 mCi of the radiolabeled compound.","Preferred imaging methods include the use of labeled HDACIs of the present invention which are capable of generating at least a 2:1 target to background ratio of radiation intensity, or more preferably about a 5:1, about 10:1, or about 15:1 ratio of radiation intensity between target and background.","In preferred methods, the labeled HDACIs of the present invention are excreted from tissues of the body quickly to prevent prolonged exposure to the radiation of the radiolabeled compound administered to the individual. Typically, labeled HDACIs of the present invention are eliminated from the body in less than about 24 hours. More preferably, labeled HDACIs are eliminated from the body in less than about 16 hours, 12 hours, 8 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, 90 minutes, or 60 minutes. Typically, preferred labeled HDACIs are eliminated in about 60 to about 120 minutes.","In addition to isotopically labeled and fluorescently labeled derivatives, the present invention also embodies the use of derivatives containing tags (such as biotin) for the identification of biomolecules associated with the HDAC isoforms of interest for diagnostic, therapeutic or research purposes.","The present HDACIs also are useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and inflammations. Compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in overcoming graft and transplant rejections and in treating forms of arthritis.","Despite successes of modern transplant programs, the nephrotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia associated with current therapeutic regimens, plus the incidence of post-transplant malignancies and graft loss from chronic rejection, drive efforts to achieve long-term allograft function in association with minimal immunosuppression Likewise, the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasing. Animal studies have shown that T regulatory cells (Tregs) expressing the forkhead transcription family member, Foxp3, are key to limiting autoreactive and alloreactive immunity. Moreover, after their induction by costimulation blockade, immunosuppression, or other strategies, Tregs may be adoptively transferred to na\u00efve hosts to achieve beneficial therapeutic effects. However, attempts to develop sufficient Tregs that maintain their suppressive functions post-transfer in clinical trials have failed. Murine studies show that HDACIs limit immune responses, at least in significant part, by increasing Treg suppressive functions, (R. Tao et al., 13, 1299-1307, (2007)), and that selective targeting of HDAC6 is especially efficacious in this regard.","With organ transplantation, rejection begins to develop in the days immediately post-transplant, such that prevention rather than treatment of rejection is a paramount consideration. The reverse applies in autoimmunity, wherein a patient presents with the disease already causing problems. Accordingly, HDAC6\u2212\/\u2212 mice treated for 14 days with low-dose RPM (rapamycin) are assessed for displaying signs of tolerance induction and resistance to the development of chronic rejection, a continuing major loss of graft function long-term in the clinical transplant population. Tolerance is assessed by testing whether mice with long-surviving allografts reject a subsequent third-party cardiac graft and accept additional donor allografts without any immunosuppression, as can occur using a non-selective HDACI plus RPM. These in vivo sutides are accompanied by assessment of ELISPOT and MLR activities using recipient lymphocytes challenged with donor cells. Protection against chronic rejection is assessed by analysis of host anti-donor humoral responses and analysis of graft transplant arteriosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in long-surviving allograft recipients.","The importance of HDAC6 targeting is assessed in additional transplant models seeking readouts of biochemical significance, as is monitored clinically. Thus, the effects of HDAC6 in targeting in renal transplant recipients (monitoring BUN, proteinuria) and islet allografts (monitoring blood glucose levels) are assessed. Renal transplants are the most common organ transplants performed, and the kidney performs multiple functions, e.g., regulating acid\/base metabolism, blood pressure, red cell production, such that efficacy in this model indicates the utility of HDAC6 targeting. Likewise, islet transplantation is a major unmet need given that clinical islet allografts are typically lost after the first one or two years post-transplant. Having a safe and non-toxic means to extend islet survival without maintenance CNI therapy would be an important advance. Transplant studies also are strengthened by use of mice with floxed HDAC6. Using existing Foxp3-Cre mice, for example, the effects of deletion of HDAC6 just in Tregs is tested. This approach can be extended to targeting of HDAC6 in T cells (CD4-Cre) and dendritic cells (CD11c-Cre), for example. Using tamoxifen-regulated Cre, the importance of HDAC6 in induction vs. maintenance of transplants (with implications for short-term vs. maintenance HDAC6I therapy) is assessed by administering tamoxifen and inducing HDAC6 deletion at varying periods post-transplant.","Studies of autoimmunity also are undertaken. In this case, interruption of existing disease is especially important and HDAC6 targeting can be efficacious without any requirement for additional therapy (in contrast to a need for brief low-dose RPM in the very aggressive, fully MHC-mismatched transplant models). Studies in mice with colitis indicated that HDAC6\u2212\/\u2212 Tregs were more effective than WT Tregs in regulating disease, and tubacin was able to rescue mice if treatment was begun once colitis had developed. These studies are extended by assessing whether deletion of HDAC6 in Tregs (Foxp3\/Cre) vs. T cells (CD4=Cre) vs. DC (CD11c-Cre) differentially affect the development and severity of colitis. Similarly, control of colitis is assessed by inducing HDAC6 deletion at varying intervals after the onset of colitis with tamoxifen-regulated Cre.","The present compounds are envisioned to demonstrate anti-arthritic efficacy in a collagen-induced arthritis model in DBA1\/J mice. In this test, DBA1\/J mice (male, 7-8 weeks) are used, with 8 animals per group. Systemic arthritis is induced with bovine collagen type II and CFA, plus an IFA booster injection on day 21. A present HDACI is dosed at 50 mg\/kg and 100 mg\/kg on day 28 for 2 consecutive weeks, and the effects determined from the Average Arthritic Score vs. Days of Treatment data.","Despite efforts to avoid graft rejection through host-donor tissue type matching, in the majority of transplantation procedures, immunosuppressive therapy is critical to the viability of the donor organ in the host. A variety of immunosuppressive agents have been employed in transplantation procedures, including azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, FK-506, rapamycin, and corticosteroids.","The present HDACIs are potent immunosuppressive agents that suppress humoral immunity and cell-mediated immune reactions, such as allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, Freund's adjuvant arthritis and graft versus host disease. HDACIs of the present invention are useful for the prophylaxis of organ rejection subsequent to organ transplantation, for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, for the treatment of psoriasis, and for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, Crohn's disease, and lupus.","A therapeutically effective amount of a present HDACI can be used for immunosuppression including, for example, to prevent organ rejection or graft vs. host disease, and to treat diseases and conditions, in particular, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and conditions.

These disease and conditions also can be treated by a method of the present invention.","In the present method, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more HDACI of the present invention, typically formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical practice, is administered to a human being in need thereof. Whether such a treatment is indicated depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) that takes into consideration signs, symptoms, and\/or malfunctions that are present, the risks of developing particular signs, symptoms and\/or malfunctions, and other factors.","A present HDACI can be administered by any suitable route, for example by oral, buccal, inhalation, topical, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, intracisternal or intrathecal through lumbar puncture, transurethral, nasal, percutaneous, i.e., transdermal, or parenteral (including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracoronary, intradermal, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and\/or surgical implantation at a particular site) administration. Parenteral administration can be accomplished using a needle and syringe or using a high pressure technique.","Pharmaceutical compositions include those wherein a present HDACI is present in a sufficient amount to be administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose.

Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide levels of a present HDACI that is sufficient to maintain therapeutic effects.","Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the present HDACI compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio between LDand ED. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from such procedures can be used in formulating a dosage range for use in humans. The dosage preferably lies within a range of circulating compound concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, and the route of administration utilized. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.","A therapeutically effective amount of a present HDACI required for use in therapy varies with the nature of the condition being treated, the length of time that activity is desired, and the age and the condition of the patient, and ultimately is determined by the attendant physician.

When administered in liquid form, the composition contains about 0.1% to about 90%, and preferably about 1% to about 50%, by weight, of a present compound.","When a therapeutically effective amount of a present HDACI is administered by intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection, the composition is in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable solutions, having due regard to pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art. A preferred composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection typically contains an isotonic vehicle. A present HDACI can be infused with other fluids over a 10-30 minute span or over several hours.","The present HDACIs can be readily combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well-known in the art. Such carriers enable the active agents to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding a present HDACI to a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers and cellulose preparations. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added.","A present HDACI can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing, and\/or dispersing agents.","Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active agent in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of a present HDACI can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils or synthetic fatty acid esters. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension. Optionally, the suspension also can contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, a present composition can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.","A present HDACI also can be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases. In addition to the formulations described previously, a present HDACI also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, a present HDACI can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins.","In particular, a present HDACI can be administered orally, buccally, or sublingually in the form of tablets containing excipients, such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules, either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. Such liquid preparations can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as suspending agents. The present HDACIs also can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intracoronarily. For parenteral administration, the present HDACIs are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which can contain other substances, for example, salts or monosaccharides, such as mannitol or glucose, to make the solution isotonic with blood.","As an additional embodiment, the present invention includes kits which comprise one or more compounds or compositions packaged in a manner that facilitates their use to practice methods of the invention. In one simple embodiment, the kit includes a compound or composition described herein as useful for practice of a method (e.g., a composition comprising a present HDACI and an optional second therapeutic agent), packaged in a container, such as a sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the kit that describes use of the compound or composition to practice the method of the invention. Preferably, the compound or composition is packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit further can include a device suitable for administering the composition according to the intended route of administration, for example, a syringe, drip bag, or patch. In another embodiment, the present compounds is a lyophilate. In this instance, the kit can further comprise an additional container which contains a solution useful for the reconstruction of the lyophilate.","Prior HDACIs possessed properties that hindered their development as therapeutic agents. In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, the present HDACIs were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors for HDAC. The present compounds demonstrate an increased HDAC6 potency and selectivity against HDAC1 and HDAC8 with improvements in BEI relative to prior compounds. The improved properties of the present compounds, particularly the increase in BEI and reduced potency at HDAC8, indicate that the present compounds are useful for applications such as, but not limited to, immunosuppressive and neuroprotective agents. For example, compounds of the present invention typically have a bonding affinity (IC) to HDAC6 of less than 100 \u03bcM, less than 25 \u03bcM, less than 10 \u03bcM, less than 1 \u03bcM, less than 0.5 \u03bcM, and less than 0.2 \u03bcM."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
