All of these applications are incorporated herein by this reference.","The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of N00019-02-C-3003 awarded by the United States Navy.","This invention relates generally to gas turbine engines and more particularly to variable stator vane assemblies for use in such engines.","Gas turbine engines operate by combusting a fuel source in compressed air to create heated gases with increased pressure and density. The heated gases are ultimately forced through an exhaust nozzle, which is used to step up the velocity of the exiting gases and in-turn produce thrust for driving an aircraft. The heated gases are also used to drive a turbine for rotating a fan to provide air to a compressor section of the gas turbine engine. Additionally, the heated gases are used to drive a turbine for driving rotor blades inside the compressor section, which provides the compressed air used during combustion. The compressor section of a gas turbine engine typically comprises a series of rotor blade and stator vane stages. At each stage, rotating blades push air past the stationary vanes. Each rotor\/stator stage increases the pressure and density of the air. Stators serve two purposes: they convert the kinetic energy of the air into pressure, and they redirect the trajectory of the air coming off the rotors for flow into the next compressor stage.","The speed range of an aircraft powered by a gas turbine engine is directly related to the level of air pressure generated in the compressor section. For different aircraft speeds, the velocity of the airflow through the gas turbine engine varies. Thus, the incidence of the air onto rotor blades of subsequent compressor stages differs at different aircraft speeds. One way of achieving more efficient performance of the gas turbine engine over the entire speed range, especially at high speed\/high pressure ranges, is to use variable stator vanes which can optimize the incidence of the airflow onto subsequent compressor stage rotors.","Variable stator vanes are typically circumferentially arranged between an outer diameter fan case and an inner diameter vane shroud. Traditionally, mechanisms coordinating the synchronized movement of the variable stator vanes have been located on the outside of the fan case. These systems increase the overall diameter of the compressor section, which is not always desirable or permissible. Also, retrofitting gas turbine engines that use stationary stator vanes for use with variable stator vanes is not always possible. Retrofit variable vane mechanisms positioned on the outside of the fan case interfere with other external components of the gas turbine engine located on the outside of the fan case. Relocating these other external components is often impossible or too costly. Synchronizing mechanisms also add considerable weight to the gas turbine engine. Thus, there is a need for a lightweight variable vane synchronizing mechanism that does not increase the diameter of the compressor section and does not interfere with other external components of the gas turbine engine.","The present invention is related to a variable vane mechanism for use with a gas turbine engine. The variable vane mechanism comprises a variable vane, an inner diameter shroud and a synchronizing mechanism. The variable vane comprises a vane body and an inner diameter trunnion extending radially inwardly from the vane body. The shroud comprises a shroud body, a socket extending into the shroud body for receiving the inner diameter trunnion and a synchronizing channel extending through the inner diameter shroud aft of the socket so as to be bounded by the shroud body and opening to the socket. The synchronizing mechanism is disposed inside the synchronizing channel and connects to the inner diameter trunnion. In another embodiment, the variable vane includes a button connected to the inner diameter trunnion and displaced radially inwardly from the inner diameter trunnion, and the shroud includes a flange extending into the socket for engaging the button and inhibiting radial movement of the variable vane.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","16","18","14","20","22","24","20","22","24","20","24"]},"Variable vane array  is comprised of drive vanes  and a plurality of follower vanes . Drive vanes  and follower vanes  are connected inside inner diameter vane shroud  by the synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism of the present invention. Thus, when actuator  rotates drive vanes , follower vanes  rotate a like amount.","Typically, follower vanes  encircle the entirety of vane shroud . Only a portion of variable vane array  is shown so that sockets  can be seen. Drive vanes  and follower vanes  are rotatably mounted at the outer diameter of stator vane section  in fan case , and at the inner diameter of stator vane section  in vane shroud . The number of drive vanes  varies in other embodiments and can be as few as one. In one embodiment, variable vane array  includes fifty-two follower vanes  and two drive vanes . Drive vanes  are similar in construction to follower vanes . In one embodiment, drive vanes  are of heavy duty construction to withstand forces applied by actuator .","Inner diameter vane shroud  can be constructed in component sizes less than the entire circumference of inner diameter vane shroud. In one embodiment, as shown in , forward vane shroud component  is made of sections approximately one sixth (i.e. 60 degrees) of the circumference of inner diameter vane shroud . In such a case, two sections have nine half-sockets  and one section has eight half-sockets . Smaller forward vane shroud components  assist in positioning forward vane shroud component  under the inner diameter ends of drive vanes  and follower vanes  when they are inserted in sockets . In one embodiment for use in split fan case designs, aft shroud component  is made of sections approximately one half (i.e. 180 degrees) the circumference of inner diameter vane shroud , in which case each section has twenty six half-sockets . The synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism of the present invention is constructed in smaller segments, such as approximately one half (i.e. 180 degrees) segments, for use in split fan case designs. Additionally, in other embodiments, forward vane shroud component  and aft vane shroud component  can be made as full rings (i.e. 360 degrees), along with synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism, for use in full ring fan case designs.","Stator vane section  is typically located in a compressor section of a gas turbine engine downstream of, or behind, a rotor blade section. Air is forced into stator vane section  by a preceding rotor blade section or by a fan. The air that passes through stator vane section  typically passes on to an additional rotor blade section. Drive vanes  and follower vanes  rotate along their respective radial positions in order to control the flow of air through the compressor section of the gas turbine engine. The synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism of the present invention coordinates their rotation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["16","12","14","26","28","24","14","26","28","12","3","3","14","28","24","20","22","24","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3","14","24","14","20","22","24","30","32","20","20","20","20","22","22","22","22","24","24","24","24","30","34","36","37","38","40","42","28","44","46","48","50"]},"Locking insert  is secured inside of fastener channel . Trunnion hoop  of vane arm  is inserted over vane arm post . Button  is secured around the head of fastener . Fastener  is then inserted into fastener channel  and threaded into locking insert . Button  forces trunnion hoop  against trunnion  and secures it around vane arm post . In one embodiment, vane arm post  and trunnion hoop  have a square profile such that when trunnion hoop  is inserted around vane arm post  they cannot rotate relative to one another. Follower vane A, vane arm , fastener  and button  are installed into fan case . This process is repeated for all follower vanes  and drive vanes . Bumper  is positioned on a lower surface of synch ring  to assist synch ring  in maintaining a circular path through inner channel . Synch ring  is positioned inside of aft shroud component . Aft shroud component , along with synch ring , is then positioned against trunnions . Pin  is positioned through clearance hole , and into pin hole , securely fastening vane arm  to lug . Pin  is tight fitting in lug  and vane arm  is allowed to pivot at pin . The plurality of follower vanes  and drive vanes  of variable vane array  are linked to synch ring  in similar fashion.","Forward shroud component  is positioned against aft shroud component  such that socket A fits around button . Button  is used to pivotably secure follower vane A inside socket A. Forward shroud component  is fastened to aft shroud component  as is known in the art.","During operation of synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism, actuator  rotates drive vanes . Vane arms  of drive vanes  are likewise rotated about trunnion . Synch ring  is pushed by vane arms  of drive vanes  and rotates inside inner channel . Synch ring  thereby pulls vane arms  connected to follower vanes , which in turn rotates follower vanes  the same amount that drive vanes  are rotated by actuator . Thus, the direction of the flow of air exiting stator vane section  can be controlled for entry into the next section of the gas turbine engine utilizing the synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism.","The synch ring variable vane synchronizing mechanism of the present invention can be constructed in smaller segments. In one embodiment, synch ring  is divided into first and second segments for use in split fan case designs.","While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment(s), it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment(s) disclosed, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
