title: In-situ calibration of radar frequency measurement
abstract: Frequency calibration of a bi-static type of radar system is performed by positioning radar transmitter and receiver in spaced relation to each other over a targeted seawater surface from which radar radiation along a forward radiation scattering path is reflected toward the receiver while radar energy is also radiated along a direct path to the receiver by-passing the seawater during sequential frequency measurement tests to determine a frequency diffraction factor. A radiation blocking barrier is positioned by a floating support at a reflection location at an angular position on the seawater surface for intersection by the forward scattering path to block reflection of radar energy radiation toward the receiver during one of the measurement tests.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to calibration of frequency measurement of radiation from a bi-static forward radiation scattering type of radar system.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","During operation of a radar system over a targeted radiation reflective surface such as terrain or seawater, the radar energy emitted from the transmitter is reflected from the targeted surface along a forward scattering path toward the receiver. The radar energy is also directly transmitted to the receiver along a line-of-sight path. Typically radar frequency measurement is calibrated for a mono-static type of radar system, wherein the targeted surface is illuminated by the emitted radar energy radiation a known distance from the transmitter and the collocated receiver. Such measurement calibration is however difficult to perform for a bi-static type of radar system, especially when the target surface is close by, because the radar radiation when impinging on the targeted surface it is scattered so as to corrupt the measurement calibration process. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to facilitate radar frequency calibration for the bi-static type of radar system.","Pursuant to the present invention, a radiation reflection blocker is positioned on a targeted surface within the target region before initiating a frequency measurement for a bi-static type of radar system, with forward radiation scattering thereby eliminated. The blocker is then removed during a following measurement test involving vertical adjustment of the receiver of the bi-static radar system in order to determine a diffraction correction factor to be utilized with the previously performed measurement so as to obtain a fully calibrated frequency measurement through a calculator.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a target region  on top of a body of seawater  on which a targeted surface  is positioned underlying a bi-static type of radar system  located above the targeted surface  on some support structure such as a bridge. A radar transmitter  and a receiver  are associated with the system , are located in spaced relation to each other so as to establish the target region  therebetween on the seawater surface . The transmitter  and receiver  are furthermore angularly positioned so that during a first initial radiation frequency measurement test, radiation energy is forwardly emitted from the transmitter  along a direct path  to the receiver  and along a radiation scattering path  to a radar bounce reflection point  on the targeted surface  within the region .","Pursuant to the present invention, as shown in  a radar radiation blocker  is positioned by a float support  on the targeted seawater surface  over the reflection point  after completion of the initial frequency measurement test as shown in . The blocker  is positioned at an angle , such as 30\u00b0, so as to be intersected by the forward radiation scattering path  to thereby block reflection onto the receiver . The blocker  is formed from a rectangular barrier plate  having a radar absorbing rim (RAM)  on top and sides thereof as shown in , so as to effectively mask the radar radiation energy radiated along the interrupted path  as shown in . A strong radar energy field is accordingly applied exclusively along the direct path  to the receiver  during performance of a second frequency calibration measurement test.","After completion of the second calibration measurement test, the blocker  is removed from the targeted surface  so that a third scattering measurement test may be performed with the radar radiation transmitted along the path  being reflected from the targeted surface  at the reflection point  for determination of a diffraction correction factor from frequency variation data extracted from the receiver , as reflected by the graph shown in .","Heretofore calibration of the radar system  from frequency measurement tests was corrupted because of the amplitude of the frequency variations associated with an interference pattern  as shown in . The peak frequency amplitude of the interference pattern  caused by radiation scattering is however substantially reduced pursuant to the present invention by vertical shift adjustment  of the receiver  within a transition distance as denoted in . Selection of a maximum interference peak amplitude is thereby effected with respect to the forward scattering interference field undergoing the measurement test, from which the diffraction correction factor is determined by comparison with a theoretical peak frequency amplitude. Upon such determination thereof, the diffraction correction factor is utilized to obtain full frequency calibration of the radar system  pursuant to the process diagrammed in .","The calibration process involves positioning  of the blocker , as denoted in , before a frequency measurement test  is performed as generally known in the art. When the blocker  is thereafter removed, another test  is performed through which a frequency diffraction measurement  is obtained for use together with data output from the test  for determination of the diffraction correction factor , which is combined with the data output from the test  to provide full calibration  with respect to the bi-static radar system .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
