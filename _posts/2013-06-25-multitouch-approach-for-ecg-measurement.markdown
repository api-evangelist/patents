title: Multi-touch approach for ECG measurement
abstract: An ECG measurement approach for any multi-touch screens comprises the following steps: 1) display ECG on the screen; 2) use two fingers to touch the screen and the two touch points have two vertically projected points on the actual ECG waves; 3) draw the horizontal and vertical baselines to show the x interval in milliseconds and y interval in microvolt; 4) move any one or both of the two fingers touch points on the screen, the projected points and the horizontal/vertical baselines updated synchronously, as well as the measurements; 5) measure the different part of the ECG waves using this approach, including the wave top points, wave beginning and ending points. This approach can be used as a measurement tool to any graphs of functions over time displayed on the multi-touch screen, like EEG.

After numberious of clickings on the wave top point, wave beginning and wave ending points with PC mouse, all clicked point coordinates are saved and calculated. The present invention discloses a method to use touch screen which replaces the clicks with PC mouse which does not use the screen touch feature for ECG measurement.","Neither the traditional measure approach using rulers, nor the mouse clicking and draging based approach, is user-friendly to yield accurate measurement for ECG.","In the prior art, there is no similar application on touch-screen devices as disclosed in the present invention, while the traditional mouse based approach can be not applied for the widely used touch screen devices in the field of ECG measurement. The present invention reveals a novel process of ECG measurement with a touch screen device.","The subject of the invention is to implement a novel process to measure ECG waves with a touch screen device by using multi-touch feature, which can yield horizontal interval and vertical interval between two touch points. This approach solves a long-desired problem which the ECG waves cannot be accurately measured with traditional approaches on display screens.","To implement the approach by using multi touches on screen comprises the following steps:\n\n","According to above steps of the measurement, the projected target points are based on the actual touch point coordinates on the screen, which is read with a gesture API provided by an operation system of a touch screen device.","According to the step 2 of above process of measurement of ECG, the way to get the target measurement points is that the assumed (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the 2 actual touch point coordinates, x1 and x2 are divided by pixelsPerPoint (pixels per point on screen), get n1 and n2 as the point index, respectively, through which we can read the voltage value on the y axis from the array voltage[ ]: v1 and v2 . Coordinates (n1, v1 ) and (n2, v2 ) are the target points projected on x axis and y axis. The two target points are drawn on the screen, we shall convert them into the pixels per point.","According to the step 3 of above process of measurement of ECG, the x interval and y interval are calculated as following:\n\nX interval is ((n2\u2212n1)\/sample)\u00d71000\n\n","According to the step 4 of above process of measurement of ECG, the measurement is synchronously performed while the finger touch points are moved.","This invention further discloses the specific steps to implement the approach on an iOS device. The API is UIPinchGestureRecognizer class in iOS. The two actual touch point coordinates on screen are generated by UIPinchGestureRecognizer:\n\n","Following equations are used to calculate x1 and x2 wherrein x1 is a left point:\n\nInt 1=self.touch1.>=self.touch2.?self.touch2.: self.touch1.\n\nint 2=self.touch1.<=self.touch2.?self.touch2.: self.touch1.\n","The index of points are calculated with the ECG wave data (array):\n\nint 1=Math.Floor(1\/pixelsPerPoint);\n\nint 2=Math.Floor(2\/pixelsPerPoint);\n","The voltage values are calculated with the voltage[ ] array:\n\nint v1=voltage[n1]\n\nint v2=voltage[n2];\n","The following functions are used to draw the points and lines:\n\n","The major advantage of this invention is a very user-friendly method (touch screen using fingers and move) for users. The measurement of ECG waves is accurate and easy to perform.","The process of the present invention is applicable to other similar measurement, such as Brain Waves (electroencephalography), or other waves when the voltage is on y axis and time is on x axis.","To make the invention more understandable, here is a detailed description for an example to explain how to implement the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Implementation Details:","Multi-touch screen devices (such as iPad) can provide a series of gesture API, and the API application is able to acquire the finger touch data (coordinates) and the event when the finger touches and slices.","Inputs are:","Assumed (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two actual touch point coordinates, and the following parameters are predefined:\n\n","x1 and x2 were divided by pixelsPerPoint (pixels per point on screen) which yielded n1 and n2 as the point index, respectively, through which we could read the voltage values as v1 and v2 on the y axis from the array voltage[ ].
