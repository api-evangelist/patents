title: Aircraft excessive fuel dumping ejection parallel to flight direction
abstract: Excessive fuel is dumped by ejection under a pressurized outflow velocity from an aircraft during flight as jets in a direction parallel to air stream flow relative to the aircraft, from a rearwardly facing exit opening of a fuel jettison device mounted on the lower surface of the aircraft, with the exit fixedly spaced below the lower aircraft surface a short distance to avoid the Coanda effect while reducing or eliminating fuel and fuel mist impingement on aircraft surfaces.

Heretofore such dumping of fuel by ejection of fuel jets from the aircraft resulted in extensive fuel mist impingements on aircraft surfaces, such as the lower tail surface portions thereof. Attempted solutions to such fuel mist impingement problem heretofore involved aircraft flight at a low angle of attack, such as seven degrees (7\u00b0). However surface impingement still occurred because of the directional swerve of emerging fuel jets from the aircraft. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for ejection of fuel from aircraft during flight with reduced or eliminated fuel mist surface impingement while avoiding other disadvantages associated with prior attempted impingement problem solutions.","Pursuant to the present invention, the lower surface of an aircraft fuselage mounts a fuel jettison device having a rearwardly facing exit opening from which excessive propulsion generating fuel is dumped by ejection under pressure in a direction parallel to air-stream flow relative to the aircraft fuselage during flight. The fuel to be dumped is supplied to the fuel jettison device through a short fuel line extending therefrom into the lower surface of the aircraft fuselage. The exit opening of the fuel jettison device is thereby spaced and fixedly positioned a short distance below the lower aircraft surface to avoid the Coanda effect by directing ejection parallel to the air-stream flow.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an aircraft , such as a propeller driven V-22 type, undergoing flight to induce air stream flow relative thereto in a direction . The outer surfaces of the aircraft includes a lower fuselage surface component or sponson  on one lateral side of which a jettison device  is mounted as shown in ,  and  for dumping excessive fuel not utilized for aircraft propulsion. The excessive fuel extracted under pressure from inside the aircraft  is fed to the device  through a relatively short supply line , extending into the sponson  from the jettison device  as shown in . The fuel is accordingly dumped by ejection as jets  at a velocity of 10 ft.\/sec. from the jettison device  in a direction  generally parallel to the air stream flow direction  before landing of the aircraft .","The fuel jets  emerge from the jettison device  through a rearwardly facing circular exit opening  in a fixed position at rear end of the supply line  as shown in . The exit opening  is thereby spaced a short distance  below a lower end of the sponson  as shown in , such as five (5) inches, to thereby avoid the Coanda effect. Furthermore, the initial emergence of the fuel jets  from the exit opening  in the direction  parallel to the air stream reduces or eliminates fuel mist impingement on the rear tail end surface portion  of the aircraft . Complete elimination of fuel mist impingement is thereby assured when the aircraft  is flown at an angle of attack of seven degrees or lower.","As shown in , the jettison device  located on one side of the sponson  includes a nozzle tube end portion  on which the exit opening  is formed and extending from the fuel supply line  which extends into the aircraft  through the sponson . The exit end  of the nozzle tube portion  is fixedly spaced below the sponson  by a support  to establish and maintain the aforementioned spacing distance . A pair of side support plates  also interconnect and mount the nozzle tube portion  on the side of the sponson .","While the advantages of the present invention associated with use of the jettison device  as hereinbefore described are applicable to the lower portion of the V-22 type propeller driven aircraft  as shown in , it is also applicable to other types of jet or propeller powered aircraft which involve combustion of fuel. Also jettison exit openings differently shaped from that of the circular exit opening  may be utilized as long as they are fixedly positioned for emergence of the jets  in a direction parallel to the air-stream flow direction .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
