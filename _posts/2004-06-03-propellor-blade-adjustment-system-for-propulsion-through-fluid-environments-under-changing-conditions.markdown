title: Propellor blade adjustment system for propulsion through fluid environments under changing conditions
abstract: The stern end of a seawater hull has a rotor hub with propeller blades thereon. The rotor hub is rotated for propulsion of the hull by means of a propeller shaft extending through a sealed compartment within the hull. Such sealed compartment and an electrically powered control system is disposed within the hull to automatically adjust angular deflection of deformable tip portions of the propeller blades by means of blade embedded actuators, in response to varying input signals which respectively reflect changes in seawater conditions such as temperature and strain imposed on the propeller blades during propelling rotation of the rotor hub.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to hydrodynamic or aeronautical propulsion by rotation of a bladed propeller.","Because of adverse changes in environmental conditions that too often occur, it has become rather difficult to arrange for the maintenance of appropriate and effective hydrodynamic or aeronautic propulsion and for maneuvering of submarines or aircraft under speed and\/or directional control. Marine propeller blades are varied in cross-sectional profile for example to reduce vortices induced vibrations during propulsion. The control systems for such active hydrodynamic surface controls, heretofore designed for optimal performance under varying environmental conditions, involved application of electromagnetic\/mechanical control of control surfaces having shape memory alloy material cores. Such control systems for propulsive surfaces, such as propeller blades, were functionally limited because of complexities associated with inherent tensioning. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for enhanced active control by adjustment of hydrodynamic or aeronautical shaped surfaces, such as rotor blades having shape memory material associated therewith.","Pursuant to the present invention, propeller blades on a hub connected to a propulsion shaft have tips within which torque transfer plates are embedded. Electrical control current is supplied to the blades through the propulsion shaft for deformation adjustment of the blade tips under control of a computer sealed within a stern portion of a hull from which the propulsion shaft extends. Input signals are fed to the computer reflecting changes in environmental fluid temperature, blade rotational propelling force in the propulsion shaft and strain imposed on the blade tips during adjustment.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a marine hull  having a stern end portion through which a propeller shaft  extends for rotation about a rotational axis  extending from a propulsion unit  associated with an aft end hub section  of the hull end portion. A plurality of propeller blades  project from the hub section .","As shown in , the stern portion of the hull  is internally divided by a transverse bulkhead  into a stern tube enclosure  and a watertight compartment  within which fluid is sealed. The stern tube enclosure  is exposed inside thereof to ambient seawater by inflow at its aft end. The propeller shaft  extends forwardly into the stern tube  through a bearing , fixed in position therein by support hull struts , in spaced relation to an axially aligned bearing  fixed to the bulkhead . Also fixed to the bulkhead  on its inboard side within the sealed compartment  is a shaft seal  through which the propeller shaft  extends to maintain pressure integrity between the stern tube enclosure  and the compartment , so as to prevent ingress of the seawater from the enclosure  into the compartment  and egress of the fluid therefrom. An axial thrust bearing  for the propeller shaft  is fixed in position by the hull  in axially spaced alignment with the shaft seal  so as to accommodate transfer of forward and reverse propulsion forces developed during rotation of the propulsion unit . Also fixedly positioned over the propeller shaft  within the compartment  between the shaft seal  and the thrust bearing  is a slip ring assembly  through which electrical current is conducted by wiring extending through the propeller shaft  between an electrical power controller  as diagrammed in  and the propulsion unit  as shown in  for controlled adjustment of the propeller blades  on the hub section  as hereinafter explained. A temperature gauge  as also diagrammed in  is also provided within the compartment  for measurement of seawater temperature externally of the hull .","As denoted in , each of the propeller blades  has associated therewith an outer tip  made of a deform able shape memory alloy such as Nitipole. The tip  extends radially from a base portion  of the blade  fixed to the propeller hub section  of the hull . According to one embodiment of the present invention, a torque actuator is formed by a plate  embedded within the blade tip  and connected to an electrical torsional transmitter  from which the aforementioned electrical wiring  extends through the shaft  and the slip ring assembly  to the controller .","As diagrammed in , a strain gauge  associated with the propeller blade tip  detects strain in the blade tip  by generation of a signal that is applied to a computer  within the controller  to effect controlled adjustment of the propeller blade . The computer  within the controller  receives through a signal line  blade deflection signals from the strain gauge  as measurement of stress imposed on the propeller blade tip  during propulsion operation of the propeller unit . In response to such input of blade deflection signals from the strain gauge , the computer  generates control signals that are applied through a signal line  together with pre-existing deflection signals from an adder  connecting a power source  to an electrical power current supply  in the controller , from which electrical control adjustment energy is applied through a line  to the aforementioned torque actuator \u2013. In addition to the variable input from the propeller blade tip strain gauge  through line , other variable inputs to the computer  include water temperature signals from the aforementioned temperature gauge  and propeller rotation rate signals from the slip ring assembly  so as to improve cavitation conditions occurring at the blade tips .","When electrical pulse current is supplied through line  the current supply  in the controller  under control of the computer , the torque actuator plate  embedded in the blade tip  effects heating of its shape memory alloy material causing rotational deformation thereof in response to the aforementioned strain producing stress. Upon deenergization of the heated torque actuator plate , it returns to its ambient temperature for released twist return of the blade tip  to its ambient state by the strain energy stored therein. Adjustments effected in response to changes in environmental conditions of the seawater through which the hull  is being propelled by the propulsion unit  is thereby rendered more efficient over a wide range of environmental changes by rotational adjustment of the propeller blades  under deformation control in a most economical and reliable manner. Furthermore, the foregoing described and\/or referred to arrangement of parts, components and selection of shape memory alloy material associated with the propeller blades  is not only applicable to propulsion of the hull  of a craft such as a submarine through the dynamic fluid environment of seawater, but is also applicable to propeller blade propulsion of aircraft through air space as another type of fluid environment.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1\u20133"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
