title: Method and system for reducing synchronization time in a CDMA wireless communication system
abstract: A method and system for generating forward link channels in a synchronous CDMA base station having a pilot pseudonoise (PN) sequence with a pilot PN sequence offset. In one embodiment the method includes the steps of generating a sync channel including a sync channel message; generating an identification channel including at least the pilot PN sequence offset; and orthogonalizing the sync channel and the identification channel. The identification channel and the sync channel are both transmitted. However, the mobile station may get the pilot PN offset from the identification channel quickly, rather than having to demodulate the entire sync channel message. The identification channel may further include an indication of the phase of the pilot PN sequence, and the epoch of the pilot PN sequence. In one embodiment, the method includes encoding the identification channel using a Golay code.

More information concerning a code division multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated in its entirety herein by this reference.","Third-generation CDMA wireless communications systems have also been proposed. The cdma2000 ITU-R Radio Transmission Technology (RTT) Candidate Submission proposal forwarded by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for consideration for the IMT-2000 CDMA standard is an example of such a third-generation wireless communication system. The standard for cdma2000 is given in draft versions of IS-2000 being generated by TR45 of the TIA. The cdma2000 proposal is compatible with IS-95 systems in many ways. For example, in both the cdma2000 and IS-95 systems, each base station time-synchronizes its operation with other base stations in the system. Typically, the base stations synchronize operation to a universal time reference such as Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) signaling; however, other mechanisms can be used. Based upon the synchronizing time reference, each base station in a given geographical area is assigned a sequence offset of a common pseudo noise (PN) pilot sequence. For example, according to IS-95, a PN sequence having 2chips and repeating every 26.66 milliseconds (ms) is transmitted by each base station in the system at one of 512 PN sequence offsets as a pilot signal. The base stations continually transmit the pilot signal which can be used by the remote units to identify the base stations as well as for other functions.","Base station time-synchronization as provided in the cdma2000 and IS-95 systems has many advantages with respect to system acquisition and handoff completion time. Synchronized base stations and time-shifted common pilot signals as discussed above permit a fast one-step correlation for system acquisition and detection of neighboring base stations. Once the mobile station has acquired one base station, it can determine system time which is the same for all neighboring synchronous base stations. In this case, there is no need to adjust the timing of each individual mobile station during a handoff between synchronous base stations. Additionally, the mobile station does not need to decode any signal from the new base station in order to obtain rough timing information prior to handing off.","Another recently-proposed 3G communication system is referred to as W-CDMA. One example of a W-CDMA system is described in the ETSI Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Radio Transmission Technology (RTT) Candidate Submission forwarded by ETSI to the ITU for consideration for the IMT-2000 CDMA standard. The base stations in a W-CDMA system operate asynchronously. That is, the W-CDMA base stations do not all share a common universal time reference. Different base stations are not time-aligned. As a result, W-CDMA base stations employ a 3-step acquisition procedure with multiple parallel correlations in each step. In the W-CDMA system, each base station transmits a \u201csynchronization\u201d channel that comprises two sub-channels. The first of the two sub-channels, the primary synchronization channel, uses a primary synchronization code, c, that is common to all base stations. The second of the two sub-channels, the secondary synchronization channel, uses a cyclic set of secondary synchronization codes, c, that are not shared by other base stations that are not in the same code group. The mobile station in a W-CDMA system can acquire the synchronization channel of one or more base stations by searching for the primary synchronization code, cof the primary synchronization channel, and then using the timing information derived from the primary synchronization channel to process the secondary synchronization channel.","Recently, a combined CDMA IMT-2000 standard has been proposed in which cdma2000-compliant equipment and W-CDMA-compliant equipment may be optionally supported by any manufacturer. Thus, it is expected that synchronous base stations of a cdma2000-compliant system will be geographically located near asynchronous base stations of a W-CDMA-compliant system. This creates a need to be able to handoff a mobile station that supports both cdma2000 and W-CDMA operation between the asynchronous base stations of a W-CDMA system and the synchronous base stations of a cdma2000 system, and vice versa.","U.S. Pat.

The subject matter of U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,876 concerns so-called \u201csofter handoff.\u201d For the purposes of this document, the term \u201csoft handoff\u201d is intended to include both \u201csoft handoff\u201d and \u201csofter handoff.\u201d U.S. Pat.

Due to the physical proximity of the coverage areas of the neighboring base stations to the coverage area of the active base station, the remote units which are communicating with the active base station are more likely to handoff to one of the neighboring base stations than to other base stations in the system. In the IS-95 and cdma2000 systems, the base station identifies the neighboring base stations to the remote units with which it has established communication using a neighbor list identification message. The neighbor list identification message identifies a neighboring base station according to the PN sequence offset at which it transmits the pilot signal. In the IS-95 and cdma2000 systems, there is a one-to-one correspondence in a given geographical area between a base station and a PN sequence offset. In other words, two base stations operating in the same geographical area do not both use the same PN sequence offset. Thus, a base station in the IS-95 or cdma2000 system can be uniquely identified in a geographical region by its PN sequence offset.","The remote unit uses the neighbor list to limit the space over which it searches for handoff candidates. Because the searching process is so resource intensive, it is advantageous to avoid performing a search over the entire set of possible PN sequence offsets. By using the neighbor list, the remote unit can concentrate its resources on those PN sequence offsets which are most likely to correspond to useful signal paths.","A typical IS-95 or cdma2000 neighbor acquisition operation is practical so long as each base station's timing remains synchronous with respect to the others. However, in some systems such as W-CDMA, advantages are achieved by decoupling operation of the system from a synchronizing reference. For example, in a system which is deployed underground, such as in a subway system, it can be difficult to receive a universal time synchronization signal using GPS. Even where strong GPS signals are available, it is perceived as desirable in some political climates to decouple system operation from the U.S. Government GPS system. There may be other reasons for decoupling operation of the system from a synchronizing reference.","In a system where one or more of the base stations operate asynchronously with respect to other base stations in the system, the base stations cannot be readily distinguished from one another based merely upon a relative time offset (typically measured as a relative PN sequence offset) because a relative time offset between the base stations cannot be established without the use of a universal time reference. Thus, when a remote unit is in communication with an asynchronous base station, and has not been recently in communication with a synchronous base station, the remote unit is unlikely to have system time information of the synchronous base stations to a sufficient accuracy.","For example, suppose a remote unit has been in the coverage area of an asynchronous base station and is moving into the coverage area of a synchronous base station. Further suppose that the remote unit is able to detect the pilot signals of two different synchronous base stations by determining their relative PN sequence offsets. Unless the remote unit already knows system time of the synchronous base stations to a sufficient accuracy, the remote unit will be unable to determine which pilot signal is being transmitted by which base station. In other words, although the remote unit is able to distinguish that there are two different synchronous base stations due to their different relative PN sequence offsets, the remote unit is unable to determine the identity of either synchronous base station based on their pilot signals alone because the remote station does not have an absolute time reference with which to compare the two PN sequence offsets.","In a conventional IS-95 or cdma2000 system, once the forward pilot channel is acquired, the remote unit can then demodulate the forward synchronization channel. This is possible because the forward sync channel timing is such that its frame boundary is always aligned to the beginning of the PN sequence of the forward pilot channel. In other words, the forward sync channel frame boundary is always offset from system time by the same number of PN chips as the PN sequence offset of the corresponding forward pilot channel. The forward sync channel carries a sync channel message which includes overhead information such as system identification, system time, the base station's PN sequence offset, and several other items of useful information. After demodulating the sync channel message, the remote unit adjusts its internal timing according to the PN offset and system time sent in the sync channel message as described in IS-95.","Because the conventional sync channel is transmitted at a low data rate (for example, 1200 bps in IS-95), and the sync channel message contains a large amount of overhead information that must be demodulated on a frame-by-frame basis, it may be on the order of 800 milliseconds before the remote unit is able to determine the system identity of the transmitting base station via the sync channel message. This delay can undesirably affect the timing of a handoff from the asynchronous base station to the synchronous base station, particularly in a fading environment. In some instances, the delay associated with the remote unit having to determine the system identification of the target synchronous base station(s) by demodulating a conventional sync channel message would be unacceptably long, causing degradation or even dropping of a call in progress.","Thus, there is a need for an improved method and system for facilitating handoff between asynchronous and synchronous base stations that avoids the undesirable delays associated with demodulating a conventional sync channel message.","The present invention is a novel and improved method and system for generating forward link channels in a synchronous CDMA base station having a pilot pseudonoise (PN) sequence with a pilot PN sequence offset. In one embodiment the method includes the steps of generating a sync channel including a sync channel message; generating an identification channel including at least the pilot PN sequence offset; and orthogonalizing the sync channel and the identification channel. The identification channel and the sync channel are both transmitted. However, the mobile station may get the pilot PN offset from the identification channel quickly, rather than having to demodulate the entire sync channel message. The identification channel may further include an indication of the phase of the pilot PN sequence, and the epoch of the pilot PN sequence. In one embodiment, the method includes encoding the identification channel using a Golay code.","The present invention also provides a system for practicing the above-summarized method. The system includes a sync channel message generator that generates a sync channel including a sync channel message; an identification channel data generator that generates an identification channel including at least the pilot PN sequence offset; and first and second walsh coverors for orthogonalizing the sync channel and the identification channel. The system may further include an identification channel encoder for encoding the identification channel using a Golay code.","In a separate but related embodiment, an identification channel is not transmitted, but the sync channel message content is reduced. The method includes generating a reduced sync channel having a reduced sync channel message containing at least the pilot PN sequence offset; generating a broadcast channel having a broadcast channel message; and orthogonalizing the reduced sync channel and the broadcast channel. The reduced sync channel message may further include an indication of the location of a sync channel frame within the broadcast channel, and an indication of a data rate of the broadcast channel. Furthermore, in one embodiment the method includes generating a complete sync channel having a complete sync channel message when operating according to a first spreading rate; and generating the reduced sync channel having the reduced sync channel message when operating according to a second spreading rate.","The invention also includes a system for performing the method. The system includes a reduced sync channel message generator for generating a reduced sync channel having a reduced sync channel message containing at least the pilot PN sequence offset; a broadcast channel message generator for generating a broadcast channel having a broadcast channel message; and first and second walsh coverors for orthogonalizing the reduced sync channel and the broadcast channel. In one embodiment, the system further includes a sync channel message generator for generating a complete sync channel having a complete sync channel message when operating according to a first spreading rate, and wherein the reduced sync channel message generator generates the reduced sync channel when operating according to a second spreading rate.","Referring now to , a wireless communication system is illustrated in which both synchronous and asynchronous base stations are illustrated. A Mobile Switching Center (MSC)  may be coupled to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) (not shown). MSC  is also coupled to two Base Station Controllers (BSC)  and . BSC  is illustrated as being coupled to three asynchronous base stations , , and , with geographical coverage areas (sometimes referred to as \u201ccells\u201d) A, A, and A, respectively. BSC  is illustrated as being coupled to two synchronous base stations  and , with geographical coverage areas A and A, respectively. As can be seen from , there is significant overlap in the geographical coverage areas of the respective asynchronous and synchronous base stations. It is in these overlapping regions that handoff of a remote unit is expected and in which the present invention provides significant advantages. It is understood that there may be more or fewer synchronous base stations and asynchronous base stations than are shown in the example illustration of FIG. . Additionally, it is understood that BSC  and BSC  may not both be connected to the same MSC , but rather may be connected to independent MSCs or other network entities that are in turn interconnected by the PSTN (not shown).","Each of the synchronous base stations  and  transmits a pilot channel as is known in the art in accordance with either IS-95 or cdma2000. In addition, each synchronous base station  and  transmits one or more system overhead channels. For example, synchronous base stations  and  may transmit a synchronization channel and\/or one or more broadcast channels to convey timing, paging and other related overhead information to the remote unit in accordance with either IS-95 or cdma2000. A simplified timing diagram of certain ones of the forward link channels transmitted by synchronous base stations  and  is shown in FIG. .","In , three separate forward link channels are shown, a pilot channel , a sync channel , and an identification (ID) channel . Pilot channel  may be a conventional pilot channel according to IS-95. Pilot channel  is transmitted by synchronous base stations  and  with different PN offsets from the system time zero reference. For convenience of illustration, pilot channel  may be broken down into a continuous repetition of frames A, B, C. Sync channel  may be a conventional synchronization channel according to IS-95. Sync channel  is transmitted with the beginning of a sync channel frame being time-aligned with the pilot channel , according to the same PN offset. For convenience of illustration, sync channel  may be broken down into a continuous repetition of frames A, B, C.","ID channel  is also shown in  as being time-aligned with the PN offset of the pilot channel . However, ID channel  is not a conventional IS-95 channel. Preferably, ID channel  is transmitted by synchronous base stations  and  in addition to the conventional pilot channel  and conventional sync channel . ID channel  is also preferably covered with a different Walsh code than pilot channel  or sync channel  in order to maintain orthogonality of the forward channels. However, it is understood that the ID channel  does not necessarily need to be orthogonal to the remaining overhead channels. For convenience of illustration, ID channel  may be broken down into a continuous repetition of frames A, B, C which are aligned in time with the PN sequence of the pilot channel .","The ID channel  is used to improve handoffs from asynchronous base stations , ,  to synchronous base stations , . In particular, the ID channel  aids a mobile station in determining the pilot PN offset, and therefore the identity and timing of the target synchronous base station  or  to which it is handing off. As described above, the conventional sync channel  contains a large amount of information in addition to the pilot PN offset of the transmitting base station. None of this additional information is as immediately critical to the mobile station during handoff from an asynchronous base station to a synchronous base station as the pilot PN offset. Thus, in the embodiment of , ID channel  contains as little information as necessary for the base station to rapidly determine the pilot PN offset of the transmitting base station. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the ID channel  contains at least the 9-bit pilot PN offset. The ID channel  may also contain the 2-bit phase of the pilot PN sequence in 80 ms, and also a 1-bit even\/odd indication of the 80 ms epoch of the pilot PN sequence. These additional fields allow the mobile station to determine the PN long code state. With this information, the mobile station can derive system time and synchronize to the transmitting base station's timing.","In the exemplary embodiment, the ID channel  is Golay encoded. For example, in the embodiment that has 12 bits (9 pilot PN offset, plus 2 phase, plus 1 even\/odd), the ID channel  uses a 24 bit (24, 12) Golay code word. Golay codes are well known in the art as being robust, efficient error correcting codes and will not be discussed in detail herein. Example Golay coding and decoding techniques are given in the book \u201cError Control Coding: Fundamentals and Applications\u201d, by Shu Lin and Daniel J. Costello, Jr., ISBN 0-13-283796-X. However, other error-correcting coding techniques such as convolutional encoding or other techniques well known in the art may be used for the ID channel  without departing from the present invention.","Each ID channel frame A, B, C may contain one or more code words with each code word containing the pilot PN offset, and optionally the other information described above. The ID channel  preferably is continuously repeated. The continuous repetition allows a mobile station that did not collect sufficient energy during the duration of a single code word to combine energy from multiple consecutive code words in order to decode the code word and recover the pilot PN offset. In one embodiment of the present invention, only those synchronous base stations ,  that have at least one asynchronous base station , ,  as a neighbor would transmit the ID channel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["0","400","0","402","400","408","408","410","412","412","32","404","400","414","414","408","416","418","418","0","32","400","400","400"]},"In another embodiment of the present invention, a separate ID channel  is not transmitted. Instead, under certain conditions, the information on the sync channel  is reduced to decrease the amount of time necessary for the mobile station to obtain the pilot PN offset of the transmitting base station. This second embodiment will be disclosed with reference to an exemplary cdma 2000 system.","This alternate embodiment provides a more efficient structure for the sync channel message that may be used when the base station is transmitting at high data rates. In this alternate embodiment, several fields that would otherwise be part of the sync channel message are moved to another broadcast channel so that the sync channel message can be significantly shortened. This leads to a shorter \u201cboot-up\u201d time within the mobile station after acquisition with no previous information on system time. Later, the mobile station may then read the less critical information on the separate broadcast channel.","The sync channel in a cdma 2000 system operates at a data rate of 1200 bps for both spreading rates  (1.2288 mcps) and  (3.6864 mcps). The sync channel transmits information specific to the base station and needed by the mobile station to access the system, as well as timing fields for providing an accurate synchronized clock in the mobile station. After a sync channel message is formed, it is segmented into 31-bit groups and sent in a sync channel frame comprising a 1-bit start of message (SOM) field, and 31 bits of sync channel frame body. Three sync channel frames are combined to form a sync channel superframe of length 80 ms (96 bits). A CRC of 30 bits is also added. If the sync channel messages are less than an integer multiple of 93 bits (excluding SOM bits), they are padded with pad bits set to zero at the end of the message.","The fields in a conventional cdma 2000 sync channel message (for the first implementation version) are indicated in TABLE I below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e2151","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Conventional Sync Channel Message"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Field","Length (bits)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"MSG_TYPE","8"]},{"entry":[{},"P_REV","8"]},{"entry":[{},"MIN_P_REV","8"]},{"entry":[{},"SID","15"]},{"entry":[{},"NID","16"]},{"entry":[{},"PILOT_PN","9"]},{"entry":[{},"LC_STATE","42"]},{"entry":[{},"SYS_TIME","36"]},{"entry":[{},"LP_SEC","8"]},{"entry":[{},"LTM_OFF","6"]},{"entry":[{},"DAYLT","1"]},{"entry":[{},"PRAT","2"]},{"entry":[{},"CDMA_FREQ","11"]},{"entry":[{},"EXT_CDMA_FREQ","11"]},{"entry":[{},"OTD_MODE","2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Thus, from TABLE I, the conventional sync channel message body has about 180 bits, plus 30 bits of CRC, plus SOM bits. To this, padding bits are added, resulting in a message that is 3 superframes long. Since the long code state (LC_STATE) indicated by the sync channel message is 320 ms after the end of the sync channel message, it can be seen that the maximum boot up time from pilot acquisition until the mobile station obtains the long code state is 800 ms, assuming that the sync channel message is received error-free. For example, if the sync channel message is 240 ms long, then it may be up to 240 ms for the mobile station to receive the first start of message (SOM) bit of the sync channel message. Assuming it takes 240 ms to then decode the sync channel message, and 320 ms until the long code state is loaded by the mobile station, the total delay could be about 800 ms. As stated in the background above, this will be too long if a mobile station is being handed off from an asynchronous base station to a synchronous base station with a call in progress.","Thus, this alternate embodiment of the present invention includes transferring many of the fields of TABLE I to a separate broadcast channel, thereby shortening the sync channel message significantly.

The BRAT field indicates the data rate of the broadcast channel to which the other fields from TABLE I have been transferred. OTD_MODE is an indicator of the orthogonal transmit diversity mode of the transmitting base station. Orthogonal transmit diversity is a forward link transmission method that distributes forward link channel symbols among multiple antennas and spreads the symbols with a unique Walsh or quasi-orthogonal function associated with each antenna. Together, these three fields provide the mobile station with enough information to quickly locate and demodulate the fields that have been transferred to the separate broadcast channel. PILOT_PN is the pilot PN offset of the transmitting base station. As previously stated, knowing the pilot PN offset is necessary to determine the identity and timing of the transmitting base station if the system time of the synchronous system is not already known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["400","402","4","500","500","508","510","500"]},"The repeated code symbols are interleaved by interleaver  according to a predetermined interleaving format. Preferably, the interleaving format is a block interleaver of 96 code symbol duration. This provides flexibility in the mobile station to the extent that the mobile station need not demodulate an entire sync channel frame (26.667 ms) of data to obtain the reduced sync channel message in its entirety. The interleaved symbols are then covered with the Walsh function W() in walsh coveror . Note that this is the same Walsh function normally reserved for the conventional sync channel in an IS-95 or cdma 2000 system.","The reduced sync channel message, in the above example, is repeated 4 times within the sync channel frame. If the mobile station receives sufficient E\/N, the mobile station may demodulate the sync channel message with high reliability after demodulating only a fraction (one-quarter, one-half, or three-quarters) of the sync channel frame. Furthermore, it is advantageous to have the entire reduced sync channel message within one frame because if the sync channel message spans multiple frames and just one frame is in deep fade, the mobile station may need to demodulate the entire message anew, further increasing the boot-up time.","With the above structure for the reduced sync channel message, the effective E\/Nover the 26.667 ms sync channel frame at the mobile station is about 14.9 dB. Thus, the mobile station is likely to read the sync channel message within a fraction of the sync channel frame. Even so, the mean time until the mobile station can begin to demodulate the broadcast channel, assuming that the mobile station takes an entire sync channel frame of 26.667 ms to decode the reduced sync channel message is about 56.667 ms. This corresponds to a savings of about 620 ms in mean boot-up time\u2014that is, mean time to determine the pilot PN offset sufficient to uniquely identify the transmitting base station and begin to demodulate the broadcast channel.","The broadcast channel message generator C generates a broadcast channel message that includes the fields from TABLE I that were not listed in TABLE II. The message is convolutionally encoded in convolutional encoder , the code symbols are repeated in symbol repeater , and the repeated code symbols interleaved in interleaver . The broadcast channel is then covered with a Walsh function (\u201cW(N)\u201d) different from W() or W() in Walsh coveror  in order to maintain orthogonality with the pilot and sync channels. Of course, it is understood that different fields other than those listed in TABLE I may be transmitted on the broadcast channel without departing from the present invention.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the reduced sync channel message is transmitted only in those base stations that have asynchronous neighbors. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reduced sync channel message is only transmitted when the base station is operating at certain spreading rates. For example, in one embodiment, the base station only transmits the reduced sync channel message when operating at a spreading rate of 3.6864 mcps (Spreading Rate  for direct sequence spreading in cdma 2000), and instead transmits the conventional sync channel message when operating at a spreading rate of 1.2288 mcps (Spreading Rate  for direct sequence spreading in cdma 2000). Thus, for spreading rate , the conventional sync channel message would begin at the start of a sync channel superframe, and span  superframes. However, for spreading rate , the reduced sync channel message would begin at the start of a sync channel frame and would be repeated four times in a single sync channel frame of 26.667 ms. Similarly, the broadcast channel would only carry the \u201cextra\u201d fields from the sync channel when operating at spreading rate , and would carry a conventional broadcast channel message when operating at spreading rate .","It should be noted that the embodiments of FIG.  and  are merely exemplary of the present invention, and other combinations of \u201cID channels\u201d with one or more \u201csync channels\u201d or \u201cbroadcast channels\u201d may be implemented by one of ordinary skill in the art using the teachings herein. For example, different information other than that shown in the above tables may be transmitted, or the same information or a subset thereof may be divided differently among the channels taught herein. Futhermore, it should be noted that the present invention is intended to encompass all combinations of \u201cID channels\u201d or \u201creduced sync channels\u201d with \u201cconventional sync channels\u201d, or \u201cbroadcast channels\u201d.","It should be further understood that the two examples given herein (FIG.  and ) may be viewed as separate species of the same generic invention described herein. Specifically, both embodiments are directed to a method and system for generating an overhead message and overhead channels that significantly reduce the time necessary for a mobile station to determine the identity and timing of a synchronous base station in a CDMA system according to its pilot PN offset. The embodiment of  applies directly to the overlaying of a new ID channel to an existing IS-95-based system. The embodiment of  applies directly to replacing the conventional sync channel with a reduced sync channel and moving the extra fields to the broadcast channel, which would be advantageous for the 3x DS mode of a cdma2000 system.","Although the present invention has been disclosed herein in an exemplary cdma 2000 or IS-95 compliant system, it is understood that the principles described herein may be advantageously applied to other systems in which the base stations are uniquely identified by their pilot PN offset. It should also be noted that although  illustrate separate functional blocks, these blocks may be advantageously integrated onto one or more ASICs or DSPs.","The previous description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. The various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features, objects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings in which like reference characters identify correspondingly throughout and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
