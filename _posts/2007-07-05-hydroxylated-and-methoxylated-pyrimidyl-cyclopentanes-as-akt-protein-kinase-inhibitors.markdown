which has been submitted via EFS-Web and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on Aug. 3, 2010, is named 02121009.txt and is 809 bytes in size.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to novel inhibitors of serine\/threonine protein kinases (e.g., AKT and related kinases), pharmaceutical compositions containing the inhibitors, and methods for preparing these inhibitors. The inhibitors are useful, for example, for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer and inflammation, in mammals.","2. Description of the State of the Art","Protein kinases (PK) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins by transfer of the terminal (gamma) phosphate from ATP. Through signal transduction pathways, these enzymes modulate cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i.e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) , Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.). Furthermore, abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from relatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer). Protein kinases are an important target class for therapeutic modulation (Cohen, P. (2002) Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 1:309).","Significantly, atypical protein phosphorylation and\/or expression is often reported to be one of the causative effects of abnormal cellular proliferation, metastasis and cell survival in cancer. The abnormal regulation and\/or expression of various kinases, including Akt, VEGF, ILK, ROCK, p70S6K, Bcl, PKA, PKC, Raf, Src, PDK1, ErbB2, MEK, IKK, Cdk, EGFR, BAD, CHK1, CHK2 and GSK3 amongst numerous others, has been specifically implicated in cancer.","Protein kinases include two classes; protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and serine-threonine kinases (STK). The Protein Kinase B\/Akt enzymes are a group of serine\/threonine kinases that are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. One of the best-characterized targets of the PI3K lipid products is the 57 KD serine\/threonine protein kinase Akt, downstream of PI3K in the signal transduction pathway (Hemmings, B. A. (1997) Science 275:628; Hay N. (2005) Cancer Cell 8:179-183). Akt is the human homologue of the protooncogene v-akt of the acutely transforming retrovirus AKT8. Due to its high sequence homology to protein kinases A and C, Akt is also called Protein Kinase B (PKB) and Related to A and C (RAC). Three isoforms of Akt are known to exist, namely Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, which exhibit an overall homology of 80% (Staal, S.P. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84:5034; Nakatani, K. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257:906; Li et al (2002) Current Topics in Med. Chem. 2:939-971; WO 2005\/113762). The Akt isoforms share a common domain organization that consists of a pleckstrin homology domain at the N-terminus, a kinase catalytic domain, and a short regulatory region at the C-terminus. In addition, both Akt2 and Akt3 exhibit splice variants. Upon recruitment to the cell membrane by PtdInd(3,4,5)P, Akt is phosphorylated (activated) by PDK1 at T308, T309 and T305 for isoforms Akt1 (PKB\u03b1), Akt2 (PKB\u03b2) and Akt3 (PKB\u03b3), respectively, and at S473, S474 and S472 for isoforms Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, respectively. Such phosphorylation occurs by an as yet unknown kinase (putatively named PDK2), although PDK1 (Balendran, A., (1999) Curr. Biol. 9:393), autophosphorylation (Toker, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:8271) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) (Delcommenne, M. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95:11211) have been implicated in this process. Akt activation requires its phosphorylation on residue Ser 473 in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Brodbeck et al (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274:9133-9136; Coffer et al (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 201:475-481; Alessi et al (1997) Curr. Biol. 7:261-269). Although monophosphorylation of Akt activates the kinase, bis(phosphorylation) is required for maximal kinase activity.","Akt is believed to assert its effect on cancer by suppressing apoptosis and enhancing both angiogenesis and proliferation (Toker et al. (2006) Cancer Res. 66(8):3963-3966). Akt is overexpressed in many forms of human cancer including, but not limited to, colon (Zinda et al (2001) Clin. Cancer Res. 7:245), ovarian (Cheng et al (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:9267), brain (Haas Kogan et al (1998) Curr. Biol. 8:1195), lung (Brognard et al (2001) Cancer Res. 61:3986), pancreatic (Bellacosa et al (1995) Int. J. Cancer 64:280-285; Cheng et al (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93:3636-3641), prostate (Graff et al (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:24500) and gastric carcinomas (Staal et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:5034-5037).","The PI3K\/Akt\/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been explored for targeted small molecule inhibitor therapy (Georgakis, G. and Younes, A. (2006) Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 6(1):131-140; Granville et al (2006) Clin. Cancer Res. 12(3):679-689). Inhibition of PI3K\/Akt signaling induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth of tumor cells that have elevated Akt levels (Kim et al (2005) Current Opinion in Investig. Drugs 6(12):1250-1258; Luo et al (2005) Molecular Cancer Ther. 4(6):977-986).","The development of kinase inhibitors that target abnormally regulated pathways and ultimately result in disease is of enormous ethical and commercial interest to the medical and pharmaceutical community. A compound that inhibits (1) recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane, (2) activation by PDK1 or PDK2, (3) substrate phosphorylation, or (4) one of the downstream targets of Akt could be a valuable anticancer agent, either as a stand-alone therapy or in conjunction with other accepted procedures.","U.S. pat. application publication 2005\/0130954 discloses inter alia, a variety of compounds that act as AKT inhibitors.

Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also includes all such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures, pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of this invention. The term \u201cenantiomer\u201d refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. The term \u201cdiastereomer\u201d refers to a pair of optical isomers which are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities.","The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.","The compounds of Formula I include solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs and salts (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts) of such compounds.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d indicates that the substance or composition is compatible chemically and\/or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and\/or the mammal being treated therewith.","A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term \u201chydrate\u201d can also be used to refer to a complex wherein the solvent molecule is water.","A \u201cprodrug\u201d is a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, methyl-alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and tert-butylglycine.","Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of Formula I can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in 1996, 39, 10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C-C)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N\u2014(C-C)alkoxy-carbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C-C)alkanoyl, \u03b1-amino(C-C)alkanoyl, arylacyl and \u03b1-aminoacyl, or \u03b1-aminoacyl-\u03b1-aminoacyl, where each \u03b1-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH), \u2014P(O)(O(C-C)alkyl)or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).","Free amines of compounds of Formula I can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these moieties may incorporate groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR\u2032-carbonyl, wherein R and R\u2032 are each independently (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)cycloalkyl, or benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural \u03b1-aminoacyl or natural \u03b1-aminoacyl-natural \u03b1-aminoacyl, \u2014C(OH)C(O)OY wherein Y is H, (C-C)alkyl or benzyl, \u2014C(OY)Ywherein Yis (C-C) alkyl and Yis (C-C)alkyl, carboxy(C-C)alkyl, amino(C-C)alkyl or mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylaminoalkyl, or \u2014C(Y)Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl.","For additional examples of prodrug derivatives, see, for example, a) , edited by H.

Examples of salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic base, such salts including, but not limited to, sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogenphosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyn-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, \u03b3-hydroxybutyrates, glycollates, tartrates, methanesulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates. Since a single compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moiety, the compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.","If the inventive compound is a base, the desired salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, by treatment of the free base with an acidic compound, for example an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the inventive compound is an acid, the desired salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, by treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base. Examples of suitable inorganic salts include those formed with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, barium and calcium. Examples of suitable organic base salts include, for example, ammonium, dibenzylammonium, benzylammonium, 2-hydroxyethylammonium, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium, phenylethylbenzylamine, dibenzylethylenediamine, and the like salts. Other salts of acidic moieties may include, for example, those salts formed with procaine, quinine and N-methylglucosamine, plus salts formed with basic amino acids such as glycine, ornithine, histidine, phenylglycine, lysine and arginine.","In certain embodiments, the salt is a \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d which, unless otherwise indicated, includes salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the corresponding free acid or base of the specified compound and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable.","The compounds of Formula I also include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and which may be useful as intermediates for preparing and\/or purifying compounds of Formula I and\/or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formula I.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., H) and carbon-14 (i.e., C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Metabolites of Compounds of Formula I","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of compounds of Formula I described herein. A \u201cmetabolite\u201d is a pharmacologically active product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products may result, for example, from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolites are identified, for example, by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to a human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolites, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I","Compounds of this invention may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, , v. 1-19, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-1999 ed.), or 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements).","Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial \u2018split and mix\u2019 approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formula I, or salts thereof.","For illustrative purposes, Schemes 1-4 and Schemes A-J shows a general method for preparing the compounds of the present invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below.

A 2-phenylacetate coupled with an appropriate chiral auxillary (R*) (for example, an Evans' auxiliary or a Sultam) with the appropriate stereochemistry to generate the desired chemistry at the b-position of the amino acid may be treated with an imine or iminium ion synthon (e.g. prepared in situ by the presence of a Lewis acid (eg. TiCl) and an appropriately substituted alkoxymethanamine or N-(alkoxymethyl)amide\/carbamate at \u2212100\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C.).

Cleavage of the chiral auxillary, using methods known to cleave the chosen auxillary (e.g. LiOH\/HOat \u221250\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. for the Evans auxillary) then leads to the desired N-protected b-amino acid with the desired stereochemistry at the b-position.

The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.","Methods of Separation","In any of the synthetic methods for preparing compounds of Formula I, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a reaction mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., 1975) 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212)menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. ., (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, 1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Methods of Treatment with Compounds of Formula I","The compounds of the present invention can be used as prophylactics or therapeutic agents for treating diseases or disorders mediated by modulation or regulation of AKT protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, additional serine\/threonine kinases, and\/or dual specificity kinases. AKT protein kinase mediated conditions that can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, inflammatory, hyperproliferative cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, gynecological, and dermatological diseases and disorders.","In one embodiment, said pharmaceutical composition is for the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, including cancers of the following categories: (1) Cardiac: sarcoma (angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma), myxoma, rhabdomyoma, fibroma, lipoma and teratoma;

In the case of cancer, an effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The amount of a compound of Formula I that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the mammal in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.","\u201cTreating\u201d is intended to mean at least the mitigation of a disease condition in a mammal, such as a human, that is affected, at least in part, by the activity of one or more AKT protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, additional serine\/threonine kinases, and\/or dual specificity kinases. The terms \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those found to be predisposed to having the disease condition but have not yet been diagnosed as having it; modulating and\/or inhibiting the disease condition. The terms \u201ctreating\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, or \u201ctreatment\u201d embrace both preventative, i.e., prophylactic, and palliative treatment.","As used herein, the term \u201cmammal\u201d refers to a warm-blooded animal that has or is at risk of developing a disease described herein and includes, but is not limited to, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, hamsters, and primates, including humans.","This invention also provides compounds of Formula I for use in the treatment of AKT protein kinase-mediated conditions.","An additional aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of Formula I in the preparation of a medicament for therapy, such as for the treatment or prevention of AKT protein kinase-mediated conditions.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more additional drugs such as described below. The dose of the second drug can be appropriately selected based on a clinically employed dose. The proportion of the compound of the present invention and the second drug can be appropriately determined according to the administration subject, the administration route, the target disease, the clinical condition, the combination, and other factors. In cases where the administration subject is a human, for instance, the second drug may be used in an amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight per part by weight of the compound of the present invention.","The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of this invention such that they do not adversely affect each other.

A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action.
