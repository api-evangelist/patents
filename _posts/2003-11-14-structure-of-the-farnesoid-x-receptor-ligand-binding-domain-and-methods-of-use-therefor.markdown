In a particular aspect, the invention relates to compositions comprising the ligand binding domain of a FXR in crystalline form, as described by structure coordinates obtained by X-ray crystallography, and computers utilizing such structure coordinates to provide information regarding the ligand binding domain of FXRs and ligands therefor. In another aspect, the invention relates to methods of utilizing such structure coordinates for modeling of known and putative FXR ligands.","Structural biology provides an important tool for the detailed characterization of proteins at the molecular level. This molecular approach can lead to a more complete understanding not only of a protein itself, for example, but also helps characterize the interactions between a ligand-binding protein and its known ligands and\/or putative binding partners. The nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) functions as a bile acid sensor by responding to physiological levels of a variety of bile acid ligands and coordinating the control and maintenance of lipid homeostasis. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure, and in particular, the structure of the ligand binding domain involved in binding bile acids, can assist in studies of the function and physical properties of FXR.","An essential function of the liver and the intestine in vertebrates is to maintain lipid homeostasis within the body through tight regulation of the acquisition, synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol (Chawla et al. (2000). \u201cDon't know much bile-ology\u201d. Cell. 103, 1-4). Excess cholesterol is either converted into bile acids in the liver, or undergoes biliary excretion in the intestine and is disposed of in the stool (Chiang (2002) Bile Acid regulation of gene expression: roles of nuclear hormone receptors. Endocr Rev. 23(4), 443-63). The nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) farnesoid X receptor (FXR, also known as NRIH4) is involved in the regulation of both of these metabolic processes. FXR is expressed in the liver and intestine as well as other cholesterol rich tissues such as the adrenal gland. Knockout mice deficient in FXR expression display defects in bile acid (BA) homeostasis when exposed to dietary stresses, including elevated serum BA, reduced bile acid pools, and reduced fecal BA secretion (Sinal et al. (2000). Targeted disruption of the nuclear receptor FXR\/BAR impairs bile acid and lipid homeostasis. Cell: 102(6), 731-44). In the liver, the rate-limiting step for the conversion of excess cholesterol into bile acids is catalyzed by the cytochrome p450 gene, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). A second cytochrome p450 gene, sterol 12 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B) is a key enzyme for regulating the cholic acid (CA)\/chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) ratio in bile acid biosynthesis (Kerr et al., (2002) Loss of nuclear receptor SHP impairs but does not eliminate negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. Dev Cell. 2(6), 713-20; Wang et al. (2002) Redundant pathways for negative feedback regulation of bile acid production. Dev Cell. 2(6), 721-31). In mammals these genes are indirectly regulated by FXR via the NHR homologue gene SHP (small heterodimer partner) (Lu et al. (2000). Molecular basis for feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis by nuclear receptors. Mol Cell. 6(3), 507-15; Goodwin et al (2000). A regulatory cascade of the nuclear receptors FXR, SHP-1, and LRH-1 represses bile acid biosynthesis. Mol Cell. 6(3), 517-26).","Physiological concentrations of specific BAs bind and activate FXR, the most potent being CDCA a major primary bile acid found in human bile (Makishima et al, (1999) Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids. Science. 284(5418), 1362-5; Parks et al. (1999). Bile acids: natural ligands for an orphan nuclear receptor. Science. 284(5418). 1365-8, and Wang et al. (1999) Endogenous bile acids are ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR\/BAR. Mol Cell. 3(5), 543-53). This activation enables FXR to act as a transcriptional sensor for bile acids (BAs), repressing the transcriptional expression of both CYP7A and CYP8B genes by increasing the levels of the inhibitory nuclear receptor SHP. SHP is a promiscuous inhibitory heterodimer partner of NHRs that suppresses the transcriptional activity of a large number of NHRs. However, its ability to bind and inhibit the liver receptor homologue (LRH-1) a NHR required for CYP7A gene expression, indirectly allows FXR to exert its influence on cholesterol homeostasis (Lu et al., (2000), supra; Goodwin et al., (2000), supra). Additionally, BA activation of FXR positively regulates the expression of genes involved in the excretion and transportation of BAs including intestinal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP), bile salt export pump (BSEP) and canalichur multi-specific organic anion transporter (cMOAT) (Chiang (2002), supra). Thus, this receptor plays a key physiological role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis.","FXR belongs to a superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors involved in a wide array of biological functions including development, differentiation and homeostasis. The family members share two structurally-conserved domains; a central, highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) that targets the receptor to specific DNA sequences, termed hormone response elements, and a ligand binding domain (LBD) that binds small lipophilic hormones (Evans R M. (1988) The steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. Science. 240(4854), 889-95). The LBD functions as the regulating molecular switch. Binding of the appropriate hormone to the LBD causes a conformational change that results in the release of bound co-repressor proteins and the recruitment of co-activator proteins that culminates in the activation of transcriptional target genes. This regulation of NHR transcription factors by small lipophilic hormones makes this gene family an ideal target for chemical biology to identify novel chemical activators (Blumberg and Evans (1998). Orphan nuclear receptors-new ligands and new possibilities. Genes Dev. 12(20), 3149-55). FXR senses BA levels and mediates the repression of genes that convert excess cholesterol into bile BAs as well as the induction of BA transport genes makes FXR an attractive pharmaceutical target. The availability of potent synthetic agonists for FXR, and an understanding of how various binding agents interact with the ligand binding domain of FXR is a critical step required for the validation of FXR as a drug target and the elaboration of the functions of FXR.","The present invention provides the first high-resolution crystal structure determinations of a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in its active state. Specifically disclosed herein is the ligand binding domain of FXR bound with a novel FXR agonist termed fexaramine, which is structurally distinct from known natural bile acid (BA) ligands. Accordingly, the invention provides a structural basis for understanding FXR ligand binding, and provides further knowledge of the physical properties of this receptor. The present invention uses molecular modeling at the atomic level, to elucidate FXR-ligand interactions.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there are provided compositions comprising the ligand binding domain (LBD) of a FXR, and complexes thereof with ligands, in crystalline form. The invention further provides the structure coordinates of FXR complexed with fexaramine as determined by X-ray crystallography.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer for producing a three-dimensional representation of a FXR molecule or molecular complex or a homologue thereof, based on such FXR structure coordinates, or a portion thereof sufficient to define the points of interaction between a FXR LBD and a ligand therefor.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer for determining at least a portion of the structure coordinates corresponding to X-ray diffraction data obtained from a FXR molecule or molecular complex or a homologue thereof.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, there are provided methods of using the high-resolution crystal structure determinations of a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in its active state. Specifically disclosed herein are methods of using the structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of FXR bound with a novel FXR agonist. Accordingly, the invention provides a structural basis for understanding FXR ligand binding, and provides further knowledge of the physical properties of this receptor. The present invention uses molecular modeling at the atomic level, to elucidate FXR-ligand interactions. By determining high-resolution x-ray crystal structures of a FXR complexed with a synthetic ligand, the present invention provides a more complete understanding of FXR structure and provides a molecular explanation of how both natural and modified or synthetic BAs interact with the receptor.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there are provided methods of predicting a molecule capable of binding to a FXR molecule. Such methods comprise modeling a test molecule that potentially interacts with the LBD of FXR, wherein the LBD is defined by a plurality of structure coordinates of the LBD of FXR. The structure coordinates of FXR are derived from X-ray diffraction data obtained from crystals of a FXR molecule or molecular complex or a homologue of said FXR molecule or molecular complex. In preferred embodiments, the structure coordinates correspond to the LBD of FXR complexed with the high affinity ligand fexaramine as described herein.","According to further aspects of the present invention, there are provided methods of identifying a compound with agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist activity for a FXR molecule. Such methods comprise modeling test compound using FXR structure coordinates. Also provided are compositions of compounds identified by such methods.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there are provided methods of determining whether a test compound is capable of binding to the LBD of a FXR molecule by analyzing and comparing points of interaction between the LBD and one or more FXR ligand(s), with points of interaction between the LBD and the test compound. In preferred embodiments, the test compound is a bile acid.","In accordance with the present invention, there are provided compositions comprising the ligand binding domain (LBD) of a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in crystalline form. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there are provided high-resolution structures of FXR LBD complexed with a high affinity ligand, fexaramine, as described herein. The structure of a FXR LBD presented herein provides the first three-dimensional view of the structural basis for ligand binding between FXR and natural, modified and synthetic ligands therefor.","In accordance with the present invention, the crystal structure of the LBD of FXR complexed with fexaramine has been refined to 1.78 \u212b resolution. FXR LBD\/fexaramine crystals belong to space group P222with one molecule per asymmetric unit (52.9% solvent). Unit cell dimensions are about a=36.656 \u212b, b=56.776 \u212b, c=117.646 \u212b, \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=90.0\u00b0. The complete structure coordinates for the X-ray diffraction data set are set forth in Appendix 1.","One aspect of the invention resides in obtaining the FXR LBD in crystalline form, of sufficient quality to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein by X-ray diffraction methods. X-ray crystallography is a method of solving the three-dimensional structures of molecules. The structure of a molecule is calculated from X-ray diffraction patterns using a crystal as a diffraction grating. Three-dimensional structures of protein molecules arise from crystals grown from a concentrated solution of that protein. The process of X-ray crystallography can include the following steps:\n\n","The term \u201ccrystalline form\u201d refers to a crystal formed from a solution comprising a purified polypeptide corresponding to all or part of FXR. In preferred embodiments, a crystalline form may also be formed from a purified polypeptide corresponding to all or part of FXR in a complex with one or more additional known or putative ligand molecules, or other known or putative molecules capable of binding to FXR or an FXR homologue, such as natural, synthetic, or modified bile acids.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods utilizing structure coordinates obtained by X-ray crystallography of crystals comprising the ligand binding domain (LBD) of a farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In accordance with a preferred aspect of this embodiment of the present invention, the methods utilize information obtained from high-resolution structures of FXR LBD complexed with a high affinity ligand fexaramine as described herein.

Identification of a nuclear receptor that is activated by farnesol metabolites. Cell 81:687-693. This receptor is a protein having a relative molecular mass of approximately 54,000 Daltons, and is a vertebrate transcription factor regulated by intracellular metabolites. The receptor is activated by certain farnesoids, i.e., farnesol itself and compounds derived from, and\/or similar in structure to, farnesol. These farnesoids include farnesol, farnesal, farnesyl acetate, farnesoic acid, geranylgeraniol, and juvenile hormone III.","FXR polypeptides contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention can be characterized by reference to the unique tissue distribution thereof.

This phenomenon may be due to the non-optimal G+C content and\/or A+T content of the gene relative to the expression system being used. For example, the very low G+C content of many bacterial genes results in the generation of sequences mimicking or duplicating plant gene control sequences that are highly A+T rich. The presence of A+T rich sequences within the genes introduced into plants (e.g., TATA box regions normally found in promoters) may result in aberrant transcription of the gene(s). In addition, the presence of other regulatory sequences residing in the transcribed mRNA (e.g., polyadenylation signal sequences (AAUAAA) or sequences complementary to small nuclear RNAs involved in pre-mRNA splicing) may lead to RNA instability. Therefore, one goal in the design of genes is to generate nucleic acid sequences that have a G+C content that affords mRNA stability and translation accuracy for a particular expression system.","Due to the plasticity afforded by the redundancy of the genetic code (i.e., many amino acids are specified by more than one codon), evolution of the genomes of different organisms or classes of organisms has resulted in differential usage of redundant codons. This \u201ccodon bias\u201d is reflected in the mean base composition of protein coding regions. For example, organisms with relatively low G+C contents utilize codons having A or T in the third position of redundant codons, whereas those having higher G+C contents utilize codons having G or C in the third position. Therefore, in reengineering genes for expression, one may wish to determine the codon bias of the organism in which the gene is to be expressed. The usage of codons for genes of a particular organism can be determined by analyzing such genes that have been deposited in GenBank or other databases containing nucleotide sequence information. After determining the bias thereof, the new gene sequence can be analyzed for restriction enzyme sites as well as other sites that could affect transcription such as exon:intron junctions, polyA addition signals, or RNA polymerase termination signals.","Genes encoding a FXR polypeptide comprising the LBD of FXR can be placed in an appropriate vector, depending on the artisan's interest, and can be expressed using a suitable expression system. An expression vector, as is well known in the art, typically includes elements that permit replication of said vector within the host cell and may contain one or more phenotypic markers for selection of cells containing said gene. The expression vector will typically contain sequences that control expression such as promoter sequences, ribosome-binding sites, and translational initiation and termination sequences. Expression vectors may also contain elements such as subgenomic promoters, a repressor gene or various activator genes. The artisan may also choose to include nucleic acid sequences that result in secretion of the gene product, movement of said product to a particular organelle such as a plant plastid (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,785; 5,451,513 and 5,545,817, which are incorporated by reference herein) or other sequences that increase the ease of peptide purification, such as an affinity tag.","A wide variety of expression control sequences are useful in expressing the gene encoding the polypeptide when operably linked thereto. Such expression control sequences include, for example, the early and late promoters of SV40 for animal cells, the lac system, the trp system, major operator and promoter systems of phage S, and the control regions of coat proteins, particularly those from RNA viruses in plants. In , a useful transcriptional control sequence is the T7 RNA polymerase binding promoter, which can be incorporated into a pET vector as described by Studier et al., Meth. Enzymol. 185:60-89 (1990), which is incorporated by reference herein.","For expression, a desired gene should be operably linked to the expression control sequence and maintain the appropriate reading frame to permit production of the desired polypeptide. Any of a wide variety of well-known expression vectors are of use in the practice of the present invention. These include, for example, vectors comprising segments of chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences such as those derived from SV40, bacterial plasmids including those from such as col E1, pCR1, pBR322 and derivatives thereof, pMB9, wider host range plasmids such as RP4, phage DNA such as phage S, NM989, M13, and other such systems as described by Sambrook et al., (MC, A LM, 2Ed. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press), which is incorporated by reference herein.","A wide variety of host cells are available for expressing polypeptides of the present invention. Such host cells include, for example, bacteria such as and , fungi, yeast, animal cells, plant cells, insect cells, and the like. Preferred embodiments of the present invention include FXR polypeptides comprising the LBD of FXR that are expressed in with a histidine tag to facilitate purification.","Once a polypeptide of the present invention is expressed, the protein obtained therefrom can be isolated or purified so that structural analysis, modeling, and\/or biochemical analysis can be performed, as exemplified herein. The nature of the protein obtained can be dependent on the expression system used. For example, genes, when expressed in mammalian or other eukaryotic cells, may contain latent signal sequences that may result in glycosylation, phosphorylation, or other post-translational modifications, which may or may not alter function. Therefore, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is the expression of FXR genes or portions thereof in cells. Once such proteins are expressed, they can be easily purified using techniques common to the person having ordinary skill in the art of protein biochemistry, such as, for example, techniques described in Colligan et al. (CPPS, Chanda, Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (1997)), which is incorporated by reference herein. Such techniques often include the use of cation-exchange or anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration-size exclusion chromatography, and the like. Another technique that may be commonly used is affinity chromatography. Affinity chromatography can include the use of antibodies, substrate analogs, or histidine residues (His-tag technology as preferred herein).","By a \u201csubstantially pure polypeptide\u201d is meant a polypeptide which has been separated from components which naturally accompany it. Typically, the polypeptide is substantially pure when it is at least 60%, by weight, free from the proteins and naturally-occurring molecules with which it is naturally associated. Preferably, the preparation is at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 99%, by weight, polypeptide of interest. A substantially pure polypeptide may be obtained, for example, by extraction from a natural source; by expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide; or by chemically synthesizing the protein. Purity can be measured by any appropriate method (e.g., column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by HPLC analysis, and the like).","Once purified, the present invention allows for the characterization of FXR polypeptides comprising the LBD of FXR by crystallization followed by X-ray diffraction. Polypeptide crystallization occurs in solutions where the polypeptide concentration exceeds it solubility maximum (i.e., the polypeptide solution is supersaturated). Such solutions may be restored to equilibrium by reducing the polypeptide concentration, preferably through precipitation of the polypeptide crystals. Often polypeptides may be induced to crystallize from supersaturated solutions by adding agents that alter the polypeptide surface charges or perturb the interaction between the polypeptide and bulk media to promote associations that lead to crystallization.","Compounds known as \u201cprecipitants\u201d are often used to decrease the solubility of the polypeptide in a concentrated solution by forming an energetically unfavorable precipitating layer around the polypeptide molecules (Weber, 41:1-36 (1991)). In addition to precipitants, other materials are sometimes added to the polypeptide crystallization solution. These include buffers to adjust the pH of the solution and salts to reduce the solubility of the polypeptide. Various precipitants are known in the art and include, for example, ethanol, 3-ethyl-2-4 pentanediol, many of the polyglycols, such as polyethylene glycol, and the like.","Commonly used polypeptide crystallization methods include, for example, batch, hanging drop, seed initiation, and dialysis methods. In each of these methods, it is important to promote continued crystallization after nucleation by maintaining a supersaturated solution. In the batch method, the polypeptide is mixed with precipitants to achieve supersaturation, the vessel is sealed, and set aside until crystals appear. In the dialysis method, the polypeptide is retained in a sealed dialysis membrane that is placed into a solution containing precipitant. Equilibration across the membrane increases the polypeptide and precipitant concentrations thereby causing the polypeptide to reach supersaturation levels.","In the preferred hanging drop technique (McPherson, 251:6300-6303 (1976)), an initial polypeptide mixture is created by adding a precipitant to a concentrated polypeptide solution. The concentrations of the polypeptide and precipitants are such that in this initial form, the polypeptide does not crystallize. A small drop of this mixture is placed on a glass slide that is inverted and suspended over a reservoir of a second solution. The system is then sealed. Typically, the second solution contains a higher concentration of precipitant or other dehydrating agent. The difference in the precipitant concentrations causes the protein solution to have a higher vapor pressure than the second solution. Since the system containing the two solutions is sealed, an equilibrium is established, and water from the polypeptide mixture transfers to the second solution. This equilibrium increases the polypeptide and precipitant concentration in the polypeptide solution. At the critical concentration of polypeptide and precipitant, a crystal of the polypeptide will form.","Another method of crystallization involves introducing a nucleation site into a concentrated polypeptide solution. Generally, a concentrated polypeptide solution is prepared and a seed crystal of the polypeptide is introduced into this solution. If the concentrations of the polypeptide and of any precipitants are correct, the seed crystal will provide a nucleation site around which a larger crystal forms.","Some proteins may be recalcitrant to crystallization. However, several techniques are available to the skilled artisan. Quite often the removal of polypeptide segments at the amino or carboxy terminal end of the protein is necessary to produce crystalline protein samples. Said procedures involve either the treatment of the protein with one of several proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, substilisin, and the like. This treatment often results in the removal of flexible polypeptide segments that are likely to negatively affect crystallization. Alternatively, the removal of coding sequences from the protein's gene facilitates the recombinant expression of shortened proteins that can be screened for crystallization. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, only the LBD of FXR, amino acid residues 248-476 of SEQ ID NO:1, is expressed for crystallization.","The crystals so produced have a wide range of uses. For example, high quality crystals are suitable for X-ray or neutron diffraction analysis to determine the three-dimensional structure of a FXR, to design mutants thereof, to determine ligand binding properties and pharmacokinetics thereof, and the like. In addition, crystallization can serve as a further purification method. In some instances, a polypeptide or protein will crystallize from a heterogeneous mixture into crystals. Isolation of such crystals by methods known in the art, for example, filtration, centrifugation, and the like, followed by redissolving the polypeptide affords a purified solution suitable for use in growing the high-quality crystals needed for diffraction studies. The high-quality crystals may also be dissolved in water and then formulated to provide an aqueous solution having other uses as desired.","Because FXR polypeptides may crystallize in more than one crystal form, the structure coordinates of a FXR or portions thereof, as provided by this invention, are particularly useful to solve the structure of other crystal forms of a FXR polypeptide. Said structure coordinates, as provided herein in Appendix 1, may also be used to solve the structure of FXR homologues or portions thereof.","The structure coordinates disclosed herein may be used to determine the structure of the crystalline form of other proteins with significant amino acid or structural homology to any functional domain of a FXR. One method that may be employed for such purpose is molecular replacement. In this method, the unknown crystal structure, whether it is another crystal form of a FXR, a FXR having a mutation of one or more amino acid position(s), or the crystal of some other protein with significant sequence and\/or structural homology to a FXR, may be determined using the coordinates provided herein. This method provides structural information for the unknown crystal in sufficient detail for further evaluation, and is more efficient than attempting to determine such information ab initio. In addition, this method can be used to determine whether or not a given FXR molecule in question falls within the scope of this invention.","The terms \u201cstructure coordinates\u201d, \u201cstructural coordinates\u201d, \u201catomic coordinates\u201d, \u201cdata set\u201d, \u201cX-ray coordinates\u201d or \u201cX-ray data coordinates\u201d as used herein are interchangeable, and refer to a data set (or portions thereof) that defines the three-dimensional structure of a molecule, for example, as set forth in Appendix 1. In particular, the LBD of FXR can be defined by a particular set of points of interaction between specific amino acid residues of the FXR LBD and a ligand therefor, for example, as illustrated in . Amino acid residues of FXR that may be used as reference points of interaction to define the LBD include two or more of Phe288, Leu291, Thr292, Met294, Ala295, His298, Met332, Phe333, Ser336, Ile339, Phe340, Leu344, Leu352, Ile356, Ile361, Tyr365, Met369, Phe370, Tyr373, His451, Met454, Leu455, Trp458, Phe465, Leu469, and Trp473.","In preferred embodiments, crystals of the LBD of FXR complexed with the high affinity agonist fexaramine belong to space group P222with unit cell dimensions of about a=37 \u212b, b=57 \u212b, c=117 \u212b, and \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=90\u00b0. The data sets are derived from mathematical equations related to the patterns obtained on diffraction of a monochromatic beam of X-rays by the atoms (scattering centers) of a protein molecule in crystal form. The diffraction data are used to calculate an electron density map of the repeating unit of the crystal cell. Structure coordinates can be slightly modified and still render nearly identical three-dimensional structures. A measure of a unique set of structure coordinates is the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of the resulting structure. Structure coordinates that render three-dimensional structures that deviate from one another by an r.m.s. deviation of less than about 1.5 \u212b may be viewed as identical since they have little effect on the overall structure, and would not significantly alter the nature of binding associations. Furthermore, those of skill in the art understand that a set of coordinates for a polypeptide or portion thereof, is a relative set of points that define the three-dimensional shape of said polypeptide or portion thereof. As such, it is possible that an entirely different set of structure coordinates could define a similar or identical shape. Hence, the structure coordinates set forth in Appendix 1 are not limited to the express values set forth therein.","X-ray crystallography can elucidate the three-dimensional structure of crystalline forms according to the invention. Typically, the first characterization of crystalline forms by X-ray crystallography can determine the unit cell shape and its orientation in the crystal. The term \u201cunit cell\u201d refers to the smallest and simplest volume element of a crystal that is completely representative of the unit of pattern of the crystal. The dimensions of the unit cell are defined by six numbers: dimensions a, b and c and angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. A crystal can be viewed as an efficiently packed array of multiple unit cells. Detailed descriptions of crystallographic terms are provided in Hahn, TITC, VA, 4Ed., Kluwer Academic Publishers (1996); and Shmueli, TNTC, VB, 1Ed., Kluwer Academic Publishers. The term \u201cspace group\u201d refers to the symmetry of a unit cell. In a space group designation (e.g., P2) the capital letter indicates the lattice type and the other symbols represent symmetry operations that can be carried out on the unit cell without changing its appearance.","The term \u201cselenomethionine substitution\u201d refers to the method of producing a chemically modified form of a protein crystal. The protein is expressed by bacteria in media that is depleted in methionine and supplement with selenomethionine. Selenium is thereby incorporated into the crystal in place of methionine sulfurs. The location(s) of selenium is(are) determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of the crystal. This information is used to generate the phase information used to construct a three-dimensional structure of the protein.","\u201cHeavy atom derivatization\u201d refers to a method of producing a chemically modified form of a protein crystal. In practice, a crystal is soaked in a solution containing heavy atom salts or organometallic compounds, e.g., lead chloride, gold thiomalate, thimerosal, uranyl acetate, and the like, which can diffuse through the crystal and bind to the protein's surface. Locations of the bound heavy atoms can be determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of the soaked crystal. This information is then used to construct phase information which can then be used to construct three-dimensional structures of the enzyme as described in Blundel and Johnson, PC, Academic Press (1976), which is incorporated by reference herein.","The knowledge obtained from X-ray diffraction patterns can be used in the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the binding sites of other homologous polypeptides. This is achieved through the use of commercially available software known in the art that is capable of generating three-dimensional graphical representations of molecules or portions thereof from a set of structure coordinates. The binding domain can also be predicted by various computer models. Based on the structural X-ray coordinates of the solved structure, mutations and variants of the solved structure can also be designed.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer method for producing a three-dimensional representation of a FXR molecule or molecular complex or a homologue of said molecule or molecular complex, wherein said molecule or molecular complex or a homologue of said molecule or molecular complex comprises a LBD defined by structure coordinates obtained from X-ray diffraction data obtained from crystals of said FXR molecule of molecular complex or a homologue thereof. Said computer comprises:\n\n","In preferred embodiments, the structure coordinates are set forth in Appendix 1, or a portion thereof sufficient to define the points of interaction between said LBD and a ligand therefor. The points of interaction can be one or more amino acid residues of the LBD which come into contact with or proximity with a molecule capable of binding the FXR LBD, as illustrated in .","The term \u201cmolecular complex\u201d as used herein refers to a FXR polypeptide or portion thereof combined with one or more additional molecules. For example, in preferred embodiments, the contemplated molecular complex comprises the FXR LBD together with a high affinity agonist, such as, for example, fexaramine, fexarene, ortho-fluoro-fexarene, and the like.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer for determining at least a portion of the structure coordinates corresponding to X-ray diffraction data obtained from a FXR molecule or molecular complex or a homologue of said FXR molecule or molecular complex, said computer comprising:\n\n","The term \u201ccomputer\u201d as used herein can be composed of a central processing unit (for example, the Pentium III from Intel Corporation, or similar processor from Sun, Motorola, Compaq, AMD or International Business Machines, and the like), a working memory which may be random-access memory or core memory, mass storage memory (for example, one or more floppy disk drives, compact disk drives or magnetic tape containing data recorded thereon), at least one display terminal, at least one keyboard and accompanying input and output devices and connections therefor. The computer typically includes a mechanism for processing, accessing and manipulating input data. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer systems are suitable. It should also be noted that the computer can be linked to other computer systems in a network or wide area network to provide centralized access to the information contained within the computer.","Contemplated input devices for entering machine readable data include, for example, telephone modem lines, cable modems, CD-ROMs, a keyboard or disk drives. The computer may advantageously include or be programmed with appropriate software for reading the data from the data storage component or input device, for example computational programs for use in rational drug design that are described in detail below. Contemplated output devices include conventional systems known in the art, for example, display terminals, printers, or disk drives for further storage of output.","Embodiments of the invention include systems (e.g., internet based systems), particularly computer systems which store and manipulate the coordinate and sequence information described herein. One example of a computer system  is illustrated in block diagram form in . As used herein, \u201ca computer system\u201d refers to the hardware components, software components, and data storage components used to analyze the coordinates and sequences such as those set forth in Appendix 1. The computer system  typically includes a processor for processing, accessing and manipulating the sequence data. The processor  can be any well-known type of central processing unit, such as, for example, the Pentium III from Intel Corporation, or similar processor from other suppliers such as Sun, Motorola, Compaq, AMD or International Business Machines.","Typically the computer system  is a general purpose system that comprises the processor  and one or more internal data storage components  for storing data, and one or more data retrieving devices for retrieving the data stored on the data storage components. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer systems are suitable.","In one particular embodiment, the computer system  includes a processor  connected to a bus which is connected to a main memory  (preferably implemented as RAM and one or more internal data storage devices , such as a hard drive and\/or other computer readable media having data recorded thereon. In some embodiments, the computer system  further includes one or more data retrieving device(s)  for reading the data stored on the internal data storage devices .","The data retrieving device  may represent, for example, a floppy disk drive, a compact disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, a modem capable of connection to a remote data storage system (e.g., via the internet), and the like. In some embodiments, the internal data storage device  is a removable computer readable medium such as a floppy disk, a compact disk, a magnetic tape, and the like, containing control logic and\/or data recorded thereon. The computer system  may advantageously include or be programmed by appropriate software for reading the control logic and\/or the data from the data storage component once inserted in the data retrieving device.","The computer system  includes a display  which is used to display output to a computer user. It should also be noted that the computer system  can be linked to other computer systems -in a network or wide area network to provide centralized access to the computer system .","Software for accessing and processing the coordinate and sequences of Appendix 1, (such as search tools, compare tools, and modeling tools etc.) may reside in main memory  during execution.","Computer programs are widely available that are capable of carrying out the activities necessary to model structures and substrates using the crystal structure information provided herein. Examples include, but are not limited to, the computer programs listed below:\n\n","In addition, various general purpose machines may be used with programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may be more convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the operations. However, preferably this is implemented in one or more computer programs executing on programmable systems each comprising at least one processor, at least one data storage system (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. The program is executed on the processor to perform the functions described herein.","\u201cMolecular replacement\u201d refers to generating a preliminary model of a polypeptide whose structure coordinates are unknown, by orienting and positioning a molecule whose structure coordinates are known within the unit cell of the unknown crystal so as to best account for the observed diffraction pattern of the unknown crystal. Phases can then be calculated from this model and combined with the observed amplitudes to give an approximate Fourier synthesis of the structure whose coordinates are unknown. This in turn can be subject to any of the several forms of refinement to provide a final, accurate structure of the unknown crystal (Lattman, 115:55-77 (1985); Rossmann, M G., ed., TMRM(1972), Int. Sci. Rev. Ser. No. 13, Gordon & Breach, New York). Using structure coordinates of the FXR LBD provided herein, molecular replacement may be used to determine the structure coordinates of a crystalline mutant, homologue, or a different crystal form of a FXR LBD.","In accordance with this invention, a FXR polypeptide, or a portion thereof such as the LBD, may be crystallized in association or complex with any known or putative ligands. The crystal structures of a series of such complexes may then be solved by molecular replacement and compared with that of a native FXR molecule. Potential sites for modification within the FXR molecule or a corresponding ligand may thus be identified based on the points of interaction between a ligand and the LBD of FXR. This information provides an additional tool for determining the most efficient binding interactions, for example, increased hydrophobic interactions, between FXR and a putative chemical entity or compound, even before any synthesis or modifications are performed.","All of the complexes referred to above may be studied using well-known X-ray diffraction techniques as described herein, and may be refined versus 2-3 \u212b resolution X-ray data to an R value of about 0.20 or less using computer software, such as X-PLOR (Yale University, 1992, distributed by Molecular Simulations, Inc.). See, e.g., Blundel & Johnson, supra; Methods in Enzymology, vol. 114 and 115, H. W. Wyckoff et al., eds., Academic Press (1985). This information may thus be used to optimize known classes of FXR binding agents or ligand, such as natural bile acids, and to design, modify and\/or synthesize novel classes of FXR ligands.","The modeling or design of compounds or ligands that bind to and\/or modulate a FXR polypeptide according to the invention generally involves consideration of two factors. First, the compound or molecule must be capable of physically and structurally associating with a FXR molecule. Non-covalent molecular interactions important in the association of a FXR with a putative ligand include hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions, and the like.","Second, the compound or molecule must be able to assume a conformation that allows it to associate with a FXR molecule. Although certain portions of the compound or molecule will not directly participate in this association, those portions may still influence the overall conformation of the molecule. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on affinity with the receptor. Such conformational requirements include the overall three-dimensional structure and orientation of the compound or molecule in relation to all or a portion of the binding site, e.g., LBD or any potential accessory binding sites, or the spacing between functional groups of a compound or molecule comprising several chemical entities that directly interact with FXR.","The term \u201cmodeling\u201d as used herein, refers to analysis of the interaction of FXR and a known or test compound or molecule by utilizing a computer generated representation of the molecules, as opposed to physical molecules.","The potential binding of a test compound with a FXR may be analyzed prior to its actual synthesis and testing by the use of computer modeling techniques. If the theoretical structure of the given compound suggests insufficient interaction and association between it and FXR, synthesis and testing of the compound may be obviated. However, if computer modeling indicates a strong interaction, the molecule may then be tested for its ability to bind to FXR. Methods of assaying for FXR activity are known in the art (as identified and discussed herein). Methods for assaying the effect of a potential binding agent can be performed in the presence of a known binding agent of FXR. For example, the effect of the potential binding agent can be assayed by measuring the ability of the potential binding agent to compete with a known binding agent.","A test compound may be computationally evaluated and designed by means of a series of steps in which chemical entities or fragments are screened and selected for their ability to associate with the individual binding pockets or other areas of FXR associated with ligand binding. In particular, the ability to form points of interaction with the approximately 25 amino acid residues of the LBD identified earlier and depicted in  can be assessed.","One skilled in the art may use one of several methods to predict a molecule capable of binding to FXR and to screen test compounds for their ability to associate with a FXR and more particularly with the individual binding pockets or LBD of a FXR polypeptide. This process may begin by visual inspection of, for example, the LBD on the computer screen based on structure coordinates obtained derived from X-ray diffraction data obtained from crystals of FXR, such as those provided in Appendix 1. Selected fragments or chemical entities may then be positioned in a variety of orientations, or docked, within an individual binding pocket of the FXR LBD. Docking may be accomplished using software such as Quanta and Sybyl, followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics forcefields, such as CHARMM and AMBER.","Specialized computer programs may also assist in the process of selecting fragments or chemical entities at this stage. These include:\n\n","Once suitable chemical entities or fragments have been selected, they can be assembled into a single compound that is a candidate ligand. Assembly may be performed by visual inspection of the relationship of the fragments to each other on the three-dimensional image displayed on a computer screen in relation to the structure coordinates of the FXR molecule as set forth in Appendix 1. This would be followed by manual model building using software such as Quanta or Sybyl.","Useful programs to aid one of skill in the art in connecting the individual chemical entities or fragments include:\n\n","In addition to the method of building or identifying a ligand in a stepwise fashion one fragment or chemical entity at a time as described above, FXR ligands may be designed as a whole or \u201cde novo\u201d using either an empty LBD site or optionally including some portion(s) of a known ligand(s). These methods include:\n\n","Other molecular modeling techniques may also be employed in accordance with this invention. See, e.g., Cohen, N. C. et al., \u201cMolecular Modeling Software and Methods for Medicinal Chemistry\u201d, J. Med. Chem., 33, pp. 883-894 (1990). See also, Navia, M. A, and M. A, Murcko, \u201cThe Use of Structural Information in Drug Design\u201d, Current Opinions in Structural Biology, 2, pp. 202-210 (1992).","Once a test compound or binding agent has been designed or selected by the above methods, the efficiency with which that compound may bind to a FXR may be tested and optimized by computational evaluation.","A compound designed or selected as a putative ligand may be further computationally optimized so that in its bound state it would preferably lack repulsive electrostatic interaction with the target site. Such non-complementary (e.g., electrostatic) interactions include repulsive charge-charge, dipole-dipole and charge-dipole interactions. Specifically, the sum of all electrostatic interactions between the binding agent and FXR when the ligand is bound to the FXR, preferably make a neutral or favorable contribution to the enthalpy of binding.","Specific computer software is available in the art to evaluate compound deformation energy and electrostatic interaction. Examples of programs designed for such uses include: Gaussian 92, revision C (M. J. Frisch, Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa., 1992); AMBER, version 4.0 (P. A. Kollman, University of California at San Francisco, 1994); QUANTA\/CHARMM (Molecular Simulations, Inc., Burlington, Mass. 1994); and Insight II\/Discover (Biosysm Technologies Inc., San Diego, Calif., 1994). These programs may be implemented, for example, using a Silicon Graphics workstation, IRIS 4D\/35 or IBM RISC\/6000 workstation model 550. Other hardware systems and software packages will be known to those skilled in the art of which the speed and capacity are continually modified.","Other molecular modeling techniques may also be employed in accordance with this invention.

Biology, 4, pp. 777-781 (1994)]","In another embodiment of the present invention, the crystal structure and structure coordinates may be employed for the design of novel therapeutics. The transactivating capability of FXR on multiple target genes can be modified in new ways with novel compounds identified herein.","Bile acid synthesis is a major pathway for cholesterol disposal and thus represents a potential therapeutic target pathway for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. FXR acts as a bile acid receptor and biological sensor for the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis. FXR is known to regulate cholesterol metabolism in two ways: (1) chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a primary bile acid, binds directly to and activates FXR, which then mediates the feedback suppression by bile acids of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol; and (2) FXR participates in the activation of intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP), which is involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Thus FXR constitutes a potential therapeutic target that can be modulated to enhance the removal of cholesterol from the body. Novel compounds identified by the methods presented herein provide a new tool for regulating or modulating FXR function.","Furthermore, FXR is known to in turn activate a series of target genes. In particular FXR functions as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR). A number of target DNA binding sequences that would be present in target genes have recently been identified. A consensus sequence has been determined, which contains an inverted repeat of the sequence AGGTCA with a 1-base pair spacing (IR-1) (Laffitte et al. (2000) Identification of the DNA binding specificity and potential target genes for the farnesoid X-activated receptor. 275:10638-10647). This sequence was shown to be a high affinity binding site for FXR\/RXR in vitro and to confer ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by FXR\/RXR to a heterologous promoter in response to a bile acid or synthetic retinoid. Although these studies demonstrated that the FXR\/RXR heterodimer binds to the consensus IR-1 sequence with the highest affinity, it was also demonstrated that FXR\/RXR can bind to and activate through a variety of elements including IR-1 elements with changes in the core half-site sequence, spacing nucleotide, and flanking nucleotides. In addition, it was shown that FXR\/RXR can bind to and transactivate through direct repeats. Therefore, by providing novel ways to modulate FXR function, the present invention in turn provides a method of modulating the function of a variety of target genes that are acted upon by FXR.","A FXR modulating agent or compound identified by the methods of the present invention may be administered with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient, in unit dosage form. Conventional pharmaceutical practice may be employed to provide suitable formulations or compositions to administer to a subject suffering from bile acid imbalances, for example. Any appropriate route of administration may be employed, for example, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, aerosol, oral administration, or the like. Therapeutic formulations may be in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions; for oral administration, formulations may be in the form of tablets, capsules or the like; and for intranasal formulations, in the form of powders, nasal drops, aerosols, or the like.","Methods well known in the art for making formulations are found in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th ed. Easton: Mack Publishing Co., 1405-1412, 1461-1487 (1975) and The National Formulary XIV, 14th ed.

Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, sterile water, or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated naphthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide\/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for IAP modulatory agents include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, liposomes, and the like. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel.","The following terms are provided to facilitate the reader's understanding of the crystal compositions of FXR provided herein.","\u201cIsolated\u201d refers to a protein or nucleic acid that has been identified and separated from its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. In one embodiment, the isolated molecule, in the case of a protein, will be purified to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence or to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or silver stain. In the case of a nucleic acid the isolated molecule will preferably be purified to a degree sufficient to obtain a nucleic acid sequence using standard sequencing methods.","As used herein, \u201cnaturally occurring amino acid\u201d and \u201cnaturally occurring R-group\u201d includes L-isomers of the twenty amino acids naturally occurring in proteins. Naturally occurring amino acids are glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, methionine, threonine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, cysteine, proline, histidine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, arginine, and lysine. Unless specially indicated, all amino acids referred to in this application are in the L-form.","\u201cUnnatural amino acid\u201d and \u201cunnatural R-group\u201d includes amino acids that are not naturally found in proteins. Examples of unnatural amino acids included herein are racemic mixtures of selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In addition, unnatural amino acids include the D or L forms of, for example, nor-leucine, para-nitrophenylalanine, homophenylalanine, para-fluorophenylalanine, 3-amino-2-benzylpropionic acid, homoarginines, D-phenylalanine, and the like.","\u201cR-group\u201d refers to the substituent attached to the \u03b1-carbon of an amino acid residue. An R-group is an important determinant of the overall chemical character of an amino acid. There are twenty natural R-groups found in proteins, which make up the twenty naturally occurring amino acids.","\u201c\u03b1-carbon\u201d refers to the chiral carbon atom found in an amino acid residue. Typically, four substituents will be covalently bound to said \u03b1-carbon including an amine group, a carboxylic acid group, a hydrogen atom, and an R-group. The \u03b1-carbon atoms can also be referred to by their crystal structure coordinates as a convenient reference point.","\u201cPositively charged amino acid\u201d and \u201cpositively charged R-group\u201d includes any naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid having a side chain, which is positively charged under normal physiological conditions. Examples of positively charged, naturally occurring amino acids include arginine, lysine, histidine, and the like.","\u201cNegatively charged amino acid\u201d and \u201cnegatively charged R-group\u201d includes any naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid having a side chain, which is negatively charged under normal physiological conditions. Examples of negatively charged, naturally occurring amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and the like.","\u201cHydrophobic amino acid\u201d and \u201chydrophobic R-group\u201d includes any naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid that is relatively insoluble in water. Examples of naturally occurring hydrophobic amino acids are alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, and the like.","\u201cHydrophilic amino acid\u201d and \u201chydrophilic R-group\u201d includes any naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid that is relatively soluble in water. Examples of naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acids include serine, threonine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, and the like.","\u201cDegenerate variations thereof\u201d refers to changing a gene sequence using the degenerate nature of the genetic code to encode proteins having the same amino acid sequence yet having a different gene sequence. For example, FXRs of the present invention are based on amino acid sequences. Degenerate gene variations thereof can be made encoding the same protein due to the plasticity of the genetic code, as described herein.","\u201cExpression\u201d refers to transcription of a gene or nucleic acid sequence, stable accumulation of nucleic acid, and the translation of that nucleic acid to a polypeptide sequence. Expression of genes also involves transcription of the gene to make RNA, processing of RNA into mRNA in eukaryotic systems, and translation of mRNA into proteins. It is not necessary for the genes to integrate into the genome of a cell in order to achieve expression. This definition in no way limits expression to a particular system or to being confined to cells or a particular cell type and is meant to include cellular, transient, in vitro, in vivo, and viral expression systems in both prokaryotic, eukaryotic cells, and the like.","\u201cForeign\u201d or \u201cheterologous\u201d genes refers to a gene encoding a protein whose exact amino acid sequence is not normally found in the host cell.","\u201cPromoter\u201d and \u201cpromoter regulatory element\u201d, and the like, refers to a nucleotide sequence element within a nucleic acid fragment or gene that controls the expression of that gene. These can also include expression control sequences. Promoter regulatory elements, and the like, from a variety of sources can be used efficiently to promote gene expression. Promoter regulatory elements are meant to include constitutive, tissue-specific, developmental-specific, inducible, subgenomic promoters, and the like. Promoter regulatory elements may also include certain enhancer elements or silencing elements that improve or regulate transcriptional efficiency. Promoter regulatory elements are recognized by RNA polymerases, promote the binding thereof, and facilitate RNA transcription.","A polypeptide is a chain of amino acids, regardless of length or post-translational modification (e.g., glycosylation or phosphorylation). A polypeptide or protein refers to a polymer in which the monomers are amino acid residues, which are joined together through amide bonds. When the amino acids are alpha-amino acids, either the L-optical isomer or the D-optical isomer can be used, the L-isomers being typical. An exemplary FXR polypeptide of the invention is provided as an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.","Accordingly, the polypeptides of the invention are intended to cover naturally occurring proteins, as well as those which are recombinantly or synthetically synthesized. Polypeptide or protein fragments are also encompassed by the invention. Fragments can have the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring protein. A polypeptide or peptide having substantially the same sequence means that an amino acid sequence is largely, but not entirely, the same, but retains a functional activity of the sequence to which it is related. In general polypeptides of the invention include peptides, or full-length protein, that contains substitutions, deletions, or insertions into the protein backbone, that would still have an approximately 70%-90% homology to the original protein over the corresponding portion. A yet greater degree of departure from homology is allowed if like-amino acids, i.e. conservative amino acid substitutions, do not count as a change in the sequence.","A polypeptide may be substantially related but for a conservative variation, such polypeptides being encompassed by the invention. A conservative variation denotes the replacement of an amino acid residue by another, biologically similar residue. Examples of conservative variations include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another, such as the substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acids, or glutamine for asparagine, and the like. Other illustrative examples of conservative substitutions include the changes of amine to serine; arginine to lysine; asparagine to glutamine or histidine; aspartate to glutamate; cysteine to serine; glutamine to asparagine; glutamate to aspartate; glycine to proline; histidine to asparagine or glutamine; isoleucine to leucine or valine; leucine to valine or isoleucine; lysine to arginine, glutamine, or glutamate; methionine to leucine or isoleucine; phenylamine to tyrosine, leucine or methionine; serine to threonine; threonine to serine; tryptophan to tyrosine; tyrosine to tryptophan or phenylalanine; valine to isoleucine or leucine, and the like. The term \u201cconservative variation\u201d also includes the use of a substituted amino acid in place of an unsubstituted parent amino acid provided that antibodies raised to the substituted polypeptide also immunoreact with the unsubstituted polypeptide.","Modifications and substitutions are not limited to replacement of amino acids. For a variety of purposes, such as increased stability, solubility, or configuration concerns, one skilled in the art will recognize the need to introduce, (by deletion, replacement, or addition) other modifications. Examples of such other modifications include incorporation of rare amino acids, dextra-amino acids, glycosylation sites, cytosine for specific disulfide bridge formation. The modified peptides can be chemically synthesized, or the isolated gene can be site-directed mutagenized, or a synthetic gene can be synthesized and expressed in bacteria, yeast, baculovirus, tissue culture, and so on.","The term \u201cvariant\u201d refers to polypeptides modified at one or more amino acid residues yet still retain the biological activity of a FXR polypeptide. Variants can be produced by any number of means known in the art, including, for example, methods such as, for example, error-prone PCR, shuffling, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, assembly PCR, sexual PCR mutagenesis, and the like, as well as any combination thereof. Variants of FXR may also be FXR proteins, or isoforms or homologues naturally found in other species.","By \u201csubstantially identical\u201d is meant a polypeptide or nucleic acid exhibiting at least 50%, preferably 60%, more preferably 70%, more preferably 80%, more preferably 85%, more preferably 90%, and most preferably 95% homology to a reference amino acid or nucleic acid sequence.","Sequence homology and identity are often measured using sequence analysis software (e.g., Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, Wis. 53705). The term \u201cidentity\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using any number of sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. The term \u201chomology\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are homologous or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are homologous when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region as measured using any number of sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Programs as mentioned above allow for amino acid substitutions with similar amino acids matches by assigning degrees of homology to determine a degree of homology between the sequences being compared.","For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.","A \u201ccomparison window\u201d, as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequence for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, 2-482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Person & Lipman, 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Other algorithms for determining homology or identity include, for example, in addition to a BLAST program (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool at the National Center for Biological Information), ALIGN, AMAS (Analysis of Multiply Aligned Sequences), AMPS (Protein Multiple Sequence Alignment), ASSET (Aligned Segment Statistical Evaluation Tool), BANDS, BESTSCOR, BIOSCAN (Biological Sequence Comparative Analysis Node), BLIMPS (BLocks IMProved Searcher), FASTA, Intervals & Points, BMB, CLUSTAL V, CLUSTAL W, CONSENSUS, LCONSENSUS, WCONSENSUS, Smith-Waterman algorithm, DARWIN, Las Vegas algorithm, FNAT (Forced Nucleotide Alignment Tool), Framealign, Framesearch, DYNAMIC, FILTER, FSAP (Fristensky Sequence Analysis Package), GAP (Global Alignment Program), GENAL, GIBBS, GenQuest, ISSC (Sensitive Sequence Comparison), LALIGN (Local Sequence Alignment), LCP (Local Content Program), MACAW (Multiple Alignment Construction & Analysis Workbench), MAP (Multiple Alignment Program), MBLKP, MBLKN, PIMA (Pattern-Induced Multi-sequence Alignment), SAGA (Sequence Alignment by Genetic Algorithm) and WHAT-IF. Such alignment programs can also be used to screen genome databases to identify polynucleotide sequences having substantially identical sequences. A number of genome databases are available, for example, a substantial portion of the human genome is available as part of the Human Genome Sequencing Project (J. Roach, accessible on the world wide web (www) at the URL \u201cweber.u.Washington.edu\/\u02dcroach\/human_genome_progress 2.html\u201d) (Gibbs, 1995). Several databases containing genomic information annotated with some functional information are maintained by different organization, and are accessible via the internet on the world wide wed (www), for example, at the URL \u201ctigr.org\/tdb\u201d; \u201cgenetics.wisc.edu\u201d; \u201cgenome-www.stanford.edu\/\u02dcball\u201d; \u201chiv-web.lanI.gov\u201d; \u201cncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u201d; \u201cebi.ac.uk\u201d; \u201cPasteur.fr\/other\/biology\u201d; and \u201cgenome.wi.mit.edu\u201d.","One example of a useful algorithm is BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., 25:3389-3402 (1977), and Altschul et al., 215:403-410 (1990), respectively. Software for performing BLASE analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information on the world wide web (www) at the URL \u201cncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u201d. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLAT program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectations (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see. Henikoff & Henikoff, 89:10915 (1989)) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands.","The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin & Altschul, 90:5873 (1993)). One measure of similarity provided by BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a references sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.","In one embodiment, protein and nucleic acid sequence homologies are evaluated using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (\u201cBLAST\u201d) In particular, five specific BLAST programs are used to perform the following task:\n\n","The BLAST programs identify homologous sequences by identifying similar segments, which are referred to herein as \u201chigh-scoring segment pairs,\u201d between a query amino or nucleic acid sequence and a test sequence which is preferably obtained from a protein or nucleic acid sequence database. High-scoring segment pairs are preferably identified (i.e., aligned) by means of a scoring matrix, many of which are known in the art. Preferably, the scoring matrix used is the BLOSUM62 matrix (Gonnet et al., Science 256:1443-1445 (1992); Henikoff and Henikoff, Proteins 17:49-61 (1993)). Less preferably, the PAM or PAM250 matrices may also be used (see, e.g., Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds., , Washington: National Biomedical Research Foundation (1978)). BLAST programs are accessible through the U.S. National Library of Medicine, e.g., accessible on the world wide web (www) at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.","The parameters used with the above algorithms may be adapted depending on the sequence length and degree of homology studied. In some embodiments, the parameters may be the default parameters used by the algorithms in the absence of instructions from the user.","A detailed description of FXR LBD structure is provided below as a preferred embodiment of the invention.","The crystal structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of human FXR (hFXR, amino acids 248-476 of SEQ ID NO:1) in complex with the novel potent agonist identified herein, fexaramine was determined to 1.78 \u212b resolution. The hFXR LBD adopts a 12 alpha helix bundle as seen in all NHR LBD structures (RXR\u03b1 (Egea et al. (2000). Crystal structure of the human RXRa ligand-binding domain to its natural ligand: 9-cis retinoic acid EMBO J. 19, 2592-2601), PXR\/SXR (Watkins et al. (2001). The Human Nuclear Xenobiotic Receptor PXR: Structural Determinants of Directed Promiscuity, Science, 292, 2329-2333), PPAR\u03b3 (Xu et al. (2001). Structural determinants of ligand binding selectivity between the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 98(24), 13919-24) and ROR\u03b2 (Stehlin et al. (2001). X-ray structure of the orphan nuclear receptor RORbeta ligand-binding domain in the active conformation. EMBO J. 20(21), 5822-31; see ). The most significant difference between FXR and other NHRs (RXR, VDR and PPARs) is in the replacement of the \u03b2-turn found following helix 5 with a more pronounced helix 6 (see ). Also, the 15-residue insertion region between helices 1 and 3 is completely disordered in the FXR crystal structure (see  and B). RXR\u03b1, which most closely resembles FXR in both primary sequence and length of the insertion region, has an additional helix (helix 2) in this position in the absence of ligand that unfolds upon binding of 9-cis retinoic acid (Egea et al. (2000, supra). This region of RXR\u03b1 has been proposed to act as a \u201cmolecular spring\u201d that accommodates the large conformational movements of helix 3 upon ligand binding. The insertion region may serve a similar role in hFXR, facilitating helix 3 rearrangements upon ligand binding. In the PPARs, this region contains a helix 2 and is the proposed ligand access site for the binding pocket. In SXR (Watkins et al (2001), supra) and VDR (Rochel et al. (2000). The Crystal Structure of the Nuclear Receptor for Vitamin D Bound to its Natural Ligand. Mol Cell 5, 173-179) the insertion domain region is significantly longer (see ). Analysis of root mean square deviations (RMSD) between the apo and ligand bound structures of SXR and VDR revealed no significant differences, suggesting that a shorter insertion domain region may be responsible for regulating large rearrangements of helix 3.","Significantly, the activation function-2 domain (AF2 or helix 12), essential for transcriptional activation of the receptor is packed against the body of FXR, positioned between helices 3 and 4 (see ). This dosed or active conformation is a signature feature that enables stable interactions between NHRs and their co-activator accessory protein partners (Xu et al. (2001), supra). By homology with NHR LBD structures, the LXXLL co-activator binding sequence would interact with the hydrophobic pocket formed between helices 3, 4, 5, and 12 that interacts with the hydrophobic face of the LXXLL helix located within co-activator proteins.","The ligand-binding cavity of the hFXR LBD is predominantly hydrophobic in nature and is formed by about 25 amino acids (see ). The binding pocket has a volume of 726 Awhich is smaller than that seen in SXR (1150 A) (Watkins et al. (2001), supra), but larger than that of RXR\u03b1 (439 A) (Egea et al. (2000), supra; see ). The fexaramine is sequestered between a helices 3 and 7 and makes significant contacts with helices 5, 6, 11 and 12 (see ).","Interactions between FXR and fexaramine can be divided into two sets. The first set stabilizes the hexyl ring and the first benzene ring as well as the methyl ester moieties. The hexyl group makes minimal van der Waals contacts with Ile339 and Leu344 (helix 5), while Phe333 helix 5) and Met369 and Phe370 (helix 7) create a hydrophobic surface behind fexaramine's central nitrogen and single benzyl group. Met294 (helix 3) as well as Leu352 and Ile356 (helix 6) stabilize the aliphatic linker between the first benzene ring and the methyl ester moiety (see ). The methyl ester itself occupies a neutral groove between helices 3 and 6 and is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds from the NE2 proton of His298 (helix 3) and the hydroxyl of Ser336 (helix 5) to the amide carbonyl oxygen of fexaramine.","The second set of interactions stabilizes the biaryl rings and the dimethyl amine moiety. Phe288, Leu291, Thr292, and Ala295 (helix 3) form a hydrophobic surface on one side, while Ile361 (helix 6 and loop 7) and His451, Met454, Leu455, and Trp458 (helix 11) form a hydrophobic surface on the other side of fexaramine's double ring structure. Phe465 (helix 11 and loop 12) and Leu469 and Trp473 (helix 12) bridge the hydrophobic surface from the helix 11 region to helix 3 creating a deep hydrophobic pocket that is filled by the biaryl moiety (see ).","Thus, some combination of at least two of these amino acid residues in particular, and\/or the structure coordinates corresponding thereto, can be used to define the points of interaction between a known or putative ligand or molecule capable of binding to FXR, and a FXR molecule.","The present invention provides novel chemical tools that activate FXR in a highly potent and specific fashion. Fexaramine was identified by utilization of a cell-based assay to screen a combinatorial library of approximately 10000 benzopyran compounds. The original compounds were discovered from the screen-activated FXR in the low \u03bcM range and were unique in chemical structure. Once discovered, these compounds were then systematically optimized to subsequently elucidate a high affinity agonist for FXR, termed fexaramine. The compound is chemically distinct from other synthetic and physiological agonists previously reported for FXR. Intensive structure activity analysis of this compound determined that the 3-methylcinnamate moiety in region I in addition to the cyclohexyl amide unit in region II are optimal for FXR agonist activity. Addition of a biaryl amine subunit at region III was necessary to achieve the maximal efficacy on FXR.","Characterization of fexaramine was undertaken and reported using both in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro assays established that fexaramine and related ligands robustly recruited the co-activator SRC-1 peptide to FXR in a manner comparable to that of GW4064. Rigorous analysis of cell based in vivo assays with FXR response elements (ECRE and ERA) and natural promoters of known target genes IBABP, PLTP and MRP-2 showed that these ligands could potently activate FXR in a concentration-dependent manner. When tested in cross reactivity experiments the fexaramine class of ligands showed no activity against a diverse range of other nuclear hormone receptors. Unlike the fexaramine class of compounds, GW4064 required the accessory protein RXR to achieve maximal efficacy in the chimeric GAL4DBD-FXR-LBD protein. This suggests that the in vivo binding of GW4064 to FXR may recognize the FXR\/RXR heterodimer preferentially. Induction of known target genes in both intestinal and liver cell systems demonstrated the usefulness of the identified compounds in studying FXR target genes. In intestinal cells treatment with fexaramine robustly induced the IBABP gene in a concentration dependent manner with efficacy similar to GW4064. Likewise, in the HEPG2 liver cell system, strong induction of target genes SHP, PLTP BSEP and MRP-2 was achieved at comparable concentrations of fexaramine and GW4064.","The specificity and efficacy of fexaramine allowed for a more detailed investigation of FXR target genes. Gene profiling of primary liver hepatocytes treated with three chemically distinct classes of FXR agonists revealed surprisingly little overlap. This exemplifies the difficulties of investigating NHR function using a ligand present at high physiological concentrations, and highlights the need for specific synthetic ligands. However, high affinity synthetic compounds tailored for the target protein may have non-specific effects on other pathways. This potential cross-reactivity may necessitate the development of multiple synthetic ligands to accurately discern receptor pathways and physiological relevance.","The crystal structure of FXR complexed with fexaramine allowed modeling of CDCA with a high degree of confidence into the ligand-binding pocket of FXR. This model provides a molecular explanation for the selectivity of BAs on FXR and highlighted the importance of position and orientation of the hydroxyl groups (position 7 and 3) in binding affinity. Specifically, this model provides a rationale for the beneficial effects of UDCA in the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Although UDCA has two hydroxyl groups to potentially form hydrogen bonds with FXR in the ligand-binding cavity, their trans configuration create a more open ligand-binding pocket that would destabilize helix 12 and thereby inhibit activation of the receptor.","The present invention integrates chemical, genetic, and structural approaches to the analysis of FXR. In doing so, the present invention provides valuable and novel chemical tools to study the function of the receptor and also elucidates how FXR interacts with physiological natural and synthetic ligands at the molecular level.","The invention will now be described in greater detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples.","Expression and Reporter Constructs","The expression plasmids pCMX, pCMX-LacZ, pCMX-mFXRFL, pCMX-hRXRFL, pCMX-GALDBD-rFXRLBD and other pCUX-GALDBD-NR LBDs (hRXR\u03b1, hPPAR\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4, mPXR, hPXR, hLXR\u03b1, HTR\u03b2, hRAR\u03b2, mCAR, mERR3 and hVDR) have been described elsewhere (Blumberg et al.

(2000) Dissection of malonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylation from polyketide formation in the reaction mechanism of a plant polyketide synthase. Biochemistry 39, 890-902) prokaryote protein expression vectors. DNA fragments containing hFXR aa248 to 476 were cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-hFXR, while the cloning sites NcoI and BamHI sites were used in pHIS8-3.","The retroviral plasmids were constructed by cloning FXRFL, FXR-AF2 and VP16 FXR cDNAs into the BamHI site of the established pBABE retroviral backbone vector. Viral extracts were established using published procedures and used to infect HT29 colon cells which, after exposure for 24 hours, were selected by addition of 4 \u03bcg\/ml of the drug puromycin. Cells that survived this selection procedure were then pooled and analyzed for the expression of the FXR gene.","All constructs were verified by double-stranded sequencing to confirm identity and reading frame. Detailed information regarding each construct is available upon request.","For transfection of these constructs, monkey CV-1 HEPG2 and HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U\/ml penicillin G, and 50 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37\u00b0 C. in 7% CO2. CV-1 cells (60%-70% confluence, 48-well plate) were cotransfected with 16.6 ng of the appropriate expression vector, 100 ng of reporter plasmid, and 100 ng of pCMX-LacZ in 200 \u03bcl of DMEM containing 10% FBS by the N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP)-mediated procedure. After 24 hr, the medium was replaced, and cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity 36-48 hr after transfection. The luciferase activity was normalized to the level of \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.","Solid Phase Synthesis of Small Molecule Ligands","The synthesis of this library was carried out on solid phase in a parallel fashion as summarized in the diagram below. Thus, Boc-protected cinnamic acid 1 was immobilized on Merrifield resin through the action of CsCOto afford conjugate 2. The Boc group was removed from this resin by treatment with 20% TFA (for abbreviations see the legend of diagram below) in CHCland the resultant resin-bound amine was reductively alkylated with 4-bromobenzaldehyde in the presence of NaCNBHto yield amino resin 3. Resin 3 was acylated with one of three acyl groups to give amide or urea resins 4. The acylated resins (4) were then subjected to either a Heck coupling [Pd(dba), P(o-tol), EtN] with thirteen substituted styrenes or a Suzuki coupling [Pd(PPh), CsCO] with eighteen boronic acids to yield stilbene resins 5 and biaryl resins 6, respectively. Cleavage of the resulting compounds from resins 5 and 6 with NaOMe yielded methyl cinnamates 7 and 8. Analysis of the library by LCMS after purification showed the average purity of these compounds to be >95%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0179","num":"0220"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"128.02mm","wi":"222.00mm","file":"US07647217-20100112-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sub":["2","3","3","4"],"sup":"1"},"To discover novel small molecule ligands for FXR, a constructed combinatorial library of approximately 10 000 benzopyran compounds was screened using a cell-based assay in a 384 well format (Nicolaou et al. (2000). Natural product-like combinatorial libraries based on privileged structures. 1. General principles and solid-phase synthesis of benzopyrans. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, 9939-9953; Natural product-like combinatorial libraries based on privileged structures. 2. Construction of a 10000-membered benzopyran library by directed split-and-pool chemistry using nanokans and optical encoding. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, 9954-9967; and Natural product-like combinatorial libraries based on privileged structures. 3. The \u201clibraries from libraries\u201d principle for diversity enhancement of benzopyran libraries. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, 9968-9976). This cell-based screen was based on the co-transfection of an expression vector containing the full-length FXR receptor with a reporter vector. The reporter vector contains a hormone response element under a minimal eukaryotic promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene. The initial screen identified several lead compounds, possessing activities ranging from 5-10 \u03bcM and whose prototypical structure (1) is shown in . Lead compounds were re-tested and checked for cross-reactivity for the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the heterodimeric partner of FXR. None of the identified compounds had the ability to bind or activate RXR.","Systematic optimization of regions I and II of the prototypical structure through multiple rounds of screening using smaller \u201cfocused\u201d chemical libraries defined the requisite features of these domains for high affinity binding to FXR. Specifically, incorporation of the 3-methylcinnamate moiety in region I and the cyclohexyl amide unit in region II resulted in a more than 10-fold enhancement in the potency, as demonstrated by compound 2 (EC=358 nM) (). Preliminary exploration of region III suggested that replacement of the parent benzopyran unit with styrenyl and biaryl moieties within this latter scaffold (2) would yield compounds with even higher potency. This intelligence gathering was then used to design and synthesize on a solid support a focused library of 94 new compounds for further optimization.","Screening of the synthesized compound library led to the discovery of several highly potent ligands including (see ); A [coined fexaramine: EC=25 nM], B [coined fexarine: EC=38 nM] and C [coined fexarene: EC=36 nM], as well as many lower affinity compounds such as D [coined SRI-1: EC=377 nM] and E [coined SRI-2: EC=343 nM], the structures of which are shown in . Furthermore, these compounds are structurally distinct from the known natural and synthetic ligands for FXR; the BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and GW4064 shown in  F and G. GW4064 exhibited ECvalues of approximately 90 nM, comparable to the known values.","To determine if the compounds identified as ligands could promote the association of FXR with co-activators in vitro, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based coactivator binding assay was employed (see, for example, Makishima et al. (1999), supra; Urizar et al. (2002). A natural product that lowers cholesterol as an antagonist ligand for FXR. Science. 296(5573), 1703-6). This assay relies on an agonist-induced interaction between the nuclear receptor and its coactivator bringing two fluorogenic partners together resulting in the nuclear receptor ligand-dependent FRET. Specific recruitment of a peptide containing the receptor binding domain of the steroid receptor co-activator SRC-1 (LXXLL) to the FXR ligand-binding domain was only observed in the presence of the agonists fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene, SRI-1, SRI-2 and GW4064 (see ). GW4064 demonstrated the strongest recruitment with an ECvalue of 100 nM followed by fexaramine (EC255 nM), fexarine (EC222 nM), and fexarene (EC\u2248255 nM). Weaker recruitment is seen with compounds SRI-1 and SRI-2.","The ability of these compounds to activate the receptor in a number of different cell-based reporter gene assays was then determined. The recently identified high affinity non-steroidal synthetic compound GW4064 was used as a control in these experiments. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for mouse FXR and human RXR with a thymidine kinase (minimal promoter reporter vector containing either no copies or six copies of the ecdysone response element (ECRE), a well-characterized FXR response element (FXRE). In addition, two copies of the recently identified FXRE everted repeat separated by 8 nucleotides (ER-8) was also studied (see, for example, Laffitte et al. (2000). Identification of the DNA binding specificity and potential target genes for the farnesoid X-activated receptor. J Biol. Chem. 275(14), 10638-47; Kast et al. (2002). Regulation of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (ABCC2) by the nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor, farnesoid X-activated receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor. J Biol Chem. 277(4), 2908-15).","The cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene, SRI-1, SRI-2 or GW4064. The results depicted in  and C show that fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene and GW4064 showed robust activation of both of the FXREs (ECRE 100-fold; ER-8 4-fold) with a maximal activity achieved at 1 \u03bcM (concentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM were tested but produced no more activity). The compounds SRI-1 and SRI-2, although structurally similar to fexaramine, showed little or no activity. Novel compounds identified above showed no activity on the minimal TK promoter. However, GW4064 displayed a weak activity (less than 2 fold) on this promoter (see ). Similar results were found in a variety of different cell types including liver cells (HEPG2) and kidney cells (HEK 293).","Having demonstrated that the newly identified compounds could robustly activate multiple copies of FXREs linked to a TK minimal promoter, the ability of the compounds to activate natural promoters of known FXR targets in a transient transfection cell-based assay was examined. For this study, the following gene promoters were used: intestinal bile acid binding protein (IBABP; see, for example, Grober et al. (1999). Identification of a bile acid-responsive element in the human ileal bile acid-binding protein gene. Involvement of the farnesoid X receptor\/9-is-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer. J Biol Chem. 274(42), 29749-54>, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (Urizar et al (2000). The farnesoid X-activated receptor mediates bile acid activation of phospholipid transfer protein gene expression. J Biol Chem. 275(50), 39313-7) and multidrug resistance related protein 2 (MRP-2) (Kast et al. (2002), supra), which are all well characterized targets of FXR. The natural promoters of both the IBABP and PLTP genes contain one copy of an inverted repeat with a one base spacing (IR-1) while MRP-2 contains an ER-8 element. The results obtained, shown in  D (hIBABP promoter), E (hPLTP promoter) and F (hMRP-2 promoter), were similar to experiments with multiple FXRE copies with maximum efficacy of the fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene and GW4064 compounds observed at 1 \u03bcM, while SRI-1 and SRI-2 showed little or no activity. The most robust activation (28-fold) was seen on the IBABP promoter. Less robust (2-3 fold) but specific activation was observed on the PLTP and MRP-2 promoters.","Cell-based transcriptional activation assays using chimeric nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) constructs were established to measure the selectivity of the compounds to FXR relative to other NHRs (Forman et al. (1995). Identification of a nuclear receptor that is activated by farnesol metabolites. Cell 81, 687-693). These assays used fusion proteins with the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain connected to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NHRs. These constructs were co-transfected with a thymidine kinase C minimal promoter reporter vector containing four copies of the GAL4 binding site. Titration experiments were then performed using the identified compounds.  show that fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene and GW4064 all activate the chimeric FXR construct in the presence and absence of RXR. Interestingly, fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene are more efficacious ligands for FXR than GW4064 in the absence of RXR suggesting some difference between the mechanism of activation between the two classes of compounds. Addition of RXR had no effect on the activation potential of fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene in this assay. Compounds SRI-1 and SRI-2 again showed little or no activity consistent with previous results.","In this assay fexaramine, fexarine and fexarene were highly selective for FXR. No activity was observed on other chimeric NHR constructs including hRXR\u03b1, hPPAR\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4, mPXR, hPXR, hLXR\u03b1, hTR\u03b2, hRAR\u03b2, mCAR, mERR3 and hVDR (see ).","RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization","HepG2 or HT29-derived cell lines were typically cultured in medium containing superstripped FBS for 24 hr before the addition of a ligand or DMSO (vehicle) for an additional 24-48 hr. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and was resolved (10 \u03bcg\/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and cross-linked to the membrane with UV light.","cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [\u03b1-P]dCTP using the highprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Membranes were hybridized using the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were normalized for variations of RNA loading by hybridization to a control probe, either, 18 S ribosomal cDNA, or the ribosomal protein 36B4. The RNA levels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant software; Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.) in addition to being exposed to X-ray film.","RNA Analysis of FXR Target Genes","The liver and the intestinal system are the major areas where FXR plays a role in the induction of specific gene targets in response to bile acid (BA) concentrations. To establish that the identified compounds are effective in studying the function of FXR in these systems, the compounds were examined for their ability to induce characterized gene targets. In addition to the ability to induce characterized gene targets, invention compounds are also useful for identification of gene targets for FXR, i.e., genes which are modulated (i.e., induced or repressed) by FXR.","Human colon cells HT29 (FXR null until differentiated) were infected with retroviral vectors that expressed either FXR constructs and the puromycin-resistant gene or the puromycin-resistant gene alone. Puromycin resistant cells were isolated and pooled cell populations were propagated that harbored either the vector alone (HT29-BABE), overexpressed FXR full length (HT29-FXRFL), a non-functional FXR truncated at the AF2 region (HT29-FXR-AF2), or a constitutively active FXR that has the VP16 activation domain fused N-terminal of the protein (HT29-VP16-FXR). Confirmation of the successful establishment of the different stable cell lines was established via northern blot analysis of FXR message levels in the cells (see ).","HT29-BABE lines do not express FXR while the stable cell lines expressed the exogenous FXR message. To test the ability of these cell lines to induce FXR target genes total RNA was isolated from cells treated overnight with increasing amounts of CDCA or GW4064. Northern blot analysis of the HT29-FXRFL cell line showed robust concentration dependent induction of IBABP mRNA by both CDCA and GW4064 (see ). Maximal activation of the IBABP gene by CDCA was observed at 100 \u03bcM while only 1 \u03bcM of GW4064 was needed to achieve the same level of induction. No induction of IBABP mRNA levels was observed in the HT29-BABE or HT29-FXR-AF2 cell lines. Constitutive expression was seen in the HT29-VP16-FXR and was super-induced by addition of CDCA and GW4064. These observations verify the usefulness of this colon cell model system for studying the induction of FXR target genes.","The ability of the novel compounds identified herein to induce IBABP gene expression in this cell system was also examined. Total RNA from HT29 stable cells treated overnight with fexaramine, fexarine and fexarene was probed for IBABP gene expression (see ). Fexaramine, fexarine and fexarene all induced expression of the IBABP mRNA in the HT29-FXRFL with similar profiles to that seen for GW4064 (maximal activity at 1 \u03bcM concentration). No induction was seen in the HT29-BABE or HT29-FXR-AF2 cell lines, proving the specificity of the compounds. These results demonstrate that the novel compounds of the present invention are effective in studying FXR target genes in an intestinal model cell system.","To demonstrate the usefulness of these compounds in studying FXR function in the liver, a model hepatocyte cell system that expresses the FXR gene was employed (Kast et al. (2002), supra). Confluent HEPG2-FXR cells were treated overnight with increasing concentrations of fexaramine, fexarine, fexarene SRI-1, SRI-2 and the control ligands GW4064 and CDCA. Total RNA was isolated and the expression of the FXR target genes SHP, MRP-2, BSEP and PLTP was measured by Northern blot analysis (see ).","The control ligands CDCA and GW4064 showed similar induction of the target genes to what has been previously reported. Of the novel compounds identified herein, fexaramine was the most effective inducer of target genes, although strong induction was also observed with fexarine and fexarene. In this hepatocyte cell system, maximal activation of FXR target genes by these compounds was achieved at 10 \u03bcM, which is similar to the control ligand GW4064. Interestingly, although GW4064 showed slightly better induction of the FXR target genes PLTP and SHP, fexaramine matched GW4064 induced activation of the BSEP and MRP-2 genes. These results demonstrate that these novel compounds can be used to identify and characterize new FXR target genes in the liver and the intestinal cell systems. Differences in efficacy of target gene induction between the liver and the intestinal cell systems may reflect the ability of the liver hepatocytes to mount a xenobotic response or cell specific permeability to the identified compounds. Modification of the ligands to overcome these effects may be made in order to increase the efficacy of these drugs in liver cell systems.","Further evidence that invention compounds can be used to identify and characterize additional FXR gene targets is provided by the large scale screening summarized in Appendix 2 (for genes upregulated by invention compounds) and Appendix 3 (for genes downregulated by invention compounds).","Having established fexaramine as a potent FXR specific agonist in two model cell systems, its gene activation profile with CDCA and GW4064 in human primary hepatocytes was then compared. Hepatocytes were treated with DMSO (control group), fexaramine (10 \u03bcM), CDCA (100 \u03bcM, or GW4064 (10 M and total RNA isolated at 6 and 12-hour time points. Prior to gene profiling experiments the samples were verified by Northern blot analysis for induction of a known FXR target gene SHP (see ). Subsequently, biotinylated cRNAs prepared from mRNA samples were hybridized to duplicate sets of high-density microarrays (U-133A set Affymetrix, Palo Alto, Calif.) to minimize experimental error.","A total of 222 transcripts were identified whose expression changed with respect to DMSO using a paired student's T-test. These genes were then subjected to hierarchal clustering and visualized using the Treeview. The most striking observation was the very unique profiles seen by the different FXR agonists (see ). Relatively few genes were observed whose expression changed with all three agonists. This may, in part, be due to CDCA regulating genes via non-FXR pathways. The recent body of work by Wang et al supports this idea, which demonstrated that BAs mediate repression of the CYP7A in a SHP independent manner through the activation of the xenobiotic receptor PXR or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK (Wang et al. (2002), supra).","In addition, a small subset of genes (see ) were changed over 3-fold by all three FXR ligands. The largest change was seen in the apolipoprotein E gene repression. This result correlates with levels observed in FXR null mice where increases in apoE levels in the VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions were seen when compared with wild-type mice (Sinal et al. (2000), supra). This list suggests additional roles for FXR in the bilirubin biosynthetic pathway (BLVRA 5-fold), thyroid metabolism (TSHR 3-fold; thyroid transcription factor 1 3-fold) and amino acid transport (SCL7A2 4-fold), as well as other pathways (see also Appendix 2 and Appendix 3). Confirmation of gene induction by FXR agonists of many of the genes reported in this list have been checked by Northern blot analysis as well.","The plasmids pGEX or pHIS8-3-hFXR LBD (residues 248 to 476 of SEQ ID NO:1) were transformed into strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) and cells were grown at 37\u00b0 C. to an O.D.of 1.0. Protein expression was induced by adding iso-propyl-thio-galactose (Boehringer Mannheim) at a concentration of 0.1 mM and cells were allowed to grow for 6 hr at 20\u00b0 C. Bacteria were harvested at 8,000\u00d7g at 5\u00b0 C. and pellets were stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-Ca (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME) (Sigma) at 4\u00b0 C.","Resuspended cells were sonicated and lysates were centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. Supernatants were purified by Ni-chelation chromatography (QIAGEN). Protein sample was eluted in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 10 mM \u03b2-ME. The N-terminal octahistidine tag was removed by thrombin (Sigma) digestion during dialysis against 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM dithiotheitol (DTT) at 4\u00b0 C. for 24 h. The sample was purified over Superdex 200 26\/60 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in dialysis\/thrombin cleavage buffer. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed against 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) 62.5 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, concentrated to 15 mg mlusing Centricon 10 (Amicon), and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. Selenomethionine substituted protein (SeMet) was obtained from grown in minimal media using the methionine pathway inhibition methods (Doubli\u00e9 (1997). Preparation of selenomethionyl proteins for phase determination. Methods Enzymol. 276, 523-530) and was purified similarly to the native sample.","Crystallization and Structure Determination","Complexing of the receptor with the ligand was accomplished by incubating hFXR (15 mg ml) with fexaramine at a 1:2 molar ratio. Fexaramine was solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM. Crystals of the hFXR-LBD with fexaramine were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion methods at 4\u00b0 C. by mixing 1.0 \u03bcl of hFXR-LBD\/fexaramine complex with 1.0 \u03bcl of a reservoir solution containing 15%-20% PEG 8000, 100 mM HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 0.2 M Mg 1 mM DTT. Crystals of selenomethionine-substituted hFXR-LBD were grown similarly with an increase in DTT concentration to 10 mM. Crystals were stabilized in 10%-15% glycerol, 20% PEG 8000, 0.2 M MgCl, 100 mM HEPES-Na(pH 7.5), and 10 mM DTT and rapidly frozen in a 100K stream of nitrogen gas.","MAD data to 2.1 \u212b was collected around the Se edge at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) on beamline FIP (BM30A). Native data to 1.78 \u212b was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 9-1. All data was processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor (1997). Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode. Methods Enzymol. 276, 307-326). The crystals contain one molecule per asymmetric unit (52.9% solvent) and belong to the space group P222(a=36.656, b=56.776, c=17.646, \u03b1=90.0, \u03b2=90.0, \u03b3=90.0). Three wavelength MAD data were scaled to the \u03bband verified by inspection of both dispersive and anomalous difference. 7 of 9 Se sites were located and MAD phasing was done with SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen (1992). Automated MAD and MIR structure solution. Acta Crystallogr. D 55, 849-861.) and density modification was carried out with RESOLVE (Terwilliger (2000) \u201cMaximum likelihood density modification,\u201d Acta Cryst. D56, 965-972).","The initial model was built into the experimental electron density maps displayed in O (Jones et al. (1991) Improved methods for building protein models in electron density maps and the location of errors in these models. Acta Crystallogr. A 47, 110-119). The resulting model was positionally refined against all the high-resolution native data set using the default bulk solvent model in CNS with maximum likelihood targets (Brunger et al. (1998). Crystallography & NMR system: A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination. Acta Crystallogr. D 54, 905-921). The structure of FXR was refined to a Rand a Rvalue of 23.0% and 27.5%, using all data extending to 1.78 \u212b resolution. The R-factor=\u03a3|F\u2212F|\/\u03a3, where summation is over the data used for refinement and the Rwas calculated using 5% of the reflection data chosen and excluded from refinement. The model consists of residues 248 to 270 and 286 to 475 of human FXR, 1 fexaramine molecule, and 340 water molecules. PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. (1993). PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 26, 283-291) revealed a total of 92% of the residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and 8% in the additionally allowed region. Main chain and side chain structural parameters were consistently better than average (overall G value of 0.16).","The structure of the activated form of the FXR LBD allowed investigation of how BAs, structurally distinct physiological ligands for FXR, bind and activate the receptor. The bile acid CDCA was initially modeled into the FXR binding pocket by overlaying its steroidal backbone onto the biaryl group in fexaramine (see ). The model suggested that potential hydrogen bonds could occur between CDCA's hydroxyl groups and Tyr365, Tyr373, and His451 in helices 7 and 11. These interactions were subsequently used to refine the modeled orientation of the ligand. In this model, hydrophobic interactions with CDCA are predicted to secure helix 3 in a similar orientation to that seen in the complex with fexaramine.","This model also provides an explanation for the partial activation of FXR by lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) (Makishima et al. (1999), supra). These BAs lack one of the two hydroxyl groups (the \u03b1OH at position 7) found in CDCA and therefore are predicted to interact significantly only with the helix 7. These BAs would therefore not bridge helix 3 to helix 7 as securely as CDCA, which in turn, would affect the rigidity of helix 12. In addition, although the inhibitory BA ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has two hydroxyl groups, their trans rather than cis relationship would orientate UDCA in a manner that would create a more open ligand-binding pocket. This in turn may force a less than optimal orientation of helix 12 and result in inhibition of the co-activator interaction.","Modeling of the recently identified synthetic BA agonist 6alpha-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid 6-ECDCA, onto the positional coordinates for the CDCA model further supports the model and suggests a mechanism for its efficacy (Pellicciari et al. (2002). 6-alpha-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA), a potent and selective FXR agonist endowed with anticholestatic activity. J Med Chem. 45(17), 3569-72). 6-ECDCA differs from CDCA by an addition of an aliphatic moiety at the 6\u03b1 position. The ethyl substituent at this position would be predicted to fit snugly into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Met332 and Phe333 from helix 5. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that either a methyl substituent or a bulkier group at this position reduced efficacy (Pellicciari et al. (2002), supra). This model would predict that a methyl substituent would not be not as effective as an ethyl group because it does not fill the hydrophobic pocket as well as the ethyl group and therefore would not maximize binding energy through an increase in contact surface resulting in a loss of efficacy. Bulkier substituents would also be unfavorable, as they would surpass the 0.3 \u212b limit allowed for in overlap before Van der Waals contacts would become energetically unfavorable.","Fexaramine is a much stronger activator of FXR than even its most potent natural ligand. This potency appears to be mediated by two mechanisms. First, the fexaramine methyl ester group provides a significant number of contacts with helix 3 that are absent in our model of CDCA binding. The methyl ester aliphatic chain effectively bridges helix 3 with helix 6 through van der Waals contacts. FXR further stabilizes helix 3 against the remainder of the structure via interactions between Asn297 from helix 3 and Arg335 from helix 5, in addition to interactions from Asn286 (helix 3) and Arg354 from helix 6. The second mechanism seems to be a function of fexaramine's length. Fexaramine and compounds of similar length such as fexarene and fexarine activate FXR at much lower concentrations than the natural ligands. It appears that the sequential hydrophobic ring structures of these compounds penetrate deeper into the ligand-binding pocket and thereby increase the number of stable contacts. The larger size of fexaramine compared to CDCA (fexaramine has a volume of 461 \u212band a surface area of 465 \u212b; CDCA has a volume of 339 \u212b, and a surface area of 319 \u212b), more effectively fills the ligand-binding cavity. Analysis of buried surface area in the absence and presence of fexaramine reveals an additional 9 \u212bof buried hydrophobic surface when fexaramine is bound. This corresponds to an increase of approximately 1 kJ\/M in stabilizing energy. Fexaramine also appears to make direct contact with helix 12 as well. The increase in stabilization of helix 12 directly influences its rigidity and hence its ability to interact with the co-activator.","While the invention has been described and exemplified in sufficient detail for those skilled in this art to make and use it, various alternatives, modifications, and improvements should be apparent without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
