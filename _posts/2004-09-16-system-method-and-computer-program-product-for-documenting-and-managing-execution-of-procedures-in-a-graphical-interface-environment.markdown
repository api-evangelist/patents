Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to documenting procedures, and more particularly to graphically documenting procedures.","2. Related Art","Conventional process documentation may be performed in a paper format. Word processing software applications may be conventionally used to document a procedure. The procedures may be generally placed in bound procedures manuals. In an exemplary, illustrative manufacturing plant floor environment, an operator may be assigned to perform a process and may refer to the procedures manual in performing a step. The operator may keep manual records, e.g., on a clipboard, of steps of a procedure that have been performed.","Control engineering has evolved over time. Conventionally, humans were the main method for controlling a system. More recently electricity has been used for control and early electrical control was based on relays. Electrical relays allow power to be switched on and off without a mechanical switch. Conventionally, relays may be used to make simple logical control decisions. The development of low cost computers has brought the most recent revolution, the programmable logic controller (PLC). The advent of the PLC began in the 1970s, and has become the most popular conventional manufacturing control. PLCs have gained popularity on factory floors and are expected to remain predominant for some time to come. The popularity of PLCs may be attributed to the advantages that PLCs offer over conventional control systems. PLCs are cost effective for controlling complex systems. PLCs are flexible and can be reapplied to control other systems quickly and easily. Computational abilities of PLCs allow more sophisticated control than conventionally available solutions. Troubleshooting aids coupled to PLCs make programming easier and reduce downtime. Also, reliable components make PLCs likely to operate for years before failure.","A distributed control unit may direct the operation of a process or of part of a process. A distributed control unit may be, for example, a PLC. A distributed control unit may be coupled to another computing device. For example, a distributed control unit may be coupled to a general purpose computer such as a personal computer, a mainframe computer, or a server. The general purpose computer may, for example, facilitate the programming of a distributed control unit, for example, a PLC, by a user, the presentation of data to a user, the manipulation of data provided by a distributed control unit by a range of software, the transformation of data from a distributed control unit to a range of data formats, and the transfer of data from a distributed control unit to remote locations. In a type of distributed computing scheme, several distributed control units, for example, PLCs, may be coupled to a single general purpose computer. Such a distributed computing scheme may facilitate the upgrading of an already existing control structure, the fast, local control of a process, or the design of fail-safe systems. Several general purpose computers may be coupled to one or more distributed control units allowing, for example, for the programming of and monitoring of data generated by a distributed control unit at several different locations.","Software may be used in directing a sequential process. Sequential manufacturing processes may include, for example, a machine tool process or a pharmaceutical or drug manufacturing process. INBATCH\u2122 available from InSource Software Solutions of Richmond, Va. U.S.A. and RSBizWare Batch available from Rockwell Software Inc. of Milwaukee, Wis. U.S.A. are examples of software for directing a sequential process. Manual or automatic execution of a process may be directed by software. Manual execution of a process may be more economical and appropriate if a process is small in scale or requires application of an operator's judgment, for example, in the execution of a process under development. Automatic execution of a process may be practical if it is a high-throughput or well-understood process so that conditions and responses may be anticipated.","Software for the facilitation of the development of systems and products exists. For example, MOIS from Rhea System S.A., of Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium is intended for preparation of satellite and space probe missions.","Documentation of a process or procedure may be required when one develops a process, or when ensuring uniform performance of a documented procedure. Conventionally, procedure documentation has been a largely manual process. For example, conventionally, bound procedures manuals have been used to document a procedure and its steps. In order to monitor process development, performance of a procedure may be documented. Documentation of use of a process may also be required to be filed with a regulatory agency. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires the filing of papers documenting pharmaceutical or drug manufacturing processes. IBATCH\u00ae and PROFICY\u2122 available from GE Fanuc International, Inc. of Foxborough, Mass. U.S.A. maybe used to perform some of these functions.","Conventional software and systems for documenting processes may be limited in the length of text that may be entered by a process designer in order to guide an operator. The operator may receive a short text string, for example, a short code or a reference to a manual, so that the operator must then spend time to look up the action or instruction associated with the code or reference in a bound paper procedures manual. Conventional software and systems are limited in length of text strings that an operator can enter in order to update or comment on information directing a process. Thus, conventionally, an operator must maintain a separate manual log book.","Various exemplary embodiments of a system, method and computer program product for managing a procedure are set forth in detail below.","In an exemplary embodiment, a computer-implemented method for managing a process may include receiving input of visual operation information in a graphical visual procedure interface format, and receiving a free form text description. The visual operation information from the graphical visual procedure interface format and the free form text description may be converted to a data container language. The free form text description may be of any length. The free form text description may include a verb description and an object description. For example, the verb description may be selected from a list of sample verb descriptions or the verb description may be entered by a user. For example, the object description may be selected from a list of sample object descriptions or the object description may be entered by a user.","The computer-implemented method may, in an exemplary embodiment, include receiving one or more of a data validation range, an authentication request, a function call request, or other step parameters about the visual operation information.","An exemplary embodiment of the method may include providing a document file from the data container language. Visual operation information may include a multi-section procedure.","Step-by-step interactive usage of the process may be displayed. In one exemplary embodiment, the step-by-step interactive usage may be displayed in real time. The step-by-step interactive usage may be monitored, including providing a document file from said data container language. Such monitoring may include recording progress of the process. Recording of the process may include recording one or more of the following in the document file: a manually executed sequential step or manually executed sequential steps, an automatically executed sequential step or automatically executed sequential steps, timing of completion of a sequential step, values from the user, comments from the user, results, or authentication.","In an exemplary embodiment, the method may include prompting a current sequential step of the process to a user, and receiving a response from the user. Prompting a current sequential step can include prompting one or more of the following: one or more sequential procedures; a graphical symbol to indicate progress of usage of the process; one or more colors or a shading, to indicate progress of the process; by displaying an expandable\/collapsible hierarchical tree; the user for a value; an authentication by at least one of an operator, an engineer, a supervisor, a peer reviewer, an independent reviewer, or a quality assurance reviewer; a validation of the value according to a range, a step execution request; or a function call request. Receiving a response from the user can include in an exemplary embodiment, receiving one or more of the following: a selection of at least one sequential procedure; a response indicating completion of the current sequential step; a response indicating skipping the current sequential step; a response requiring automatic execution of the current sequential step or the current sequential step with a set of steps; a value; a response including a comment; a function call request; a request to execute a shell command; or an authentication from one or more of an operator, an engineer, a supervisor, a peer reviewer, an independent reviewer, or a quality assurance reviewer.","In an exemplary embodiment, the method may include converting the data container language to a computer function language. An alarm response routine may be included in visual operation information, and an alarm response routine in a computer function language format may cause interactive display of a step or steps of a procedure in the process in response to an alarm condition. A monitor function and a monitor response routine may be included with visual operation information. The monitor function in a computer function language format may initiate automatic execution of a step or steps of the monitor response routine in response to a condition.","The computer function language may be provided to an interpreter, and the process may be executed with the interpreter. A status of execution may be outputted from the interpreter, and the status of execution may be converted to a document in an alterable format. An image document in a substantially unalterable format may be generated from the document in an alterable format. The computer function language may include NOVATEH\u2122 D\/3 \u00ae Distributed Control System Proprietary Sequence and Batch Language (SABL\u00ae) and\/or an OPC-compliant language. The computer function language may include information for programming one or more real-time feedback control units that use information of the physical state of a chemical or material which the process transforms. The computer function language may include information for programming at least two distributed control units.","In an exemplary embodiment, the method may include displaying information from the data container language in a procedure overview display. The operator may update the data container language, and a document file may be provided from the updated data container language. Updating may include, for example, including values representative of the operation of a process. An image document in a substantially unalterable format may be generated from the updated data container language. The updated data container language may be electronically filed with a regulatory organization, with the updated data container language in an XML or SGML format. The regulatory organization may be, for example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the U.S. Department of Energy, or any other government, regulatory, standards, certification, or other agency body or organization.","In an exemplary embodiment, the method may include generating an image document in a substantially unalterable format from the data container language. A document in an alterable format may be generated from the data container language and an image document in a substantially unalterable format may be generated from the document in an alterable format. The substantially unalterable format may include, e.g., a PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF) format. The image document may be time stamped, in an exemplary embodiment. The substantially unalterable format may include a format accepted by a regulatory organization. A regulatory organization may include at least one of the following: a governmental agency, such as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); a private certification organization, such as UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES INC.\u00ae (UL); or a certification, or quasi-governmental organization, such as, e.g., but not limited to, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), etc..","In an exemplary embodiment, a document in an alterable format may be generated from the data container language. The data container language may include XML. The graphical visual procedure interface format may include a MICROSOFT\u00ae VISIO\u00ae-compatible extended graphical application. The process may include at least one of the following: a chemical process, a material handling process, a drug manufacturing process, a health services process, an emergency response process, a military operation, a military service process, an electrical generation process, or an electrical distribution process. The process may include a real process or a simulated process.","In another exemplary embodiment, the method may include receiving at least a portion of the visual operation information from a visual operation information library, and\/or storing at least a portion of the visual operation information in the visual operation information library. The method may include mapping a procedural description to generate visual operation information.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","A preferred and other exemplary embodiments of the invention are discussed in detail below. While specific exemplary embodiments are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations can be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include a system, method, and computer program product that may allow a user to enter a description of a process visually, as visual operation information, and as free form text. The system, method, and computer program product may convert the visual operation information and the free form text description to an intermediate format, such as, e.g., but not limited to, a data container language. The system, method, and computer program product may direct manual or display\/monitor automatic execution of the described process, and may interactively display the usage of the process to a user in real time. A document file in an alterable or an unalterable format representing the initial visual description of the process, the process as executed, or the process as executed with values and comments entered by the user may be generated in one exemplary embodiment. The document file may be, in an exemplary embodiment, in a format that may be filed with a regulatory organization; for example, the document file may be in a format that may be electronically filed with a regulatory organization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 4","FIG. 1A","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","104","102","104","104","104","104","104","100","104","110","104","106","106","110","104","110","112","110","104","100","108","108","114","104","110","108","104","110","108","104","108","110"]},"The client  may be a communications device or computing device such as, e.g., but not limited to, a tablet, handheld, subnotebook, notebook, laptop, desktop or work station computer such as, e.g., a personal computer (PC), a personal digital assistant (PDA), or other device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["120","120","122","124","124","102","124","126","128","130","120","104","110","108","124","126","128","130","122","126"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":["200","102","102","102","102"]},"An advantage of a system, method, and computer program product according to the present invention is that the tools for designing a procedure can be used by technicians or office workers having a minimum of engineering or scientific training. With a system, method, and computer program product according to the present invention, an engineer can provide a description of a procedure to a technician or office worker who then can use a graphical interface to enter the described procedure into a system, so that the procedure can be automatically or manually executed. The procedure can be documented and presented so that an operator with a minimum of technical or scientific training can easily and accurately follow instructions for carrying out a manual procedure.","Flow diagram  of  in an exemplary embodiment may begin with  and may continue immediately with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, user  using a graphical interface may document graphically visual operation information, e.g., a procedure chart using an interactive graphical user interface tool similar to that shown and described further below with reference to  using such software components as illustrated and discussed further below with reference to . A graphical visual procedure interface format for documenting graphically visual operation information may include, for example, a format of a MICROSOFT\u00ae VISIO\u00ae-compatible extended graphical application. In an exemplary embodiment, the graphical system may be an extension of VISIO\u00ae referred to as PAPERLESS PROCEDURES, available from NovaTech Process Solutions, LLC of Columbia, Md. U.S.A. For example, the graphical system may be an \u201cadd-in\u201d module, for example, the \u201cadd-in\u201d module may interact with another program, such as VISIO\u00ae. The rules and an array of tools for documenting graphically visual operation information may be included in the \u201cadd-in\u201d module. These rules may, for example, govern how a textual description is related to graphic representation of operation information or how a graphically represented procedure and associated textual information may be placed in an intermediate format such as a data container language. For example, the rules may govern how data is placed into a data container language format. VISIO\u00ae may, for example, serve to support the drawing of graphic representations of a procedure. In an exemplary embodiment, at least a portion of the visual operation information may be received from a visual operation information library. In another exemplary embodiment, at least a portion of the visual operation information may be stored in a visual operation information library. An advantage of a graphical interface can be that a designer is forced to form logical connections of actions and decisions, so that the procedure does not have dead ends and incorrect logic. From , flow diagram  may continue with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, user  may advantageously add one or more textual descriptions of the procedure using a free form text description. In an exemplary embodiment, the free form text description may be long, for example, up to a pre-defined length. A pre-defined length may be, for example, 32,767 characters. The free form text description may include special characters, such as international characters, characters from non-Latin alphabets, e.g., Greek, as well as the Latin alphabet, and mathematical and other symbols. The free form text description may include, in an exemplary embodiment, formatting such as, e.g., but not limited to, underlining, bolding, italicizing, and paragraphing with a line return and indenting. The free form text description may include a verb description and an object description. For example, a verb description may be selected from a list of sample verb descriptions, or a verb description not in the list of sample verb descriptions may be entered by a user. For example, an object description may be selected from a list of sample object descriptions, or an object description not in the list of sample object descriptions may be entered by a user. In an exemplary embodiment, the description may include an association of the combination of the verb description and the object description with a computer function language for possible use in later automated execution. User  may also add additional information, i.e., additional step parameters, about the visual operation information. For example, user  may add a data validation range, which, for example, includes bounds on a value an operator can enter for the value to be accepted. User  may add an authentication request, which requires an authorized person, for example, but not limited to, an operator, a supervisor, an engineer, a process designer, or other personnel directly or indirectly involved with the design or execution of the process, to electronically or otherwise sign off on a step. User  may add a shell command; a shell command may cause, for example, an internet page containing product information on a component of machinery used in a process, e.g., a valve, to be displayed to an operator during execution of the process. The user may add other step parameters about the visual operation information, for example, information indicating that a specific solenoid should open a valve during a step during automatic execution of the process.

From , flow diagram  may continue with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, the graphically represented procedure and associated textual information may be placed in an intermediate format. In an exemplary embodiment, the procedure may be stored in a standard format that may allow ready access to the procedure. In one exemplary embodiment, the intermediate format may be a data container language. In an exemplary embodiment, the data container language may be an extensible markup language (XML) format. In another exemplary embodiment, a document file is provided from the information in data container language format. For example, an image document in a substantially unalterable format may be generated from information in the data container language format. Alternatively, a document in an alterable format may be generated from information in the data container language format. In an exemplary embodiment, a document in an alterable format may be generated from information in the data container language format and an image document in a substantially unalterable format may be generated from the document in an alterable format. An image document may be time stamped. An example of a substantially unalterable format is the PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF). The substantially unalterable format may include a format accepted by a regulatory organization.

From , flow diagram  may continue with  if the system has been configured for manual execution of the procedure, or may continue with  if the system has been configured for automatic execution of the procedure.","In , in an exemplary embodiment, the procedure as documented may be displayed for execution in manual mode. In one exemplary embodiment, the procedure may be depicted as an expandable\/collapsible hierarchical tree based procedure for showing steps and substeps of the procedure. In another exemplary embodiment the display may indicate the status of a step being performed using, e.g., a graphical icon, a color or a shading to indicate the level of completion of a step and the progress of the process. In an exemplary embodiment, the step-by-step interactive usage of the process may be interactively monitored. The procedure may be interactively accessed allowing, for example, an operator to step through the procedure as the operator manually executes the process. The display may prompt a user for a value, and validate that the value lies within a range. The display may prompt a user to indicate whether a shell command, e.g., for displaying an internet page, should be executed. From , flow diagram  may continue with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, an operator user  may manually step through the steps of the procedure. An operator user  may indicate completion of a current step or may indicate that a current step is being jumped to another step.","For a manual procedure, a designer may designate one action shape, representing an action step, or two or more action shapes in a series, representing a series of action steps, as expert mode. An action step may be presented to an operator to instruct the operator perform a task. For example, an action step may be presented in a hierarchical tree shown in an execution window of a procedure overview display. Action steps designated as expert mode may be skipped, for example, not presented to an operator, when the procedure is run in expert mode. For example, when one or more action steps are presented in a hierarchical tree, the tree may indicate that an action step is to be performed. An operator may indicate that an action step has been performed, so that the next step in a sequence of steps is indicated. If the next step is or steps are designated as expert mode, and the procedure is run in expert mode, these steps may be skipped and not presented, so that the next non-action step or action step not designated as expert mode in the sequence may be presented to the operator. Use of an expert mode designation for an action step or action steps may be useful, for example, when detailed instructions must be provided for less experienced operators, but experienced operators do not need such detailed instructions. For an inexperienced operator, the procedure may be run not in expert mode, so that the inexperienced operator is presented with and must confirm completion of each detailed step. For an experienced operator, the procedure may be run in expert mode, so that detailed steps designated as expert mode are not presented, and only an action step describing an overall task is presented; the experienced operator, familiar with the detailed steps for performing the overall task, may simply confirm completion of the overall task.","In an exemplary embodiment, the operator may add comments. The comments may be text of any length, up to a flexibly architected limit, for example, a flexibly architected limit of 32,767 characters. In another exemplary embodiment, the user may be required to authenticate using a user name and password or user name and password entry by a supervisor of input that a step was approved to perform.

In one exemplary embodiment, the procedure may be depicted as an expandable\/collapsible hierarchical tree based procedure for showing steps and substeps of the procedure. In another exemplary embodiment the display may indicate the status of a step being performed using, e.g., a graphical icon, a color or a shading to indicate the level of completion of a step and the progress of the process. In an exemplary embodiment, the step-by-step interactive usage of the process may be interactively monitored. The procedure may be interactively accessed allowing, for example, an operator to monitor status of automated execution of the procedure. The display may prompt a user to indicate whether a shell command, e.g., for displaying an internet page, should be executed.

The computer function language maybe, for example, NOVATECH\u2122 D\/3\u00ae Distributed Control System Proprietary Sequence and Batch Language (SABL\u00ae) or an OPC-compliant language. From , flow diagram  may continue with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, the steps of the procedure in computer function language format may be sent to an interpreter to automatically execute the procedure. The interpreter programmed with the steps of the procedure may be a distributed control unit, for example, a real-time feedback control unit which uses information of the physical state of a chemical or material which the process transforms. Such a feedback control unit may use, for example, a measured temperature of a chemical to set an appropriate voltage across a heating coil. The steps of the procedure in computer function language format may be sent to two or more interpreters, for example, two or more distributed control units may be programmed. From , flow diagram  may continue with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, an operator may be prompted to indicate whether execution should be continued in automatic mode or whether execution should instead be continued in manual mode. From , flow diagram  may continue with  if the operator has indicated that execution should be continued in manual mode. If the operator has indicated that execution should be continued in automatic mode, automatic execution may continue, or, when the procedure has been completed, flow diagram  may continue with .","In an exemplary embodiment, the status of a manually or automatically executed procedure, including, for example, the steps executed and results of a step, is stored in a standard format such as a data container language. The timing of completion of a step and an authentication may be stored in a data container language. The operator may update a procedure stored in a data container language by, for example, entering a value to represent the result of a step; for example, the operator may indicate whether the appearance of a mixture is smooth or granular. Automatically obtained information from a process, such as temperature data from a thermocouple, may be stored in a data container language to represent the result of a step.","An updated procedure stored in a data container language format may be filed with a regulatory organization. The data container language may be, for example, XML or SGML. Examples of regulatory organizations may include governmental agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Regulatory organizations may also include private certification organizations, for example, UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES INC.\u00ae (UL), and quasi-governmental organizations, for example, International Organization for Standardization (ISO).","An example of an alterable electronic format is standard generalized mark-up language (SGML) or an SGML-derived format such as XML.","Extensible markup language (XML) is a meta-language, not a single, predefined markup language. XML allows one to design one's own markup. XML is used to describe the structure of data, so anywhere that data is input, output, stored, or transmitted from one place to another, may benefit from the application of XML. XML is a specification developed by the W3C consortium. XML is a pared-down version of SGML. XML is designed especially for Web documents. XML allows designers to create their own customized tags, enabling definitions, transmission, validation, and interpretation of data between applications and between organizations.","In , in an exemplary embodiment, status of execution of the procedure may be outputted and converted into an alterable file format such as a wordprocessing application format. From , flow diagram  may continue with .","In , in an exemplary embodiment, the status of execution of the procedure may be converted into a substantially unalterable format such as, for example, but not limited to, PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF). From , flow diagram  may continue with .","Conversion of the status of execution procedure into an alterable file format or into an unalterable format, such as an unalterable image file, may be considered recording of progress of the process in a document file. For example, a manually executed step or steps or an automatically executed step or steps may be recorded in a document file. The timing of completion of a step, values or comments entered by a user, or authentications may be recorded in a document file. The results of a step may be recorded in a document file; for example, a user entered value representing an aspect of the state of a process after a step, e.g., a texture of a mixture, or an automatically measured value, e.g., a temperature measured by a thermocouple, may be recorded in a document file. Updates to a procedure may be converted to a document file.","A procedural description may include information in a data container language format and may include a document file, for example, a document in an alterable format or a document in a substantially unalterable format. A procedural description may be mapped to generate visual operation information, for example, for the design of a new process or modification of the current process. For example, but not limited to, a designer may map by reviewing a procedural description, selecting a graphical building component in a graphical interface format, copying appropriate text from the procedural description, pasting the text into the graphical building component, placing the graphical building component within a graphic user interface, and repeating to generate the desired visual operation information.","In , in an exemplary embodiment, flow diagram  may end.","In an exemplary embodiment, a user may develop an Alarm Response Routine, for example, by using a graphical interface. An Alarm Response Routine may be triggered in response to a user assigned alarm condition. An Alarm Response Routine may interact with a computer function language, for example, NOVATECH\u2122 D\/3\u00ae Distributed Control System Proprietary Sequence and Batch Language (SABL\u00ae) and\/or an OPC-compliant language, that may direct a processor in monitoring sensors for alarm conditions. For example, a part or a whole of an Alarm Response Routine can be in the format of computer function language. In an embodiment, the steps represented in an Alarm Response Routine may be carried out by an operator. For example, once an Alarm Response Routine has been triggered, it may interactively display or cause interactive display of a step or steps of a manual procedure to an operator. Thus, for example, an Alarm Response Routine can monitor a process for an emergency condition, and efficiently guide an operator in responding to the emergency condition.","In an exemplary embodiment, a user may define a Monitor function and include this function in a procedure; a user may develop a Monitor Response Routine. For example, a user may include a Monitor function and\/or a Monitor Response Routine with visual operation information. A Monitor function can monitor .a process for one or more conditions and, if the condition is met, direct halting of a currently running procedure, and initiate automatic execution of a step or steps of a Monitor Response Routine. When the Monitor Response Routine has completed running, execution may continue with the procedure which the Monitor function halted. A Monitor function may be implemented, for example, through a computer function language such as NOVATECH\u2122 D\/3\u00ae Distributed Control System Proprietary Sequence and Batch Language (SABL\u00ae) and\/or an OPC-compliant language. For example, computer function language instructions may direct a processor to monitor analog values, for example, analog values provided by sensors, digital states within the processor or in another processor, or alarm conditions recognized by the processor or outside of the processor. A graphical user interface (GUI) environment may include a separate canvas dedicated to the design of Monitor Response Routines; for example, a separate page in a MICROSOFT\u00ae VISIO\u00ae \u2014compatible extended graphical application may be dedicated to the design of Monitor Response Routines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["320","302"]},"One graphical building component, in an exemplary embodiment, which may be termed a dynamic connector , in an exemplary embodiment, may be used to link together any two graphical building components. The execution or performance of a graphical building component to which the end of the dynamic connector  with no arrow may be linked may precede the execution or performance of a graphical building component to which the end of the dynamic connector  with an arrow may be linked.","A decision box  may, in an exemplary embodiment, indicate a determination, or prompting for decision information from an operator or from a device, such as, e.g., but not limited to, a PLC. Information prompted for may include, for example, a value.","A decision mode bar  may, in an exemplary embodiment, follow a decision box, and indicate that one or more of several actions may follow from a value received in response to a prompt from a decision box .","An answer box , in an exemplary embodiment, may indicate that if, in response to a prompting for information, a value is received that is equivalent to the value in the answer box, then the action specified in a subsequent action box  may be performed. Another decision mode bar  and a terminator box  may, for example, follow an action box and may, in an exemplary embodiment, indicate that a response to the prompting indicated by a decision box  has been received and appropriate action taken.","A note box , in an exemplary embodiment, may be inserted into a representation of a procedure in a GUI environment. The note box  provides information to an operator in a verbose form.","A table box , in an exemplary embodiment, may be inserted into a representation of a procedure in a GUI environment to allow the designer to enter information directing one or more steps, for example, verb descriptions and object descriptions, in a tabular format. A table box  may be inserted into a representation of a manual procedure or may be inserted into a representation of an automatic procedure; for example, a table box  may include information directing a process during automatic execution. A table box  may cause a matrix to be presented to an operator, for example, to be displayed to an operator in a procedure overview display. A designer may designate a column or columns in the matrix for one or more classes of information, for example, for a verb description or an object description. Each row of the matrix may represent, for example, an action step. When a step represented in the matrix is manually completed, an operator may so indicate; a symbol next to a row may change, for example, may change color or shading, to indicate that the step represented by the row has been completed. When a step represented in the matrix is automatically completed, a symbol next to a row may change, for example, may change color or shading, to indicate that the step represented by the row has been completed. The table box may be represented in, for example, an approved PDF file or in an executed PDF file, as a matrix.","The group bar , in an exemplary embodiment, may be inserted to indicate that execution of several procedural chains follows; the leftmost procedural chain is executed first, then each successive procedural chain to the right is executed. Another group bar  following these procedural chains, in an exemplary embodiment, terminates the execution grouping. The side transition box  determines whether a specified condition exists, and based on whether or not the condition exists, transfers execution to another procedural chain or allows execution to continue along the current procedural chain.","In an embodiment, a user may design a multi-section procedure and graphically document the multi-section procedure as visual operation information. For example, the user may insert a group bar and indicate that the group bar has the multi-select property. The user may place one or more procedural chains below the group bar, each procedural chain representing a section. Another group bar and a terminator following the procedural chains may indicate termination of the execution grouping; additional shapes in a single chain may follow this other group bar and terminator. When an operator reaches the step in the procedure indicated by the group bar with the multi-select property preceding the one or more procedural chain(s), the display may present the operator with a multi-select question, that is, with a choice of which of the one or more procedural chain(s) should be executed. The operator may select which procedural chain or chains to execute. Before a procedural chain selected for execution in response to the multi-select question is executed, the display may present the operator with a request for verification that the procedural chain is to be executed. If the operator responds that the procedural chains is to be executed, then the procedural chain is executed. If the operator responds that the procedural chain is not to be executed, then if the operator had indicated that another procedural chain is to be executed, the display may present the operator with a request for verification that the other procedural chain is to be executed. After a procedural chain has been executed, if another procedural chain had been selected for execution in response to the multi-select question, the display may present the operator with a request for verification that the other procedural chain is to be executed. After each selected procedural chain or chains has or have been executed, execution may continue with the steps indicated by the additional shapes in the single chain following the other group bar and terminator, rather than with any other procedural chain or chains between the group bar with the multi-select property and the other group bar that were not selected. In an approved PDF document, which may present the procedure, but not results of execution, the multi-select question is presented in a Preliminary Actions section of the document. In an executed PDF document, the multi-select question may be presented as in the approved PDF document; the full text of sections that were executed and sections that were skipped may be presented. However, an additional notation at the top of a skipped section may indicate that the section was skipped. An approved PDF document may, for example, be printed for use by an operator. For example, in a method, a user may direct that the approved PDF document be printed with checkboxes next to each step; an operator may use these checkboxes to indicate the completion of a step and progress of the process. Providing an operator with a printed approved PDF document may be useful, for example, when the operator is at a remote location where no computer is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["300","310","308","304","302","304","312","312","300","312","313","314","316","317","318","316","312","306","300","312","306","300","319"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["350","352","358","354","356","356","356","360","361","366","356","362","366","364","370","372","374","376","361","350","382","382","384"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, a procedure overview display for an automatic procedure may include a jump button. If the jump button is pressed by an operator during execution of the automatic procedure, the display may present the operator with a list of steps to which the operator may jump. For example, the display may not present the operator with the option to jump to a step which requires the completion of another step which has not been completed, but may present the operator with the option to jump to a step which does not depend on the completion of another step or which depends on the completion of another step which has been completed.","In order to add comments to the recorded execution of a process, the operator may press the operator comment button . The interactive usage of the process may be displayed in real time. For example, the status of a given step may be indicated by color or shading. In an exemplary embodiment, the color and\/or shading of the triangle may be indicative of the status of a step. For example, a white triangle may indicate a step that has not yet been completed, in an exemplary embodiment. In an exemplary embodiment, graying-out the triangle associated with a listed step may indicate that the step has been completed, green may indicate that the step is in process, and as previously noted, a white background may indicate that the step has not yet been reached. Further, the color and shading of the text may also be varied to indicate status of completion of a step, in an exemplary embodiment. Although not shown, in some cases a step may require an operator to complete the step, to provide an authentication such as, e.g., entry of a username and\/or password. Other exemplary authentications may include, in an exemplary embodiment, an authentication by a supervisor or other user. Advantageously, if a procedure is executed automatically, a procedure overview display such as the procedure overview display of  may be used to monitor performance of the procedure during automated execution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","104","108","110","400","400","124","124"]},"The computer system  may include, in an exemplary embodiment, one or more processors, such as, e.g., processor(s) .
