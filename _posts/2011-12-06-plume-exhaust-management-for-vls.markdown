title: Plume exhaust management for VLS
abstract: A system is provided for directing a flow of gas, including a launching mechanism, a plenum, a layer of meltable material, and an open-ended uptake component. The launching mechanism is adapted to expel rocket exhaust gas. The plenum includes an upper portion having at least one fire resistant breachable plug. The upper portion is adjacent to the launching mechanism. The layer of meltable material is disposed on the upper portion. The heat generated by the gas melts the layer of meltable material. The open-ended uptake component operatively connects to the plenum. The plug moves onto a lower portion of the plenum due to force generated by the gas onto the plug, and the gas flows through the plenum and the uptake component to vent said gas in a controlled manner.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Technical Field","The embodiments herein generally relate to weapons systems, and, more particularly, to equipment used for protection against the exhaust gases of missile launching systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","A vertical launching system (VLS) consists of a number of cells for holding and firing missiles on surface ships and submarines used by many navies around the world. Typically, each cell can hold a number of different types of missiles, enabling the ship flexibility to load an appropriate set for a given mission and to enable replacement of earlier missiles with upgrades without expensive rework. When the command is given, the missile flies straight up long enough to clear the cell and the ship, and then turns on course. The most popular VLS system in the world is the MK 41, being used by eleven navies around the world. The United States Navy will employ the MK 57 VLS on the U.S.S. Zumwalt class destroyers.","Both MK 41 and MK 57 VLS missile launchers primarily are configured as a plenum and uptake type gas management system. A plenum is a pressurized chamber holding fluids, and the uptake refers to the general upwards\/vertical venting of pressurized gas from the plenum. These systems manage gases during a normal missile launch and also during retrained firing. However, a typical plenum and uptake approach results in substantial structural wear caused by normal missile launches, which decreases the ability to withstand a restrained firing, thus, limiting the number of missiles that can be launched prior to gas management system refurbishment.","The MK 41 and MK 57 VLS gas management system plenums protect their plenum floors with ablative material. Additional protection is provided underneath the rocket motor by using a bi-layer ablative material stack. The material on top of the stack is exposed to the rocket motor plume during normal missile fly outs, and the material on the bottom of the stack is exposed only during a missile restrained firing. However, the material is generally inadequate to prevent burn-through when exposed to plume jetting and long burn times because the ablative material, which tends to be expensive, typically do not have sufficient mechanical strength to resist the forces produced by the plume impingement.","The Mk 41 VLS gas management system also uses an aft closure, grid, and sill. The aft closure is a square multi-material, multilayer plate that has diagonal scores that allow it to \u201cblow open\u201d during a rocket motor firing. The sill keeps the aft closure from opening too far and the grid prevents the adjacent aft closures from opening in the opposite direction. However, this type of system requires a substantial number of components, the aft closure layup uses many different materials and a very process-intensive assembly, and the sill and grid are relatively difficult to manufacture and assemble. Moreover, this system is not readily adaptable for use on a general plenum box assemblies because it requires more space above the top of the plenum and more intrusion into the inside of the plenum.","Therefore, it is desirable to develop an improved gas management system that utilizes the plenum and uptake configuration and is readily adaptable in current weapon systems at reduced cost and complexity. In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a system for directing a flow of gas, including a launching mechanism, a plenum, a layer of meltable material, and an open-ended uptake component. In various exemplary embodiments, the launching mechanism is adapted to expel rocket exhaust gas.","In various exemplary embodiments, the plenum includes an upper portion having at least one fire resistant breachable plug. The upper portion is adjacent to the launching mechanism. The layer of meltable material is disposed on the upper portion. The heat generated by the gas melts the layer of meltable material. The open-ended uptake component operatively connects to the plenum. The plug moves onto a lower portion of the plenum due to force generated by the gas onto the plug, and the gas flows through the plenum and the uptake component to vent said gas in a controlled manner.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","The embodiments herein provide a gas management system that utilizes the plenum and uptake configuration to provide protection from the deleterious effects of a rocket plume. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","15","20","25","15","20","10","15","30","15","30","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["35","10","35","43","15","20","40","35","15","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 through 3"],"b":["30","31","32","31","31","32","30","31","16","15"]},"In , the various block arrows depict the flow of gas as a result of a rocket\/missile  being launched. The initial exhaust gas  purges the upper portion  (i.e., ceiling) of the plenum  and then extends downward through the inner chamber  of the plenum . Thereafter, upon contacting the gas blast protector , the gas is diverted in a substantially horizontal direction in relation to the plenum  such that the diverted gas  flows through the chamber  and then through the connecting uptake component  (not shown in ) to be vented in a controlled manner. The gas blast protector  assists in reducing the mechanical and thermal impact of the gas  on the floor  of the plenum , thereby aiding in the maintenance of the structural integrity of the floor  of the plenum . In other words, the gas blast protector  protects the floor  of the plenum  from burning through when exposed to the direct impingement of hot missile exhaust gas . As mentioned above, the gas blast protector  is an optional component of the embodiments herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A through 5C","FIGS. 1 through 4","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5C","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["10","10","10","10"],"i":["a","a ","a ","a "]},"As illustrated, the gas management system includes a plenum  having an upper portion  with a plurality of breachable (i.e., movable) plugs , ; a lower portion ; and a chamber  separating the upper portion  from the lower portion . The system also includes an uptake component  operatively connected to the plenum . In an optional embodiment, at least one gas blast protection component  (not shown in ) may be positioned over the lower portion  of the plenum . The plurality of breachable (i.e., movable) plugs , move in a direction from the upper portion  towards the lower portion  upon impact of rocket motor exhaust gas  directed thereon.","As shown in , the plugs , may incorporate a tapered shape or alternatively may comprise a stepped shape (not shown). While these two shapes\/configurations are described with respect to the plugs , , the embodiments herein are not restricted to a particular geometric configuration of the plugs , , as any type of configuration that permits breach of the plugs , is permitted. Additionally, the system further includes a layer of meltable material  over the upper portion  of the plenum , and a layer of fire resistant material  under the layer of meltable material . In one embodiment, the material used for the layer of fire resistant material  is the same material used for the plugs , . Thus, the plugs , are fire resistant, and the release of the plug is dictated by the force of the exhaust gas  rather than the heat generated by the gas .","The layer of fire resistant material  may be configured to be substantially aligned with the plugs , . Due to the fire resistant qualities of the plugs , , the floor  of the plenum  is protected from the deleterious effects of the gas  without the need of a gas blast protector . Additionally, once the plug hits the lower portion  of the plenum , the plug provides the same gas diversion quality as the raised bumps  of a gas blast protector . However, should additional protection of the floor  of the plenum  be desired, then the embodiments herein may incorporate a gas blast protector  in the plenum . The uptake component  comprises a first open end  connected to the plenum  and a second open end  to permit controlled venting of the gas .","The plugs , move in substantially one direction only (i.e., generally in the direction from the upper portion  to the lower portion  of the plenum ). The discharged plug caused by the hot missile exhaust gas  creates an opening  in the upper portion  of the plenum  located directly underneath the exhausting rocket motor (e.g., rocket\/missile  of ). However, non-discharged plug as well as the layer of fire resistant material  prevents exhaust gas ,  from leaking back underneath adjacent non-exhausting rocket motors (not shown). When the plug underneath the exhausting rocket motor functions (i.e., is released), the rocket motor exhaust gas  flows into the inner chamber  of the plenum  and is ducted away to a safe location (e.g., through the uptake component ). However, the non-exhausting rocket motors (not shown) are protected from the hot gases, due to the non-breached adjacent plug preventing sympathetic rocket motor ignition.","Accordingly, since the non-exhausting rocket motors do not direct hot gas  onto plug , then the plug remains in place in the upper portion  of the plenum  without breaching. Therefore, only plug is breached because a rocket is launched directly above this location of the upper portion  of the plenum . The gas  directed onto the plenum  first strikes the layer of meltable material  over the upper portion  of the plenum .","The heat capacity of the meltable material  is less than the temperature of the gas  thereby causing the material  to melt, which then allows the gas  to strike the plug at a force sufficient to cause the plug to dislodge from the upper portion  of the plenum and down towards the lower portion  of the plenum . The layer of fire resistant material  restrains the gas  from causing the breach of adjacent plug and to maintain the structural integrity of the remaining areas of the upper portion  of the plenum . The meltable material  and the fire resistant material  of the plugs , are not restricted to particular materials and need only be dictated by the thermal environment.","The system protects a launcher  and surrounding equipment from the effects of a restrained firing even though the launcher  was not necessarily designed to mitigate a restrained firing. Due to the use of the fire resistant material , the gas management system does not wear out due to the number of missile firings occurring.","By utilizing the plugs , and multi-layered ,  upper portion  of the plenum , the embodiments herein achieve higher mechanical strength by combining the meltable material  and the heat resistant material . This is because meltable materials are plentiful and can be selected for higher strength, whereas heat-resistant materials are more specialized and typically weaker mechanically. Furthermore, the plugs , are relatively easy to machine due to the materials that they constitute, which reduces manufacturing costs.","The embodiments herein also permit the redirection of the exhaust gases ,  such that their detrimental effects on structural components (i.e., plenum ) are mitigated. The embodiments herein require fewer components and fewer materials than conventional gas management systems because the system utilizes a less complex configuration by requiring less room above and inside the plenum  (e.g., the embodiments herein do not require an additional gas blast protector ). This is because, the system does not use a grid, and since a sill is also not required, there are no required extraneous flow inhibiting items protruding into the plenum .","While various material descriptions are described herein, the gas management system may be made from a number of materials for the structural as well as the heat resistant aspects of the design. The materials used for the system can be chosen based on mechanical strength under high heating rates and long burn time, ease of machining, ease of availability, and cost.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1 through 5C"],"b":["70","71","45","43","17","15","55","55","72","60","45","73","65","60","74","55","55","65","75","55","55","50","76","50","15","20"],"i":["a","b","a","b ","a","b "]},"The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
