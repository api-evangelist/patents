It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","To enhance the description of the present aspects, the following provides a list of some of the discussed terminology.","Mobile widget or widget: a user interface (UI) element with which a device end user interacts; in some aspects, a mobile widget may have a specific relationship with a respective content source. For example, a mobile widget or widget is a relatively small, specialized graphical user interface (GUI) application, which may include a combination of a graphical symbol and program code or a software module executable to provide visual information or easy access to a function, such as but not limited to a clock, a calendar, a news aggregator, weather information, etc.","Widget frame: a static user interface display area of a mobile widget.","Widget management client (WMC): a client application that instantiates and manages one or more mobile widgets.","Widget wall: an initial view in the WMC where a device end user can see all or some portion of mobile widgets, depending on the size of the view and the size of the respective mobile widgets, resident on the respective wireless communication device.","Widget operation modes: (i) compressed mode: an individual widget frame for display on a widget wall; and (ii) expanded mode: an individual widget frame for display when the mobile widget is selected, where the widget frame may be sized larger than the respective widget frame in the compressed mode.","Mobile widget types: (i) updateable widget: a widget whose underlying widget package can be updated after instantiation at the client; (ii) locked widget: widget that cannot be modified, deleted or re-positioned by the user; it is updateable, but not at user discretion; (iii) dynamic widget mobile widget having: a compressed mode appearance on UI that can be manipulated by end user (as opposed to a locked widget); (iv) floating widget: a mobile widget having a compressed mode appearance that cannot be modified by the end user; (v) discovery widget: a mobile widget that presents widget management functionality to the end user, including widget selection and widget wall management.","Widget security: (i) trusted widget: a widget that has gone through an approval process; and (ii) untrusted widget: a widget that has not gone through any approval; could be user defined, public domain, or from a developer.","Standalone ad widget: an optional form of a locked widget displayed on the widget wall; may have content relevant to the end user based on, among other things, other widget selections made by the WMC.","Widget management system (WMS): an infrastructure element for managing widget subscriptions and downloads.","Widget management portal (WMP): in one aspect, an end user-facing web tool for end users to manage widgets.","Content access server (CAS): an infrastructure element operable to handle routing of metering information related to mobile widget activity or end user interactivity with mobile widgets from one or more wireless communication devices; further operable to manage providing content updates to mobile widgets, and to retrieve\/cache corresponding content updates from one or more content providers.","Widget wizard: a client management engine for mobile widgets.","Unified widget manager (UWM): an infrastructure element that operates as a clearinghouse for mobile widgets.","Message router: a network element through which all communication between the widget system infrastructure elements and the WMC is routed.","Schedule record: a data record that provides update schedules for widget content updates and a timetable for periodic retrieval of digital locker contents, where the digital locker may be a WMS component that includes mobile widget information and configuration for end users; for example, the schedule record may be sent from the WMS digital locker to the WMC.","Catalog record: a data record sent from the WMS digital locker to the WMC and WMP that provides a widget catalog listing mobile widgets, e.g. catalog items, available to the end user; the catalog record may be customized for an end user.","Overview","The described aspects relate to widgets, and more specifically to apparatus and methods relating to an end-to-end system for the creation, storage, delivery, and management of user-defined mobile widgets and widget-related content in a wireless communication environment. The described aspects provide apparatus and methods which enable end users to customize mobile widgets. Further, the described aspects provide apparatus and methods that are operable to operate efficiently in a wireless network environment having constraints with regard to network connectivity, communications bandwidth or throughput, and wireless device memory and processing usage.","As such, the described aspects particularly relate to \u201cmobile\u201d widgets optimized for a wireless network environment. To understand mobile widgets, one should also understand their counterpart\u2014desktop widgets. Desktop widgets are essentially compact, client applications that provide specific functionality to the end user via a specialized user interface. It should be understood, however, that mobile widgets are not a straightforward extension of desktop widgets, particularly in several respects: (a) Desktop widgets are simple to write, and leverage existing web programming technologies (particularly Javascript and XML). In some aspects, mobile widgets may include compact protocols and utilize limited interpreters (e.g. Javascript, etc.) due to limitations in device memory and processing power; (b) Desktop widgets generally function with an expectation of consistent connectivity. Such consistent connectivity is not necessarily feasible in the wireless network environment due to inconsistent available throughput, limited cellular capacity, and specific wireless data plans; (c) Functionality utilized by desktop widgets specified in standard Javascript (e.g. ECMAScript versions, etc.) does not interface with wireless device-specific API's that can be extended to the mobile widget developer. Examples of such API's include the handset power meter, location information, and wireless connectivity status; (d) In some aspects, mobile widget accessibility may be provided in several forms, while, in general, desktop widgets are accessible directly on the PC desktop. In some aspects, mobile widgets are accessible via the wireless device application manager, while in other aspects mobile widgets may be accessible via a specific mobile widget management application or via a network portal; and (e) Mobile widget discovery and instantiation may be controlled by a wireless device application manager, or by a mobile widget management application, or by a network portal. In contrast, desktop widget discovery and instantiation is not restricted to one client or one portal. Therefore, the described aspects take these considerations into account to provide a mobile widget service optimized for the wireless network environment.","In particular, the described mobile widgets provide an alternative to the mobile browser to access content on a wireless device, and also allow individual users to easily create custom mobile widgets for arbitrary wireless device or web resources.","Thus, the described aspects offer a true replacement to receiving content via a mobile browser, addressing the above-noted challenges by developing a system with the constraints of wireless access, wireless device capabilities, and web development in mind.","End-To-End System Architecture","Referring to , in one non-limiting aspect, a mobile widget system  provides an end-to-end architecture for the creation, storage, delivery, operation, and management of mobile widgets in a wireless network environment.","A mobile widget  includes a compact application or set of codes executable by a wireless communication device  to interact with a content source, such as a content access server (CAS) , to retrieve content for presentation to a device end user  via a user interface , such as a display, on the device. In one non-limiting aspect, for example, mobile widget  may be a Really Simple Syndication (RSS) reader operable to retrieve a data feed from a news source and display the corresponding news item or headline(s) to allow end user  to view the latest news.","It should be noted, however, that mobile widget  is not limited to the prior example, and may have any functionality and may include any type of content. For example, mobile widget  may present any content generated by a content provider , including text, graphics, audio, video and multimedia content. Further, for example, content presentable by mobile widget  may include an advertisement, such as from an advertisement serving platform , where the advertisement may be mixed with other content or may be the sole content. Advertisement serving platform  may be a specialized version of content provider , supplying system  with advertising content, managing the placement of advertisements in system , and tracking feedback relating to the usage of advertisements on wireless communication devices . Additionally, advertisement serving platform  may be operable to interface with an advertisement virtual negotiation component , such as an advertisement bidding exchange, which provides advertisers  and an operator  of system  with a virtual marketplace to enable the placement and management of advertising content within system .","Further, in system , wireless communication device  provides a platform for the storage, operation, and management of mobile widget  for end user . For example, wireless communication device  may include a widget management client (WMC)  that is executable to obtain one or more mobile widgets , such as from a widget management system . Additionally, WMC  may be executable to supervise mobile widget operation, and to track mobile widget activities on wireless communication device  and report such activities to a widget tracking component .","Widget management system (WMS)  is operable to communicate with WMC , for example via a wireless interface  and a message router component , and includes one or more catalogs  of one or more widgets  available for purchase and\/or download to wireless communication device . WMS  may include a digital locker  operable to store records of each widget  downloaded to each device , as well as the corresponding configuration of each widget  on each device . A widget configuration may include settings relating to an appearance of widget , as well as an operation of widget , including one or more content update settings. In conjunction with providing access to widget catalogs  and widgets , WMS  optionally may include a widget recommender  to provide end user  with advice, suggestions, or recommendations of mobile widgets  that may be of benefit or of interest to end user .","As noted, message router component  is operable to interface between WMC  and the widget-supplying and content-supplying components of system . In particular, message router component  provides the interface with WMS  and CAS  to exchange messages relating to downloading mobile widget , configuring mobile widget , updating mobile widget content, scheduling of content updates, and reporting of data tracking the activity of or end user interaction with mobile widget . As such, in some aspects, message router component  defines a network element that manages and controls all communications with WMC .","Further, in some aspects, system  may include a widget management portal  that allows end user  to access WMS  to inquire about available mobile widgets  and widget catalogs . Further, widget management portal  allows end user  to configure the functionality and appearance of mobile widget  on wireless communication device . As such, widget management portal  provides end user  with alternative interface for mobile widget management.","In system , WMS  may obtain mobile widget  and widget catalog  from a unified widget manager (UWM) . UWM  provides a controlled point-of-entry into system  for mobile widget . In particular, UWM  may be operable to insure that each mobile widget  meets one or more predetermined architectural and\/or operational widget standards for functioning within system . Additionally, UWM  provides a common, virtual marketplace that enables one or more mobile widget developers\/providers  to introduce their respective mobile widget  to an operator , such as a wireless network carrier, of system . For example, widget developers\/providers  may submit one or more mobile widgets  to UWM  via a developer interface , and operator\/carrier  may access and review mobile widgets  at UWM  via an operator interface , where developer and operator interfaces  and  may be a network-accessible interface such as an extranet. Further, for example, via UWM , one or more developers\/providers  and one or more operators\/carriers  may access a widget virtual negotiation component , such as a widget bidding exchange, where an agreement may be reached regarding one or more of mobile widget pricing, mobile widget operation, mobile widget content updating, mobile widget placement in widget catalogs, mobile widget billing, developer\/provider compensation, or operator\/carrier mobile widget cost in system .","Additionally, in some aspects, system  may have a backend system  for analyzing the tracked data and transactions within system . In particular, backend system  may include an analytics component  that receives and examines the data of system , and a reporting component  that generates reports, including operator\/carrier proprietary information , based on the results of the analysis of analytics component . Further, backend system  may include a billing component  that accounts for transactions in system  and debits and\/or credits one or more end users , developers\/providers , operators\/carriers , or advertisers . For example, end user  may purchase and download mobile widget  to a respective wireless communication device . This purchase transaction may be recorded by WMS  and reported to analytics component , which extracts relevant information for use by reporting component  and\/or billing component  to generate, respectively, an accounting of the transaction and a bill or invoice corresponding to the transaction. The accounting and the billing may represent, for example, one or more of a purchase price\/account receivable to be debited to an end user account, an operator\/carrier account payable to be credited to an operator\/carrier account, a developer\/provider account payable to be credited to a developer\/provider account, or an advertiser account receivable to be debited to an advertiser account.","It should be noted that the components within and functionalities provided by system  may be configured in any manner. For example, the various functionalities of any single system component alternately may be performed by individual system components. As such, it should be noted that the aspects of system  may be rearranged in any of a variety of manners, and yet still achieve the stated functionality.","Further, it should be noted that the infrastructure components, e.g. the components to the right of wireless interface  in , may be communicatively coupled by one or any combination of wired or wireless links, referred to as infrastructure communication network . As such, infrastructure communication network  may be a wired network, a wireless network, or a combination wired\/wireless network, for example including LANs, WANs, PSTNs, the Internet, circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks.","Thus, system  provides one aspect of an end-to-end system for managing mobile widgets in a wireless network environment. Further details of the various system components and their aspects will now be discussed.","Infrastructure Element\/Network Device","In system , the network-side or infrastructure elements may include one or more of any type of computer device, such as a network device, operable to perform the functionality described herein.

In some aspects, submitted mobile widgets  may be subject to a validation process  executable by a widget validation component , resulting in a respective submitted widget  being either a trusted widget or an untrusted widget or alternately being denied entry into system . Validation process  may be an automated process, a manual process, or a combination of both, that determines if submitted mobile widget  conforms to one or more widget system standards  and performs on system  as designed by developer\/provider . If the submitted mobile widget  passes validation process , then the respective mobile widget  will be classified as a trusted widget. In some aspects, trusted mobile widgets may have a trust indicator, such as a digital certificate corresponding to UWM  or widget validation component  to indicate trustworthiness. If the submitted mobile widget  either fails validation process  or enters system  in another manner, such as via the public domain or from being directly defined by a user, then the respective mobile widget  may by considered an untrusted widget.","In some aspect, developer\/provider  may submit mobile widget  to system  in the form of an unvalidated widget package , which represents a type of untrusted widget. Unvalidated widget package  may include the relevant components that define the respective widget, including its operation on system  and its pricing. For example, in one aspect, unvalidated widget package  may include: a widget identifier  to identify or describe the widget, and\/or to identify targeted demographics or user behavioral categories to which the widget may be directed; widget application or code  comprising the instructions, objects, etc. to allow the respective widget to operate on a given computer platform, such as different types of wireless communication device  and\/or on a personal computer (PC) using different technologies; a recommended update schedule  that defines a recommendation or suggestion of the developer\/provider  of when the content represented by the widget should be updated\u2014for example, the temporal aspects of widgets may vary, as so some widgets such as a stock watcher widget may preferably have frequent updates during market hours and much less frequent updates after market hours, versus a weather widget which may preferably be updated only a few times per day; and proposed pricing  that defines one or more price-related and\/or marketing\/selling-related aspects of the widget, such as one or more of a desired end user price, developer\/provider compensation or fee or royalty, discounts, carrier-specific pricing, catalog placement considerations including catalog type and slotting position, etc. Upon passing through validation process  and achieving widget system standard(s)  as defined by widget validation component , the respective Invalidated widget package  may be allowed into system  as a validated widget package , which represents a type of trusted widget.","Mobile widgets  accepted by UWM  may be accessed and modified by both developer\/provider  and operator\/carrier  via a widget virtual negotiation component  that may be entered, for example, via developer interface  and operator\/carrier interface , respectively. Similar to developer interface , operator\/carrier interface  provides an access point, such as an extranet, for operator\/carrier  to interact with UWM . For example, one or more operators\/carriers  may review mobile widgets , or in some aspects validated widget packages , to determine if they want to include the respective widget in one or more widget catalogs  available to end users  of system . Further, for example, widget virtual negotiation component  allows developers\/providers  and operators\/carriers  to negotiate various aspects of a respective mobile widget , such as widget pricing, developer compensation, operator compensation, update scheduling, etc. In one aspect, for example, widget virtual negotiation component  may include a widget bidding exchange including auction functionality to control and report the results of an auction process used to define agreed upon parameters corresponding to a respective mobile widget . In any case, in some aspects, after agreement between developers\/providers  and operators\/carriers  on the final set of widget parameters, the mobile widget  may be defined by a negotiated mobile widget package . For example, negotiated mobile widget package  may include: a widget identifier  to identify or describe the widget and\/or to identify targeted demographics or user behavioral categories to which the widget may be directed, which may be the same as identifier  or which may be operator\/carrier specific; widget application or code  comprising the instructions, objects, etc. to allow the respective widget to operate on a given computer platform, which may be the same as widget application or code  or which may be operator\/carrier specific; a negotiated update schedule  that defines negotiated or initially accepted content update schedule, which may be the same as recommended update schedule  or which may be operator\/carrier specific; and negotiated pricing  that defines one or more price-related and\/or marketing\/selling-related aspects of the widget as agreed upon during the negotiation, which may be the same as proposed pricing  or which may be operator\/carrier-developer\/provider specific or negotiation specific.","Referring specifically to , in one non-limiting example, one aspect of an architecture  and method  corresponding to widget virtual negotiation component  () include an online auction server  operable to interact with UWM  to perform auction administration duties and to transmit auction results. For example, online auction server  may be operable to present mobile widget inventory to operators\/carriers  (), as well as biddable parameters associated with each mobile widget, such as pricing and placement (, action ). For example, biddable parameters corresponding to mobile widget placement may include, but are not limited to, parameters such as slotting placement for position on a widget wall, a \u201cfeatured\u201d parameter corresponding to featuring the respective mobile widget in the display of a shopping mobile widget, and slotting placement for each category of widgets or for each widget catalog. Further, the mobile widgets presented by online auction server  may have additional targeting metadata, such as the data of the targeted demographics or user behavioral categories to which the widget may be directed. As such, operator\/carrier  () is able to access biddable items and enter bids corresponding thereto (, actions  and ). Based on the auction results (, action ), UWM  modifies the records of corresponding mobile widgets  and\/or mobile widget catalogs  (, action ), which are received by WMS  and updated in the corresponding records of digital locker  (, action ). Thus, as a result, such updated records are then made available to WMC  and widget management portal  to insure end user  () has access to the latest information.","Additionally, in some aspects, UWM  allows operator\/carrier  to organize one or more mobile widgets  into one or more widget catalogs , for example, using a catalog manager component  accessible via operator\/carrier interface . In one aspect, for example, operator\/carrier  selects negotiated widget packages  for inclusion in one or more widget catalogs , which may be organized in many different fashions, such as by widget functionality, etc. Further, for example, each widget catalog  includes a listing of mobile widgets  that may be organized in a predetermined fashion, such as based on payments for a given slotting placement, etc. Widget catalog  may be defined by a catalog record that includes mobile widget metadata describing each mobile widget  and corresponding parameters that may be of interest to a catalog viewer, such as one or any combination of a name of the widget, a description of the widget functionality, a graphic or visual representation of the widget, widget pricing and purchasing information, etc. Further, for example, the listing of mobile widgets  in widget catalogs  may be varied after creation of widget catalog , such as based on end user preferences, and\/or end user behavioral information, and\/or end user device capabilities. In any case, catalog manager component  further allows operator\/carrier  to transmit widget catalogs  to WMS  so that the listed mobile widgets  may be made available to end users .","Further, UWM  may further include a widget manager component  that allows operator\/carrier  to change one or more parameters or characteristics of mobile widget . For example widget manager component  may allow operator\/carrier  to: activate or deactivate a respective mobile widget  for operation on system ; set or change a widget identifier, such as identifier ; set or change widget application\/code, such as application\/code ; set or change a widget update schedule, such as update schedule ; and\/or set or change pricing information, such a pricing .

Widgets of interest may be identified by the WMS  based on widget usage tracking\/metering data communicated from the wireless device . Once a user selects, acquires or otherwise purchases a new widget, the user management portal  communicates the selection to the WMS  and the WMS  subsequently retries the widget from a corresponding content access server  () and communicates the widget to the wireless device via message router .","Content Access Server\/Content-Advertising-Tracking Components","Referring to , a detailed block diagram highlighting the content access server  is depicted. Content access server  is operable to provide content to the mobile widgets  based on a predetermined update schedule for the widget. As previously mentioned the update schedule may be logically determined based on one or more content delivery attributes, network attributes and\/or user configuration settings. A mobile widget  will initiate a content request  based on the update schedule, which is wirelessly received by the content access server  via the message router . The content access server  will act on the request  by retrieving current content from content provider  or, in the case of advertisements serving platform , which is in communication with an advertisement source. Once the content update is retrieved, the update is communicated to the wireless device for presentation on the corresponding widget. For example, if the mobile widget is a sporting event score reporting widget, a request may be sent to the content access server and the content access server mat retrieve a content update, in the form of updated sporting event scores from a content provider , such as a web-based sports news site or the like. In one aspect, the content access server  may include a content package bundler  operable to bundle updates in a content update package, such as a \/zip file or some other spectrally efficient compression mechanism. Bundling content updates in packages provides for smaller messages that can be more efficiently delivered to the wireless devices.

The bidding exchange marketplace may provide for the advertisers  to bid on widget advertising based one or more advertising criteria, such as a position\/placement of the advertisement on the widget wall, the frequency of presentation, the time of presentation, the demographics of the target audience and the like. In addition, the bidding exchange marketplace may provide for the advertisers to bid based on broadcast and\/or multicast presentation of advertisements in the widget. In one aspect, the bidding exchange marketplace is a publicly available marketplace, such as an Internet-based marketplace that allows for all advertisers or potential advertisers to bid on widget-based advertising.","Backend System","Referring back to , as previously noted, in some aspects, system  may have a backend system  for analyzing the tracked data and transactions within system . Backend system  may include one or any combination of analytics component , reporting component , and billing component .","Analytics component  receives and examines the data of system .","Reporting component  generates reports, including operator\/carrier proprietary information , based on the results of the analysis of analytics component .","Billing component  accounts for transactions in system  and debits and\/or credits one or more end users , developers\/providers , operators\/carriers , or advertisers .","Sample Call Flows","Referring to , according to some aspects, some non-limiting examples of call or messages flows are listed for various scenarios. Referring to , for example in one aspect, a high level call flow relates to a widget management portal (WMP)-originated selection and configuration of a new mobile widget. In particular, WMP interacts with WMS to select and configure the mobile widget. The WMS interacts with CAS to obtain the content for the mobile widget. Additionally, the WMS forwards the mobile widget and\/or the content update for the mobile widget to the WMC via the message router.","Referring to , for example in one aspect, a high level call flow relates to a WMC-originated selection, configuration and updating of a mobile widget. In particular, WMC interacts with WMS to select and configure the mobile widget. The WMS interacts with CAS to obtain the content for the mobile widget. Further, the WMC may request a content update for the mobile widget from the CAS, which responds with the updated content, which the WMC confirms receiving.","Referring to , for example in one aspect, a high level call flow relates to a WMC accessing a web storefront in the WMS, wherein the operator\/carrier authorizes the access. In particular, the WMC requests access to the storefront from the WMS, which verifies with the operator\/carrier that WMC is authorized for such access. For example, the verification may include passing an identifier or a credential associated with the WMC or the end user to a content management server or authorization server of the operator\/carrier to determine if WMC is authorized. Upon receiving an authorization, WMS is then able to provide WMC with access to the storefront and allows subsequent interaction for downloading of mobile widgets.","Referring to , for example in one aspect, a high level call flow relates to a content update requested by a WMC. In particular, based on the occurrence of a content update event, WMC sends a content update request via the message router to the CAS. The CAS bundles the corresponding content update and transmit it to the WMC via the message router. It should be noted that in one example, the content update request may be user initiated. Additionally, it should also be noted that WMC may package metering\/tracking data along with the content update request. In this case, CAS is operable to route the metering\/tracking data to other infrastructure elements, such as the analytics component of backend system and\/or the advertisement serving platform.","Referring to , for example in one aspect, a high level call flow relates to a reporting of widget metering\/tracking data and a corresponding adjustment of a widget update schedule based on the reported metering\/tracking data. In particular, WMC transmits a widget message that includes metering\/tracking data to CAS via message router. CAS is operable to route the metering\/tracking data to other infrastructure elements, such as the analytics and reporting components in this case. The analytics and reporting components then determine usage data based on the reported metering\/tracking data, which is provided as an input to the WMS and\/or the UWM for use in determining content update schedules. Based on the usage data, a new update schedule is determined for one or more users, and\/or for one or more mobile widgets. The new update schedule is stored at the WMS and\/or the UWM, and is further communicated to the WMC via the message router. Thus, a new update schedule is effected based on an analysis of the reported metering\/tracking data provided by WMC.","Referring to , for example in one aspect, a high level call flow relates to the CAS providing WMC with a content update. In particular, CAS transmits a content request to a content provider, who responds with a content document. The content document may include various updated content, as well as references to resources for further content updates. The CAS parses the content document and, if necessary, requests the additional resources from the content provider. Upon receiving the requested resources, the CAS transforms the resources and the other content from the content document into an update package for delivery to WMC. Upon completing the transformation, the CAS forwards the content update packet to the WMC via the message router.","Widget\/System Security","Referring to , in one aspect, the described aspects include apparatus and methods for insuring the security of system  () with respect to the operation of mobile widgets  (). In particular, in some aspects, one of the features of the widget management system of  is an ability to qualify mobile widgets through an acceptance process that could be implemented as part of the Unified Widget Manager (UWM) . The mechanism by which developers\/providers  submit mobile widgets  may be as simple as a web upload, however, upon submission, the mobile widget may undergo one or more validation processes , some of which may be automated, some of which may be manual, and some of which may be a mix of manual and automated testing.","Widget validation component  may include a validation processor module  to actuate or manage validation process , including evaluating mobile widgets  according to one or more widget system standards .","In one aspect, for example, widget validation component  checks that submitted mobile widgets  conform to development and packaging guidelines, which may be a part of widget system standards . This can be a fully automated process, and includes ensuring the respective mobile widget  conforms to standardized packaging, for instance, as defined in the Worldwide Web Consortium, and pre-specified programming guidelines.","In another aspect, for example, widget validation component  may be operable to perform widget emulation and testing, which may involve manual testing (including human observations of widget performance), automated testing, or a combination of both. Such testing may result in widget performance data  for a respective mobile widget , which validation processor module  may then compare against one or more mobile widget specifications . In particular, mobile widget specifications  may include one or more activity standards  that define whether or not a mobile widget is considered acceptable to system , also referred to as a trusted mobile widget, or unacceptable to system , also referred to as an untrusted mobile widget or a hostile mobile widget. In one aspect, such activity standards  relate to how operator\/carrier  () desires mobile widget  to perform on wireless interface  () of operator\/carrier . For example, the activities of mobile widget  may affect the performance of wireless interface  and\/or wireless communication device  and\/or other wireless devices operating on wireless interface . For example, the one or more activity standards  may include, but are not limited to, standards for one or any combination of activities, such as: a number of generated messages; a type of generated message; an amount of memory usage; an amount of processor usage; operator-specific activities; access to one or more resources on a corresponding wireless communication device; a number of wireless connections; and any other activity affecting performance of the wireless network or devices on the wireless network.","Additionally, mobile widget specification , and correspondingly one or more activity standards , may vary depending on the respective mobile widget , for example, based on a widget classification or type . As such, in one aspect, each mobile widget  may be associated with one of the widget classifications or types , and validation processor module  may execute one or more validation processes  for a respective mobile widget  based on a given widget classification or type  corresponding to that mobile widget . For example, widget classification or type  may relate to the kind of content included in the respective mobile widget, which may relate to the expected activities of the mobile widget. Thus, widget validation component  may test a respective mobile widget  according to one or more classification-specific mobile widget specifications .","Moreover, in some aspects, widget validation component  not only validates mobile widgets  upon submission to system  (), but also after acceptance into system . For example, one or more validation processes  may include random or scheduled testing of one or more mobile widgets  active in system . In this case, for example, widget performance data  may include actual performance data collected from one or more mobile widgets  operating in system . For example, widget performance data  may be collected by WMC  on one or more wireless communication devices  and forwarded to UWM , and hence widget validation component , via the collection of metering\/tracking data  performed by CAS . For example, CAS  may collect metering\/tracking data  and forward it to UWM  directly or via WMS . As such, validation processor module  or another component within system  may be operable to parse widget performance data  from metering\/tracking data  for one or more mobile widgets . Thus, widget validation component  is able to perform on-going monitoring of mobile widgets  within system .","In another aspect, in the case when widget validation component  determines an active mobile widget  to be unacceptable, untrusted, or hostile, then widget validation component  may take any number of actions to protect system  (). Hostile mobile widgets may include, for example, mobile widgets that make an unnecessary amount of network calls, mobile widgets that require an abnormal amount of memory or make unnecessary handset file input\/output calls, mobile widgets that send an abnormal amount of text messaging, and mobile widgets that send personal information in an insecure manner, among other hostile mobile widgets. Abnormal may include, for example, a number above a threshold set by a user or system operator or carrier to indicate when a widget may start to adversely affect a network's performance. In an aspect, message router  may track mobile widget  network calls determining whether mobile widget  is making an unnecessary amount of network calls. Message router  may forward the determined data regarding mobile widget  to UWM  directly or via WMS , and hence widget validation component . In another aspect, CAS  may collect metering\/tracking data  regarding the amount of text messaging or file system access occurring from mobile widget  forwarding the data to UWM  directly or via WMS .","In one aspect, for example, widget validation component  may transmit a message to developer\/provider  notifying them of the validation result. For example, the message may include the details and\/or the results of the comparison of widget performance data  and mobile widget specification . Such notification allows developer\/provider  to take corrective action to fix the problem causing the unacceptable results. In another aspect, widget validation component  may disable or remove the unacceptable mobile widget  from system . For example, widget validation component  may change an enable\/disable setting in a record corresponding to mobile widget , or may send a disabling message  to effect removal or inactivation of the respective mobile widget  in system . Such settings or records may be stored in the memory or database of one or more system components, such as but not limited to one or any combination of UWM , WMS , or WMC . In one aspect, for example, disabling message  may be forwarded all the way to each WMC  having the respective unacceptable mobile widget . Such a disabling message  may cause WMC to execute a disabling module  to make the respective mobile widget inoperable on wireless device , or to remove the respective mobile widget from wireless device . In an aspect, digital locker  () may maintain the licenses for the respective mobile widgets and remove or eliminate licenses that correspond to an unacceptable mobile widget . In another aspect, CAS  may implement traffic monitoring for the mobile widgets and upon detecting a suspicious or unacceptable mobile widget , mobile widget  may be disabled or may require further traffic analysis offline before disabling mobile widget . Alternatively, such a disabling message  may be a synchronization request message that prompts WMC  to synchronize settings for the resident version of mobile widget  with the settings for the network version of mobile widget , thereby causing mobile widget  to be inoperable on wireless interface\/network  of operator\/carrier .","Referring to , in one non-limiting aspect, a method  of managing a mobile widget on a network device includes receiving performance data corresponding to operation of a mobile widget at . The performance data can be data based on testing of mobile widget, or based on the actual operation of the mobile widget on a wireless interface\/network.","The method also includes obtaining a mobile widget specification corresponding to the mobile widget, wherein the mobile widget specification comprises one or more acceptable activity standards for a respective one or more activities of an acceptable mobile widget at . The mobile widget specification may be specific to an operator\/carrier network to enable the operator\/carrier to define behavior of the mobile widget on the operator\/carrier network. Further, the mobile widget specification may vary depending on a classification or type of the mobile widget, as different kinds of mobile widgets may be expected to have different behaviors.","Further, the method includes comparing the performance data to the mobile widget specification at . Such comparison includes evaluating one or more mobile widget activities against a corresponding one or more activity standards corresponding to the respective mobile widget.","The method also includes identifying the mobile widget as a trusted mobile widget if the performance data meets the respective one or more acceptable activity standards at . The identification enables a mobile widget to be accepted for operation of within a wireless network of mobile widgets.","Additionally, the method includes storing the identification corresponding to the mobile widget at . The identification, which corresponds to the mobile widget being acceptable for operation in a wireless network, may be stored in the memory or database of one or more system components, such as but not limited to one or any combination of UWM , WMS , or WMC . It should also be noted that an identification of the mobile widget being unacceptable or untrusted may also result from the comparison, and such identification may also likewise be stored and may further trigger actions to disable or remove the mobile widget from the system and\/or to notify the developer\/provider of the problem corresponding to the activities of the mobile widget.","Referring to , in another non-limiting aspect, a method  of managing a mobile widget on a wireless communication device includes tracking performance data corresponding to operation of a mobile widget on a wireless communication device at . A widget management client operating on a wireless device may collect widget activity data based on the actual operation of a mobile widget within the system, and as part of tracking\/metering the activities corresponding to the mobile widget.","Further, the method includes forwarding the tracked performance data across a wireless network for analysis at . The widget management client may report the tracked activity data to one or more network infrastructure elements, which may be responsible for maintaining or improving the operation of the system of mobile widgets or the operation of a wireless network including the mobile widgets as well as other wireless communication devices.","The method also includes receiving a widget disabling message based on a comparison of the performance data to a mobile widget specification, wherein the mobile widget specification comprises one or more acceptable activity standards for a respective one or more activities of an acceptable mobile widget at . The tracked performance data may be used by the network elements to evaluate the mobile widget. Such tracked data, either alone or in combination with other similar tracked data for other wireless devices operating a similar mobile widget, may then be analyzed according to specified activity standards to determine an acceptability of the mobile widget. If the reported activities meet the standard, then the mobile widget may be allowed to continue to operate. If the reported activities do not conform to the standard, then the respective mobile widget may be disabled or removed from a device or from the network.","Additionally, the method includes disabling the mobile widget based on the widget disabling message at . As noted, based on the tracked performance data violating a standard, a mobile widget may be disabled from operation, thereby enabling a wireless network operator to achieve a standard of operation in the network.","Life Cycle Management","According to another aspect, systems, methods, and apparatus are provided that allow for mobile widgets portability between different platforms. In this regard, the mobile widgets are developed such that they can be implemented on any mobile device regardless of device type, device manufacturer, or device model. Although runtime environments in the mobile device environment are fractured, the portable mobile widgets of present aspects are capable of being executed on any wireless device's implementation of a web runtime technology. Portability of widgets is made possible by development of widgets that can be modified for different instantiations of the widget client.","For example, a widget may be configured to utilize audio resources, such as a music player widget or the like. If the widget is used a wireless device that supports only MP3 file playback capabilities, the widget resources are made available as MP3 files based on implementation of a platform within the client that supports MP3 files. However, if the user upgrades or otherwise changes wireless devices to a device that supports multiple forms of audio encoding, including more compact formatting of audio file playback, such as AAC or the like, the widget resources may be made available as AAC files or the like based on implementation of a platform within the client that supports AAC files.","In addition to supporting different wireless device manufacturer and model platforms, the mobile widget client may also be configured to support non-mobile environments, such as desktop platforms. Thus, allowing for portability not only between different wireless devices but also between wireless devices and non-wireless devices, such as personal computers or the like.","Additionally, referring to , each mobile widget client  may provide for multiple operational modes in addition to providing for multiple platform functionality. For example, multiple operational modes may include low memory widgets and compressed mode widgets, among other multiple operational modes. Thus, with respect to low memory widgets and compressed mode widgets, a single mobile widget client may include the standard operation mode widget, the corresponding low memory mode widget, the corresponding compressed mode widget, and any other operational mode for more than one platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0192"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 27"],"b":["102","150","102","152","152","152","152","154","156","158","160","152","154","156","158","160","152","154","156","160","152","154","158","160"]},"Widget Generated Content","Yet another aspect is defined by systems, methods, and apparatus that provided for mobile widgets operable to generate and output content to another entity, which is operable to use the output of the widget as input to another function. For example, a widget may be provided that is operable to receive user queries, such as a network search widget, communicate the queries to the network and receive data (e.g., search results) in response to the query. In another example, a widget may be provided that is operable to receive user inputs for a real-time or near-real time service, such as Voice over IP (VoIP), chat or the like) and communicate the inputs to the network, which in turn communicates the inputs to intended addressee. In yet another example, a widget may be provided for purchasing transactions, such as the purchase of additional widgets or any other product or service. The purchasing widget is operable to allow the user to select or otherwise input purchase options, which are communicated to the network and, in response the wireless device wirelessly receives the product (e.g., a new widget) or service or receives confirmation of the purchase, via SMS message, email or the like.","Additionally, in one specific aspect, a widget may be operable to generate alerts, which may be communicated internally within the wireless device or externally to the network to trigger some action or event. For example, a widget may be configured to monitor battery level within the wireless device and provide for an alert\/alarm to be communicated to an output user interface, such as display or an audio output, if the battery power level drops to a predetermined level. In addition, to sending the alert\/alarm to user interfaces, such that the user is alerted of the low battery power level, the alert may also be sent to other applications running on the wireless device for the purpose of disabling applications, or changing the mode of operation of applications, such as moving an application from a standard mode of operation to a low battery power mode of operation or the like. In another example, a widget may be configured to monitor the location of the wireless device user (for example, a child) and alerts may be generated and communicated to the serving network if the user is outside of a predetermined location boundary, referred to in the art as a geofence. In response to receipt of the alert, the serving network may send a communication to another wired or wireless device, such as an SMS, email or the like, notifying the recipient (for example, a parent) that the wireless device user is outside of the predetermined location boundary.","Referring to , a block diagram is illustrated on a wireless device  configured with content generating widgets and a content bundler application, in accordance with aspects of the innovation. Similar to previously described wireless device, wireless device  includes processor , which is in communication with memory , communications module , and user interface . The wireless device includes one or more mobile widget clients  that are operable to generate content  that requires communication to the serving network. In order to efficiently communicate such content to the serving network it may desirable to bundle or package content  that is outputted by one or more of the widget clients . As such, Widget Management Client (WMC)  may further include a content packager  operable to receive content  from widget clients  and package the content in a single communication for the purpose of minimizing upstream data transmissions. The content packager  may be configured to package all generated content with a predetermined time period  or the content packager  may be configured to include a polling mechanism  operable to poll the content generating widgets  to determine if generated content is currently being generated or will be generated within a predetermined immediate time period for the purpose of determining the generated content that will be included in a pending package. Additionally, the content packager  may include a content priority determiner  operable to determine the significance or priority of content based on the widget client  or identifiers placed in the generated content. As such, prioritized content may be communicated immediately as opposed to being packaged. For example, clients  that generate alerts or alarms may need to be communicated to the serving network immediately so that appropriate actions can be taken at the network level in a timely fashion.","Widget Integration with IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)","In other aspects, systems, methods, and apparatus provide for widget integration with other network information to enable other services. In this regard, the widget can act as a portal to other information, such as user\/subscriber information, session information, network capability information, or information regarding other network services. In one specific aspect, a widget may operable for providing caller identification from a call received on a legacy landline, Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) or VoIP-Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) device. In this regard, the widget, through the serving network, may be integrated with the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as a source for caller ID information, user\/subscription information or the like.","IMS is a set of specifications that describes the Next Generation Networking (NGN) architecture for implementing IP based telephony and multimedia services. IMS defines a complete architecture and framework that enables the convergence of voice, video, data, and mobile network technology over an IP-based infrastructure. It fills the gap between the two most successful communication paradigms, cellular and Internet technology. Moreover, IMS provides seamless integration, coordination, and flow of information between widgets and the IMS core network. Thus, IMS allows for unified access methods to various operator networks by integrating the widget platforms with the operator networks.","In one aspect, widget\/IMS integration provides the widget with a source for user\/subscription information, such as user\/subscriber identity, single sign-on, authentication, or the like. The present solution is in contrast to current mobile widget solutions, which do not have direct mechanisms for tapping into cellular authentication. The existing workarounds are clunky (e.g., sending a dummy http request and picking off user ID from the response header; sending an SMS and picking off the phone number at the widget server). Utilizing the IMS authentication allows the present mobile widget service to have direct IP-based access to user credentials. By providing for a network source of such information, widgets that utilize such user identification and\/or authentication may not be required to have the user manually enter such data. Thus, this aspect provides for an added level of security in wireless devices, such as GSM devices or the like, which may have multiple users with each user being associated with an individual removable identity module.","Turning now to , illustrated is a schematic diagram of an example of the interaction of a widget service broker in accordance with an aspect. In the illustrated example, Widget Services Broker (WSB)  may interface widget services and capabilities with the various data from the network. In addition, WSB  may interface directly or indirectly to third party application services providing necessary widget content through one or more of IP, HTTP, or web services interfaces. For example, WSB  may interface via content proxies  to third party websites . Additionally, WSB  may interface with WMS , and one or more service providers .","In one aspect, WSB  may be operable for brokering and intermediating interactions between WMS  and the IMS network domains across multiple service providers . For example, WSB  may include mapping component  operable for discovering and maintaining mapping addresses pertaining to individual services offered by each domain and implementing the data requests and responses. Moreover, WSB  may use the mapping addresses for routing data between WMS  and IMS network domains.","In another aspect, WSB  may be operable to gain access to necessary service functions within each domain. For example, WSB  may include authentication component  operable for implementing the necessary Parlay\/OSA authentication capabilities in order to gain access to necessary service functions within each domain.","In addition, WSB  may include subscription component  operable for subscribing to IMS networks  and implementing the appropriate accounting and policy management notification functions required from IMS network .","In an additional aspect, WSB  may be operable for authenticating, authorizing, managing, and servicing requests for network based data received from WMS  and content proxy . For example, WSB  may include a managing component  and translation component  operable for managing requests from, for example, WMS , content proxy , or end user  and translating protocols between different interface technologies.","Thus, WSB  may unify the messaging across different interface technologies and protocols allowing for unified access to various service providers . In an aspect, WSB  may be operable for channeling real time network event notifications to WMS . For example, WSB  may include network event notification component  notifying WMS  of real time network events. Real time network events may be for example, voice calls, SMS\/MMS messaging, voicemail notifications, presence and availability information, charging or broadcast information of wireless device  () or other registered devices in the IMS system, among other real time network events.","Referring now to , illustrated is a block diagram depicting one example of the integration between IMS and widgets, specifically widget management at the serving network. In the illustrated example, the digital locker  of the widget management system  acts as an extension to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS)  within the IMS architecture . The HSS  provides the digital locker  with a source for subscriber information , session information , subscription information , and any other HSS information . The digital locker  may be logically or physically separated from HSS . In this regard, the interface  between the digital locker  and HSS  may be Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)-based, which provides for tight coupling and deep integration, or eXtension Markup Language\/Simple Object Access Protocol (XML\/SOAP)-based or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol\/Representational State Transfer (HTTP\/REST)-based, both of which provide loose coupling, or any other suitable interface mechanism.","In one specific aspect, the IMS  integration with the WMS  and, in particular the HSS  integration with the digital locker , may provide for a public (i.e., outside) firewall for the widget(s)  being executed on the wireless device  and\/or a private (i.e., inside) firewall for the widget management system .","Referring now to , illustrated is a block diagram of another integration architecture having a service capability feature integration made available to the widget management system. Service Capability Server (SCS), such as Open Service Architecture (OSA) SCS , is integrated with the WMS  and the HSS  of the IMS . In the illustrated example, the HSS information, such as subscriber information , session information , subscription information , and any other HSS information , is made available to the WMS  via the SCS . The SCS interfaces with the WMS  via Parlay\/OSA Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) , and the transport interface between the SCS  and the WMS  may be CORBA, Web Services Definition Language (WSDL), or any other suitable transport interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0208"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["394","300","394","300","950","960","380","1","380","1","2","380","2","3","380","3","380","394","300","950","960","952","954","956","958","962","964","964","966"]},"For example, in one aspect, SCS  may include a user authentication service SCS operable to authenticate an identity of wireless device  and\/or end user  with a third party service, such as website. For example, such user authentication may be in the context of a user application, including a mobile widget. In one aspect, at the backend, the user authentication service SCS function  interfaces with the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) elements and the HSS  to exchange authentication information in order to authenticate and validate the user  and\/or device  and\/or application, for example, based on a previously determined shared secret, such as a login and\/or password. In some aspects, the interactions are encrypted and information is returned regarding the time validity of such authentication. Once the user  and\/or device  and\/or the application is authenticated, the WMS  saves the authentication information in the digital locker  and maps and applies this information for access to third party services, such as content provider websites, on behalf of the user. In other words, WSB  provides an interface between network resources  and\/or network services , via one or more SCSs , to manage authorizing device  and\/or user  and\/or an application, such as a mobile widget , thereby providing subsequent, automatic authorization, and access to the respective resource or service based on the obtained authorization.","More specifically, turning now to , illustrated is an exemplary flow diagram  illustrating user authentication in accordance with an aspect. While the illustrated example will be described in relation to widget user authentication, it should be appreciated that the below method of user authentication may be applied to web interactions in general and is not limited to widget applications. User authentication may be used, for example, for logging into websites that require a user name and password, validating that the user is a registered for access to a particular service or subscription, determining whether the user is paying for a specific service or subscription, or any other shared secret information relating to the user.","At , WSB  is brought on-line, instantiated, or otherwise made operable within the system. At , WSB  authenticates itself with an OSA Gateway (OSA GW) . Next, at , WSB  discovers one or more available User Authentication Service Service Capability Servers (UAS SCS)  (Note: For convenience, the figure only illustrates one SCS), and, at , authenticates itself with the one or more available UAS SCS . The authentication process occurring between WSB  and OSA GW  and UAS SCS  in steps , ,  and  may be a one time configuration with a particular system instantiating WSB .","Next, at , WMS  sends an authentication request to WSB . The request may be automatically sent by WMS  or, as indicated by the dashed line, initiated by end user , device , WMC , or a user application such as a mobile widget . Note: For simplicity, the figure only illustrates device . The request may include, for example, a login request, request for subscription information (e.g., news reports from the Wall Street Journal), a payment request, a widget refresh request, or a service request, among other requests. In an aspect, the request may include parameters (e.g., a subscriber ID (SID) identifying the end user  and a service provider ID (SPID) identifying the network or service provider ). In some aspects, multiple users from across various networks and service providers may be identified in the request. For example, in an aspect, multiple requests from multiple users may be combined into a single request message. In an aspect, the request message may be an XML tag including the various number of requests for a particular network.","At , WSB  uses the parameters included in the request message to map the identified service provider  (), and thus the corresponding UAS SCS . For example, WSB  may use an internal mapping function stored in WSB  to map to service provider's  IP address and apply the correct protocols for the message to service provider . Thus, at , WSB  sends a check user authorization based on the requested message to UAS SCS  in the correct format for service provider . Next, at , UAS SCS  interacts with HSS  of the service provider to authenticate user  using the parameters from the request message received by UAS SCS . After UAS SCS  receives authentication of user  from HSS , at , WSB  receives a check user authentication response from UAS SCS . The check user authentication response may include parameters, such as a SID and configurations based upon a particular service requested, whether user  is authorized for a particular website, or whether user  is authorized for a particular service, among other parameters. At , WSB  sends WMS  a user authorization response with the parameters forwarded from UAS SCS  at . Next, at , WMS  sends a save user credentials message to digital locker  with the SID and the parameters forwarded from WSB . At , after receiving the SID and parameters from WMS , digital locker  saves user  credentials for use in the current transaction, e.g., logging onto a website, or for use in future transactions.","Storing credentials for user  in digital locker  may avoid the necessity of user  sending the credentials every time user  tries to access a service provider or a website requiring user authentication. In other words, WSB  and WMS  can work together to manage authentication credentials for one or more services of interest to user . Thus, the user may experience seamless interaction with the service providers or websites since the user does not need to provide the credentials for the user every time the user accesses the website or service provider. Instead, the WMS can retrieve the user's credentials from the digital locker and forward them to the WMS for authentication with the service provider or website.","Moreover, multiple authentications may be prevented by authenticating user  once with service provider . In one aspect, after the authentication of user , WSB may send a token or key, for example, to various service providers or websites authenticating user  for accessing the respective services provided. In another aspect, as illustrated in , after user's  credentials are stored in digital locker , WSB  may retrieve the user's credentials from digital locker  and send the information to the separate websites requesting user's  credentials. Therefore, if user  is trying to access multiple websites that require different passwords, digital locker  can retrieve the respective passwords for the various websites and login.","Additionally, the authentication may serve as verification for multiple domains across multiple application providers. Thus, the user has the ability to interface seamlessly between different operators and service providers with a single set of credentials without having separate credentials for different service providers.","Furthermore, it should be noted that the user's credentials may be associated with a particular wireless device allowing for the wireless device to be easily associated with a particular user.","Referring now to , correspondingly, once user authentication credentials are obtained and stored, in one aspect, the WMS  can act on behalf of a mobile widget user application  to obtain content and services. For example,  illustrates an example flow diagram  identifying interactions between WMS  and IMS in accordance with such as aspect. At , widget  sends an update widget request message to WMS . The update widget request message may include parameters, such as, SID and a widget identification (WID). In an aspect, user  () may have multiple widgets with different WIDs stored in digital locker . The update widget request message may include, for example, refreshing widget , a request to receive data from content provider , among other update requests. Next, at , WMS  may send a get widget information message to digital locker  with the WID as a parameter. At , digital locker  may retrieve widget information corresponding to the WID sent from WMS . Widget information may include, for example, identification of personal information (e.g., passwords, billing information, login identifications, among others) of user  (), access control information, or URL information, among other widget information.","At , after digital locker  retrieves widget information for widget , WMS  receives a get widget information response from digital locker . The get widget information response may include parameters, such as, WID, SID and any access or control information regarding content provider  related to widget . Next, at , WMS  sends a user authentication request including parameters (e.g., SID) to digital locker . At , after digital locker checks the stored user 's credentials for authorization and validity. At , if user  is valid, digital locker  forwards the shared secret parameters for accessing content provider  to WMS .","At , after receiving the parameters for accessing content provider , WMS  sends content provider  a get content request message. The get content request message may contain parameters including the shared secret for connecting to content provider . Next, at , content provider  sends the requested content to WMS . At , WMS  sends widget  an update widget response with the provided content from content provider  and any additional resources widget  may need.","Referring back to , in another example, SCS  may include a network event notification service SCS operable to inform device  and\/or end user  of IMS network events.","For example, referring to , a flow diagram  illustrates interactions between the widget management system and a network event notification SCS in an accordance with an aspect. A network event notification (NEN) or network event may include, for example, events happening in an operator's network that need to be communicated to the user. For example, one aspect of such a network event notification includes remote access to caller ID information, which provides information regarding calls to a particular subscribed number, such as to a landline phone, with the network event notification SCS reflecting such information, such as a caller ID, back to the user\/device via a widget, SMS\/MMS messaging, voicemail notifications, etc.","At , WSB  authenticates with service provider  () via OSA GSW  establishing a relationship between WSB  and network . Next, at , WSB  discovers the available NEN service capability servers (NEN SCS) , and at , WSB  may be authenticated and authorized to communicate with NEN SCS . At , WMS  sends a NEN registration message to WSB  including parameters indicating the NEN requested by user . For example, the parameters may be a subscriber ID (SID) identifying the end user , a service provider ID (SPID) identifying the network or service provider , and a NEN type identifying the type of NEN user  is requesting. Next, at , WSB  uses the parameters included in the NEN registration message to map the identified service provider . For example, WSB  may use an internal mapping function stored in WSB  to map to service provider's  IP address and apply the correct protocols for the message to service provider . Thus, at , WSB  sends a NEN request message to NEN SCS  in the correct format for service provider . The NEN request message may include the SID, a request ID, and the NEN type as parameters, for example.","At , after receiving the NEN request message from WSB , NEN SCS  may register the NEN events forwarded in the NEN request message. Next, at , NEN SCS  may monitor network  for the registered NEN events identified by the SPID parameter and the NEN type parameter. At , after the NEN event occurs, NEN SCS  sends a notify NEN message to WSB  notifying WSB  that an NEN event has occurred. At , WSB  forwards a NEN received message to WMS  indicating the SID, NEN type and any additional parameters forwarded from NEN SCS  relating to the NEN event. At  and , WMS  updates the digital locker  and widget  status by forwarding an update NEN status message to digital locker . The update NEN status message may include parameters identifying the SID, the NEN type and any additional parameters relating to the NEN event. Thus, user  may register once for a NEN and is notified upon occurrence of the event.","Therefore, WSB  provides access to any SCS , and thus to any network resources  and network services  services by any SCS .","In addition to providing network resource  and\/or network service  in their original format, packaged at the WMS  for widget display, in one aspect, integration of network resources  and network services  provide WMS  with the capability to blend or \u201cmash-up\u201d network resource\/service content with content provided by content access server , such as web content . Thus WMS  may additionally provide for a content blender module  operable for blending content from multiple sources, such as network resources, network services, content access server, such as web content, the wireless device\/widget and the like. For example, in one aspect, content from a location tracking widget, such as a web-based map, and content from a network-resource, such as a user\/device location , may be combined to form blended content. In another example, a network event, such as a telephone call, multimedia SIP session, SMS or MMS messaging session or the like may be delivered as a network service  to the wireless device  while the user is interacting with widget , managed via WMS , to provide for blended or \u201cmashed-up\u201d content that includes both the network service content and the content related to the widget.","Additionally, it should be noted that instead of or in addition to having a \u201cContent Blender Module\u201d to drive mash-ups, the mash-up can also be performed by the mobile widget. For example, the mobile widget may directly call into the IMS service, and the mobile widget similarly makes a separate call to the web service, thereby retrieving separate content to be mashed-up.","In addition to blending network resource\/service content with content readily accessible to the widget, such as content from CAS , content generated by the widget  may also be blended or otherwise \u201cmashed-up\u201d to provide for multi-source widget content. For example, the widget  may generate preference data, based on a locally stored user profile, while the CAS  provides access to a web-based mapping content and the network resource  provides access to the user\/device location . The resulting blended content may include the map, the user location on the map, and recommendations for attractions\/restaurants in the area defined by the map, which are retrieved from the web content  based on the widget-generated user preference data. In another example, user interactivity with the widget  could generate content that triggers a service event in one of the SCSs  that could invoke service logic in the SCS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0230","num":"0229"},"figref":["FIG. 36","FIG. 36","FIG. 36"],"b":["700","700","1","701","304"]},"In the illustrated example of , WMS  interfaces with IMS  and content server  via Service Capability Interaction Manager (SCIM) . SCIM  may include logic associated with the execution of applications, other than widget applications, on the wireless device or other widget implementing devices and\/or logics that provide interaction between widget behavior and\/or widget generated content and network resources\/services or the like. In one particular aspect, WMS  may be embodied within the IMS, such as IMS application  or the like.","Turning to , illustrated is a system  for widget management and network\/resource\/service integration.
