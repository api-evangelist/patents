No. 61\/141,502, filed Dec. 30, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.","Subject matter described herein was made with U.S. Government support under Grant Numbers DE-FG02-05ER64071 and DE-FG02-07ER46375 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the presently-disclosed subject matter relates to anode materials for lithium-ion batteries that include an elongated core structure and a plurality of nanostructures, each of which are placed on the surface of the core structure and spaced at a distance from adjacent nanostructures.","Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are rechargeable batteries that have become increasingly common in many consumer products because of their high energy-to-weight ratios, high energy density, and slow self-discharge when not in use. The three primary functional components of a Li-ion battery are an electrolyte, a cathode, and an anode. The electrolyte of a Li-ion battery typically includes a nonaqueous solution of a lithium salt, which is able to carry Li ions between the cathode and anode when the battery passes a current through a circuit. In this regard, the cathode of a Li-ion battery has been mainly formed from a layered oxide material (e.g., lithium cobalt oxide) and the anode material selected for many Li-ion batteries has predominantly been graphite. However, in order to produce Li-ion batteries that have a higher capacity and capacity retention over a number of charge\/discharge cycles, researchers have begun investigating a variety of other materials for use as components of Li-ion batteries.","Recently, one dimensional nanowire (NW)-based materials have been identified as candidates for Li-ion battery electrodes due to their desirable characteristics, including: a faster charge transport, better conducting pathways, and good strain relaxation [1-3]. Indeed, silicon (Si) NW arrays, as well as NWs of cobalt oxide (COO), iron oxide (FeO), and tin oxide (SnO) in a bulk powder form have been shown to retain over 75% of their maximum capacity over ten (10) charge\/discharge cycles, and thus hold promise as potential materials for Li-ion battery electrodes [5-8]. However, despite the potential ability of these materials to serve as electrodes, the stability of these materials during cycling either remains unknown, or in some cases, is significantly limited (e.g., capacity fading after about 30-50 cycles).","Of the various metal and metal oxide systems that have been used as anode materials for Li-ion batteries, both Sn and SnOare interesting because of their concurrent semi-conducting properties and high capacity capabilities (Sn: 994 mAhgand SnO: 781 mAhg), compared to that of graphite (372 mAhg) [11-12]. Notwithstanding the certain apparent benefits that are associated with these metal and metal oxide systems though, significant capacity fading with cycling is still a specific problem in these systems, largely due to enormous volume changes that occur during Li alloying and de-alloying, which subsequently leads to metal segregation and crystallographic deformation [13]. For example, in the case of Sn, the metal segregation and crystallographic deformation has been observed to be as high as 259% [14].","In light of the identified capacity fading drawbacks associated with the above-identified materials, there has been a recent interest in further investigating the use of nanowire-based oxide materials to improve the capacity fading characteristics that are associated with many of these anode materials. Recent studies have shown that SnOnanowires and heterostructured SnO\/InOnanowires retain a capacity of around 700 mAhgfor up to 15 cycles, but the capacity still quickly fades to approximately 300 mAhgafter 50 cycles. Similarly, SnOnanorods have been investigated as an anode material, but, again, these materials have also shown a capacity that fades to approximately 400 mAhgafter 60 cycles.","In any event, and although the above-described studies have indicated that nanoscale tin oxide-based materials may have certain beneficial characteristics that allow them to be used as anode materials in Li-batteries, current research still indicates that these materials exhibit low capacities that range from approximately 300-620 mAhgafter only 50 cycles. As such, an anode material for a lithium battery has yet to be provided that not only remains stable over a number of charge\/discharge cycles, but that also exhibits high-capacity retention during cycling.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes anode materials for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries that exhibit enhanced stability and high-capacity retention over a number of charge\/discharge cycles.","In some embodiments, an anode material for a Li-ion battery is provided that includes an elongated core structure that is capable of forming an alloy with lithium and a plurality of nanostructures, each of which is placed on a surface of the core structure. In these embodiments, each nanostructure is also capable of forming an alloy with lithium and is spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanostructures such that the nanostructures are subsequently able to accommodate the volume expansion that occurs during lithiation and delithiation (i.e., Li alloying and de-alloying).","In one exemplary embodiment of the presently-disclosed anode materials, the core structure is a metal oxide nanowire, such as a tin oxide (SnO), a tungsten trioxide (WO), or a molybdenum oxide (MoO) nanowire. In other embodiments, the core structure is a carbon-based material, such as a carbon nanotube or a carbon microtube.","In some embodiments, the nanostructures, which are placed on the surface of the core structure, are comprised of silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), or a Si and Ge alloy. Each of these materials is capable of forming an alloy with lithium and can be placed on a surface of the core structure to provide an anode material for a lithium ion battery. Furthermore, each of those materials can be placed on the surfaces of the core structures such that the available surface area on the anode materials is increased and the net amount of Li alloying and de-alloying that may occur during charge and discharge cycles is increased as well. In some embodiments, the plurality of nanostructures comprise nanoclusters that are placed on the surface of the core structure and spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanoclusters. In other embodiments, the plurality of nanostructures comprises nanowires that are placed on the surface of the core structure and spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanowires.","In some embodiments, the nanostructures of the presently-disclosed anode materials are spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanostructures in order to accommodate volume expansion during alloying and prevent agglomeration of the nanostructures, which may otherwise occur if the nanostructures are not spaced properly on the core structure. In some embodiments, the distance between adjacent nanostructures is about 1 to about 2.5 times the diameter of the nanostructure, which, in some embodiments, is less than about 50 nm.","In some embodiments, the plurality of nanostructures are placed on the core structures of the anode materials such that the distance between adjacent nanostructures is large enough to accommodate the volume expansion that a particular material will undergo during lithiation. For example, in embodiments where the plurality of nanostructures are comprised of tin, the tin nanostructures are placed on the core structure such that the distance between each tin nanostructure is about 1.4 times the diameter of the nanostructure. As another example, in embodiments where the plurality of nanostructures are comprised of silicon, the distance between each silicon nanostructure is about 1.71 times the diameter of the nanostructure. As yet another example, in embodiments where the nanostructures are comprised of germanium, the distance between each germanium nanostructure is about 1.65 times the diameter of the nanostructure.","Thus, the anode materials of the presently-disclosed subject matter allow for the placement of a variety of different nanostructures on a core structure such that each nanostructure can expand in volume during a lithiation process and prevent agglomeration, while still providing an increased surface area for Li alloying and de-alloying. Furthermore, by spacing the nanostructures at predetermined distances from one another, the anode materials of the presently-disclosed subject matter are able to retain their morphology and conductivity over multiple charge\/discharge cycles to thereby provide an stable anode material with high-capacity retention.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes anode materials for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and, more specifically, anode materials for Li-ion batteries that include an elongated core structure and a plurality of nanostructures, each of which are placed on the surface of the core structure and spaced at a distance from adjacent nanostructures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["10","10","20","30","30","40","20","30","30","40","20","30","30","30","10","30"]},"As shown in , the core structure  of the exemplary anode material  is an elongated structure in the shape of a wire or cylinder. The core structure  can be fabricated from a variety of materials that are capable of forming an alloy with Li to thus provide an anode material that can effectively be used in a Li-ion battery. In some embodiments, the core structure  of the exemplary anode material  is a metal oxide nanowire, such as a tin oxide (SnO) nanowire, a tungsten trioxide (WO) nanowire, or a molybdenum oxide (MoO) nanowire. In other embodiments, the core structure  is a carbon-based material, such as a carbon nanotube or a carbon microtube. Of course, as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, other metal oxide nanowires and carbon-based materials capable of forming an alloy with Li can also be used to fabricate an exemplary anode material without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter disclosed herein.","As noted, the core structure  of the exemplary anode material  shown in  can be a metal oxide nanowire. Such metal oxide nanowires can be synthesized according to a variety of methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, in some embodiments, metal oxide nanowires can be synthesized using a process in which metal powders (e.g., tin (Sn) powder) are reacted directly in a gas phase with oxygen containing plasma to form metal oxide nanowires (e.g., SnOnanowires). Such a process is described in commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/248,731, filed on Oct. 9, 2008, which is incorporated herein by this reference. By using such a process, metal oxide nanowires can be formed that are substantially free or completely free of foreign metal contamination, which could otherwise hinder the electrochemical performance of the nanowires and reduce their ability to be used as part of an anode material of the presently-disclosed subject matter.","In other embodiments, metal oxide nanowires, such as tungsten trioxide (WO) nanowires or molybdenum oxide (MoO) nanowires, can be synthesized by growing the nanowires directly on a stainless steel substrate, which subsequently gives rise to sufficient conduction using a hot filament chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor. In this system, the stainless steel substrates are placed at a distance from the hot metal filament, and the various metal oxide species (e.g., MoO) are introduced into the system and transported using oxygen, such that the metal oxide is then deposited onto the substrate and subsequently forms a metal oxide nanowire. By using such a system, the density, morphology, and diameter of the resulting nanowires can further be controlled by varying the substrate temperature and the oxygen flow into the system in order to produce a desired nanowire that can then be used as the core structure  of the exemplary anode material  shown in .","In yet further embodiments, and as noted above, the core structure  of the exemplary anode material  could be a carbon-based structure, such as a carbon nanotube or a carbon microtube. Suitable carbon nanotubes that can be used in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter include commercially available carbon nanotubes that can be purchased from companies such as Carbon Nanotechnologies, Inc. (Houston, Tex.) or Nanocyl Inc. (Sambreville, Belgium).","Suitable carbon microtubes that can be used as a core structure  in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter can be synthesized on a silicon wafer in a metal organic CVD reactor by employing a carrier gas and a trimethyl gallium precursor, as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art. By using such a process, carbon microtubes can be synthesized such that the carbon microtubes include graphite edge planes and are hollow, unlike carbon nanotubes, with internal diameters of about 100 nm. Furthermore, by synthesizing carbon microtubes in such a manner, the carbon microtubes can be considered \u201cthick\u201d in the sense that they have more than one layer with a space between the layers that is capable of accommodating Li inside the respective layers. These thick layers, with spacing between the layers as well as hollow interiors, further allow for more Li storage and can lead to better Li diffusion into the carbon microtubes, such that the carbon microtubes can serve as a part of a high-capacity and stable anode material for a Li-ion battery.","Referring still to , once the core structure  has been synthesized, the nanostructures  can then be placed (i.e., applied) on the surface of the core structure . The term \u201cnanostructure\u201d is used herein to refer to nanoscale structures with various geometric configurations, but which typically have diameters of between 1 and 100 nm. Various nanostructures are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including nanoclusters and nanowires, and can be used in accordance with the presently-disclosed anode materials.","Regardless of the particular nanostructure  that is chosen for the anode material , the nanostructure  that is chosen for the exemplary anode material  of the presently-disclosed subject matter is comprised of a material that is capable of forming an alloy with Li such that nanostructure  can be placed on the core structure  and effectively used as part of an anode material for a Li-ion battery. In some embodiments, the plurality of nanostructures  that are placed on the core structure  are comprised of metals and inorganic materials, such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), or a Si and Ge alloy, in order to provide a nanostructure that is comprised of a material capable of forming an alloy with Li. Of course, as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art and to the extent it may be desired, other materials capable of forming an alloy with Li can also be used to provide a suitable nanostructure without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter disclosed herein.","In some embodiments of the presently-disclosed anode materials for Li-ion batteries, and as illustrated in , the plurality of nanostructures  that are placed on the core structure  are nanoclusters. The term \u201cnanocluster\u201d is used herein to refer to a grouping (i.e., a cluster) of nanoparticles that has a diameter that is typically less than 100 nm. Various methods can be used in accordance with the presently-disclosed subject matter to place the plurality of nanoclusters on the surface  of the core structure . For example, in embodiments where the core structure  is a metal oxide nanowire, nanoclusters can be placed on the surface  of the metal oxide nanowires (e.g., SnOnanowires) by exposing the nanowires to hydrogen (H) plasma in a microwave CVD reactor to produce metal nanoclusters (e.g., Sn nanoclusters) on the nanowire surfaces. As another example, in embodiments where the core structure  is a carbon-based structure, such as a carbon nanotube or a carbon microtube, Si or Ge nanoclusters can be placed on the surface  of the carbon nanotubes or carbon microtubes by CVD techniques in which silane gas is used for the deposition of Si nanoclusters and germane gas is used for the deposition of Ge nanoclusters, respectively.","Referring now to , in another exemplary anode material  of the presently-disclosed subject matter, the anode material  is again comprised of an elongated core structure  and a plurality of nanostructures . Similar to the exemplary anode material shown in , the plurality of nanostructures  are placed on a surface  of the core structure , with each nanostructure  spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanostructures . However, in this exemplary embodiment, the plurality of nanostructures  of the anode material  are nanowires, which, in some embodiments, are up to several microns in length such that sufficient conduction is obtained along the nanowires.","Nanowires can be placed on the surface  of the core structure  by using a variety of methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as by using a CVD reactor. For example, to place a Si nanowire on the core structure , a CVD reactor can be equipped with inlets into which silane (SiH) gas can be introduced. The SiHgas can then be dissociated in high density plasma to give rise to Si, which then dissolves through a Sn catalyst such that the Si precipitates out at the bottom of the reactor, to thereby provide nanowire growth on the core structure . Similarly, and as another example, germanium (Ge) nanowires can be also be grown on the core structure  by using germane (GeH), which dissociates in the high density plasma to form Ge and thereby lead to Ge nanowire growth.","As noted, in some embodiments of the presently-disclosed anode materials , , each nanostructure ,  is placed on the core structure ,  and is spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanostructures , , as shown in  and in . The distances between adjacent nanostructures ,  can be controlled by varying the conditions under which the nanostructures ,  are placed on the core structures , , including, for example, the deposition power, the temperature of the substrate, the chamber pressure of the CVD chamber (e.g., the chamber pressure of the CVD reactor utilized for the deposition of Si and Ge), and the hydrogen flow rate of a particular system (e.g., the system utilized for placing Sn nanoclusters on SiOnanowires). By varying these conditions, each nanostructure ,  can be spaced in a particular manner on the surface , of the core structure ,  and can be evenly spaced across the surface , of the core structure , .","Referring still to  and , each nanostructure ,  has a diameter (d), there is a distance (W) between adjacent nanostructures , , and this distance (W) between the adjacent nanostructures ,  is maintained as the nanostructures ,  are placed along the surfaces ,  of the core structures , . In some embodiments, the distance between the nanostructures ,  is about 1 to about 2.5 times the diameter of the nanostructure , . In some embodiments, the distance between each nanostructure ,  is about 1, about 1.1, about 1.2, about 1.3, about 1.4, about 1.5, about 1.6, about 1.7, about 1.8, about 1.9, about 2.0, about 2.1, about 2.2, about 2.3, about 2.4, or about 2.5 times the diameter of the nanostructure , . In some embodiments, the diameter of each nanostructure ,  is about 50 nm.","Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that by spacing each nanostructure ,  at a predetermined distance from adjacent nanostructures , , the nanostructures ,  are able to accommodate an expansion in volume without forming agglomerates. Previous studies have shown that anode materials that are comprised of only a pure metal oxide nanowire core structure undergo large volume changes during Li alloying and de-alloying. Over a number of lithiation and delithiation cycles, the metal atoms in these nanowires expand and coalesce with nearby metal atoms, which leads to the formation of large agglomerates and thereby reduces the available Li-ion storage capacity of the materials and eventually destroys the morphology and conductivity of the anode materials. It has been determined, however, that by including nanostructures ,  (i.e., nanoclusters or nanowires) on the core structures ,  of the anode materials ,  and spacing the nanostructures ,  at a predetermined distance from one another, anode materials can be provided that not only possess an increased surface area for Li alloying and de-alloying, but are also able to retain a high-capacity retention and coulombic efficiency after a number of charge\/discharge cycles as the morphology and conductivity of these anode materials are maintained during repeated lithiation and delithiation cycles. Furthermore, due to the placement of the nanostructures , , on the surfaces ,  of the cores structures , , which allows for electrons to travel very short distances into the core structures , , it is believed that faster electron transport can be achieved through the underlying core structures ,  and thus allow for efficient Li alloying and de-alloying.","In some embodiments, the plurality of nanostructures ,  are placed on the core structures ,  of the anode materials ,  such that the distance between adjacent nanostructures ,  is sufficient to accommodate the volume expansion that a particular material will undergo during lithiation. By taking into account the volume expansion a particular material will undergo during lithiation, the nanostructures ,  can thus be sufficiently spaced on the core structures , , and thereby prevent agglomeration and retain the capacity of the anode material , . For example, in some embodiments where the plurality of nanostructures ,  are comprised of tin, the tin nanostructures can be placed on the core structures ,  such that the distance between each tin nanostructure is about 1.4 times the diameter of the nanostructure. As another example, in other embodiments where the plurality of nanostructures ,  are comprised of silicon, the distance between each nanostructure is about 1.71 times the diameter of the silicon nanostructures. As yet another example, in yet a further embodiment where the nanostructures ,  are comprised of germanium, the distance between each germanium nanostructure is about 1.65 times the diameter of the nanostructure.","The presently-disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples. Some of the following examples are prophetic, notwithstanding the numerical values, results and\/or data referred to and contained in the examples.","Materials and Methods for Example 1","To examine the ability of a material including a core structure having a plurality of nanostructures placed on its surface to function as an anode material, tin oxide (SnO) nanowires were first synthesized by reacting tin (Sn) metal powders directly in the gas phase with oxygen containing plasma without the use of a substrate in a microwave (MW) plasma jet reactor at a power of 2 kW [19]. The as-synthesized SnOnanowires were then purified by dispersing them in 1-methoxy 2-proponal followed by gravity sedimentation. Pure SnOnanowires were subsequently exposed to Hplasma in a microwave chemical vapor deposition reactor at a power of 500 W for 15 minutes to obtain the Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires.","To characterize the Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires, all the synthesized materials were examined using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; FEI Nova 600), x-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 Discover) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Tecnai F20 FEI TEM with a Gatan 2002 GIF system).","Further, the Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires were also examined for their ability to function as an anode material for a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. In this regard, material for the working electrode was prepared by spreading the SnOnanowire-based materials uniformly on a platinum foil by applying pressure. Similar results were obtained when electrodes were made by mixing the SnOnanowire-based material with carbon black and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 respectively in a 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent and then spreading it onto platinum foil. A three electrode cell with the SnOnanowire electrode as the working electrode and lithium foil as both the reference and auxiliary (counter) electrodes was used. The electrolyte consisted of 1M LiPFin a 1:1 (volume) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The electrochemical measurements were performed using eDAQ e-corder and potentiostat in the voltage range of 0 to 2.2V.","Results and Discussion for Example 1","The design principle for the proposed hybrid structures was that the SnOnanowires were covered with Sn nanoclusters with spacing of approximately 1.4 times the diameter of each nanocluster. The spacing was included to accommodate the volume expansion of the Sn nanoclusters during alloying to thereby prevent Sn agglomeration. The faster electron transport through the underlying SnOnanowires was expected to allow for efficient Li alloying and de-alloying while the exposed Sn nanoclusters and SnOnanowire surfaces served as Li alloying sites. The SEM image in  shows the as-synthesized, SnOnanowires with diameters ranging from 50-200 nm and microns in length. The as-synthesized SnOnanowires were then reduced using Hplasma exposure producing nanometer-sized Sn clusters on the nanowire surfaces. The Hplasma exposure also reduced the nanowire diameters from the 50-200 nm range to a 30-100 nm range. (See  for a high resolution TEM image showing a SnOnanowire covered with 15 nm sized, crystalline Sn nanoclusters evenly spaced from each other).","All materials systems were tested using anodic measurements over a potential window of 0 to 2.2 V (versus Li\/Li). The data using pure SnOnanowires showed a high initial capacity of 2400 mAhgbut severe capacity degradation occurred within the next 15 cycles leading to a reversible capacity of 166 mAhgafter 40 cycles, as shown in . In comparison, Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires exhibited a reversible capacity of 845 mAhgafter 40 cycles as shown in . Other types of Sn\/SnOcomposite nanowire systems (metal Sn nanoclusters distributed in between the SnOnanowire networks) showed an initial capacity of 2800 mAhgwith a final reversible capacity of 490 mAhgafter 40 cycles. This result is similar to that obtained in prior studies using Sn\/SnOcomposites [18].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5B"],"sup":["\u22121 ","\u22121","\u22121 ","th "],"sub":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sub":["2 ","2 ","x"],"sup":"\u22121 "},"For pure phase SnOnanowires, rapid capacity degradation was observed with cycling and capacity retention of 166 mAhgwas obtained after 40 cycles. The XRD and SEM characterization of that material after cycling showed that the SnONWs reduce completely to Sn while destroying the nanowire morphology. These observations about severe degradation of nanowire morphology and reduction in the capacity are consistent with prior studies involving SnOand other metal oxide nanowires [8, 15, 16]. In some cases, the as-synthesized SnOnanowire samples exhibited capacity retention over a range of values (166-300 mAh\/g), which was possibly due to the presence of some excess Sn metal on nanowire surfaces similar to the hybrid nanowire systems. Complete reduction of the SnOnanowires at various microwave powers yielded Sn crystals of varying diameters rather than Sn nanowires. The performance of Sn thin films as anodes has been studied before [20] and performs similarly to that of pure phase SnOsystem, i.e., the capacity fades quickly to about 200 mAhgin 20 cycles.","The stability of the Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires can be explained with the following Li alloying mechanism [21]:\n\nSnO+2Li+2\u2192SnO+LiO\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nSnO+2Li+2\u2192Sn+LiO\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nSn+LiLiSn(04.4)\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The reaction of SnOwith Li ions, electrolyte decomposition and solid electrolyte interface formation are believed to be the reasons for large irreversible capacity during the first cycle. In the case of pure SnOmaterials including nanowires, the reduction of SnOto Sn takes place in the first cycle. Repeated cycling induces enormous volume changes in Sn which tends to expand and coalesce with the nearby Sn atoms, leading to large agglomerates, thus reducing the available surface area for the Li-ion storage capacity of the material and eventually destroys the pure oxide nanowire structure.","In the case of the hybrid structures involving Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires, however, the spacing between the nanoclusters clusters was adequate enough to accommodate the volume changes induced by the lithiation process, preventing agglomeration and thus explaining the observed high capacity even after hundred charge\/discharge cycles. Of course, the underlying nanowires must also retain both their morphology and conductivity for the observed stability with cycling, so the XRD spectra were obtained for both pure phase and Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowire samples after they were subjected to several charge\/discharge cycles.  shows a rutile phase for SnOfor both as-prepared samples of pure phase SnOnanowires and Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires.  shows XRD spectra of both pure phase and Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires after 25 and 100 charge and discharge cycles, respectively. After lithiation, the majority of the SnOnanowires were completely converted into a Sn phase in the case of pure SnOnanowire samples, along with unreacted SnOphases. In comparison, the Sn-nanocluster-covered SnOnanowires showed the presence of a SnO phase in addition to Sn phases after hundred charge\/discharge cycles. The peak shifts of the different peaks in Table 1 towards the lower diffraction angles indicate that the lithium intercalation increases the lattice plane spacing of these materials and also the probable presence of Li-ions inside the structure.

The observed capacity retention can be attributed to the presence of Sn as well as SnO phase. The SnO phase is formed as a result of the reversibility of Equation 3 in which the nanoscale Sn domains can decompose the LiO which is otherwise irreversible. This reversibility gives rise to the formation of SnO nanodomains from Sn nanosized particles during the de-lithiation process. Such nanodomains are clearly seen to be present in an amorphous matrix within the nanowires after they were subjected to hundred charge\/discharge cycles (see the HR-TEM image in ). The reversibility of the metal particles to metal oxides by the decomposition of LiO in nanosized domains was shown to be feasible in other reports [1,6].","The SEM image in  distinctly shows unblemished hybrid nanowires after hundred charge\/discharge cycles. The image in  further shows the enlarged Sn nanoclusters on the nanowire periphery, which was due to the volume expansion of Sn as well as the Sn segregation from the interior of the nanowire. The proposed reversibility with the Sn nanocluster covered SnOnanowires is schematically illustrated in . As shown in that schematic, during the lithiation process, the nanowire is composed of SnO and LiO, in which SnO promotes the electronic conductivity while the LiO phase promotes the Li-ion migration during Li alloying and de-alloying and prevents further Sn agglomeration inside the nanowire [18]. Hence, the nanowire morphology is retained after several cycles avoiding major structural changes, such as those observed when pure SnOnanowires undergo repeated lithiation cycles (see ). The SnO phase can also arise due to the slightly reversible nature of the reaction in Equation (2) during the dealloying process; the faster kinetics for SnO formation compared to SnO22,23].","In summary, SnOnanowires decorated with well-separated Sn nanoclusters exhibit a reversible storage capacity greater than 800 mAhgover 100 cycles. These hybrid structures, with improved stable capacity, better relieve the stresses associated with volume changes, as compared to pure phase SnOnanowires. The capacity fading after the first few cycles is low at less than 1% per cycle, and post-lithiated samples show the intact hybrid structure after 100 cycles.","To synthesize an anode material where the core structure is a carbon nanotube (CNT) and silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge) nanowires are placed on the surface of the CNT and spaced at predetermined distances from adjacent nanowires, CNTs are first obtained from commercially available sources. Si and Ge nanowire growth on the CNTs is then obtained using a CVD reactor. To synthesize Si nanowires on the CNTs, the reactor is equipped with inlets for the handling of silane (SiH) gas. The SiHis disassociated in high density plasma to give rise to Si, which then dissolves through a Sn catalyst and precipitates out at the bottom of the reactor to lead to nanowire growth. Similarly, for the Ge nanowire growth on the CNTs, germane (GeH) is used, which, in the presence of high-density plasma, disassociates to form Ge and hence, leads to nanowire growth. In these anode materials, high capacity can be obtained from the Si and Ge materials, whereas the stability can be obtained from the underlying base CNTs.","To synthesize an anode material where the core structure is a carbon microtube (CMT) and silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge) nanowires are placed on the surface of the CNT and spaced at predetermined distances from adjacent nanowires, CMTs can first be synthesized in large quantities on silicon substrates using a CVD reactor. Briefly, CMTs are synthesized on 6 inch silicon wafers in a metal organic chemical vapor deposition reactor at a substrate temperature of 700\u00b0 C. The chamber pressure is set to 50 torr with a carrier gas (nitrogen) flow rate of 10 sccm and the precursor, trimethyl gallium is set at 0\u00b0 C. A 10-minute experiment covers the entirety of the silicon wafer with CMTs and the mass of the sample obtained for each run is more than 200 mg. CMTs are then scraped off the silicon wafers and dispersed in aquaregia to dissolve off the gallium. Aquaregia is freshly prepared by making a solution of concentrated nitric acid (Fisher scientific) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (Fisher scientific) in a volumetric ratio of 1:3. The CMTs are allowed to stand in the acid solution for an hour before removing the settled deposit of the CMTs from the solution. The CMTs are then washed with water and subsequently dried at 200\u00b0 C. for a couple of hours.","Si and Ge nanowire growth on the as-synthesized CMTs is then obtained using a CVD reactor. To synthesize Si nanowires on the CMTs, the reactor is equipped with inlets for the handling of silane (SiH) gas. The SiHis disassociated in high density plasma to give rise to Si, which then dissolves through a Sn catalyst and precipitates out at the bottom of the reactor and leads to nanowire growth. Similarly, for the Ge nanowire growth on the CMTs, germane (GeH) is used, which, in the presence of high-density plasma, disassociates to form Ge and hence, leads to nanowire growth. In these anode materials, high capacity can be obtained from the Si and Ge materials, whereas the stability can be obtained from the underlying base CMTs.","To synthesize an anode material where the core structure is a metal oxide nanowire comprised of molybdenum oxide (MoO) or tungsten trioxide (WO) that include silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge) nanowires placed on the surface of the metal oxide nanowires and spaced at predetermined distances from adjacent nanowires, metal oxide nanowire arrays can be grown directly onto conducting stainless steel substrates, which gives rise to good conduction using a hot filament CVD reactor. In this system, the substrates are then placed at a distance from the hot metal filament. The metal oxide species (vapor phase) are then transported using oxygen, and are subsequently deposited onto the substrate. The nanowire density, nanowire morphology and the nanowire diameter can be controlled by the substrate temperature and the oxygen flow into the system. Si and Ge nanowire growth on the metal oxide nanowires can then be obtained using a CVD reactor. To synthesize Si nanowires on these metal oxide nanowires, the reactor is equipped with inlets for the handling of silane (SiH) gas. The SiHis disassociated in high density plasma to give rise to Si, which then dissolves through a Sn catalyst and precipitates out at the bottom of the reactor and leads to nanowire growth. Similarly, for the Ge nanowire growth on the metal oxide nanowires, germane (GeH) is used, which, in the presence of high-density plasma, disassociates to form Ge and hence, leads to nanowire growth. In these anode materials, high capacity can be obtained from the Si and Ge materials, whereas the stability can be obtained from the underlying metal oxide nanowires.","Throughout this document, various references are mentioned.
