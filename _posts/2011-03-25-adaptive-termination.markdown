{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/186,832, entitled \u201cADAPTIVE TERMINATION\u201d, filed Jun. 13, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The invention relates to inductive data transfer, and more particularly to an adaptive termination to reduce ringing in a system utilizing inductive data transfer.","High speed wireless data transfer can be accomplished using coupled inductors. Driving coupled inductors at nigh speeds creates several challenges, a significant one being ringing on the secondary or receiver side. Excessive ringing can cause erroneous data or restrict the maximum system bandwidth.","A system for receiving data is provided. In one exemplary embodiment, the system includes an inductive data device, such as a device that receives high-speed data over an inductive coupling. An adjustable impedance is coupled to roe inductive data device, where the adjustable impedance is used for dynamically controlling ringing in the inductive data device, such as by damping ringing signals generated by circuit inductances or capacitances.","In the description that follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures meant not be to scale and certain components can be shown in generalized or schematic form and identified by commercial designations in the interest of clarity and conciseness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"System  includes transmitter system . Transmitter system  can be a data transmission device such as a cellular telephone, a computing device, a computer peripheral, a meter, a device that utilizes wireless telemetry such as a vending machine, a camera, a portable storage device such as USB drive or external\/removable hard drive, a calculator or other suitable devices that have inductive data transfer capability.","Adjustable impedance  is coupled to transmitter system  via inductive coupling . In one exemplary embodiment, inductive coupling  can include additional inductances in transmitter system  and adjustable impedance  or receiver system , or other suitable systems or components that are used to provide data transfer functionality without the need for a physical or direct connection (such as a wire line connection through a conductor) between transmitter system  and adjustable impedance  or receiver system . In one exemplary embodiment, adjustable impedance  can provide resistive damping to dissipate energy contained in or generated by circuit resonances, reflected signals or other signals that can create ringing and that otherwise obscure the inductively transmitted data signals. Impedance  can also or alternatively be used to provide reactive impedances, such as to de-tune a resonant circuit or for other suitable purposes, where the circuit design is amenable to the use of reactive impedances.","Receiver system  is coupled to adjustable impedance  and receives data from transmitter system . In one exemplary embodiment, receiver system  can provide feedback to adjustable impedance  to adjust the amount of impedance when ringing is present. Receiver system  outputs data that is received from transmitter system  across inductive coupling .","In operation, system  allows data to be inductively transmitted from transmitter system  to receiver system , and adjusts for ringing that may occur as a result of the various impedances involved in the inductive data coupling. Adjustable impedance  allows the ringing to be compensated, such as by detecting and correcting ringing at adjustable impedance , by receiving an impedance control signal from receiver system , or in other suitable manners.","In one exemplary embodiment, by monitoring the input to the receiver for errors in the data stream (which can be used to indicate ringing), system  can automatically adjust the impedance to compensate for excessive ringing. In this exemplary embodiment, the resistance value can be changed using a resistor digital to analog converter (DAC) circuit. If it is determined that the received data contains errors, such as by using cyclic redundancy checking algorithms (CRC), checksum algorithms, parity checking algorithms, error correction code algorithms (ECC), analog or digital oversampling or other suitable error detection algorithms or techniques that are known to one of skill, then the value of the DAC can be adjusted. The direction of the adjustment can be selected according to a search algorithm, arbitrarily chosen, or otherwise varied, and the received data is then checked again for error to see if the error was improved or made worse, thereby determining whether the direction was correct or not, and providing information for the next adjustment.","The amount of resistance that is required to damp any ringing of the received data signal without causing unacceptable signal attenuation is a function of the external circuit components such as the inductances and air gaps, as well as the parasitic capacitance at the receiver. The optimum resistance may vary over time due to temperature, component value variations, inductor alignment, or other effects. System  dynamically adjusts the impedance value to provide optimum performance.","The advantages of system  include a simplified system architecture, no need for an external resistance, a receiver impedance that is determined automatically by the adaptive control, a robustness to temperature and system variation, automatic recalibration that compensates for changes over time, and reduced ringing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","212","214","204","206","203","210","202","210","212"]},"In another exemplary embodiment, receiver system  can receive the signal generated by differential amplifier , and can provide feedback to adjustable impedance  when ringing is present. In this exemplary embodiment, the transmitter system can continue to retransmit the data until ringing has been eliminated, such as by using a handshaking procedure in which the transmitter continues to transmit a data packet to the receiver until the receiver returns a confirmation packet, by transmitting a request from the receiver to the transmitter for retransmission of a data packet until the data packet is received without any errors, or in ether suitable manners. Although adjustable impedance  is shown in parallel with inductor , it can also be in series or other wise provided as suitable to reduce ringing.","Inductor  can be a system inductance that has a variable value based on the air gap or other parameters of the inductive coupling to the transmitter system. Capacitors ,  and  can be design capacitances, stray capacitances, or other capacitances that may be present in system  and which may affect the ability of system  to receive data without generating ringing. Although capacitor  is shown in parallel with inductor , it can alternatively be in series, and other exemplary circuit impedances can be arranged in series or parallel as may typically occur.","In operation, system  utilizes an adjustable impedance  to compensate for circuit impedances in the receiver of an inductive receiver coupling. System  thus allows data transfer across an inductive coupling to be performed with improved efficiency and decreased ringing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","316","301","306","308","310","312","314","318","316","318"]},"Inductor  and capacitor  are parts of an inductive data coupling to a transmitter system. Capacitors  and  can be stray capacitance or other suitable capacitances that may be provided for various design purposes in system . When data is transmitted across an air gap to inductor , a ringing signal can be generated from resonance of parasitic or stray capacitances and inductances, signal frequency components, or other system parameters. In this exemplary embodiment, adjustable impedance  can be used to damp the ringing or otherwise improve the ability of data to be transferred across the inductive coupling.","Differential amplifier  generates a signal based on the received data signal and any ringing signal that may be present. The signal generated by differential amplifier  is provided to receiver system , which can include data error and ring detection circuit  and impedance control . Data error and ring detection circuit  can detect a ring signal in the output of differential amplifier , such as by using conventional error detection processes (e.g. ECC and parity check) or in other suitable manners. If data error and ring detection circuit  determines that ringing is present, control data is provided to impedance control  which determines a control signal or generates a control signal for adjustable impedance . In one exemplary embodiment, adjustable impedance  can include a predetermined number of resistances, where the amount of resistance is increased from a minimum value until ringing is compensated. In this exemplary embodiment, impedance control  can include a state machine and can vary the control settings for the adjustable impedance  until ringing has been eliminated. Typically, ringing can be damped by an added resistance, which will also cause attenuation of the received signal. Thus, when the ringing has been adequately compensated for, additional resistance only causes a detrimental impact on the received signal. Impedance control  can thus increase or decrease the amount of damping resistance in response to a control signal generated by data error and ring detection circuit , such as to reduce the damping resistance if the attenuation in the received signal is unacceptable.","In operation, system  allows improved efficiency of data transfer across and inductive data coupling by damping ringing and by removing damping when ringing is not present. System  thus eliminates data errors, improves data efficiency, and otherwise facilitates inductive data transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"System  includes differential voltages Vin A  and Vin B , fixed resistance  and fixed resistance  (either or both of which can be omitted where suitable). Fixed resistance  and fixed resistance  are used to provide a minimum resistance value. In addition, system  includes a plurality of switches Ren[]  through Ren[n]  and a plurality of resistance R  through 2*R . In this exemplary embodiment, an adjustable amount of impedance or resistance can be provided by turning switches  through  on or off, such as by turning switch  on to conduct energy and bypass resistance  while the remainder of switches  through  are off, so as to provide a resistance equal to the sum of 2*R  through 2*R . Likewise, other suitable configurations can be used.","In operation, system  provides a variable resistance for use in a ringing control circuit. System  is configured similar to a digital to analog converter ladder circuit, but uses the variable resistance values for attenuation of ringing instead of conversion from a digital to an analog value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGURE 5"],"b":["500","502","526","0","506","514","518","524","504"]},"In operation, system  provides a different adjustable resistance configuration and architecture for use in a ringing control circuit.

The algorithm then proceeds to  where it is determined whether the received data is valid. In one exemplary embodiment, an error correction code, parity check or other suitable error detection procedure can be used to determine whether there are errors present in the data.

Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds to .","At , the data is rejected, such as by changing a state variable that represents the state of the received data or in other suitable manners. The algorithm proceeds to  where the impedance in an adjustable impedance in a ring control circuit is tuned. In one exemplary embodiment, the tuning of the impedance at  can include making one or more changes to an impedance setting of an adjustable impedance, such as by using a search algorithm to increase or decrease the impedance by a predetermined amount and to determine whether the ringing has been compensated for. The algorithm then proceeds to  where data is retransmitted. In one exemplary embodiment, the data is retransmitted according to a time-out protocol, in response to a request from the receiver, or in other suitable manners. The algorithm then proceeds to .","In operation, algorithm  automatically adjusts an impedance to control ringing in an inductively coupled data transmission system receiver circuit. Algorithm  allows the amount of impedance to be set based on the existing circuit parameters at the time that ringing is detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800"]},"Algorithm  begins at  where data is received from a transmitter across an inductive data coupling. The algorithm then proceeds to , where it is determined whether ringing has been detected. In one exemplary embodiment, ringing can be detected at an adjustable impedance circuit, by performing error detection, or in other suitable manners. If it is determined at  that ringing has not been defected, the algorithm proceeds to  where data reception continues. Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds to .","At , a search algorithm is executed. In one exemplary embodiment, the search algorithm can step through a number of impedance settings so as to identify the optimal impedance setting. In this exemplary embodiment, the search algorithm can start at the lowest available impedance and can increase the impedance by predetermined steps until ringing has decreased. Likewise, other suitable search processes can be used, such as by increasing the step size until ringing has decreased and then reversing the steps until ringing starts to increase or in other suitable manners. The algorithm then proceeds to  where the impedance is set. The algorithm then proceeds to .","At , it is determined whether the reception has been completed. If reception has not been completed the algorithm returns to , otherwise, the algorithm proceeds to  where the ringing control impedance is reset. In this exemplary embodiment, resetting the ringing control impedance to the lowest possible value ensures that the ringing control impedance will not interfere with data reception under subsequent circumstances or circuit configurations where ringing is not an issue.","Likewise, the impedance can be periodically reset and recalibrated, such as to prevent excessive attenuation of too received data signal. In this exemplary embodiment, it can also or alternatively be determined at  whether a predetermined period of time has elapsed, based on the operating environment of the inductive data receiver. For example, where the inductive data receiver is locked into a data transmission apparatus, then it may only be necessary to reset and recalibrate the impedance whenever the inductive data receiver is removed and returned to a docking station having a lock or other suitable device. In another exemplary embodiment, where the inductive data receiver is held in place manually, changes in an air gap, position or other variables may require more frequent recalibration.","In operation, algorithm  allows an inductive data receiver with an adjustable impedance to be automatically controlled to reduce ringing without causing excessive attenuation of the received signal.

If it is determined that ringing is not present, then the algorithm proceeds to  and the impedance is decreased by one setting. The algorithm then returns to . If it is determined at  that ringing is present, the algorithm proceeds to  where it is determined whether there was a previous decrease. In one exemplary embodiment, where the impedance is increased in a \u201ccoarse\u201d tuning mode in steps greater than one step size, a cessation of ringing can be used to switch to a \u201cfine\u201d tuning mode where the impedance is subsequently decreased in single steps. In this manner, the impedance is first increased on large step sizes until ringing is eliminated, and the impedance is then decreased in single steps until ringing is again detected, at which point the impedance is set to the last impedance at which no ringing was present. If it is determined at  that there was no prior decrease, the algorithm returns to , otherwise the algorithm, proceeds to  where the setting for the impedance is increased by one and the switches are set for signal processing.","In operation, algorithm  provides an exemplary search algorithm for setting switches in a variable impedance circuit.
