The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The androgen receptor (\u201cAR\u201d) is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair pattern (Matsumoto, Endocrinol. Met. Clin. N. Am. 23:857-75 (1994)). The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (\u201cDHT\u201d). Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions (Zhou, et al., Molec. Endocrinol. 9:208-18 (1995)). Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone, such as the cypionate, propionate, phenylpropionate, cyclopentylpropionate, isocarporate, enanthate, and decanoate esters, and other synthetic androgens such as 7-Methyl-Nortestosterone (\u201cMENT\u201d) and its acetate ester (Sundaram et al., \u201c7 Alpha-Methyl-Nortestosterone (MENT): The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception,\u201d Ann. Med., 25:199-205 (1993) (\u201cSundaram\u201d). Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function, the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.","Worldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma, religious implications, and, most certainly, significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite the availability of suitable contraceptive devices, historically, society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits, women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices, from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more permanent options, such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However, to date, the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use, however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity, the interruption in sexual spontaneity, and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men, particularly long-term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior to a sexual act, such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.","Administration of the male sex steroids (e.g., testosterone and its derivatives) has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin-suppressing and androgen-substituting properties of these compounds (Steinberger et al., \u201cEffect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone Levels: A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive, Fertility and Sterility 28:1320-28 (1977)). Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production (azoospermia) or reduces it to a very low level (oligospermia). The degree of spermatogenic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However, a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia (i.e., less than 3 million sperm per mil) and infertility in 98% of men receiving therapy (World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility, \u201cContraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone-Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men,\u201d Fertility and Sterility 65:821-29 (1996)).","A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect. Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception, it has several drawbacks, including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection (Wu, \u201cEffects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men: Experience From a Multicenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study,\u201d Fertility and Sterility 65:626-36 (1996)).","Bone mineral density (BMD) decreases with age in both males and females. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD correlate with decreased bone strength and predispose patients to fracture.","Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.","Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However, osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength, and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of sex-hormones in non-reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood, but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life-cycle. Consequently, when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling that tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males, the natural decline in sex-hormones at maturity (direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens) is associated with the frailty of bones. This effect is also observed in males who have been castrated.","Muscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and\/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathics), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle.","The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by muscle protein degradation by catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Muscle protein catabolism, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting.","Muscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Sarcopenia, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy.","In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, burns, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism.","An intact androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore, an intact AR-signaling pathway increases lean muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.","Muscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infraction and poor performance status. In addition, muscle wasting is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from cachexia and AIDS.","New innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to develop compounds which are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with ADIF, such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; f) oral androgen replacement and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","In one embodiment, the present invention relates to novel androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), and processes for producing the same. The agents are nonsteroidal ligands for the androgen receptor and demonstrate androgenic and\/or anabolic activity. The agents are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) useful in a) male contraception; b) the treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM); c) the treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF); d) the treatment of conditions associated with osteoporosis; e) the treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; and\/or; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing regression of prostate cancer; f) oral androgen relacement and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","In one embodiment the present invention provides for a SARM compound represented by the structure of formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.86mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07645898-20100112-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["wherein\n        \n        ","Z is a hydrogen bond acceptor, NO, CN, COR, COOH or CONHR;","Y is a lipid soluble group, I, CF, H, CH, Br, Cl, or Sn(R);","Ris CH, CF, CHCH, or CFCF;","T is OH, OR, \u2014NHCOCH, or NHCOR;","Q is CN, halogen, acetamido-, trifluroacetamido-, alkylamines, ether, alkyl, N-sulfonyl, O-sulfonyl, alkylsulfonyl, carbonyl, ketone, Q is alkyl, halogen, N(R), NHCOCH, NHCOCF, NHCOR, NHCONHR, NHCOOR, OCONHR, CONHR, NHCSCH, NHCSCF, NHCSR NHSOCH, NHSOR, OR, COR, OCOR, OSOR, SOR or SR;","or Q together with the benzene ring to which it is attached is a fused ring system represented by structure A, B or C:"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.43mm","wi":"67.23mm","file":"US07645898-20100112-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["Ris CH, CF, CHCH, or CFCF;

These novel agents are useful in males for the treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, benign prostate hyperplasia and\/or prostate cancer. Further, SARMs are useful for oral testosterone replacement therapy, and treating prostate cancer. In other embodiments, the SARMs are useful for the treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions in females including, sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, infertility, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer.","In some embodiments, the SARM compounds of this invention are useful in preventing and treating muscle wasting disorders and bone related disorders.","In some embodiments, the SARM compounds stimulate cell signaling events via binding the androgen or other cell signaling receptors. In some embodiments, receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are referred to as \u201ccell signaling receptors\u201d, which are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface. The receptors may bind an extracellular signaling molecule (i.e., a ligand), and become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast, in some cases, the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them; these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell.","Steroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse directly across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily (or steroid-hormone receptor superfamily). Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, glueocorticoid receptors, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.","A receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. A receptor partial agonist is a substance which binds receptor and partially activates them. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. The SARM compounds of the present invention may, in some embodiments, have a tissue-selective effect, wherein, for example, a single agent is an agonist, partial agonist and\/or antagonist, depending on the tissue in which the receptor is expressed. For example, the SARM compound may stimulate muscle tissue and concurrently inhibit prostate tissue. In one embodiment, the SARMs which are useful in treating and preventing muscle wasting disorders are AR agonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and activating the AR. In another embodiment, the SARMs are AR antagonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and inactivating the AR. Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and\/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.","In another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist\/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as competitive inhibitors of testosterone\/DHT on the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens. The term SARM or SARM refers, in one embodiment, to a compound which modulates androgen receptor activity. In one embodiment, the SARM is an agonist, or in another embodiment, an antagonist.","In one embodiment, the SARM will have antagonist activity in a gonad of a subject, and agonist activity peripherally, such as, for example, in muscle. Such activity was demonstrated herein, in terms of effects on prostate tissue versus that of levator ani muscle tissue, as exemplified in , , or . In one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention bind reversibly or, in another embodiment, irreversibly to the androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor. The compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone.","Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and\/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.","In addition to ligand binding to the receptors, the receptors can be blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor, the three-dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three-dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration. The better the ball fits into the socket, the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone, it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more frequently. Once bound, signals may be sent through the receptor into the cells, causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is called activation. On activation, the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes, other than affinity, in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases, this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor, which is enough to begin the activation process (called signal transduction).","The compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to an androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a mammal. In another embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a human. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means that a compound can detach from the receptor after binding.","In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (e.g. affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds are alkylating agents which bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone. An \u201calkylating agent\u201d is defined herein as an agent which alkylates (forms a covalent bond) with a cellular component, such as DNA, RNA or enzyme. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with nucleophilic moieties in cellular components.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for binding the SARM compounds of the present invention to an androgen receptor by contacting the receptor with a SARM compound and\/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, polymorph, crystal, impurity, hydrate, N-oxide or any combination thereof, under conditions effective to cause the SARM compound to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the SARM compounds to the androgen receptor enables the compounds of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds bind to and inactivate the androgen receptor. Binding of the agonist or antagonist compounds is either reversible or irreversible.","The present invention also relates to a method of binding a SARM compound to an androgen receptor, which includes contacting the androgen receptor with the SARM compound of this invention under conditions effective to bind the SARM compound to the androgen receptor.","The novel SARM compounds and the non-steroidal agonist compounds of the present invention, either alone or as a composition, are useful in males and females for the treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, such as hypogonadism, sarcopenia, erythropoiesis, erectile function, lack of libido, osteoporesis and fertility. Further, the SARM compounds and the non-steroidal agonist compounds are useful for oral testosterone replacement therapy, treating prostate cancer, imaging prostate cancer, and maintaining sexual desire in women. The agents may be used alone or in combination with a progestin or estrogen.","In one embodiment, modulation of the androgen receptor refers to the ability of the compound to stimulate or enhance signaling through the receptor, and any or, in another embodiment, all, downstream effects of receptor signal transduction.","In another embodiment, a SARM of this invention may interact with a homologue of an androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the term \u201chomologue of an androgen receptor\u201d refers to structurally or, in another embodiment, functionally related receptors, whose regulation is desired. In one embodiment, the SARMs of this invention may interact with estrogen receptors, or, in another embodiment, other cell surface molecules which are involved in anabolic pathways, or in another embodiment, steroidogenic pathways, or in another embodiment, metabolic pathways.","The present invention further relates to a method of determining the presence of a selective androgen modulator compound and\/or a non-steroidal agonist compound of the present invention in a sample. The method comprises the steps of obtaining the sample, and detecting the compound in the sample, thereby determining the presence of the compound in the sample. In one embodiment, the sample is a blood serum, plasma, urine, or saliva sample.

For example, the compounds of the present invention absorb in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, with an absorbency peak at 270 nm. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the compound is detected by monitoring the UV absorbance of the sample at 270 nm. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to UV absorption, and that any other spectrometric methods of identification are applicable. For example, compounds can be detected by measuring their infra-red or visible absorbance.","In another embodiment, the present invention further provides a method of determining the concentration of a SARM compound and\/or a non-steroidal agonist compound of the present invention in a sample. The method comprises the steps of obtaining a sample; determining the level of the compound in the sample, and calculating the concentration of the compound in the sample by comparing the level with a standard sample containing a known concentration of the compound. Calibration curves of known concentrations of the compound in the sample, can be obtained, and the concentration of the compound in the test sample is calculated therefrom. By \u201clevel\u201d it is meant the absorption level of the compound at the measured wavelength.","In another embodiment, the compound is detected in the sample by contacting the sample with a binding protein which specifically binds to the compound, and determining the amount of binding protein bound to the compound. The concentration of the compound can be determined by measuring the amount of binding protein bound to the compound, and comparing that amount to a standard sample containing a known concentration of the compound\u2014binding protein complex.","Protein levels can be determined according to standard techniques, as described in Sambrook et al. Briefly, a sample obtained from a subject is contacted with a binding protein which specifically binds to a specific compound of the present invention, and the amount of complex formed between the binding protein and the compound is determined. In one embodiment, the binding protein is an antibody which specifically binds to one or more compounds of the present invention. In another embodiment, the binding protein has a detectable label bound thereto, and the complex between the binding protein-label compound is determined by visualizing the complex","As defined herein, \u201ccontacting\u201d means that the binding protein is introduced into the sample in a test tube, flask, tissue culture, chip, array, plate, microplate, capillary, or the like, and incubated at a temperature and time sufficient to permit the binding component to bind to a cell or a fraction thereof or plasma\/serum or a fraction thereof containing the target. Methods for contacting the samples with the binding proteins, or other specific binding components are known to those skilled in the art and may be selected depending on the type of assay protocol to be run. Incubation methods are also standard and are known to those skilled in the art.","\u201cVisualizing\u201d the complex may be carried out by any means known in the art, including, but not limited to, ELISA, radioimmunoassay, flow cytometry, dot blots, western immunoblotting combined with gel electrophoresis, immunohistochemistry at light and electron pe levels, HPLC and mass spectrometry.","Either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (as well as any recombinant antibodies) specific for the selective androgen modulator compounds or the non-steroidal agonist compounds of the present invention can be used in the various immunoassays. The antibodies may be delectably labeled, utilizing conventional labeling techniques well-known to the art. As used herein, the term \u201clabel\u201d refers to a molecule, which may be conjugated or otherwise attached (i.e., covalently or non-covalently) to a binding protein as defined herein. Labels are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, the antibodies may be labeled with radioactive isotopes, non-radioactive isotopic labels, fluorescent labels, enzyme labels, chemiluminescent labels, bioluminescent labels, free radical labels, or bacteriophage labels, using techniques known in the art. Examples of radioisotopic labels are H, I, I, S, C, etc. Examples of non-radioactive isotopic labels are Mn, Fe, etc. Examples of fluorescence labels are fluorescent labels which are directly labeled with the preferred fluorescence label, or fluorescent labels which are indirectly labeled with the preferred fluorescence label. In the last case, the preferred fluorescence label is conjugated to a secondary antibody, which is directed against the first antibody, such as an anti species Ig antibody. Typical fluorescent labels include, but are not limited to a fluorescein label, an isothiocyanate label, a rhodamine label, a phycoerythrin label, etc., for example fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, International Biological Supplies, Melbourne, Fla.), rhodamine, phycoerythrin (P.E., Coulter Corp., Hialeah, Fla.), phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, phycoerythrin-cyanin dye 5 (PECy5, Coulter), label, a phycocyanin label, an allophycocyanin label, an O-phthaldehyde label, a fluorescamine and Texas Red.","Examples of enzyme labels include alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, maleate dehydrogenase, and peroxidase. Two principal types of enzyme immunoassay are the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the homogeneous enzyme immunoassay, also known as enzyme-multiplied immunoassay (EMIT, Syva Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif.). In the ELISA system, separation may be achieved, for example, by the use of antibodies coupled to a solid phase. The EMIT system depends on deactivation of the enzyme in the tracer-antibody complex; the activity can thus be measured without the need for a separation step.","Particularly suitable labels include those, which permit analysis by flow cytometry, e.g., fluorochromes. Other suitable detectable labels include those useful in colorimetric enzyme systems, e.g., horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Other proximal enzyme systems are known to those of skill in the art, including hexokinase in conjunction with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.","Additionally, chemiluminescent compounds may be used as labels. Chemiluminescent labels, such as green fluorescent proteins, blue fluorescent proteins, and variants thereof are known. Also bioluminescence or chemiluminescence can be detected using, respectively, NAD oxidoreductase with luciferase and substrates NADH and FNIN or peroxidase with luminol and substrate peroxide. Typical chemiluminescent compounds include luminol, isoluminol, aromatic acridinium esters, imidazoles, acridinium salts, and oxalate esters. Similarly, bioluminescent compounds may be utilized for labelling, the bioluminescent compounds including luciferin, luciferase, and aequorin. Once labeled, the antibody may be employed to identify and quantify immunologic counterparts (antibody or antigenic polypeptide) utilizing techniques well-known to the art.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","As used herein, \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d means a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the active ingredient, i.e. the SARM compound, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intraarterially, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intraarterial administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intramuscularly, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intramuscular administration.","Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered topically to body surfaces, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for topical administration. Suitable topical formulations include gels, ointments, creams, lotions, drops and the like. For topical administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carrier.","Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered as a suppository, for example a rectal suppository or a urethral suppository.

Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). In another embodiment, the composition is an immediate release composition, i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.","In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990).","The compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.)

The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.","The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other.","An active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the like.","For use in medicine, the salts of the SARM will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.","In one embodiment, this invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a SARM of this invention. In one embodiment, such compositions are useful for oral testosterone replacement therapy.","In one embodiment, this invention also provides a composition comprising two or more SARMs of this invention, or polymorphs, isomers, hydrates, salts, N-oxides, etc., thereof.

BPH occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade. BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra which traverses the prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experience a frequent urge to urinate because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination. The obstruction of urinary flow can also lead to a general lack of control over urination, including difficulty initiating urination when desired, as well as difficulty in preventing urinary flow because of the inability to empty urine from the bladder, a condition known as overflow urinary incontinence, which can lead to urinary obstruction and to urinary failure.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the method for treating benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in a subject, comprises the step of administering to the subject a SARM compound of the present invention and\/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, polymorph, crystal, impurity, hydrate, N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to treat BPH in the subject.","Stimulation of the androgen receptor stimulates the production of tears, and thus the SARM compounds of the present invention may be used to treat dry eye conditions.

There are three types of muscles in the body: a) skeletal muscle\u2014the muscle responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the bodies; b) cardiac muscle\u2014the heart muscle; and c) smooth muscle\u2014the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel.","A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized, at least in part, by an abnormal, progressive loss of body, organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as, for example, cancer, or an infection, or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state, such as disuse deconditioning that can occur, for example, due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized, such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight, or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.","In one embodiment, \u201cmuscle wasting\u201d or \u201cmuscular wasting\u201d, used herein interchangeably, refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and\/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement, cardiac muscles which control the heart, and smooth muscles. In one embodiment, the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. \u201cChronic muscle wasting\u201d is defined herein as the chronic (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) progressive loss of muscle mass and\/or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.","The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation, by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term \u201ccatabolism\u201d has its commonly known meaning in the art, specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.","Muscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology, disease, condition or disorder. In one embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is infectious. As described herein, the pathologies, diseases, conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting (i.e. loss) of muscle mass, that is a muscle wasting disorder.","In one embodiment, muscle wasting in a subject is a result of the subject having a muscular dystrophie; muscle atrophy; X-linked spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), cachexia; malnutrition, tuberculosis, leprosy, diabetes, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, end stage renal failure, sarcopenia, emphysema, osteomalacia, or cardiomyopathy.","In another embodiment, the muscle wasting disorder is due to infection with enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes zoster, HIV, trypanosomes, influenze, coxsackie, rickettsia, trichinella, schistosoma or mycobacteria.","The muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of muscular dystrophy (MD) are: duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, duchenne muscular dystrophy, becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, facioscapulhumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy and emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy.","Muscular dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood, others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne MD is the most common form, typically affecting children. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.","Muscle atrophy (MA) is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example, Post-Polio MA is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post-polio syndrome (PPS). The atrophy includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and pain.","Another type of MA is X-linked spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA\u2014also known as Kennedy's Disease). This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, affects only males, and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation, androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still, use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.","Cachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac cachexia, i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle, is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass.","Cachexia is also seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated myopathy and\/or muscle weakness\/wasting is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV-associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss, generalized or proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, and muscle atrophy.","Sarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further, increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle-wasting disorders. In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to, and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example, studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain, there is paraspinal muscle wasting.","Muscle wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages, an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power, performance and endurance.","Long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, or disuse deconditioning that occurs, for example, when a limb is immobilized, can also lead to muscle wasting. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries, chronic illnesses, burns, trauma or cancer, who are hospitalized for long periods of time, there is a long-lasting unilateral muscle wasting, with a consequent decrease in body mass.","Injuries or damage to the central nervous system (CNS) are also associated with muscle wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be, for example, caused by diseases, trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage, peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage.","In another embodiment, muscle wasting may be a result of alcoholism, and may be treated with the compounds and compositions of the invention, representing embodiments thereof.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a use of SARM compound of the present invention for preventing a muscle wasting disorder in a subject.

They should in no way, however, be construed as limiting the broad scope of the invention.","Chemicals","A mixture comprising the compound of formula III, DHT and PTH were prepared at concentrations ranging from 1 nM-1 \u03bcM.","Animals","Four month old female rats were sacrificed by euthanasia and the femurs were excised from the animals. The femurs were cleaned off any muscle and connective tissues and were stored on ice in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with penicillin, Streptomycin and Fungizone until the cells were cultured.","Bone Marrow Cell Culture","All cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.). The femurs were first rinsed in 70% ethanol and were washed three times with 5 ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Both the ends of the femurs were snapped and the bone marrow cells were flushed with 15 ml of MEM with penicillin, Streptomycin and Fungizone into a 50 ml conical tube and stored on ice. The same procedure was performed with all the femurs. The bone marrow cells and were pooled were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min in a clinical centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in MEM without phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped serum, penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone. The cells were triturated through a 22 g needle, counted under microscope and were plated at 1.5 million cells per well of a 6 well plate in MEM without phenol red supplemented with 15% charcoal stripped serum, penicillin streptomycin, 300 ng\/ml fungizone, 0.28 mM Ascorbic acid and 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate to differentiate towards fibroblast\/osteoblast lineage and at 2.5 million cells per well of a 24 well plate in MEM without phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped serum, penicillin streptomycin and 300 ng\/ml fungizone to differentiate towards osteoclast lineage. The medium was changed on day 2 and the cells were treated with the indicated hormone. Osteoclast cultures were carried out in the presence of 50 ng RANK Ligand and 10 ng GM-CSF to induce osteoclastogenesis. Medium was completely changed every third day for osteoclast cultures. For fibroblast cultures, half the culture medium was changed every third day to leave the growth factors secreted by the cells.","Staining of Cells","At the end of 12 days, the cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for fibroblast cultured and in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for osteoclast cultures. The fibroblasts were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity and the O.D. at 405 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer as described earlier. Osteoclasts were stained for Tartarate Resistant Acid Phosphatase Activity (TRAP) and cells having 2 or more nuclei were counted under the microscope and plotted as indicated earlier.","Androgens exert anabolic effects on bone and lack of androgens under conditions such as androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer and in old age have clearly indicated the benefits of androgens as a bone protective hormone. However, the use of ectopic androgen is limited due to its side effects and also due to the risk of conversion of androgens to estrogens.","In order to determine whether a SARM could be therapeutic yet obviate the above side-effects, various SARMs were evaluated in terms of their ability to have bone protective effects, with fewer side effects, as seen with the parent hormone. The efficacy of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and Parathyroid hormone (PTH) were compared to a SARM, the compound of formula III, in terms of their ability to differentiate primary rat bone marrow cells towards the osteoblast and the osteoclast lineage (). Bone marrow cells from rats were cultured in the presence or absence of the above indicated hormones for 12 days in culture medium and were evaluated in terms of their differentiation towards osteoblast or osteoclast lineage.","DHT and the compound of formula III all increased differentiation of primary bone marrow cells toward the osteoblast lineage as measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of the cells (). At 1 \u03bcM concentration, DHT and the SARM induced the ALP activity comparably whereas at lower concentrations of 100 nM and 10 nM Compound III showed better induction than the DHT. PTH, another bone anabolic hormone induced the ALP staining only at higher concentration but not at lower concentrations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0612","num":"0946"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Sixty female, virgin, intact Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.) and aged to 23 wks.

(Bothell, Wash.) for biomechanical strength (three point bending) and pQCT analysis. A Stratec XCT RM and associated software (Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany. Software version 5.40 C) were used for the pQCT analysis. The femur was analyzed at both the mid-shaft and distal regions. The mid-shaft analysis was performed on the region at 50% of the length of the femur. The distal analysis was performed on the region at 20% of the length of the femur starting at the distal end. One 0.5 mm slice perpendicular to the long axis of the femur was used for analysis. Total bone mineral content, total bone area, total bone mineral density, cortical bone mineral content, cortical bone area, cortical bone mineral density, cortical thickness, periosteal perimeter (circumference) and endosteal perimeter were determined at the mid-shaft of the femur. At the distal femur, total bone mineral content, total bone area, total bone mineral density, trabecular bone mineral content, trabecular bone area and trabecular bone mineral density were determined. Following pQCT analysis, the femoral strength was determined by a three-point bending test. The anterior to posterior diameter (APD) (unit:mm) at the midpoint of the femoral shaft was measured with an electronic caliper. The femur was placed on the lower supports of a three-point bending fixture with the anterior side of the femur facing downward in an Instron Mechanical Testing Machine (Instron 4465 retrofitted to 5500)(Canton, MA). The length (L) between the lower supports was set to 14 mm. The upper loading device was aligned to the center of the femoral shaft. The load was applied at a constant displacement rate of 6 mm\/min until the femur broke. The mechanical testing machine directly measured the maximum load (F) (unit:N), stiffness (S) (units:N\/mm), and energy absorbed (W) (unit:mJ). The axial area moment of inertia (I) (unit:mm) was calculated by the software during the pQCT analysis of the femoral mid-shaft. Stress (\u03c3) (units:N\/mm), elastic modulus (E) (unit:Mpa), and toughness (T) (units:mJ\/m) were calculated by the following formulas: stress: \u03c3=(F* L*(a\/2))\/(4*I); elastic modulus: E=S*L\/(48*I); and toughness: T=3*W*(APD\/2)\/(L*I).","Statistical analysis was performed by Student's T-test.

The alendronate (213 N) and alendronate+COMPOUND III (207N) groups were not different from controls.","Trabecular bone mineral density was analyzed by pQCT at the distal femur. Results are shown in . We observed significant trabecular bone loss following OVX. Trabecular bone density decreased from 379 to 215 mg\/mmin the intact and OVX vehicle control groups, respectively. In intact animals treated with COMPOUND III, we observed a slight increase in trabecular bone density to 398 mg\/mm. In OVX animals treated with COMPOUND III, we observed a significant increase over the OVX vehicle control group to 406 mg\/mm. Alendronate increased trabecular bone density to 480 mg\/mm.

Dosing began nine days post ORX and was administered daily via oral gavage for fourteen days. The animals were sacrificed under anesthesia (ketamine\/xyalzine, 87:13 mg\/kg) after a 14-day dosing regimen, and body weights were recorded. In addition, ventral prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle were removed, individually weighed, normalized to body weight, and expressed as a percentage of intact control. Student's T-test was used to compare individual dose groups to the intact control group. Significance was defined a priori as a P-value <0.05. As a measure of androgenic activity, ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weights were evaluated, whereas levator ani muscle weight was evaluated as a measure of anabolic activity.

Castration significantly reduced the weight of androgenic (e.g., prostate and seminal vesicles) and anabolic (e.g., levator ani muscle) tissues, but had little effect on animal body weight (BW). Treatment of castrated animals with testosterone propionate or compound V maintained the weight of androgenic tissues to the same degree. Compound V had similar androgenic activity as testosterone propionate (i.e., the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were the same), but much greater efficacy as an anabolic agent. Compound V showed greater anabolic activity than testosterone propionate at the doses tested (i.e., the levator ani muscle maintained the same weight as intact control animals and was greater than that observed for testosterone). The experiments presented herein are the first in vivo results which demonstrate tissue-selective androgenic and anabolic activity (i.e., differing androgenic and anabolic potency) of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor.","The in vivo efficacy and acute toxicity of four novel nonsteroidal androgens (compounds V, VI, XIV, XV) in rats was examined.

The S-isomers of compounds VI, XIV, XV, and V and the R-isomer of VI were synthesized in accordance with the scheme as set forth in . Testosterone propionate (TP), polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300, reagent grade) and neutral buffered formalin (10% w\/v) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St Louis, Mo.). Alzet osmotic pumps (model 2002) were purchased from Alza Corp. (Palo Alto, Calif.).","Animals. Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 90 to 100 g, were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, Ind.). The animals were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.","Study Design. Rats were randomly distributed into twenty-nine (29) groups, with 5 animals per group. Treatment groups are described in Table 4. One day prior to the start of drug treatment, animals in groups 2 through 29 were individually removed from the cage, weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine\/xylazine (87\/13 mg\/kg; approximately 1 mL per kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e., no response to toe pinch), the animals' ears were marked for identification purposes. Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile suture being used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad (until able to stand) and then returned to their cage.","Twenty-four hours later, animals in groups 2 through 29 were re-anesthetized with ketamine\/xylazine, and an Alzet osmotic pump(s) (model 2002) was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance, the scapular region was shaved and cleaned (betadine and alcohol) and a small incision (1 cm) made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment (designated in Table 1) dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300). Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment (e.g., lethargy, rough coat).","After 14 days of drug treatment, rats were anesthetized with ketamine\/xylazine. Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta, and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube, centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer removed and frozen at \u221220.degree.C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, weighed, and placed in vials containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx, Inc. for histopathological analysis.","For data analysis, the weights of all organs were normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.","The androgenic and anabolic activities the S isomers of compounds V, VI, XIV and XV, and the R isomer of VI were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. Testosterone propionate, at increasing doses, was used as the positive control of anabolic and androgenic effects.","As shown in  the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated, vehicle-treated rats decreased significantly, due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Exogenous administration of testosterone propionate, an androgenic and anabolic steroid, increased the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator and muscle in castrated rats in a dose-dependent manner The R-isomer of compound VI, and S-isomers of compound XIV and compound XV showed no effect on the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated animals (data not shown). The S-isomers of compound V (: S-V) and compound VI (: S-VI) resulted in dose-dependent increases in prostate, seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights. Compared with testosterone propionate, S-V showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly, compound S-V, at a dose as low as 0.3 mg\/day, was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus, S-V is a potent nonsteroidal anabolic agent with less androgenic activity but more anabolic activity than testosterone propionate. This is a significant improvement over previous claims, in that this compound selectively stimulates muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles. This may be particularly relevant in aging men with concerns related to the development or progression of prostate cancer.","Compound VI was less potent than compound V, but showed greater tissue selectivity (compare effects on the prostate and seminal vesicles in ). Compound VI significantly increased levator ani muscle weights, but showed little to no ability to stimulate prostate and seminal vesicle growth (i.e., the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were less than 20% of that observed in intact animals or in animals treated with testosterone propionate).","Results showed that none of the examined compounds produced significant effect on body weight or the weights of other organs (i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs and heart). Nor did any compound produce any signs of acute toxicity, as gauged by diagnostic hematology tests and visual examination of animals receiving treatments. Importantly, compound V did not suppress the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at a dose of 0.3 mg\/day (i.e., a dose that exhibited maximal anabolic effects).","In summary, compound S-V exhibited exceptional anabolic activity in animals by maintaining the weight of levator ani muscle after removal of endogenous androgen. This discovery represents major progress towards the development of therapeutically useful nonsteroidal androgens, and a major improvement (i.e., tissue selectivity and potency) over previous drugs in this class. Compounds S-VI and S-V showed selective anabolic activity in comparison with testosterone propionate, an androgenic and anabolic steroid. The tissue-selective activity is actually one of the advantages of nonsteroidal androgens in terms of anabolic-related applications.","Despite similarities in structure and in vitro functional activity, the S-isomers of compounds V, VI, XIV, XV exhibited profound differences in terms of their in vivo activity compound V the most efficacious androgenic and anabolic activity in animals, with the anabolic activity greater than that of testosterone propionate. Compound VI showed a small degree of androgenic activity, but an anabolic activity comparable to testosterone propionate. In contrast, compounds XIV and XV failed to produce any androgenic or anabolic activity in vivo.","These studies show the discovery of two members (compounds VI and V), of a new class of SARMs (SARMS) that demonstrate potent anabolic effects (e.g., muscle growth) with less androgenic activity (e.g., prostatic growth). This new class of drugs has several advantages over nonselective androgens, including potential therapeutic applications in males and females for modulation of fertility, erythropoiesis, osteoporosis, sexual libido and in men with or at high risk for prostate cancer.","Further,  demonstrate the effects of compounds V and VI and compound V on LH and FSH levels in rats. These results further demonstrate the novelty of these SARM, due to their differential effects on these reproductive hormones, thus demonstrating the tissue-specific pharmacologic activity. In , LH levels in castrated animals treated with TP and compound VI were significantly lower than those of untreated animals (i.e., castrated controls) at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg\/day. However, higher doses (i.e., 0.5 mg\/day or higher) of compound V were required before significant decreases in LH levels were observed. Thus, compound V does not suppress LH levels at doses that are capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of levator ani muscle growth. In , FSH levels in castrated animals treated with compound VI were significantly lower than hose of untreated animals (i.e., castrated controls) at doses of 0.5 mg\/day or higher. Similarly, lower FSH levels were observed in animals treated with TP. However, only this difference was only significant at a dose of 0.75 mg\/day. FSH levels in animals treated with compound V were not significantly different from those of untreated animals at any dose level tested. Thus, compound V does not suppress FSH levels at doses that are capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of levator ani muscle growth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0679","num":"1017"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Animals Groups and Experimental Design"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"# of"]},{"entry":["Group #","Castrated","Drug","Dose","animals"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","No","None","None","5"]},{"entry":["2","Yes","None","Vehicle only","5"]},{"entry":["3","Yes","Testosterone","0.1 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["4","Yes","Testosterone","0.3 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["5","Yes","Testosterone","0.5 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["6","Yes","Testosterone","0.75 mg\/day\u2002","5"]},{"entry":["7","Yes","Testosterone","1.0 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["8","Yes","R-III","1.0 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["9","Yes","S-III","0.1 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["10","Yes","S-III","0.3 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["11","Yes","S-III","0.5 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["12","Yes","S-III","0.75 mg\/day\u2002","5"]},{"entry":["13","Yes","S-III","1.0 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["14","Yes","S-VI","0.1 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["15","Yes","S-VI","0.3 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["16","Yes","S-VI","0.5 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["17","Yes","S-VI","0.75 mg\/day\u2002","5"]},{"entry":["18","Yes","S-VI","1.0 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["19","Yes","S-VII","0.1 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["20","Yes","S-VII","0.3 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["21","Yes","S-VII","0.5 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["22","Yes","S-VII","0.75 mg\/day\u2002","5"]},{"entry":["23","Yes","S-VII","1.0 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["24","Yes","S-V","0.1 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["25","Yes","S-V","0.3 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["26","Yes","S-V","0.5 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["27","Yes","S-V","0.75 mg\/day\u2002","5"]},{"entry":["28","Yes","S-V","1.0 mg\/day","5"]},{"entry":["29","Yes","None","Vehicle only","5"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The pharmacokinetics of compound S-V, a novel SARM, were characterized in beagle dogs.

Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 90 to 100 g, were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, Ind.). The animals were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.","Study Design. Rats were randomly distributed into treatment groups groups. One day prior to the start of drug treatment, animals were individually removed from the cage, weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine\/xylazine (87\/13 mg\/kg; approximately 1 mL per kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e., no response to toe pinch), the animals' ears were marked for identification purposes. Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile suture being used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad (until able to stand) and then returned to their cage.","Twenty-four hours later, animals were re-anesthetized with ketamine\/xylazine, and an Alzet osmotic pump(s) (model 2002) was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance, the scapular region was shaved and cleaned (betadine and alcohol) and a small incision (1 cm) made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300). Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment (e.g., lethargy, rough coat).","After 14 days of drug treatment, rats were anesthetized with ketamine\/xylazine. Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta, and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube, centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer removed and frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, weighed, and placed in vials containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx, Inc. for histopathological analysis.","For data analysis, the weights of all organs were normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.","The androgenic and anabolic activities of compounds 1-4 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. The results are shown in  A-D as a percent of the Intact Control (not castrated, untreated). 0 mg\/day denotes Castrated Controls (castrated, untreated).","As shown in , the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated rats decreased significantly, due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Treatment with increasing dosages of compounds 1-4 ( A-D respectively) resulted in a tissue-selective increase in leyator ani muscle weights, with little or no stimulation of prostate and seminal vesicle growth (i.e. the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were less than 40% of that observed in intact animals for compound 2, and less than 20% for compounds 1, 3 and 4). Thus these compounds showed little potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a great potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly, compound 2 was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus, compounds 1-4 are potent nonsteroidal anabolic agents. This is a significant improvement over previous compounds, in that these compound selectively stimulate muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles. This may be particularly relevant in aging men with concerns related to the development or progression of prostate cancer.","The binding affinity of select compound 5 is represented in Table 7:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0700","num":"1038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 7"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Structure","MW","Ki (nM)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["5",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00204","num":"00204"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00204","he":"18.80mm","wi":"62.74mm","file":"US07645898-20100112-C00204.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"382.3","3.3 \u00b1 0.08"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The androgenic and anabolic activities of compound 5 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration, using the method outlined in Example 1 above.","As shown in Table 8 and in , compound 5 demonstrated tissue-selective pharmacological effects in castrated male rats, with higher efficacy in anabolic tissues (i.e. levator ani) as compared to androgenic tissues (i.e. prostate and seminal vesicles).

Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the claims that follow."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["max ","50 ","max "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9","sub":["max ","50 ","max "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 13","sub":"0-inf "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 14","sub":"max "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 24A","FIG. 24B","FIG. 24C","FIG. 24D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 28A","FIG. 28B","FIG. 28C","FIG. 28D","FIG. 28E","FIG. 28F","FIG. 28G","FIG. 28H","FIG. 28I","FIG. 28J","FIG. 28K","FIG. 28L"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 30"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
