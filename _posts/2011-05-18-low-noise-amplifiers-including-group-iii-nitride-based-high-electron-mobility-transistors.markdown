This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.

It will be further understood that terms used herein should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","Some embodiments provide a 2-stage Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) formed as a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) employing Group III-nitride based High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). By incorporating Group III-nitride based HEMTs, circuits\/devices according to some embodiments can achieve a noise figure less than 3.0 dB and\/or an output TOI (Third Order Intercept) higher than 25 dB over a frequency range from 2.3 to 4.5 GHz. In some embodiments, devices according to some embodiments can achieve a noise figure less than 2.0 dB and\/or an output TOI (Third Order Intercept) higher than 35 dB over a frequency range from 2.6 to 3.95 GHz. In some further embodiments, devices according to some embodiments can achieve a noise figure less than 2.0 dB and\/or an output TOI (Third Order Intercept) higher than 35 dB over a frequency range from 3.0 to 3.5 GHz. In some embodiments, devices according to some embodiments can achieve a noise figure less than 1.75 dB at a frequency greater than 2.5 GHz. In some further embodiments, devices according to some embodiments can achieve an output TOI (Third Order Intercept) higher than 38 dB over a frequency range from 2.5 to 3.75 GHz.","Group III nitrides refer to those semiconductor compounds formed between nitrogen and the elements in the Group III of the periodic table, usually aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and\/or indium (In). The term also refers to ternary and quaternary compounds, such as AlGaN and AlInGaN. For simplicity, Group III-nitride based structures will be referred to herein as \u201cGaN-based\u201d structures.","GaN-based HEMTs are not conventionally considered good choices to use as transistors in low noise amplifiers, because GaN transistors do not generally have good noise characteristics. For example, GaN has poorer noise characteristics than other semiconductor materials, such as GaAs and\/or InP that are conventionally used in high frequency low noise amplifiers. However, transistors formed using those materials may not have as high input power survivability as GaN-based transistors. Therefore, it would be desirable to make a low noise amplifier using GaN-based transistors provided the noise figure of the GaN-based low noise amplifier could be limited to an acceptable amount.","In some embodiments, a low noise amplifier including GaN-based HENTs can achieve a low noise figure while simultaneously achieving high Third Order Intercept (TOI) characteristics, high P1dB characteristics, and\/or high input power survivability. In practice, circuits\/devices according to embodiments of the invention can be scaled to achieve higher TOI, or can be tuned to accommodate other frequency bands.","The use of GaN-based HEMTs in an LNA according to some embodiments provides good noise figure performance while also providing superior TOI and saturated power than is available through other material technologies. This may lead to a higher dynamic range for easier system integration. The GaN-based HEMTs may also have better input power survivability, allowing them to be integrated with less need for input protection circuitry, which may improve overall system performance. Because GaN-based HEMTs have higher breakdown voltages and are typically biased at higher voltages than transistors formed using other material technologies, they can be used with a higher voltage power supply, which may allow easier integration for some systems and may also improve system power efficiency.","According to some embodiments, a two stage MMIC amplifier includes a first stage transistor having a gate periphery less than about 1 mm and a second stage transistor having a gate periphery greater than about 1 mm. In particular, the MMIC amplifier may include a 0.72 mm first stage and a 1.2 mm second stage including AlGaN\/GaN-based HEMT transistors with field plates. Typically, a transistor device employing a field plate would not be a good choice for a low noise amplifier, because the presence of the field plate may increase the input (gate to source) capacitance, which can increase the noise figure of the amplifier. However, it has been found that the presence of one or more field plates in the transistor can decrease other parasitics in the amplifier, which can improve the noise figure of the amplifier.","A GaN MMIC according to some embodiments may be matched at input and output to a 50 ohm impedance, and may have separate DC bias inputs for each stage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","112","1","1","112","2","2","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","100"]},"Referring to , a GaN-based MMIC  according to some embodiments includes a substrate , such as AlN, a metal core PCB, or the like, on which first and second GaN-based transistors Q and Q are provided.

DC blocking capacitors CG, CD, CG and CD isolate the DC bias pads VG, VG, VD and VD from ground, while RF choke inductors LG, LD, LG, LD reduce RF noise from the DC inputs.","An RF signal input pad RF_IN receives an input RF signal to be amplified. The input signal is filtered by an input capacitor CIN and an input inductor LIN and is applied to the gate of the first transistor Q. Drain bias is applied to the drain of the first transistor Q from the drain DC pad VD, while gate bias is applied to the gate of the first transistor from the gate DC pad VG. The source of the first transistor Q is coupled to ground through a source inductor LS. An interstage network , which may include a capacitor, connects the drain of the first transistor Q to the gate of the second transistor Q.","Drain bias is applied to the drain of the second transistor Q from the gate DC pad VD, while gate bias is applied to the gate of the second transistor from the gate DC pad VG.

A nucleation layer  can be formed on the substrate  to reduce the lattice mismatch between the substrate  and the next layer in the HEMT . The nucleation layer  may be approximately 1000 angstroms thick, although other thicknesses can be used. The nucleation layer  can include many different materials, with a suitable material being AlGaN (0\u2266z\u22661), and can be formed on the substrate  using known semiconductor growth techniques, such as Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), or Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE).","The substrate  can be made of many different materials with a suitable substrate being a 4H polytype of silicon carbide, although other silicon carbide polytypes can also be used including 3C, 6H and 15R polytypes. Silicon carbide has a much closer crystal lattice match to Group III nitrides than sapphire, and may result in Group III nitride films of higher quality. Silicon carbide also has a very high thermal conductivity so that the total output power of Group III nitride devices on silicon carbide may not be limited by the thermal dissipation of the substrate (as may be the case with some devices formed on sapphire). Also, the availability of silicon carbide substrates may provide the capacity for device isolation and reduced parasitic capacitance that make commercial devices possible. Suitable SiC substrates are available from Cree, Inc., of Durham, N.C.","The formation of a nucleation layer  can depend on the material used for the substrate . For example, methods of forming a nucleation layer  on various substrates are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,290,393 and 5,686,738, each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Methods of forming nucleation layers on silicon carbide substrates are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,393,993, 5,523,589, and 5,739,554 each of which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein.","The HEMT  further includes a high resistivity buffer layer  formed on the nucleation layer . The buffer layer  can include doped or undoped layers of Group III-nitride materials with a suitable buffer layer  made of a Group III-nitride material, such as AlGaIn)N (0\u2266x\u22661, 0\u2266y\u22661, x+y\u22661). Other materials can also be used for the buffer layer  such as GaN that is approximately 2 microns (\u03bcm) thick, with part of the buffer layer doped with a deep level transition element, such as Fe.","A barrier layer  is formed on the buffer layer  with the buffer layer  being sandwiched between the barrier layer  and the nucleation layer . Like the buffer layer , the barrier layer  can include doped or undoped layers of Group III-nitride materials. The barrier layer can be made of one or multiple layers of AlGaN, where x ranges from 0 to 1, and x can be a function of depth such that the barrier layer  can be a graded layer. A two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel layer  is induced at the heterointerface between the buffer layer  and the barrier layer , with the buffer layer , 2DEG channel layer  and barrier layer  generally forming the HEMTs active region.","The buffer and barrier layers ,  can be made using the same methods used to grow the nucleation layer . Electric isolation between the devices may be accomplished through mesa etch or ion implementation outside the active HEMT.","Metal source and drain electrodes ,  are formed in contact with the barrier layer , and a gate  is formed on the barrier layer  between the source and drain electrodes , . Electric current can flow between the source and drain electrodes ,  through the 2DEG channel layer  between the buffer layer  and the barrier layer  when the gate  is biased at the appropriate level. The formation of source and drain electrodes ,  is described in detail in the patents and publications referenced above.","The source and drain electrodes ,  can be made of different materials including but not limited to alloys of titanium, aluminum, gold or nickel.

The gate  can have many different lengths (L), with a suitable gate length ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 microns (\u03bcm), although other gate lengths can also be used. In some embodiments, the gate length (L) may be approximately 0.5 microns (\u03bcm).","A first non-conducting spacer layer  is formed over the gate  and at least part of the surface of the barrier layer  between the gate  and the source and drain electrodes , . As shown in , the spacer layer  covers all of the barrier layer  between the gate  and source and drain electrodes , . The spacer layer  can include a dielectric layer, or a combination of multiple dielectric layers. Different dielectric materials can be used such as a SiN, SiO, Si, Ge, MgO, MgN, ZnO, SiN, SiO, alloys or layer sequences thereof. The spacer layer can be many different thicknesses, with a suitable range of thicknesses being approximately 0.03 to 0.5 microns (\u03bcm).","A first field plate  is formed on the spacer layer  over the gate , with the first field plate extending on the spacer layer  a distance Ltoward the drain electrode  and extending a distance Ltoward the source electrode . The spacer layer  is arranged to provide isolation between the first field plate  and the barrier layer  and gate , so the spacer layer  need only cover the gate  and barrier layer  below the first field plate . For ease of manufacturing, however, the spacer layer typically covers the entire barrier layer . Lcan be different distances with a suitable range of distances being from 0.1 to 5 microns (\u03bcm). Similarly, Lcan be different distances with a suitable range of distances being 0.1 to 2 microns.
