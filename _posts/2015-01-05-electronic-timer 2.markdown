title: Electronic timer
abstract: An electronic interval timer in a dodecahedron case is described. The timer is set by turning uppermost one of 11 faces; and reset by turning uppermost the 12face. In one embodiment, the timer is free of buttons, knobs, springs, time displays, electronic visual indicators and openings in the case. Time interval completion is announced via audible tones or speech. An aggregate time interval may be set equal to the sum of legends on more than one face. The timer detects carrying such that a running time interval is not modified. The timer may be programmed via a sequence of uppermost sides. Modes may be selected via shaking or tapping. Time remaining may be announced, an interval cleared, or an interval restarted responsive to detected motion. Other polyhedral shapes may be used. Claims include a method of setting a time interval; and specific ordering of face legends.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DEFINITIONS"],"p":["The field of this invention is timers. More specifically, the field is convenience timers, sometimes referred to as kitchen timers. They may also be used to time play, classes, work, or other activities.","Timers that provide an alert or signal at the expiration of a set time are as old as the hourglass.","Later, mechanical timers typically comprised a spring, a governor or balance wheel, a knob for winding the spring, a pointer, and a dial with markings. The user would turn the knob to both set a desired time and to wind the spring. The timer ran at a (hopefully) fixed speed, calibrated to the dial. When the set time was up, the spring would also power a bell, announcing the completion of the set interval.","Now, electronic timers are prevalent. A common format comprises a keyboard, typically with the digits 0 through 9 plus a few function keys, such as start, pause, and reset. These timers usually include a display, such as an LCD, initially showing the time interval being set, and then the time remaining. An audible alarm announcements completion, often continuous until the alarm is manually cleared.","Such electronic timers are cheaper and more reliable that the mechanical timers they replaced. However, they suffer from many disadvantages. The buttons are usually small\u2014hard to see and hard for many people to operate. Similarly, the displays are often small and hard to see. Such timers are effectively useless in the dark, and hard to use in dim light, or for people who are not wearing their glasses. They are very difficult for people to use who have limited use of their fingers or hands, or have limited eyesight.","In addition, electronic timers are neither fast to set, nor intuitive. While a traditional mechanical timer required no more than a twist of the knob, electronic timers require a specific sequence of buttons to be pushed. Such multiple actions require accurate sight, dexterity and thinking.","In addition, electronic timers, typically, have other disadvantages. For example, they use batteries that must be replaced, they are not waterproof, and they break easily. Although these weaknesses could be overcome by engineering, design and money, the inherent elements of the current art of electronic timers, such as keyboards and displays, make such ruggedization challenging, and, in practice, is not done. Multiple button sequences and the need for light are endemic requirements for current electronic timers.","Devices such as smart phones include timers as applications. Although the user interfaces for these are dramatic improvements over electronic timers, such as the use of voice commands to set the timer, they require an expensive, fragile and theft-prone platform on which to run. They are not suitable for dedicated use, nor appropriate for rugged applications. Such expensive devices are rarely used as kitchen timers because of the dangers in the kitchen of spills and dropping. Voice programmed apps do not respond to all languages, nor to all speakers.","Both electronic timers and smart-phone timing applications may provide illuminated displays. However, the power usage of such displays then requires either frequent battery changes or frequent charging\u2014both of which are a serious inconvenience and often result in a non-operational timer when needed.","In addition, all such timers discussed above rarely permit more than one time interval to be set concurrently. Nor do such timers announce the length of a set time interval at the completion of the interval.","The current invention solves the discussed weakness of the prior art. It may be the easiest to use settable timer ever invented. Only one hand is required for setting. The timer works for users who speak any language, unlike voice-programmed timers. A basic embodiment consists of a 12-sided polyhedron shape. The faces of the polyhedron are printed or embossed with an interval length legend in large, high-contrast digits. To set the timer, one simply rotates the timer until the desired time interval is face up. No other action is required. There are no buttons, knobs, or displays.","When the set time interval expires, the timer provides an audible alert.","One face of the timer indicates \u201cOFF.\u201d This face is placed up to prematurely terminate a set interval or to place the timer into a known state. The legend on the OFF face may be, \u201c0.\u201d","In one embodiment, a set time interval may be changed or restarted by simply again rotating the timer. In another embodiment, rotation to a new face while an interval is running causes a second time interval to be started, running concurrently. In yet another embodiment, rotation to multiple faces in a sequence creates a time interval equal to the sum of the legends on the multiple faces. These embodiments may be combined, using, for example, the elapsed time between rotations to select the operational mode.","In one exemplary implementation, 11 available fixed times are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. Another implementation comprises: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minute times on face legends.","The basic operation of the timer, in various embodiments is described above in SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.","There are many choices of implementation options, as those trained in the art know. There are many choices of operational states and state machines, as those trained in the art know.","There are many choices of audio message announcements, either tones, speech, or special audio effects, as well as visual and haptic announcements, as those trained in the art know.","High contrast, large face legends permit the timer to be easily read in dim light, or by people with compromised vision. The use of embossed digits, or braille, permits easy use by people with poor or no vision.","Some embodiments provide a set of audible indications that are responsive to the length of a time interval, an operating mode, or setting activity. An optional repetitive tick provides confidence a time interval is running.","Some embodiments permit the legends on the faces to be altered by users, for example, by adhesive stickers. The stickers may provide symbols for particular times, such as egg to show a time interval for cooking an egg. A symbol may indicate that a class, lesson, meeting or session is ending.","Some embodiments provide for wireless communication, which may be unidirectional or bi-directional.","In one embodiment, a user may create or choose a set of times he or she wishes the timer to support. The legends on the faces may be manually changed to match wirelessly set times. Although this embodiment is programmable to user desired configurations, the timer remains overwhelmingly simple and reliable to use.","In another embodiment, a user may wirelessly download tones or announcements. In this way, time intervals may be announced appropriately for that user, such as \u201cYour egg is cooked,\u201d \u201cClass is over,\u201d or \u201cTime for bed.\u201d","In one embodiment, the timer is waterproof and sanitizable. It may be washed by hand or in the dishwasher, or, in some embodiments, autoclaved. These features allow the timer to be used in medical environments, schools and outdoors without fear of either contamination that damages the timer or the transmission of germs. Because there are no buttons, knobs or electronic displays, the timer is easily sealed and is cleanable without the risk of small crevices harboring bacteria or allowing the entry of water or germs. Prior art, with the possible exception of the hourglass, does not have these attributes.","In one embodiment, there is no access to an internal, permanently sealed battery. Because there are no electronic displays, ten-year battery life is easily achievable.","In one embodiment, the timer case may be transparent or translucent, or have such portions, allowing an interior light to be used to illuminate the legends on the faces, locate the timer at night, or pulse to show activity, or flash to indicate time completion.","The timer may be wirelessly chargeable, incorporating an electromagnetic power receiver or an optical power receiver. The optical power receiver may be responsive to infrared (IR) light, permitting all faces to be opaque to visible light.","In addition, a transparent or translucent case may permit an internal sealed battery to be charged using solar or light energy.","In some embodiments, the timer is exceptionally rugged. A polyhedron shape is easily manufactured at reasonable cost (compared to a smart phone) and adapted to withstand high stress. With no buttons, knobs, springs, displays or openings, the timer may easily be manufactured to withstand substantial abuse, such as being dropped repeatedly or very rough play by children, or for use in a classroom, or prison, or for use in health care.","In some embodiments, the polyhedron shape may have rounded vertices and edges, permitting use by children or otherwise in environments where a traditional timer might cause harm, for example, if one child threw it at another child, or in a prison.","In a simple embodiment, the user simply sets a desired time by rotating the timer until the desired time is shown on the upper face. When that time expires, the timer provides an alert, which may be any combination of one or more audible, visual, or tactile (such as vibratory) signals.","In some embodiments the timer may be carried during a running time interval without altering the running time interval.","In some embodiments the timer has a \u201ctransport\u201d mode during which the timer operates at lower power and is silent. This mode may be exited automatically at the cessation of movement. In some embodiment the timer has a \u201cdishwasher\u201d mode that causes lower power operation and silence operating during transport. This mode may be exited automatically at the cessation of movement. This mode may or may not be the same mode as \u201ctransport\u201d mode.","In some embodiments the timer has a \u201cfactory\u201d mode during which the timer operates at lower power and is silent until this mode is exited by a specific action, or set of actions, or sequence of actions.","In some embodiments the timer has a \u201cretail\u201d or \u201cdemo\u201d mode that changes the available time intervals and audio alerts, or both, to permit demonstration.","In some embodiments the timer has a \u201cretail\u201d or \u201cdemo\u201d mode that changes the available time intervals and audio alerts, or both, to permit demonstration.","In some embodiments a predetermined sequence of uppermost faces causes a mode change.","In some embodiments specific audio announcements are made by the timer when entering or exiting modes.","Some embodiments comprise operating modes comprising announcements in mode-determined languages.","More complex embodiments include an indication when the timer is set; or of the set time, or that the time is running, or that a running time has been changed or restarted; or that the timer has been moved; or the timer has been programmed, or the timer has an error; or the timer battery is low; or other functions, modes or features, or any combination of these. Audible outputs may be sounds, musical tones, speech in any or variable languages, or combinations thereof. Audible outputs may be selected, programmed, or downloaded by end-users, or by a manufacturer or distributor in advance of delivery to and end-customer.","Various embodiments are ideal for people who are blind or sight impaired. Various embodiments are ideal for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. Various embodiments are ideal for people who have limited finger or hand dexterity.","A set of views of one embodiment is provided in 12 views in . This Figure shows overhead views. Other figures typically show perspective views. Numerous times interval values other than those shown in this exemplary embodiment may be used. These times may be units of minutes, or other units of time. Legends need not be Arabic numbers. For example, Hebrew numbers or Chinese numbers may be used, or times may be spelled out in a language.","In one embodiment, the shortest five times are placed in the top hemisphere (defined by OFF up), with the longest six times placed in the bottom hemisphere. In one embodiment, the longest time, such as 60 minutes, in placed on the face opposite the OFF face. In one embodiment, the legend, color, feel, or combination of these attributes of the OFF face are distinct from the other faces in order to facilitate ease of identifying the OFF face. The word, \u201cOFF\u201d may be in any language, or may be a symbol such as an international symbol for off, or the digit zero.","In this embodiment, shown in , the five faces surrounding and adjacent to the OFF face read left-to-right, for increasing times, as one holds the timer with the OFF face generally up. In this Figure, note the shown times are, in sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Note also that the orientation of the legends for these five faces are such that they read normally (with respect to orientation and angle), with the OFF face uppermost. These arrangements are valuable in aiding visibility and ease of use, including intuitively locating a desired face. This arrangement is most visible looking at the upper left view in .","Note that in this embodiment the longest times are on the lower hemisphere. The \u201cbottom\u201d of the timer has the longest time, here, 60. Note that when this face is uppermost (that is, the timer is turned \u201cupside down\u201d from the normal, OFF position) that the five next longest times (here: 10, 15, 20, 30, 45) are arranged such that they read normally (with respect to orientation and angle), and increase in sequence, left-to-right, for 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45. This arrangement is most visible looking at the lower right view in . These arrangements of the six largest times are valuable in aiding visibility and ease of use, including intuitively locating a desired face. Such arrangements, independent of specific times, are claimed explicitly as embodiments of the invention.","There are many alternative time sets. Once such set is: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60. Another such set is: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Time units may be minutes, seconds, hours, or other units. Such units may or may not be included in legends, and may be mixed. For example, the legends for 60, 120 and 180 minute may be, \u201c1 hour,\u201d \u201c2 hours,\u201d and \u201c3 hours.\u201d Timers used for demonstration may have shorter times. For example, times normally in minutes may become times in seconds for sales or demonstration purposes. In some embodiments the set of available times may be mode dependent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Exemplary Color Embodiment"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Face","Colors"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["OFF","Black type on White background"]},{"entry":["1","Black type on Yellow or Light Yellow background"]},{"entry":["2","Black type on PaleGreen or aquamarine background"]},{"entry":["3","Black type on LightBlue or SkyBlue background"]},{"entry":["5","Black type on Pink or LightPink background"]},{"entry":["7","Black type on PeachPuff or NavahoWhite background"]},{"entry":["10","White type on Brown or SaddleBrown background"]},{"entry":["15","White type on Crimson background"]},{"entry":["20","White type on BlueViolet or DarkViolet background"]},{"entry":["30","White type on Indigo background"]},{"entry":["45","White type on Green or DarkGreen background"]},{"entry":["60","White type on Black background"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"The second action or embodiment that is shown in  is changing from a first running time interval to a new time interval.

The accelerometer is also able to wakeup the processor , or provide an interrupt, on detection of certain selected motion events. An exemplary accelerometer , is a Freescale Semiconductor MMA8451Q. The ideal interface to the process is bidirectional, as shown by communication lines , as this allows the parameters of the accelerometer, , to be programmed.","Continuing with , the heart of the electronics in some embodiments is a processor . Those in the art know there are many different processors, processor packages, and configurations suitable. An exemplary processor is a Freescale Semiconductor MK64FN1MOVLL12. The processor has internal RAM , and program memory, such as Flash memory . Such memories may be internal to the processor IC, or external, or both. The Flash memory is suitable to hold both executable code and data, such as sound data for tones or speech output.","Continuing with , the timer ideally provides audio output via an amplifier  and speaker . More than one amplifier may be used and more than one speaker may be used. The amplifier(s) are fed by a signal , from the processor. Such a signal may an analog value, such as from a DAC, or a digital signal, which may be one-bit, pulse-width modulated, or multiple bits. Audio data may be straight audio samples, or may be compressed, or may be codes that represent sounds, phonemes, or portions thereof. In some embodiments, the audio amplifier or audio control circuit may draw its data directly from memory, such as by the use of DMA. An exemplary audio amplifier is MAX9730, PAM8302 or NXP TFA9887. The one or more speakers , are typically 4 ohms or 8 ohms, however, other values and types of speakers may be used, including audio transducers, such as PZTs.","Continuing with , an oscillator, , provides a time-base. The oscillator may be a crystal, such as 32 KHz, or a resonator, or a higher frequency crystal such as 8 MHz or 25 MHz, or an integrated oscillator IC. More than one oscillator or crystal may be used. The oscillator's signal may supply other ICs in addition to the processor, .","See Table 6, below, for a parts list of one embodiment.","Communication between the processor and peripheral chips may be a common multiplexed bus, such as I2C (\u201cI-squared-C\u201d) or I2S (\u201cI-squared-S\u201d).","Motion filtering. As the operation of the timer comprises rotating the timer until the desired time face is up, detecting such \u201csetting motion\u201d as well as other motions, is critical to reliable and intuitive operation of the timer. In addition, the timer may be moved for a long period of time not directly related to setting or clearing a time. For example, the timer may be running, and is being transported from one room to another room. As another example, the timer is being washed, either by hand or in a dishwasher. As yet another example, the timer may be being shipped, such as prior to first sale, or in a user's car from one location to another. It is important that such actions are identified in order to provide the expected operation of the timer while conserving power. This includes entering one or more low-power modes during transport and washing so as to not wear down the battery, and also to avoid repeated and undesired audio output from the timer.","In addition, the timer may experience small motions from vibrations, or being bumped, or being handled by a user with no intent by the user to change the current operating mode.","One way to assist in identifying these different types of motion is to define at least three time intervals, such as Ts, Tm, and Tl. These time intervals are used to categorize motion of the timer. Position changes at or less than Ts (short) times are generally ignored in that they do not change the timer state. Note, however, that some Ts or shorter actions do have meaning, such a timer being dropped or shaken. The time period Tm may be defined as greater than Ts and less than Tl. Timer position changes within this time interval are typically intentional by the user in that they indicate a desired timer state change. Such user-desirable stat changes may be called operational state changes. State changes that take Tl or longer typically indicate some activity other than normal use of the timer, as stated above, such as washing or transport. These time thresholds may change dynamically. In particular, the timer may \u201clearn\u201d these times by recording timer activity.","The raw output of the accelerometer is typically noisy. That is, some type of low-pass filtering is appropriate. This may be implement within the accelerometer, in hardware or software within the processor, or effectively by a state machine. For example, the position of the timer may be sampled periodically, such as 10 times per second. To recognize a motion within the Tm window, at least five consecutive time samples must indicate that the same timer side is up. Other values that these examples may be used. Accelerometer sample rates may range from 100 times per second to once every 10 seconds.","When we refer to \u201crotation\u201d or \u201cmovement\u201d or \u201can uppermost face,\u201d we are including suitable and well-known filtering of data from the accelerometer to reasonably match a user's perception of \u201cmoving\u201d v. \u201cstill.\u201d","An exemplary motion table is shown below as Table 2.

In some embodiments, it is desirable to have more than one power-down state. For example, when the timer is timing, state (T), no internal activity is necessary until one of events occurs: either the timer is moved, as the accelerometer may detects motion, or an internal timer expires. The timer may use an internal time base to wake up the processor periodically. For example, the electronics may \u201cwake up\u201d once every second to see if the user's set interval has expired. In addition, an interrupt from the accelerometer may wake up the processor.","However, for some activity such as transport or washing, a different low power mode is desired. For this low power mode, the timer may not enable accelerometer interrupts.","In some embodiments, various operating modes are desirable. For example, the timer may generate output messages in English, or French, or in another language. As a second example, there may be more than one model of timer, with different values on the faces. As a third example, a user may which to change the operating mode. For example, there may be \u201cverbose\u201d mode where the timer provides frequent audio feedback, or a \u201cquiet\u201d mode where only the completion of set times causes audio output. A user may select a male or female voice, as yet another example.","In general, we may think of two types of \u201cprogramming\u201d of such timer modes: The first type is mode of operation set by a factory, distributor or retailer. The second type of mode of operation is set by an end-user.","For either type of mode programming, a novel method of programming is to rotate the timer through a particular sequence of up sides, within particular time periods. For example, rotating the timer from OFF, to 7, to 60, to 5, and then back to OFF, with each side staying up for a time period between 1 second and 10 seconds (for example) may be a recognized programming sequence to cause a particular operating mode to be set, until changed by another programming sequence.","Such programming has the advantage that a single electronics module may be used for a large number of different timer modules sold into different markets.","Table 5, below, provides an exemplary set of audio announcements.

Operating modes may be viewed as either global or local. Global modes refer to the overall operation of the timer\u2014which rotations cause which states, actions and outputs. Local modes may also be called operational states, as discussed above. Typically operational state changes are caused by (i) one or more rotations, or the cessation of rotation; (ii) movement, or the cessation of movement, (iii) a timer interval being initiated, completed, or updated; or (iv) an internal time period has passed. Generally, the user causes (i) and (ii), above, while the normal function of the timer causes (iii). Cause (iv) is used for filtering of (i) and (ii), and for changing into or out of power-down states or modes.","Global modes may be set at a factory, or a distributor, or a retailer. These modes may be for different time models, different feature sets, different target markets, different languages, or to change a timer from a shipping mode to a user mode, or vice-versa. In some embodiments, users may also set one or more global modes.","A shipping mode is advantageous to keep battery drain as low as possible during shipping\u2014until it is in the user's hands. Generally, no audio output during this mode is preferred, and \u201csleep times\u201d for the processor, accelerometer, and other electronics should be as long as possible. Waking up the timer from a shipping mode to a user mode (or a \u201cretail\u201d mode, or a \u201cdemo\u201d mode) may require a longer-term action, such as shaking for at least 10 seconds, or a series of taps. A particular orientation may be used, or also required. For example, timers may normally be shipped with the \u201cOFF\u201d side up. If a shipping box is placed upside down, or on its side, then the angle of rotation is 180\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 from the OFF orientation. These angles may continue a shipping mode, if one is already in progress. Note that an operating timer, on a level surface, would not stay at a 90\u00b0 angle. One way to exit shipping mode would be to place timers on some other side, such as one of the five faces surrounding OFF, for a time period, perhaps one minutes or more. (Time periods of 1 to 1000 seconds, or 5 to 500 seconds, or 10 to 100 seconds, or over 5, or over 10, or over 30 or over 60 seconds may be used for this exit-from-shipping-mode change.) Retail boxes for the timer may include the ability to place the retail box at such an angle to effect this exit-from-shipping-mode. Ideally, the timer generates an audio message when it exits the shipping mode.","Dishwasher mode. It is desirable to permit users to place the timers in a dishwasher. While in the dishwasher, it is desirable to minimize power use and also to minimize or avoid completely audio announcements. Generally, dishwashers create frequent motion due the water spray or mechanical vibration. This frequent motion may be detected, causing the timer to enter dishwasher mode. Such a time period of frequent or constant motion may be more than 10 seconds, or more than 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, or 240 seconds. Exiting the dishwasher mode may occur when the timer is still for period of time, and has a face reasonably level (such as within 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 45 degrees) such as more than 10 seconds, or more than 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, or 240 seconds. In addition, the timer may need to have a particular face up, such as OFF. An alternative, or additional way to exit dishwasher mode may be to shake the timer for a minimum time period, such as more than 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 30, or 60 seconds. Hand washing may also be treated as dishwasher mode, but not necessarily.","Reset to default operating mode. It may be desirable to permit a user to reset operating modes to a known default. One way of achieving this reset is to shake the timer for a minimum period of time. Such a time period of frequent or constant motion may be more than 10 seconds, or more than 5, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, or 240 seconds. In addition, a particular face may need to be uppermost at the termination of the shaking, such as the OFF face.","Programming modes. Global modes may typically be set at a factory, or a distributor, or a retailer. These modes may be for different timer models, different feature sets, different target markets, different languages, or to change a timer from a shipping mode to a user mode, or vice-versa. However, it may be desirable to allow users to also set global modes, although the set of possible user-available modes is likely to a different set than possible modes set by the factory, distributor, or retailer. A novel method of programming global modes is to rotate the timer through a predetermined sequence of uppermost sides, with one sequence for each desired mode. The necessary time period for each uppermost face in the sequence might be in the time range of 0.5 to 90 seconds, 0.75 to 30 seconds, 1 to 15 seconds, 1 to 10 seconds, or 1 to 5 seconds. Sequences may be two, three, four, five, six or more faces. For example, one such sequence is: starting from OFF (no maximum time limit) then to 7, then to 20, then to 5, and then back to OFF (no maximum time limit). There may be sets of modes that are restricted to one mode per set (e.g., language). There may be sets of modes where the mode is independent of other modes, such as a verbose mode, or a ticking-while-running mode.","Actions that may also be used for setting modes, which may be stand-alone actions, or may be combined with the above face-sequence actions include shaking or tapping. Taps may be counted. Counted taps to change mode may include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 taps, or a range of taps, such as 2 to 3, or 3 to 5, or 5 to 10 taps.","Non-limiting examples of modes are: language of announcements; tones used in announcements; gender or accent of voice for announcements; length of announcements; verbose v. standard v. quiet mode; ticking on or off; vibration threshold; announcement volume; entering or exiting a shipping mode; reset to one or more default modes; audio output, visual output, or both; entering or exiting a retail or demo mode.","Modes settable by the user may be cycled through a sequence by shaking the timer. For example, modes may be sequenced from normal to verbose to quiet, and then back to normal, each time the timer is shaken. Modes may be set by the number of taps. For example, four taps sets standard mode, five taps sets quiet mode, and six taps sets verbose mode.","For timers with wireless communication, one or more change actions described above may enable or disable wireless communication.","Retail mode. It is desirable to have a retail or demo mode. Such a mode might be viewed as intermediate between shipping mode and user mode. Such a mode might include product demonstrations, product use instructions, or might prohibit certain other mode changes, or combinations. For example, a product demonstration might be simply announcing an uppermost face, for example, \u201cten.\u201d However, this demonstration might not require the timer to be still. Thus, it may provide this audio demonstration while being held. This is distinct from normal operation, where the intent of the user is typically not determined until after the timer has stopped moving. The retail mode may also be tolerant of some vibration, without making an audio announcement or changing mode. A \u201cdemo\u201d mode might be the same as a retail mode, or may be a separate mode.","Instruction mode. It is useful to provide a mode whereby the timer provides audio instructions. Such a mode may be temporary, in that when the audio instructions have been completed, the mode exits. Such a mode may be entered by any of the mode change actions described elsewhere herein. For example, shaking for a minimum time period may cause entry into the instruction mode. Also, exit from retail mode to user made may cause instructions to be first provided.","Dropped mode. Ideally, the timer withstands drops without damage. However, it may be desirable to provide a unique audio message following a drop, such as \u201cOuch!\u201d or \u201cPlease do not drop the timer.\u201d The timer may provide such an audio message only once per a time period (such as once per hour, or once per day) to minimize users making a game out of dropping the timer.","The timer may make an announcement after a cleaning mode, such as \u201cI am now squeaky clean.\u201d Some messages may vary. Such variation may be random.","Carrying mode. The user, after a user has set it, frequently moves a timer. In this case, the user typically does not wish to change or cancel a running interval. In some embodiments, the timer detects that it is being moved and does not change a running interval. One way to do this is to note the maximum angle that the timer is rotated from its starting position while being moved. If (a) the timer is not rotated more than a first angle (such as an angle in the range of 5\u00b0 to 100\u00b0, or the range of 10\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, or the range of 15\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, or the range of 20\u00b0 to 50\u00b0); and (b) the timer is placed at the end of the carry movement so that the previously uppermost face is again uppermost, then carry mode may be assumed and the previously running interval (or intervals) are continued without interruption. It may be advantageous to make such an announcement, for example, \u201cpreviously set time of 10 minutes still running,\u201d or, \u201c3 minutes left out of 30 minutes.\u201d","Intermediate time announcements. Some people would like to know how much time is left on a running interval. A novel user action to cause a time remaining message to be announced is to pick up the timer, tilt or shake it, and place it back down with the original side face up again. Alternatively, the timer may be tapped to cause a remaining time announcement.","Weak battery mode. It may be desirable to notify the user with an audio message when the battery is low. This mode may include instructions to the user on how to remedy the problem. For a sealed, non-rechargeable battery, the instructions may include how to return the timer or how to purchase a replacement. For replaceable or chargeable batteries, the instructions may include how to replace or recharge the battery. If there is a charging stand, the timer's announcement may be, \u201cPlease place the timer on the charging stand.\u201d","Charging. In one embodiment, batteries are not chargeable. For embodiments with chargeable batteries, batteries may be charged through timer case via electrical contacts, typically on the face opposite the OFF face; or may be charged via light; or may be charged via an electromagnetic or electric field coupling through the case, as those trained in the art understand. A Near Field Communication coil may be used for both communication and charging. Ideally, a receiver for electromagnetic or electric field coupling is on the face opposite the OFF face.","For charging via light (using \u201csolar cells,\u201d as a receptor, for example), the receptor may be on or under any one or more faces. A novel method of charging via light is place the receptor on the face opposite the OFF face, then use a charging base that provides upward directed light to the timer, so that it may charges while sitting on the charging stand, with the OFF face up. The charging base and receptor may use infrared (IR) light, for example, permitting the use of low-cost and highly efficient infrared LEDs and receptors. Also, the use of IR for charging is minimally intrusive. A novel feature of the capability is the use of an IR filter on or behind a face, such that the receptor is not generally visible. Such a face may be, or may appear to black, or dark. For example, a face with a legend of \u201c60,\u201d may comprise a white legend on a black or dark background. Any charging stand may or may not detect the presence of a timer on the charging stand.","Electronic interface. In some embodiments, the timer is programmable via a wireless electronic interface. Such an interface may be audio (including frequencies above or below normal human hearing), IR data, Bluetooth, WiFi, Cellular data, Near Field Communication (NFC), or other interfaces. Non-limiting examples of programmability include: firmware, operating modes, sounds or musical tones, messages, and optional features. One novel embodiment implements bi-directional digital communication using audio signals. High-quality audio messages may be updated reliably via such a digital audio interface.","Replaceable faces. Some embodiments include replaceable face legends. This replacement may be done at the factory, a distributor, a retailer, or a user. Reasons for changing face legends include: allowing a different set of times to be implemented; implementing a different language on the legends; use of opaque, translucent or transparent faces; and special features. One method of changing faces is the use of stickers. The previous face legends, if any, may or may not be removable. Another method of changing faces is to provide a slot on a face, into which is placed a legend. The slot method has the advantage of providing a rugged cover over the legend. The use of transparent of translucent faces permits the use of an internal light that is visible, when illuminated, by users. Face legends may cover an entire face, a portion of a face, or cover no more than the legend itself.","Internal light. In some embodiments, the timer has one or more internal lights. In one embodiment, an internal light illuminates when a timing interval completes. This light may be on steady or pulse for example. It may stay on until the timer is moved, up to some time limit, such as one minute. (A suitable range may be 10 seconds to 240 seconds, or 20 to 180 seconds.) The light may be a flash lamp. Such an output is suitable for people who are hearing impaired. Visual output may be combined with audio output, or it may be the only notification of timer interval completion. If internal light is used, one or more faces should be at least partially transparent or translucent. The timer may be manufactured from transparent or translucent plastic. In one embodiment, light exits the timer case through the edges of the dodecahedron.","Braille. In one embodiment, legends on one or more faces are in braille, or are embossed legends, such that a blind or sight impaired person can identify a face by feel. Also, textures may be used to identify one or more faces. Also, such tactile faces may be used at night, or for people who do not have on their glasses. In one embodiment, the OFF face has a distinctive texture or other tactile uniqueness. This allows the timer to be easily turned to the OFF rotation, entirely by feel, even for those people who are not sight impaired (such as at night). Tactile legends, of course, may be combined with visual legends.","Communication Modes. Some people like their timer to be highly communicative. Some people like their timer to talk as little as possible. In some embodiments, various operating modes permit either the user, or a manufacturer, distributor or retailer to set a \u201cverbosity\u201d mode. Three such possible modes may be identified as: \u201cverbose,\u201d \u201cnormal,\u201d and \u201cquiet.\u201d In a verbose mode, for example, more information is provide, which might including ticking, or regular intermediate time announcements, or more instructions. In a quiet mode, for example, only completion of time intervals generate audio messages, and, possibly, a minimal indication that a time has been set, such as a short tone. Alternatively, for quiet mode, at the start of the time interval the interval length is announced; then, at the completion of the time interval a simpler output is provided, such as a basic alarm or tone, such as a \u201cding.\u201d Some people like their timers to tick\u2014this provides some assurance that the timer is running. Turning on and off ticks may be an optional mode. Ticks may be provided in the verbose mode.","Modes may include a \u201csimple\u201d mode and an \u201cadvanced\u201d mode. An advanced may included more features or options. A simple mode may limit features or options so as to provide more consistent operation.","Modes may include specific sets of features aimed at a particular target market. For example, for classroom use, setting exact time intervals may be important. For use by the elderly, simpler operation (and possibly maximum volume) may be important. For use in a garden, uppermost faces may not need to be horizontal to be recognized. For use in some teaching or therapy environments, low volume and minimal messages may be appropriate. For use in factories or noisy environments, high volume and attention getting sounds, as well as a requirement for announcements to be positively recognized, may be important. Various sizes of the timer may be appropriate for different environments or target markets. For example, for use outdoors, a large timer may be desirable.","Press to start. Ideally, there is no drain on a battery between manufacturing and first use by as user. Some products use an insulating spacer between a battery terminal and a mating connector. The user removes the spacer to electrically connect the battery. A sealed product does not well support this method. A novel method of engaging a battery comprises having a timer case comprising two portions (such as a left and right half). The two portions are pressed firmly together to connect a battery via a mechanical switch or contact points. This pressing together of the case portions may be non-reversible. That is, through the use of barbs, ratchets, clips, snaps, adhesive, or other structures, once the case portions are firmly pressed, they cannot be parted. A seal may be provided between the case portions, such as a rubber O-ring, pressure adhesive, or a press-fit seal. Thus, pressing the case portions together not only connects the battery, but also effectively seals the case, in this embodiment.","Table 6, below, lists hardware, software, and development components for one embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0127"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Parts List for One Embodiment"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Function","Component"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["IDE","Freescale KDS build 2.0.0.0.
