Field","The embodiments described herein relate to a network community platform, and, more particularly, relate to allowing users of the platform to send and receive e-mail communications from other users of the platform and users outside of the platform.","II. Background","The ubiquity of the Internet, e-mail access, and cellular telephones have created an environment in which users can be in communications with friends and family at nearly all times. Accordingly, a number of services and service providers now provide users with virtual communities in which people are allocated virtual spaces which they can personalize and customize. Within such communities of personal spaces, users having similar interests or some other connection or bond can congregate and socialize or share information and other news.","Because users rely on such virtual communities to socialize and communicate with other people, the usefulness and desirability of such communities is enhanced when as many of a user's friends and family as possible are part of or connected with the virtual community. Thus, there is a need for a user of a virtual community and other, similar services to be able to send e-mail to and receive e-mail from their friends and families within the virtual community and outside of it.","A network platform for supporting a network-enabled application, comprising a plurality of communication channels to respective plurality of wireless network carries, each of the wireless network carriers having a plurality of users, the network platform comprises at least one processor, at least one interface having access to the internet, a mobile desktop applications, at least one email application, an address book widget, a private view widget, a fake public view profile, and a real public profile.","These and other features, aspects, and embodiments of the invention are described below in the section entitled \u201cDetailed Description.\u201d","Appendices A, B, C and D include a multitude of drawings, tables, and descriptions which provide details and further understanding of the various embodiments of the present invention. The disclosures of these appendices are incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","202","212","214","216","202","210","212","202"]},"The profile page may include a hierarchy of pages, some of which are for public view and some of which have restrictions on viewing. For example, the mobile community  can be logically organized into neighborhoods such as \u201cfriends\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201cworkplace\u201d, \u201cdog owners\u201d, etc. Users , ,  can belong to these different neighborhoods and share different pages with the members of the different neighborhoods.","Additionally, this mobile community connects with various cellular carrier systems , , , each of which has an associated community of mobile phone subscribers, ,  and . Users , ,  of the mobile community  are also subscribers of various cellular carriers. In this way, users , ,  of the mobile community  not only have access through the computer-based platform  to other users' profile pages, they also have easy access to subscribers of the various cellular' carrier systems , , .","A benefit of the architecture depicted in , is that the mobile community platform  has already contracted for services with the cellular carrier systems , , . As is known in the art, the cellular carrier systems , ,  provide messaging and premium message functionality. Such messages are sent via the cellular carrier's infrastructure to mobile subscribers and, internal to the cellular carrier's infrastructure, generates a billing event according to a particular tariff rate. In practice, when the mobile community  sends a message via a cellular carrier system (e.g., ), it is billing the recipient of the message using the existing billing system of that cellular carrier. The billing event is often a micro-transaction. Thus, a user (e.g., ) of the mobile community may conduct transactions with a vendor within the mobile community  and be billed for those transactions via their cellular service account. The vendor in the transaction need only communicate with the mobile community  regarding the transaction and does not require any affiliation or agreement with any cellular carrier.","The experience of the user (e.g., ) within the mobile community  will be more enjoyable then there are more members of the mobile community  with which the user (e.g., ) would like to communicate. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention provide techniques that help ensure that people already familiar to the user (e.g., ) are invited to become members of the mobile community .  depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method that operates in accordance with the principles described in various embodiments of the present invention. The steps of the flowchart of  are described below within the context of a specific example involving the mobile community of . However, there is no requirement that the steps be used in this specific environment but, instead, can be used by other types of service providers to assist a user in inviting other members to join a particular service.","To aid in the understanding of the flowchart of ,  is provided with a more detailed view of those aspects of the mobile community  that are directly relevant to understanding the flowchart of . As depicted in , the mobile community  includes a communication synchronization application programming interface (API) . The communication synchronization API  is comprised of a registration engine , an authorization engine , a parser  and an invitation engine . In particular, the registration engine  is configured to handle the presentation of screens to new users during the registration process and also receives replies and responses from the registering users.","Users  may utilize a variety of different types of devices to interface with the mobile community . Examples of the types of devices that may be used include, but not limited to, laptop PCs , desktop PCs , mobile phones , PDAs , etc. In one embodiment, when a new user  arrives at mobile community , the user may interact (e.g., view, utilize, evaluate, rate, etc.) a plurality of different third-party software applications that are registered to the mobile community . For example, in step  a user may request access to a demo version of a third-party software application from mobile community ; which results in the mobile community  sending a webpage conferring access to the user. After interacting with the demo, the new user chooses whether to purchase (or subscribe) a \u201cfull\u201d version of the third-party software application in step . If the new user decides to purchase the full version of the third-party software application, the user may be required to first register with the mobile community  in step . In another embodiment, when a new user arrives at the mobile community , the user is immediately directed to step  where a registration screen may be presented to the user prompting the user to enter a variety of identifying information. For example, in step , the registration process results in the user providing an e-mail address and\/or a mobile telephone number to the mobile community .","In step , after providing an e-mail address and\/or a mobile telephone number to register with the mobile community , the user is presented with a webpage (sent by mobile community ) that gives the user access to a full version of the third-party software application.","Continuing on to step , when the user interacts with the full version of the third-party software application, the user is re-directed to the communication synchronization API . That is the third-party software application can be been modified (as described in ) by the third-party software provider to include a script that automatically sends the user to the communication synchronization API  that is an integrated part of the mobile community . Moving on to step , the synchronization API  presents the user with an invitation screen that informs the user that if they desire, they can send an email message to all members of their contact list that invites those members to purchase\/subscribe to the third-party software application that the user is also purchasing. The invitation screen prompts the user, in step , to enter their login information for the e-mail address (e.g., username and password). The user is informed that if they would like to send invitations, then they should fill out the login information. If, however, they do not want to send invitations, then they can leave the login information blank. Thus, the sending of invitations to the members of the contact list is completely at the discretion of the registering user and only takes place if the registering user so decides. Once, the user decides on a course of action, then a \u201cFinish\u201d, \u201cNext\u201d, or \u201cSubmit\u201d button is selected to continue.","In step , the authorization engine  uses the provided login information to authenticate with the e-mail provider. This may entail simply logging into the e-mail provider's access area like a typical user or it may entail other techniques. For example, the e-mail provider may permit a variety of different authentication methods such that completing authentication of any one of them allows access into the e-mail system. One specific example would be a e-mail provider that provides not only e-mail service but also instant-messaging service. Thus, authenticating for either one of the services would allow access into the e-mail area. If authentication fails, then the user can be prompted to re-enter the login information in case a mistake was made and then authentication is retried.","It should be understood that the communication synchronization API  may be used in conjunction with a variety of different e-mail providers. For example, \u201chotmail.com\u201d (MSN) , \u201cyahoo.mail\u201d  and AOL  are three e-mail provider (domains) that may be supported. Other supported e-mail providers  (domains) include, but are not limited to: 163.com, adelphia.net, bellsouth.net, BOL.com, btinternet.com, cantv.net, caramail.com, clubinternet.fr, comcast.net, cox.net, cs.com, docomo.ne.jp, earthlink.net, email.com, excite.com, free.fr, freenet.de, gmail.com, gmx.de, gmx.net, hanmail.net, hetnet.nl, home.nl, Hotmail, Hotmail country domains (UK, France, Germany and Italy), ibest.com.br, ig.com.br, indiatimes.com, juno.com, latinmail.com, libero.it, lycos.com, mail.com, mail.ru, MSN, mynet.com, naver.com, netscape.net, netzero.net, ntlworld.com, pacific.net.sg, pandora.be, planet.nl, pop.com.br, prodigy.net.mx, Rediff.com, rogers.com, sbcglobal.net, shaw.ca, Sina.com, singnet.com.sg, skynet.be, Sohu.com, sympatico.ca, terra.com.br, terra.es, tiscali.co.uk, tiscali.fr, tiscali.it, tiscalinet.it, Tom.com, t-online.de, uol.com.br, usa.net, verizon.net, voila.fr, wanadoo.fr, wanadoo.nl, web.de, xtra.co.nz, Yahoo, Yahoo country domains (China, Brazil, France, Canada, UK, India, Singapore and Malaysia), zipmail.com.br.","Once authentication is successfully completed, the authorization engine  has access to the user's e-mail account and its content. At this time, the authorization engine , in step , may delete the user's information so that a persistent copy of the username and password are not stored within the mobile community . This deletion is, however, an optional step. For example, retaining this information may be useful for other services such as periodically checking that e-mail account and forwarding messages from there to other e-mail accounts. Alternatively, the user's information may also be kept (at the user's request) so that the next time the user logs into the mobile community  the user will not have to re-enter the information.","Once the authorization engine  has access to the e-mail account of the user, then the authorization engine can retrieve the address book, or contact list, from the e-mail provider, in step . The specific manner in which a username and password are used to login into an e-mail provider and extract an address book depends on the specific implementation of the e-mail provider's system. One of ordinary skill will recognize that many functionally equivalent techniques may be used, as well, without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, if the e-mail provider and the mobile community explicitly partner for the purposes of facilitating this extraction of contact lists, then the e-mail provider may develop and publish a specific API for the mobile community system to use to easily extract the contact list.","Part of the process for importing a contact list or address book includes parsing the HTML page (imported from the e-mail provider) to extract just the e-mail addresses. The other extraneous characters and information need to be ignored so that the e-mail addresses within the contact list can be retrieved. The parser  is responsible for receiving the HTML page from the authorization engine  and extracting just the e-mail addresses that are then forwarded to the invitation engine .","Once the addresses from the address book or contact list are forwarded to the invitation engine , the engine  can automatically send out a default invitation letter to all the people on the list inviting them, on behalf of the registering user, to join the mobile community . However, additional customization and selectivity at this point is advantageous. In particular, the invitation engine  can generate a screen that is presented to the user informing them of the addresses that were extracted from the address book or contact list. The registering user can then select or de-select certain addresses so that only a limited number of the addresses receive the invitation. Furthermore, the text of the invitation message can be presented in an editable window so that the registering user can customize and personalize the invitation letter.","Another available option includes the ability to re-send the invitation periodically. For example, if an invitee does not respond at all to the initial invitation, then a subsequent invitation can be re-sent. The registering user can select how often to re-send the invitation. For example, the registering user can elect to send no \u201cre-sends\u201d, can elect to periodically send one every x months for a period of y months (where x and y are appropriate integer values that the user can specify). Thus, in step , the registering user can customize the invitation process by selecting on certain e-mail address to receive an invitation and also personalizing the actual invitation as well as the re-send parameters.","In step , the invitation engine  sends the invitations according to the parameters selected in step . The e-mail addresses along with the re-send meta-data for each address is stored in the database . Thus, periodically, the invitation engine  reviews the information in the database  and determines when a re-send invitation is scheduled. Once the invitations are sent, then the registration engine  continues with the registration process in step . If desired, the actual sending of the invitations, in step , can be delayed until the registering user fully completes the registration process.","There are a number of optional features that can be included within the flowchart of  to increase the efficiency and user-friendliness of the invitation process. For example, as part of the authentication process of step , the authorization server can determine if this e-mail address has previously been used to find and extract an address book. If so, then the authorization engine  can inform the user that invitations were recently sent to members of the address book and that additional invitations will not be re-sent. The determination whether or not to send invitations to members of the address book can be based on how recently (e.g., within the last n hours) the address book was extracted.","Another option is to avoid sending invitations to addresses that were already imported from someone else's address book. Thus, when the registering user is presented with the list of potential invitees in step , no e-mail addresses will be presented that have already been stored in the database  from previously extracted phone books. However, when an invitation is re-sent at some later time, the re-sent invitation includes the names of all registering members (not just the first) that is issuing the invitation. Thus, the recipient of the re-sent invitation knows on whose behalf the invitation was sent.","In some instances, some of the extracted e-mail addresses will correspond to individuals who are already members of the mobile community . In these instances, there is no need to send an invitation to these addresses. It may be advantageous, however, to inform the registering member of the identity of these current members so that the registering member knows to look for these current members within the mobile community . This can be done by displaying a picture of the current members along with their name and other contact information. Alternatively, the current member can specify what graphic image or other data to display in such an instance.","In the previous examples, the specific address books and contact lists described were related to e-mail addresses. However, many mobile phones also include contact lists that have phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Thus, in addition to asking the registering user whether or not they want to send invitations to the people in their e-mail address books, they can be asked whether or not they want invitations sent to addresses in their mobile phone. To get access to the mobile device's address book, the device's user typically has to initiate the transfer of the address book to a third party. Thus, instead of authenticating to an e-mail server and downloading an address book, the authorization engine would send a text message to the registering user's mobile device asking them to respond by initiating a transfer of the address book. Once the authorization engine  has the address book, the parser can extract the addresses as before.","Furthermore, in the above examples, the synchronization of address books has been described as part of the registration process with the service provider. The flowchart of , in contrast, depicts an exemplary method which allows an already registered user to send invitations to addresses in their address book. In accordance with this method, the user logs into their account with the network community platform (e.g., sms.ac) in step . Once the user is logged in then they are presented with their home page in step .","From their home page, the user can traverse the available selections and links, in step , to arrive at a screen that allows them to make a selection to synchronize their address book. Once this choice is made, then the process described in  is performed starting at step .","Although not mentioned earlier, yet applicable to both applications, the user may provide more than one supported e-mail address having an associated address book. In this case, the system will authenticate multiple e-mail addresses and passwords and import multiple address books. The addresses from all the address books will be combined into a single invitation list.","The re-sending of invitations may be handled as a manual process as well. Because the user originally went through the synchronization process during the original registration process, the addresses from their e-mail address book are also in their current address book within the mobile community . Thus, when the user visits their address book (or possibly some other page) they may be given the option to re-send invitations to those individuals that they realize did not respond to the first invitation to join the community. In operation, a list of all members in their address book can be displayed so that the user can select some, de-select some, select \u201call\u201d, thereby identifying those addresses to which invitations should be re-sent. This feature supplements the original sending of invitations and requested re-sends which the user requested at the time of registration. Because the mobile community  retains information regarding previous invitations, it may choose to omit displaying addresses that relate to current members or addresses who have asked not to receive additional invitations. Thus, the user may not be given the choice to re-send invitations to such addresses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["202","502","202","504","202","506","202","202"]},"At least portions of the invention are intended to be implemented on or over a network such as the Internet.
