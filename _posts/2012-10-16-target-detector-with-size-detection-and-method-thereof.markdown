It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skilled in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as an object, layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present, it will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative term's are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted is the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures, is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary-terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.

As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","The present invention provides an instrument that is capable of detecting people and animals and discriminating between the two species. A preferred embodiment utilizes two motion detectors, which are commercially available, in conjunction with Fresnel lens arrays: one is installed such that the Fresnel array pattern is horizontal to the ground and the other motion detector installed on top of the First one such that the Fresnel array pattern is at an angle of 5-30\u00b0 to the horizontal plane. Note that the use of motion detectors is described for the purposes of example only and the present invention is not limited to the use of motion detectors. The preferred embodiment comprises a computer or processor system (such as a laptop) that can capture the data from both the sensors and perform processing steps to determine whether the target is a human being or an animal. A flow chart for the processing steps is illustrated at  and the details of each step involved in determining whether it is an animal or a human are elaborated. However, the principles of the present invention are not limited to the processing steps of  and other algorithms may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.","A preferred embodiment provides an estimate of the width and height of a target using two pyroelectric sensors. Based on the width and height one can determine whether the target is art animal or a human being with substantial accuracy.  show two sets of parallel beams constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention; one set being arranged horizontally and the second set being arranged at a slant angle so that the upper beam is at a height of 2 m from the ground or base level. In this example, the spacing between each beam is approximately 15 cm. Assuming that at one end of each, beam there is a transmitter and at the other end there is a receiver as depicted in , if an animal (depicted as a dog) walks across the beams of , the animal intercepts \u2018n\u2019 number of horizontal beams, which can be observed by the lack of signal at n number of receivers. The separation between n number of beams provide the width\/length of the target. As the animal moves, it intercepts the slant beams also. The highest beam it intersects gives the height of the target. Accordingly, one can estimate the height and width\/length of the target. For example, a person has a height of 5\u2032 9\u2033 and a width, of 1\u2032 4\u2033. Similarly, horse may be 7\u2032 long and 0.6\u2032 tall. Based on these dimensions, through beam intersection, one can determine the target type, or with, more accuracy whether or not it is a person.","Generation of parallel beams requires the transmitters to be spaced apart and the receivers to detect the signal require the sensors to be spaced accordingly. Instead of parallel beams, one can use a fen shaped beams as shown in . Instead of using both transmitters and receivers, a receiver is utilized which receives emissions from the target. For practical reasons, two pyroelectric passive infrared (PIR) sensors are utilized, one for horizontal fan shaped beam pattern to generate the horizontal beams and another PIR sensor to generate the slant shaped beam patterns.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes two pyroelectric passive infrared (PIR) motion detection sensors. One of the sensors is shown in  with a Fresnel lens in front of it  shows one of the PIR sensors  in a protective package. The circuit diagram used with the sensor elements to observe the voltage generated by the pyroelectric sensing elements provided, by one of the vendors is shown in . The pyroelectric sensing elements are connected back to back as shown in . Connecting the sensors , A \u201cback to back\u201d results in output that is proportional to the difference between the two sensors. Hence, in effect it cancels the variations due to atmospheric temperature changes. These elements are marked as positive and negative, as shown in , wherein the positive terminal of sensor  is connected to the positive terminal of sensor A.  comprises a resistor , FET transistor  comprising source and drain terminals which connect to terminals S and D respectively, resistor  and capacitor . Other circuitry and\/or circuitry elements may be utilized without departing from the scope of the present invention. The detectors , A used in conjunction with the preferred embodiments may include Fresnel lenses, commonly used in conjunction with COTS (commercial off the self) units. A Fresnel lens can be thought of as regular convex lenses, but one that has been collapsed on itself to form a thinner, lighter, flat lens; one that still retains the optical characteristics of the larger convex lens, as depicted in the upper right portion of . The key advantage is that the segments of the Fresnel lens separate incoming light into distinct channels, and these, ultimately gather at the pyroelectric sensor elements (in a manner analogous to wooden slats of a simple hand fan). The objective is to gather incoming light from, each of the channels that provide distinct information about the target (or object). Many different Fresnel lenses are available on the market. The Fresnel lens shown in  divides, incoming light into five double channels (C-C, C-C, C-C, C-C, C-C, with one sub-channel (e.g. C) corresponding to the positive element and the other (e.g. C) corresponding to the negative element. Other lenses and\/or number of channels may be utilized as is readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The different Fresnel lens arrays that can be utilized in conjunction with a preferred embodiment of the present invention are available from commercial sources.  diagrammatically illustrates a Fresnel lens array that is used in conjunction with a preferred embodiment of this invention, comprising 10 subchannels labeled C-C. However, other Fresnel lens arrays can be used with minor or no modification in the human and animal, discrimination algorithm. The Fresnel lens array shows five double beams, each separated by approximately 20\u00b0. As depicted schematically in , each beam pattern has two sub-beams (e.g., C and C); one sub-beam corresponding to the positive element, another sub-beam corresponding to the negative element (as depicted in ).  is a diagrammatic illustration of the positioning of a sensor at a height of one meter. However, the sensor may be positioned at a variety of levels and\/or positions without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Human and\/or animal body is a source of thermal radiation. The blackbody radiation pattern of a person at a temperature 37\u00b0 C. is shown in . Maximum radiation from a human body occurs around 9500 ran wavelength. Similar radiation patterns can be observed for animals. The pyroelectric sensors are optimized to detect the radiation from 8000 to 14000 nm. When a heat source (source such as a human or an animal) moves across the beam patterns as shown in , an output voltage is generated. When the heat source moves into the positive element of the sensor, a positive voltage is generated at the output of the sensor. Similarly a negative voltage is generated when the heat source moves across the negative element of the sensor as shown in .","A preferred embodiment, of the present invention involves use of two pyroelectric passive infrared sensors, one above the other sensor, as shown in . The beam patterns of both the sensors are shown in . From the front view, the beam pattern of the sensor at the bottom, is horizontal to the ground and the beam pattern of the top sensor is at a slope. As a result, the height at which the beams occur increases from one side to the other as shown in . Discrimination of humans and animals is done by estimating the width\/length and height of each, target, namely, humans and animals. The bottom sensor is used to estimate the width or length of the target and the top sensor is used to estimate the height of the target.","From the bottom sensor output; one can easily estimate the direction of motion of the target. Since, each beam pattern is assigned positive and negative signs as shown in , depending on whether positive signal appears first, followed by a negative signal or vice versa the direction of motion can be ascertained. If the sensor is installed such that the beam patterns are \u2018+ \u2212 +\u2212 . . . +\u2212\u2019 from right to left with respect to the sensor, then a positive signal followed by a negative signal implies the target is moving from, right to left. Similarly, a negative signal followed by a positive signal implies the target is moving from left to right with respect to the sensor. The same information can be ascertained using the top sensor's output as long as the sensor is able to receive the radiation from the target. Another way to determine the direction of motion of the target is to stagger (misalign) the beam patterns of bottom and top PIR sensors as shown in . When a target walks from left to right; first signals appear on die bottom sensor and then on the top sensor since the target intercepts the beam pattern of the bottom sensor first and then the beam pattern of the top sensor. Similarly; if the target moves from right to left then the signals appear first on the top sensor and then on the bottom sensor.  shows the signals captured from bottom and the top sensor when a person walked across the sensor beams patterns left to right and right to left.","Range Estimation:","The Fresnel Array beam pattern has a fan shape as shown in . In the case of two detectors , A, due to the fan shape (as depicted in , for example), the separation between one beam to other varies with distance, as depicted schematically in . Hence, to estimate the length\/width of the target it is necessary to know where the target is crossing the beam pattern. Similarly, the height of the beam patterns of the top PIR sensor varies with distance and one needs to know the range of the target to estimate the height (see, e.g., eight feet high location shown in ). Hence, in order to estimate the height and length\/width estimation of the target, one should first estimate the distance of the target from the PIR sensor  or A. The PIR sensor  outputs a voltage proportional to the radiation it receives. The radiation impinging on the sensor  (or A) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and hence the output voltage of the PIR sensor  (or A) is given by equation

Estimation:","Assuming that the first sensor (bottom sensor) A with horizontal beam pattern is placed at a height of 1 foot from the ground (instead of 1 m), as depicted in . This means ail the targets with height less than 1 foot will not be detected by the bottom sensor since the Fresnel lens array used is a small animal alley lens. However, by lowering the height of the sensor one can detect the targets with height less than 1 foot using the bottom sensor. Consider the beam pattern of the top sensor. It is at a slope or angle to the horizon. As shown in , the beam pattern that is closest to the ground is at 1 foot. The beam pattern (S to S) that is at angle to the horizontal (or ground) as shown in , so that the farthest beam S is at a height of  feet at a predetermined distance. The intermediate beam patterns (e.g., S-S) are at different heights and can be easily calculated using the slope of the top sensor with horizontal plane and knowing the separation between the beam patterns of the top sensor. Assume that a target is walking from, right to left. As the target walks across the beam patterns, a signal is generated at the output of each sensor. Top sensor's output is shown in  as time versus amplitude.  also shows the target intersecting a beam pattern that is at the same height as the target. Hence, approximate height of the target can be estimated based on the highest beam pattern of the top sensor the target intersects.","In general, these sensors are deployed such that they are looking across a pathway, that is the central beam pattern is at 90\u00b0 to the pathway. However, if the target deviates from the path and approaches the sensor at an angle as shown in , the height of the target can be estimated using both the sensors outputs. The bottom sensor gives the direction of the target.","Determination of the Length or Width of the Target.","Now, the length or width of the target will be determined. Typical waveforms observed when a person or an animal walking across the beam patterns, of a PIR sensor are shown in . Two approaches are used to estimate the length\/width of the target. If the target is crossing the beam at a close distance we use one approach. When it is crossing the beams at a distance, we use the second approach.  shows the width of the beam.","Case 1: The Width of the Beam is Smaller than the Length\/Width of the Target:","Since the target length\/width is greater than the width of the beam, the target touches two beams simultaneously as shown in . This happens when the target distance to the sensor is small and hence the beam widths are small. When this happens, the waveform generated by the sensor changes its slope midway as shown in , that is, if the waveform is decreasing from a positive peak, it starts increasing in the midstream. The change is also seen in the actual data collected for a horse in ). When the slope change happens, the length\/width of the target is at least the total width of beams \u2018+\u2212\u2019 or \u2018\u2212+\u2019 of the two adjacent zones. Since the range is known, as described earlier, the beam widths can be found from the Table 2. If the beam number is not known, average beam width at the range can be used to estimate the length\/width of the target. Often, length\/width of the target is enough to decide whether the target is human or not. If length\/width is not enough to determine whether the target is human or not, the height, information can be used.","Case 2: The Width of the Beam is Greater than the Length\/Width of the Target:","This is the case when the target is farther away from the sensor.  shows one positive and associated negative beams of Fresnel array and a moving target that moves across the beams from left to right. As the target moves, a waveform is generated at the output of the PIR sensor as shown in . During the periods \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019 the target is in touch with the positive beam and hence a positive signal is being generated at the output of the sensor. Actual shape of the signal depends on the gain settings used for the output. Whatever is the shape of the signal, it will be positive. During the time periods \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019 the target is not in any beam and hence the signal discharges. Similarly, during the time periods \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019 when the target is touching the negative beam a negative signal appears. If we assume the speed at which the target is moving as \u2018v\u2019, then the distance it covered during the time period t\u2212tis\n\n+2()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere Bis the width of the positive; beam where the target is crossing and W is the length\/width of the target. The beam width Bw is known, hence if one knows the velocity at which the target is moving the length\/width, of the target can be estimated from equation 2. In order to estimate the velocity v, we refer to . The signal from, the bottom PIR sensor starts raising as soon as the target touches its positive beam. Similarly, the signal for the top PIR sensor starts raising as soon as the target touches its positive beam as shown in . The distance Dbetween the two corresponding positive beams of the top and bottom PIR sensors can be determined from geometric principles. The time it takes the target to travel the distance Dis t\u2212t, where tand tare the times when the signals starts rising from quiescent, state for the bottom and top PIR sensors respectively as shown in . Hence, the speed at which the target is traveling can be estimated by\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0076"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"v","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["D","b"]},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"t","mn":"5"},{"mi":"t","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"}},"mo":"."}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"In order to determine whether the target is human or an animal, a preferred embodiment comprises an algorithm comprising the steps given below.
