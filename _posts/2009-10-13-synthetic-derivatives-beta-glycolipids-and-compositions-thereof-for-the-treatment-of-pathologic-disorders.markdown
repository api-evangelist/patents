No. 10\/675,980 filed on Sep. 30, 2003.","The invention relates to novel synthetic derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids and uses thereof as immunomodulators. More particularly, the invention provides the compounds of any one of Formula I, II III and IV or any mixture or combination thereof, as well as compositions and methods thereof for the treatment of immune-related disorders.","All publications mentioned throughout this application are fully incorporated herein by reference, including all references cited therein.","Immune therapy involves the exposure of components of the immune system to various elements (cytokines, disease associated antigens and natural metabolites) to combat disease processes in which a dysregulated immune response is thought to play a role. Immune dysregulation is thought to play a major part in the pathogenesis or disease course of a great number of disease processes, including various neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious and genetic entities.","These disorders can be perceived as a dysbalance between pro-inflammatory (Th1) and anti-inflammatory (Th2) cytokines, and few of them are described herein below.","Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a highly conserved subset of lymphocytes that can be broadly categorized into two groups [Brigl, M. and Brenner M. B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 22: 817-90 (2004)]. In mice, invariant NKT (iNKT; also referred to as classical or type I NKT) cells express a conserved invariant \u03b1\u03b2 T cell receptor (TCR), encoded by the V\u03b114 (V\u03b124 in humans) and J\u03b118 gene segments, paired with a set of V\u03b2 chains [Bendelac. A. et al. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 25:297-336 (2007)]. These cells are CD1d-dependent, reactive to \u03b1-Galctosyl-ceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), and are potent producers of both interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). Non-classical or type II NKT cells, which use variable TCRs, are distinct from type I NKT cells and have been identified in both humans and mice [Chiu, Y. H. et al. Nat. Immunol. 3:55-60 (2002); Godfrey, D. I. et al. Science, 306: 1687-9 (2004)]. Type II (non-classical) NKT cells, which may be either CD161-positive or negative, are also CD1d-dependent and potent IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 producers. However they have more diversely structured TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains and are not \u03b1-Gal-Cer reactive [Brigl, M. and Brenner M. B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 22: 817-90 (2004); Bendelac. A. et al. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 25:297-336 (2007)].","The CD1 glycoprotein family resembles classical peptide antigen presenting molecules except that the nonpolar, hydrophobic, antigen-binding groove has evolved to present lipid antigens [Brigl, M. and Brenner M. B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 22: 817-90 (2004)]. Antigens presented by CD1d and\/or the level at which they are presented can have profound effects on immune regulation of autoimmune, infectious, and malignant disorders [Brutkiewicz, R. R. J. Immunol. 177: 769-75 (2006); Brutkiewicz, R. R. et al. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 23: 403-19 (2003); Van Kaer, L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 19: 354-64 (2007)]. Abnormalities in the number and function of NKT cells have been observed in patients with autoimmune diseases and in a variety of mouse strains genetically predisposed for the development of autoimmune diseases [Miyake, S and Yamamura, T. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 5: 315-22 (2005)]. Targeting CD1d-mediated antigen presentation can serve as a novel approach for intervening in autoimmune diseases [Brutkiewicz, R. R. et al. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 23: 403-19 (2003); Singh, A. K. et al. J. Exp. Med. 194: 1801-11 (2001); Sandberg, J. K. and Ljunggren, H. G. Trends Immunol. 26: 347-9 (2005)].","Type I and type II NKT cells share some important characteristics. However, their distinct developmental and selection requirements indicate that they have distinct specificities [Godfrey, D. I. et al. Science, 306: 1687-9 (2004)]. As both type I and type II NKT cells are CD1d-dependent, any phenotype observed in CD1d-deficient mice might be due to a deficiency in type II NKT cells rather than type I NKT cells [Huber, S. et al. J. Immunol. 170: 3147-53 (2003); Exley, M. A. and Koziel, M. J. Hepatology, 40:1033-40 (2004); Dao, T. et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 34: 3542-52 (2004)], and the functional relationship between these two cell types is unclear. To this end, the combined use of TCR J\u03b118-deficient mice and CD1d-deficient mice is useful to distinguish between type I and type II NKT cells at the functional level in vivo. Although iNKT (invariant NKT) cells have been shown to be involved in autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and asthma as well as in the antitumor immune responses, not much is known about type II NKT cells.","NKT lymphocytes are influenced by a variety of self ligands and environmental stimuli, including disease target antigens, antigen presenting cells, co-stimulatory signals, soluble factors, and effector cells [Godfrey, D. I. and Kronenberg, M., J. Clin. Invest. 114: 1379-88 (2004); Smyth, M. J. et al. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 14:165-71 (2002)]. NKT cell functions are controlled by affinity thresholds for glycosphingolipid antigens that play an important role in cell activation. Activation and development of NKTs are guided by information provided by glycosphingolipid metabolic pathways [Hammond, K. J. and Godfrey, D. I. Tissue Antigens, 59: 353-63 (2002); Kronenberg, M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 23: 877-900 (2005)].","Currently, the only efficient method to selectively stimulate NKT cells in vivo is the sea sponge-derived agent \u03b1GalCer [Van Kaer, L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 5: 31-42 (2005)]. Tetrameric forms of CD1d molecules bound to \u03b1GalCer, which have sufficient affinity for the TCR of iNKT cells, allow for the detection of these cells by flow cytometry [Taniguchi, M. et al. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 21: 483-513 (2003); Bezbradica, J. S. et al. J. Immunol. 174: 4696-705 (2005)]. Administration of \u03b1GalCer results in potent activation of NKT cells, rapid and robust cytokine production, and further activation of a variety of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems [Van Kaer, L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 5: 31-42 (2005)]. Transient administration of \u03b1GalCer induces both IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion, while repeated administration favors production of Th2 cytokines [Miyake, S and Yamamura, T. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 5: 315-22 (2005); Yamamura, T. et al. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 4: 561-7 (2004)]. OCH, a sphingosine-truncated analog of \u03b1GalCer, was shown to be a potential therapeutic reagent for a variety of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases through its selective induction of Th2 cytokines from iNKT cells [Oki, S. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 113: 1631-40 (2004)].","Both rodent and human iNKT cells have been reported to recognize \u03b1GalCer in the context of CD1d. Therefore, activated iNKT cells play a pivotal role in modulating many aspects of the innate immune response within the liver during a diverse array of pathological processes [Ajuebor, M. N. and Swain, M. G. Immunology, 105: 137-43 (2002)]. However, \u03b1GalCer has been shown to be hepatotoxic in mice, which has limited its use in human testing [Osman, Y. et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 30: 1919-28 (2000); Biburger, M. and Tiegs, G. J. Immunol. 175: 1540-50 (2005)].","While the responses to antigen presentation can be complex, the process of antigen binding, presentation, and recognition by T cell receptors is fundamentally a series of molecular recognition events. In recent years, glycolipid presentation by CD1 proteins has emerged as an important aspect of antigen recognition [Brigl, M. and Brenner M. B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 22: 817-90 (2004)].","Several glycosphingolipids and phospholipids derived from mammalian, bacterial, protozoan, and plant species have been identified as possible natural ligands for NKT cells [Zajonc, D. M. et al. Nat. Immunol. 6: 810-8 (2005); Tsuji, M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 63: 1889-98 (2006)]. A semi-invariant \u03b1\u03b2TCR can recognize iGb3, a mammalian glycosphingolipid, as well as a microbial alpha-glycuronylceramide found in the cell wall of Gram-negative, lipopolysaccharide-negative bacteria [Zhou, D. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 7: 325-33 (2006)]. iGb3 has been suggested as a candidate recognized by NKT cells under pathophysiological conditions, such as cancer and autoimmune disease [Zhou, D. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 7: 325-33 (2006); Hansen, D. S. and Schofield, L. Int. J. Parasitol. 34: 15-25 (2004)]. However, the normal development and function of invariant NKT cells in mice with iGb3 deficiency has been described [Porubsky, S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104: 5977-82 (2007); Skold, M. and Behar, S. M. Infect. Immun. 71: 5447-55 (2003); Tupin, E. et al. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 5: 405-17 (2007); Stanic, A. K. et al. Immunology, 109: 171-84 (2003)].","Alpha-anomeric D-glycosylceramides are unknown in mammals. In contrast to current thinking, \u03b2-anomeric GalCer can induce CD1d-dependent biological activities in mice, albeit at lower potency than \u03b1-anomeric GalCer. \u03b2-anomeric glycolipids may provide a source of weakly reactive self antigens. Binding studies using CD1d tetramers loaded with \u03b1-GalCer (C12) demonstrated significant but lower intensity binding to NKT cells when compared with \u03b1-GalCer. Glucosylceramide (\u03b2-GC), a naturally occurring glycosphingolipid, is a metabolic intermediate in the anabolic and catabolic pathways of glycosphingolipids [Yang, Y. G. et al. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2: 323-9 (2005)]. Its synthesis from ceramide is catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase [Lalazar, G. et al. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 6: 1249-53 (2006)]. Inherited deficiency of glucosylceramidase (a lysosomal hydrolase) results in high serum levels of \u03b2-GC and Gaucher's disease. These patients have altered humoral and cellular immune profiles, and distorted NKT lymphocyte numbers and functions [Lalazar, G. et al. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 6: 1249-53 (2006)]. In vitro, CD1d-bound \u03b2-GC inhibits NKT cell activation by \u03b1GalCer [Ortaldo, J. R. et al. J. Immunol. 172: 943-53 (2004)]. Administration of \u03b2-D-GlcCer in vivo attenuated the NKT-mediated damage in concanavalin A (Con A) hepatitis, immune-mediated colitis, and animal models of diabetes [Yang, Y. G. et al. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2: 323-9 (2005); Margalit, M. et. al. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005); Zigmond, E. et al. Gut 56: 82-9 (2007); Margalit, M. et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 319: 105-10 (2006)].","iNKT cells are influenced by a variety of self ligands and environmental stimuli, including disease target antigens, antigen presenting cells, co-stimulatory signals, soluble factors, and effector cells [Godfrey, D. I. and Kronenberg, M., J. Clin. Invest. 114: 1379-88 (2004); Smith, P. A. et al. AIHA J. (Fairfax, Va.) 63: 284-92 (2002)]. iNKT cell functions are controlled by affinity thresholds for glycosphingolipid antigens that play an important role in cell activation [Stanic, A. K. et al. J. Immunol. 171: 4539-51 (2003)]. However, cellular interactions among NKT cell subsets and their potential role in the regulation of an iNKT cell mediated disease have not been previously investigated.","Abnormalities in the number and function of NKT cells have been observed in patients with autoimmune diseases and in a variety of mouse strains genetically predisposed to the development of autoimmune diseases [Miyake, S. and Yamamura, Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 314: 251-67 (2007)]. Targeting CD1d-mediated antigen presentation can thus serve as a novel approach for intervening in autoimmune diseases [Brutkiewicz, R. R. J. Immunol. 177: 769-75 (2006); Sandberg, J. K. and Ljunggren, H. G. Trends Immunol. 26: 347-9 (2005)].","The Con A model is a widely utilized mouse model that mimics many aspects of human autoimmune hepatitis. It induces massive liver necrosis in mice simultaneously with lymphocyte infiltration in the liver, high levels of apoptotic hepatocytes, and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The liver injury was confirmed to be NKT cell-mediated [Tiegs, G. Z. Gastroenterol. 45: 63-70 (2007)]. iNKT cells have recently been shown to play a key role in the development of Con A-induced hepatitis: both J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice that lack iNKT cells are relatively resistant to Con A-induced hepatic injury [Kaneko, Y. et al. J. Exp. Med. 191: 105-14 (2000); Takeda, K. and Okumura, K. Hum. Cell, 14: 159-63 (2001)]. Signaling through the Janus kinase\/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK\/STAT) pathway is an important signal pathway that is activated immediately after cytokine stimulation [Darnell, J. E. Jr. et al. Science, 264: 1415-21 (1994)]. Con A-induced hepatitis is largely dependent on interferon IFN-\u03b3\/STAT1, as IFN-\u03b3 and STAT1-deficient mice are resistant to Con A-induced hepatitis. On the other hand, IL-6 and cytokines that activate STAT3 protect mice against liver damage.","There is therefore a need to provide safe and effective glycolipid analogs for use as immunomodulators. Such novel analogs may preferably modulate activity of iNKT cells and different signal transductions pathways and thereby alleviate immune-related disorders.","The present invention thus describes the synthesis non-natural different analogs of \u03b2-GC. One of these analogs, ALIB-97 is characterized by a bulky acyl-residue and by a thiourea bond. Because Con A-induced liver damage is mediated by iNKT cells, the inventors used this model of liver disease to examine the newly synthesized \u03b2-glycosphingolipid analogs of the invention. The invention demonstrates that orally administered ALIB-97 is a potent ligand that is effective in alleviating NKT cell-mediated liver damage in Con A-induced hepatitis. This effect was mediated by altered STAT protein expression and suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The effect noted for ALIB-97 was superior to that of the natural glycosphingolipids and comparable to that of dexamethasone.","The inventors have further investigated the potential effect of the novel analogs of the invention on other immune-related disorders using the ob\/ob mice that serve as a model for metabolic syndrome and NASH.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a substantial public health concern as it may progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and end stage liver disease [Matteoni, C. A. et al. Gastroenterology, 116: 1413-9 (1999)]. It is commonly associated with clinical features of the metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia. Insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH. The two-hit model, suggesting an initial lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes, followed by a second hit, was suggested for the development of liver injury.","c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and regulates several cellular responses including differentiation, proliferation, migration, immune reaction, and cell death in response to a diverse range of stimuli [Kodama, Y. and Brenner, D. A. Hepatology, 49: 6-8 (2009)]. Three different genes for JNKs, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3, are known. JNK3 expression is largely restricted to brain, heart and testis whereas JNK1 and 2 are expressed ubiquitously [Davis, 2000]. Recent studies have suggested that activation of JNK plays a central role in the development of obesity, insulin resistance and steatohepatitis [Hirosumi, 2002; Tuncman, 2006; Schattenberg, 2006]. Recent studies have demonstrated that JNK1 and JNK2 differ in function [Singh, R. et al. Hepatology, 49: 87-96 (2009)] [Schattenberg, 2006]. Both isoforms were found to mediate insulin resistance in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, but distinct effects were found for steatohepatitis. Activation of JNK1 was shown to promote the development of steatohepatitis in the murine methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet [Schattenberg, 2006]. Knockdown of JNK2 improved insulin sensitivity but had no effect on hepatic steatosis and markedly increased liver injury [Singh, R. et al. Hepatology, 49: 87-96 (2009)]. The differential effect of JNK2 knockdown, which is effective on insulin resistance but not on hepatic steatosis, highlights that hepatic steatosis, is more than a mere consequence of insulin resistance. JNK1 might have a direct effect on hepatic lipogenesis that is independent of insulin resistance. The distinct roles for JNK1 and JNK2 in hepatocyte death are still controversial. JNK1 phosphorylates and activates Itch, which induces ubiquitination\/degradation of c-FLIP (cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein) and subsequent caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, whereas JNK2 may activate caspase-8 more directly [Chang, 2006; Wang, 2006]. Activation of JNK1\/2 seems to be involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced insulin resistance, causing phosphorylation of IRS1 at the Ser312 residue. JNK2 (\u2212\/\u2212) mice fed a HFD are obese and insulin-resistant, similar to wild-type mice, and have increased liver injury [Singh, R. et al. Hepatology, 49: 87-96 (2009)]. This suggests that JNK1 promotes steatosis and hepatitis, whereas JNK2 inhibits hepatocytes' death by blocking the mitochondrial death pathway.","One of the major pathways that are activated by insulin is the Akt (or PKB) pathway which mediates the effects of insulin on glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, lipogenesis and suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Akt is activated by phospholipid binding and activation loop phosphorylation at Thr308 by PDK1 [Lawlor, 2001]. Akt-2 (PKB\u03b2) is highly expressed in insulin-responsive tissues such as adipose tissue [Walker, 1998]. Exciting new data establishes Akt-2 as an essential gene for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis [Cho, 2001]. Mice deficient in Akt-2 display many of the typical features of Type II diabetes mellitus in humans, namely hyperglycemia, elevated blood insulin levels, and insulin resistance in the liver and to a minor extent muscle.","Insulin resistance is characterized by a complex interaction of genetic determinants, lifestyle, ageing and nutritional factors. Visceral obesity is regarded as the major cause of insulin resistance. Visceral obesity has also been defined as an important component of the metabolic syndrome, and increased visceral fat mass contributes to the development of obesity-related disorders such as insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, diabetes and CVD [de Luca, 2008]. Chronic systemic inflammation has been proposed to have an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance [Bastard, 2006]. There is strong evidence that adipose tissue not only releases FFA that contributes to insulin resistance in liver and muscle, but also produces a wide range of inflammatory molecules including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 which may have local effects on adipose physiology and also systemic effects on other tissues. Some factors such as leptin, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and resistin are overproduced during obesity, and conversely the plasma levels of adiponectin are reduced during obesity. Both adipose tissue and the liver have an architectural organization in which metabolic cells (adipocytes or hepatocytes) are in close proximity to immune cells (Kupffer cells or macrophages), forming a suitable environment for continuous and dynamic interactions between immune and metabolic responses in both tissues [Hotamisligil, G. S. Nature, 444: 860-7 (2006)]. TNF-\u03b1 is overexpressed in the adipose tissue of obese mice supporting a link between obesity, diabetes and chronic inflammation [Hotamisligil, G. S. et al. Science, 259: 87-91 (1993)]. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the site of energy storage and is composed of many cell types, adipocytes being the most abundant. Other cell types present in WAT are included in the stromal-vascular fraction, of which approximately 10% are CD14+CD31+ macrophages [Curat, C. A. et al. Diabetes, 53: 1285-92 (2004)]. The number of macrophages present in WAT is directly correlated with adiposity and with adipocyte size in both human subjects and mice [Curat, C. A. et al. Diabetes, 53: 1285-92 (2004); Weisberg, S. P. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 112: 1796-808 (2003); Xu, H. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 112: 1821-30 (2003)]. Adipocytes secrete a variety of protein signals as well as cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10. About one third of the IL-6 level in the peripheral circulation originates from adipose tissue [Fernandez-Real, J. M. and Ricart, W. Endocr. Rev. 24: 278-301 (2003)]. With increasing obesity, the contribution of IL-6 from the adipose tissue increases [Trayhurn, P. et al. C. J. Nutr. 136: 1935S-1939S (2006); Kershaw, E. E. and Flier, J. S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 89: 2548-56 (2004)]. Additionally, anatomically, visceral abdominal fat is venouslt drained in a portal system to the liver, thus further consolidating the effect of WAT inflammatory processes on hepatic function.","Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are fundamental in controlling various immune responses. The CD4+ regulatory T cells have been categorized into two major subgroups based on their ontogeny: The naturally occurring forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells referred as Treg cells and the inducible regulatory T cells, which are generated in the periphery under various tolerogenic conditions [Shevach, E. M. Immunity, 25: 195-201 (2006)].","Both \u03b1 and \u03b2 glycosphingolipids have an immune modulatory role and can alter the induction and distribution of Tregs, affecting immune-system dependent disorders [Araki, M. et al. Curr. Med. Chem. 15: 2337-45 (2008); Lalazar, G. et al. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 6: 1249-53 (2006); Van Kaer, L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 5: 31-42 (2005)]. This effect is dependent on dendritic cells (DCs) and\/or alteration of NKT cells palstiticity [Ilan, Y. et al. Transplantation, 83: 458-67 (2007); Margalit, M. et al. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005); Zigmond, E. et al. Gut, 56: 82-9 (2007); Onoe, K. et al. Immunol. Res. 38: 319-32 (2007)]. Beta-glycolipids were shown to alleviate the metabolic syndrome in animal models and humans [Margalit, M. et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 319: 105-10 (2006); Zigmond, E. et al. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 296: E72-8 (2009); Zigmond, E. et al. Hepatology, 44: 180A (2006)].","The present invention demonstrates the beneficial effect of the novel analogs using this model and thereby the applicability of these novel compounds as immuno-modulating agents. More specifically, the results presented by the invention shed light on a cross talk between the immune system, especially in the adipose tissue and JNK signaling pathway. The data suggest new potential therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and NASH. Adipose tissue-specific CD4+ T regulatory cells are suggested as central players in the interplay between the immune system and the pancreas. They may exert their effect by secreting cytokines or by enhancing chemokines, including adipokine secretion from cells in the relevant microenvironment. Ligands such as the novel analogs of the invention and specifically, ALIB-97, via their oral effect on the induction of CD4+ T regulatory cells may serve as novel approach for the alleviation of insulin resistance and for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and NASH.","Thus, the present invention now provides novel synthetic derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids, and particularly of the compounds of Formulas I, II, III and IV, and demonstrates uses thereof in the treatment of pathologic disorders.","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide novel synthetic derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids, as well as compositions thereof and methods for treating pathologic disorders such as immune-related disorders and neurodegenerative disorders.","These and other objects of the invention will become clearer as the description proceeds.","In a first aspect, the invention relates to synthetic derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids, more particularly, the invention relates to a compound of Formula I, or isomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, Formula I being:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"16.26mm","wi":"53.17mm","file":"US08592394-20131126-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein","A represents alkenylene or alkylene bivalent radical selected from \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014 and \u2014CH(OH)\u2014CH\u2014;","D represents a bivalent radical selected from \u2014CSNH\u2014, \u2014CONH\u2014, \u2014CS\u2014, and \u2014SO\u2014;","E represents a glycosyl radical selected from glucosyl, galactosyl, sulfated galactosyl, manosyl, and lactosyl;","Ris a linear C-alkyl; and","Ris a univalent radical selected from linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl chains optionally substituted with hydroxyl, adamantanyl, and norbornenyl.

Thus, according to one specific embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic composition comprising the compound of Formula II (ALIB-97) and any mixtures and combinations thereof.","Obesity and its associated metabolic syndromes represent a growing global challenge, yet mechanistic understanding of this pathology and current therapeutics are unsatisfactory. The present invention show that induction of CD4+ T regulatory cells resident in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), can control insulin resistance in leptin deficient mice and lead to decrease in activation of JNK2. Analyses of human tissue suggest that a similar process may also occur in humans. Recently, it has been reported that in obese WT and ob\/ob (leptin deficient) mice, brief treatment with CD3-specific antibody or its F(ab)2 fragment, reduces the predominance of Th1 cells over Foxp3+ cells, reversing insulin resistance for months, despite continuation of a high-fat diet [Winer, 2009]. In that study Winer and colleagues suggest that the progression of obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities is under the pathophysiological control of CD4+ T cells.","Example 4 shows that induction of CD4+ T regulatory cells in adipose tissue and in the adipose tissue-associated stromal vasculature by the novel \u03b2-glycolipid analog of the invention is associated with the activation of JNK2 and alleviation of insulin resistance and hepatic injury. The data of the present invention supports an active role for the adipose tissue and inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. In general, expansion of CD4+ T regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) was associated with alleviation of the metabolic syndrome in terms of gluconeogenesis (reduced fasting glucose), insulin resistance (reduced postprandial glucose levels), reduced hepatic injury (AST and ALT serum levels), Tregs levels and increased JNK2 and AKT activation.","Thus, according to one embodiment, the therapeutic composition of the invention may lead to at least one of a decrease in the serum levels of triglycerides, ALT, AST and Glucose and to reduction or alleviation of insulin resistance or increase in insulin sensitivity in a subject suffering of an immune-related disorder. Wherein indicated decease, reduction, inhibition, it is meant that the composition of the invention leads to a reduction of about 5% to 99% of the serum level of any one of triglycerides, ALT, AST and Glucose, of a subject suffering of an-immune-related disorder. More specifically, such reduction may be a reduction of about, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and over 99%, as compared to the levels prior to the treatment, or the levels of untreated control. Wherein indicated increase, elevation, alleviation, enhancement, induction, it is meant that the composition of the invention leads to induction, or increase of about 5% to 99% of the sensitivity to insulin in a subject suffering of an-immune-related disorder. More specifically, such increase may be an increase of about, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and over 99%, as compared to the levels prior to the treatment, or the levels of untreated control.","Moreover, obesity is also associated with numerous inflammatory conditions. Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, obesity-associated rises in TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 are believed to contribute to occurrence of sad disorder. The present invention demonstrates that obesity selectively promotes an expansion of the Th17 T-cell sublineage, a subset with prominent pro-inflammatory roles. T-cells from \u03b2-glycolipid fed obese mice decrease Th17 cell pools. An increased Th17 bias was suggested to be associated with more pronounced autoimmune disease as confirmed in EAE and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid colitis. In both, diet-induced obese mice developed more severe early disease and histopathology with increased IL-17+ T-cell pools in target tissues. The well-described association of obesity with inflammatory and autoimmune disease is mechanistically linked to a Th17 bias.","As shown by Example 4, \u03b2-glycolipid administration resulted in ratio reversal and a shift towards immune tolerance in an organ specific, dose dependent manner. This underscores the adipose tissue as a dynamic organ, and proposes a new possible mechanism for the second hit in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and associated insulin resistance and liver injury. Furthermore, it offers a new treatment modality for these conditions, which has been demonstrated effective in oral administration. The role of CD8+ regulatory T cells which has also been affected by glycolipid administration is still unclear and requires further investigation. The fact that TGF-\u03b2 levels were unaffected by \u03b2-glycolipid administration suggest that the effect was mediated by naturally occurring Tregs, and not the inducible type.","JNK play a role in both systemic and hepatic insulin resistance by serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and IRS2. This leads to down modulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of these molecules that is required for normal insulin signaling. Both isoforms of JNK play a role in the pathogenesis of NASH [Kaneto, H. et al. Curr. Diabetes Rev. 1: 65-72 (2005); Liu, G. and Rondinone, C. M. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs, 6: 979-87 (2005); Malhi, H and Gores, G. J. Semin. Liver Dis. 28: 360-9 (2008)]. Ablation of JNK1 but not JNK2 improves hepatic steatosis. However, JNK2 ablation exacerbate liver injury [Singh, R. et al. Hepatology, 49: 87-96 (2009)]. It was suggested that JNK1 might have a direct effect on hepatic lipogenesis that is independent of insulin resistance. The data presented by the invention supports the protective role of JNK2 in the setting of insulin resistance. JNK2 plays a cytoprotective role by inhibiting Bim-dependent apoptosis via phosphorylation and degradation of Bim [Singh, R. et al. Hepatology, 49: 87-96 (2009)]. The inventors have explored the possibility that the induction of CD4+ T regulatory cells in the adipose tissue is associated with the JNK pathway. As shown by Example 4, the novel analog of the invention, ALIB-97, enhanced JNK2 expression. It has been previously shown that systemic insulin resistance at the level of the adipocytes enhances the flux of free fatty acids to the liver. Hyperinsulinemia was also shown as causing de novo lipogenesis [Kodama, Y. and Brenner, D. A. Hepatology, 49: 6-8 (2009)]. Moreover, obesity, FFA, oxidative stress and ER stress were shown as mediating insulin resistance by modulating different JNK pathways [Kodama, Y. and Brenner, D. A. Hepatology, 49: 6-8 (2009); Kaneto, H. et al. Curr. Diabetes Rev. 1: 65-72 (2005); Liu, G. and Rondinone, C. M. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs, 6: 979-87 (2005); Malhi, H and Gores, G. J. Semin. Liver Dis. 28: 360-9 (2008)]. Therefore, the observed enhancement of the JNK2 pathways by the novel analog of the invention ALIB-97 may be applicable in ameliorating insulin resistance.","Thus, according to another embodiment, the composition of the invention may lead to activation of JNK2 pathway and thereby modulation of at least one of adipose and stromal tissue derived Tregs (T regulatory cells) and alleviation of insulin resistance.","As shown by Example 4, such therapeutic composition may be particularly useful in treating an immune-related disorder such as Metabolic Syndrome or any of the conditions comprising the same, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).","More specifically, according to one embodiment, the composition of the invention may be applicable for treating a subject suffering of a metabolic syndrome or any of the conditions comprising the same.","The Metabolic Syndrome is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors in one person including:","*Abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen); *Atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders\u2014high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol\u2014that foster plaque buildups in artery walls); *Elevated blood pressure; *Insulin resistance or glucose intolerance; *Prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the blood); and *Proinflammatory state (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in the blood). People with the metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of coronary heart disease and other diseases related to plaque buildups in artery walls (e.g., stroke and peripheral vascular disease) and type 2 diabetes.","More particularly, the therapeutic composition of the invention is intended for the treatment of dyslipoproteinemia, which may include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and low HDL-cholesterol, obesity, NIDDM (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), IGT (impaired glucose tolerance), blood coagulability, blood fibronolysis defects and hypertension.","According to another embodiment, the immunomodulatory composition of the invention may be used for treating diabetes, particularly, type 2 diabetes. Diabetes mellitus, often simply diabetes, is a syndrome characterized by disordered metabolism and inappropriately high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) resulting from either low levels of the hormone insulin or from abnormal resistance to insulin's effects coupled with inadequate levels of insulin secretion to compensate. The characteristic symptoms are excessive urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst and increased fluid intake (polydipsia), and blurred vision. These symptoms are likely absent if the blood sugar is only mildly elevated.","The World Health Organization recognizes three main forms of diabetes mellitus: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes (occurring during pregnancy), which have different causes and population distributions. While, ultimately, all forms are due to the beta cells of the pancreas being unable to produce sufficient insulin to prevent hyperglycemia, the causes are different. Type 1 diabetes is usually due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance in target tissues, this causes a need for abnormally high amounts of insulin and diabetes develops when the beta cells cannot meet this demand. Gestational diabetes is similar to type 2 diabetes in that it involves insulin resistance, hormones in pregnancy may cause insulin resistance in women genetically predisposed to developing this condition.","Acute complication of diabetes (hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma) may occur if the disease is not adequately controlled. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease (doubled risk), chronic renal failure, retinal damage (which can lead to blindness), nerve damage (of several kinds), and microvascular damage, which may cause impotence and poor healing. Poor healing of wounds, particularly of the feet, can lead to gangrene, which may require amputation.","According to another embodiment, the immunomodulatory composition of the invention may be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of this beta cell loss is a T-cell mediated autoimmune attack.","According to another embodiment, the immunomodulatory composition of the invention may be used for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a clinico-pathological entity consisting of hepatic fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis in patients who have no history of alcohol consumption. It may progress to cirrhosis in 20% of cases and is considered the most common cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis in the Western world. NASH is common in patients who suffer of other metabolic disturbances, which are suggested to play a contributing role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. These include insulin resistance, obesity-related ATP depletion, increased free-fatty-acid beta peroxidation, iron accumulation, antioxidant depletion, and leptin deficiency.","NKT cells are known mediators of the immune-mediated liver injury in the ConA induced hepatitis model [Margalit, M. et. al. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005)]. Con A, when directly injected into mice, induces T cell-mediated liver injury by activating innate immune cells, including NKT cells [Miyagi, T. et al. Hepatology, 40: 1190-6 (2004)]. Con A injection stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production by liver NKT cells [Miyagi, T. et al. Hepatology, 40: 1190-6 (2004)]. Administration of the natural beta glycosphingolipids, GC, ameliorates Con A hepatitis by exerting an inhibitory effect on NKT lymphocytes [Margalit, M. et. al. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005)]. Beta-glycosphingolipids can overcome the unfavorable host milieu in the setting of Con A hepatitis by suppressing NKT-mediated liver injury [Zigmond, E. et al. Gut 56: 82-9 (2007)]. The data obtained in the present invention show that oral administration of ALIB-97, while decreasing NKT cells in the liver, increases the number of NKT cells in the spleen. In contrast, intraperitoneal administration of ALIB-97 reduced NKT cell number in both organs, suggesting the importance of the first pass effect of ALIB-97 for its immunomodulatory effect in this setting.","As shown by Example 3, the effect of ALIB-97 was mediated by reduced STAT1 and STAT4 phosphorylation. Activation of STAT1 proteins is known to be associated with enhanced liver damage in the Con A model [Torisu, T. et al. Hepatology, 47: 1644-54 (2008)]. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1), which is a negative-feedback molecule in cytokine signaling, has been shown to be rapidly induced during liver injury. STAT1 activation is enhanced in SOCS1-deficient livers [Torisu, T. et al. Hepatology, 47: 1644-54 (2008)]. Oral administration of ALIB-97 increased STAT6 expression in the liver. STAT6 is rapidly activated in Con A-induced hepatitis [Jaruga, B. et al. J. Immunol. 171: 3233-44 (2003)]. Although disruption of the IL-4 and STAT6 genes by way of genetic knockout was shown to abolish Con A-mediated liver injury [Margalit, M. et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 319: 105-10 (2006)], the data presented by the invention suggest that the NKT-dependent liver damage is not dependent solely on this pathway.","As shown by the invention, the effect of ALIB-97 on STAT proteins led to suppression of the cytokine efflux, which is one of the hallmarks of Con A hepatitis [Nicoletti, F. et al. Hepatology, 32: 728-33 (2000); Nicoletti, F. et al. Cytokine, 12: 315-23 (2000)]. Serum levels of both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 were decreased. ALIB-97 had a much stronger effect on IFN-\u03b3 suppression as compared with the natural GC, and was similar to that of a high dose of dexamethasone. The effects of ALIB-97 on NKT cells, STAT proteins, and cytokines led to alleviation of immune-mediated hepatitis, as evidenced by a decrease in apoptosis and liver enzymes.","Using the ConA induced hepatitis model, the invention show that the composition of the invention may lead to a decrease in the serum level of at least one of IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and an increase in the serum level of at least one of IL-10 and IL-4, in a subject suffering from an immune-related disorder. Thus, according to certain embodiments, the immunomodulatory composition of the invention leads to a decrease or reduction in the amount or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Such decrease or reduction according to the invention may be a reduction of about 5% to 99%, specifically, a reduction of about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99% as compared to untreated control. In yet another specific embodiment, the composition of the invention elevates and increases the amount or expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4. More specifically, the increase, induction or elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines may be an increase of about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99% as compared to untreated control.","To determine the mechanism of the effects of ALIB-97, the inventors examined its effect in CD1d KO and J\u03b118 KO mice. Both type I (classical) and type-II (non-classical) NKT cells are CD1d-dependent and are potent producers of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 [Smith, P. A. et al. AIHA J. (Fairfax, Va.) 63: 284-92 (2002)]. CD1d KO mice lack both type I and type II NKT cells. The combined use of J\u03b118-deficient and CD1d-deficient mice enabled the inventor to distinguish between type I and type II NKT cells at the functional level in vivo. The data presented in Example 3 show that the protective effect of ALIB-97 in Con A hepatitis is lost in CD1d KO mice, for which administration of ALIB-97 did not significantly alter ALT and AST liver enzymes. Furthermore, ALIB-97 did not alter STAT4 expression in these mice. Finally, ALIB-97 increased IL-10 levels and did not significantly alter the secretion of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 in CD1d KO mice.","Type I NKT cells possess a TCR with a characteristic a chain, V\u03b114-J\u03b118, whereas NKT cells have a diverse TCR. Thus, J\u03b118 KO mice lack type I NKT cells, but not NKT type II [Oh, S. J. et al. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 28: 249-67 (2008); Tessmer, M. S. et al. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets, 13: 153-62 (2009); Uemura, Y. et al. Int. Immunol. 20: 405-12 (2008)]. Administration of ALIB-97 to J\u03b118 KO mice exacerbated the liver damage induced by Con A treatment. In J\u03b118 KO mice, ALIB-97 increased IL-10 and decreased IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 levels. Taken together the data of the present invention imply that the effect of ALIB-97 depends mostly on type I NKT cells.","V\u03b114 NKT cells are required and are sufficient for the induction of Con A hepatitis [Kaneko, Y. et al. J. Exp. Med. 191: 105-14 (2000)]. IL-4 produced by Con A-activated V\u03b114 NKT cells plays a crucial role in disease development by augmenting the cytotoxic activity of V\u03b114 NKT cells in an autocrine fashion [Kaneko, Y. et al. J. Exp. Med. 191: 105-14 (2000)]. In the Con A model, activation of sulfatide-reactive type II NKT cells is associated with IL-12 and MIP-2 dependent recruitment of type I invariant NKT (iNKT) cells into mouse livers [Halder, R. C. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 117: 2302-12 (2007)]. Recruited iNKT cells are anergic and prevent hepatitis by blocking effector pathways, including the cytokine burst and neutrophil recruitment [Halder, R. C. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 117: 2302-12 (2007)].","Alteration of the NKT ligand structure is an attractive approach for the determination of NKT-dependent immune modulation [Hammond, K. J. and Kronenberg, M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 15: 683-9 (2003); Wilson, M. T. and Van Kaer, L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 9: 201-20 (2003)]. Both the length of the ligand chain and its saturation determines its function on NKT cells [Tomura, M. et al. J. Immunol. 163: 93-101 (1999); Yu, K. O. et al. J. Immunol. Methods, 323: 11-23 (2007); Yu, K. O. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102: 3383-8 (2005)].","As demonstrated by Example 3, the ALIB-97 analog of the invention suppresses type I NK T cells and STAT4 expression. Therefore, according to certain embodiments, the therapeutic composition of the invention suppress type I NK T cells and thereby may be used for treating an immune mediated hepatitis.","In yet another embodiment, the immunomodulatory composition of the invention may be used for the treatment of an autoimmune disorder. Examples of autoimmune disorders include, but are not limited to, Alopecia Areata, Lupus, Anlcylosing Spondylitis, Meniere's Disease, Antiphospholipid Syndrome, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, Autoimmune Addison's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, Myasthenia Gravis, Autoimmune Hepatitis, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Behcet's Disease, Pernicious Anemia, Bullous Pemphigoid, Polyarthritis Nodosa, Cardiomyopathy, Polychondritis, Celiac Sprue-Dermatitis, Polyglandular Syndromes, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFIDS), Polymyalgia Rheumatica, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating, Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis, Chronic Inflammatory Polyneuropathy, Primary Agammaglobulinemia, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Psoriasis, CREST Syndrome, Raynaud's Phenomenon, Cold Agglutinin Disease, Reiter's Syndrome, Crohn's Disease, Rheumatic Fever, Discoid Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Essential Mixed, Cryoglobulinemia Sarcoidosis, Fibromyalgia, Scleroderma, Grave's Disease, Sjogren's Syndrome, Guillain-Barre, Stiff-Man Syndrome, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Takayasu Arteritis, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Temporal Arteritis\/Giant Cell Arteritis, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP), Ulcerative Colitis, IgA Nephropathy, Uveitis, Insulin Dependent Diabetes (Type I), Vasculitis, Lichen Planus, and Vitiligo. The compositions described herein can be administered to a subject to treat or prevent disorders associated with an abnormal or unwanted immune response associated with cell, tissue or organ transplantation, e.g., renal, hepatic, and cardiac transplantation, e.g., graft versus host disease (GVHD), or to prevent allograft rejection.","As shown by Example 4, the novel ALIB-97 analog of the invention activates AKT. Recently, there is an increasing interest in generating drugs that can activate Akt (PKB), which could potentially be used to trigger insulin dependent processes for the treatment of diabetes. These compounds could also be used to promote survival and inhibit apoptosis of neuronal cells following a stroke.","Thus, in yet another embodiment, the compositions of the invention may be particularly suitable for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disorder such as a protein misfolding disorder, an amyloid disease, a CNS autoimmune disease, taupathy or a prion disease. More particularly, said neurodegenerative disorder may be any one of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, fronto temporal dementia, cortico-basal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Spongiform encephalopathies, Scrapie, mad cow disease and Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Fatal Familial Insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and Kuru.","According to certain embodiments, the therapeutic and the immunomodulatory compositions of the invention may be capable of modulating the Th1\/Th2, Th3 cell balance towards a pro-inflammatory Th1 response in a subject suffering of an immune-related disorder.

More particularly, such tumors may be carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, leukemia and lymphoma. Even more particularly, said solid and non-solid tumors may be any one of hepaotcellular carcinoma, melanoma, colon cancer, myeloma, acute and chronic leukemia.","As shown by Examples, the novel analogs of the invention, specifically, ALIB-97 exhibit a clear immuno-modulatory effect on immune-related cell, specifically, adipose and stromal derived T regulatory cells. More particularly, the novel derivatives of the invention and specifically ALIB-97, demonstrate immuno-modulation, specifically, anti-inflammatory effect on immune-related cells such as specific T regulatory cells for example, CD4+LAP+, adipocytes and Antigen Presenting Cells (APC), such as DC. Therefore, according to one embodiment, the composition of the invention may be used for inducing at least one of T regulatory (Treg) cells, or any cell having regulatory properties, either suppressive or inductive, adipocyte and Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) in a subject suffering from an immune-related disorder. More specifically, immune-related cells induced by the composition of the invention may be any T regulatory cell, for example any one of CD4+LAP+ T-reg cells, CD4+CD25 T-reg cells, CD8+CD25 T-reg cells and FoxP3+CD4 T-reg cells.","As demonstrated by Example 3, the clear inducing effect of the composition of the invention on a specific population of Treg. cells may enable the isolation and use of these cell for adoptive transfer. Thus, according to another embodiment, the invention further provides a composition comprising immune-cells, specifically, Tregs. It is understood that one of skill in the art will recognize that other immune-related cells may be useful in the invention. An immune-related cell may be an APC (such as DC), Treg cell or any other cell associated directly or indirectly with the immune system including but not limited to platelets, macrophages, any type of B cell, T cell (including double negative cells), and any type of non-professional antigen presenting cell, adipocytes, endothelial cell, any type of cell that is part of an organ, specifically, an organ connected to the treated immune-related disorder and any type of cell having regulatory enhancing or suppressing properties.","According to a more specific embodiment, the therapeutic and the immunomodulatory compositions of the invention may further comprises at least one component of said subject's immune-system which was pre-exposed to an effective amount of any one of the compounds of said Formula I, II, III or IV, or to any mixture or any combination thereof.

According to this embodiment, such educated NK T cells are capable of modulating the Th1\/Th2 cell balance toward an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory response. More particularly, such educated NK T cells may be, prior to their administration to the treated subject, cultured or \u201ceducated\u201d in the presence of any one of: (a) at least one of the compounds of Formula I, II, III, IV or a mixture of at least two compounds of Formula I, II, III, IV or any combination thereof; (b) combination of (a) with antigens associated with the treated pathologic disorder; (c) combination of (a) with at least one of liver-associated cells of tolerized or non-tolerized subject suffering from said pathologic disorder or of said subject; (d) combination of (a) with at least one of cytokines, adhesion molecules and any combination thereof; (e) combination of (a) with antigen presenting cells; and (f) a combination of any of (b), (c), (d) and (e).","According to one preferred embodiment, said education of NK T cells may result in the modulation of the Th1\/Th2 cell balance toward Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokine producing cells.

This can be carried out by a process that has been termed adoptive transfer. The particular educated NK T cells used for the transfer may preferably originate from the subject (autologous transfer). A syngeneic or non-syngeneic donor (non-autologous transfer) is not excluded. The storage, growth or expansion of the transferred cells may have taken place in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro.","Cell therapy may be by injection, e.g., intravenously, or by any of the means described herein above. Neither the time nor the mode of administration is a limitation on the present invention. Cell therapy regimens may be readily adjusted taking into account such factors as the possible cytotoxicity of the educated cells, the stage of the disease and the condition of the patient, among other considerations known to those of skill in the art.","It is to be appreciated that the NK T cells used by the compositions of the invention may be educated in vivo as well, via any of the methods described above, they can be modulated prior to or at any point of time following exposure to the synthetic derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids as defined by the invention, antigens or any other component described.","According to another preferred embodiment, said education of NK T cells may result in the modulation of the Th1\/Th2 cell balance toward Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokine producing cells.

The disorders cause degenerative diseases of the nervous system reflected by impairment of brain function, including memory changes, personality changes, and problems with movement that worsen over time. Probably most mammalian species develop these diseases. The infectious agent causing the diseases has been called a prion. A \u201cprion\u201d has been defined as a small proteinaceous infectious particle which resists inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids.

Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. In general, dosage is calculated according to body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the composition of the invention in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the composition of the invention is administered in maintenance doses, once or more daily.","According to another embodiment, the synthetic \u03b2-glycolipid derivatives of the invention, particularly, the compounds of Formula I, II, III, or IV, used by the methods of the invention or any mixture or combination thereof may administered alone, or in combination with other active ingredient\/s that improve the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously.","The methods of the invention involve administration of effective amount of the active ingredient to a subject in need thereof.

Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005); Zigmond, E. et al. Gut 56: 82-9 (2007); Ilan, Y. et al. Transplantation, 83: 458-67 (2007); Lalazar, G. et al. J. Lipid Res. 49: 1884-93 (2008); Lalazar, G. et al. Mol. Immunol. 45: 3517-25 (2008); Livovsky, D. M. et al. Int. Immunopharmacol. 8: 1298-305 (2008); Mizrahi, M. et al. Vaccine, 26: 2589-95 (2008)]. GC was previously shown to alleviate the NKT-mediated damage in Con A hepatitis [Margalit, M. et. al. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005)]. In contrast to \u03b1GalCer, oral administration of \u03b2-glucosylceramide is not associated with liver injury in mice [Margalit, M. et. al. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 289: G917-25 (2005); Zigmond, E. et al. Hepatology, 44: 180A (2006)]. Preliminary data suggest that GC is safe and biologically active in humans [Zigmond, E. et al. Hepatology, 44: 180A (2006)]. The present invention shows that ALIB-97 was more potent in alleviating the liver damage in comparison to the natural glycolipid GC. The effect of oral administration of ALIB-97 was comparable to that of dexamethasone, further supporting its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory ligand.","ALIB-97 is characterized by a bulky acyl chain that may affect the cross talk between dendritic cells, NKT cells, and regulatory T cells; this crosstalk may explain its enhanced immune modulatory effect. The bulky residue may be associated with more potent receptor binding, thereby increasing its biological activity. Beta-glycosphingolipids have been shown to alter the lipid rafts in lymphocyte membranes, and thus the intracellular signaling machinery of NKT cells [Lalazar, G. et al. J. Lipid Res. 49: 1884-93 (2008); Lalazar, G. et al. Mol. Immunol. 45: 3517-25 (2008)]. The alteration in the expression levels of flotillin-2, Lck, and STAT1 that occurs concomitantly with changes in lipid raft composition and structure following administration of beta-glycolipids in Con A-induced hepatitis is microenvironment-dependent and is associated with decreased intrahepatic CD8+ lymphocyte liver trapping [Lalazar, G. et al. Mol. Immunol. 45: 3517-25 (2008)]. The demonstration of altered red blood cell (RBC) aggregation in patients with Gaucher's disease, wherein GC is accumulated, lends further support to the concept of cell membrane alteration by glycosphingolipids [Adar, T. et al. Br. J. Haematol. 134: 432-7 (2006); Adar, T. et al. Clin. Hemorheol. Microcirc. 40: 113-8 (2008)]. ALIB-97 may exert its effects by alteration of cell membrane associated proteins, which may also be responsible for its more potent effect.","The invention therefore further provides a diagnostic method for predicting responsiveness of a subject suffering from a pathologic disorder to treatment with synthetic or natural derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids. The diagnostic method of the invention is based on monitoring the direct or indirect modulations in structure and composition of a cell membrane obtained from the tested subject in response to treatment with the synthetic or natural derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids. This diagnostic method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining cells from the tested subject; (b) exposing these cells to an effective amount of a compounds of Formula I, II, III, IV, or any combinations and mixtures thereof under suitable conditions; and (c) identifying an alteration in the membrane composition and structure of said cells, as compared to a control, by a suitable means.","Wherein an alteration in the membrane composition and structure of the cells as compared to a control is indicative of responsiveness of said subject to treatment with said synthetic or natural derivative of glycolipids.","By predicting the responsiveness of the particular tested subject to a certain synthetic derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids, in a certain concentration or mixture thereof, the diagnostic method of the invention provides a \u201ctailor-made\u201d treatment, personally adjusted and adapted for each specific patient.","It should be further appreciated that the diagnostic method of the invention may also be used for follow-up of treated patients.","According to one embodiment, the cells obtained from the tested subject may be any one of microglial cells, NKT lymphocyte, and dendritic cell, any regulatory lymphocyte, and type of lymphocyte.","Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

Data were analyzed using either the Consort 30 two-color contour plot program (Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, Calif.) or the CELLQuest 25 program.","Administration of Con A and Measurement of Serum Transaminase Activities","Con A was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Ohio, USA), was dissolved (0.5 mg, 20 mg\/kg) in 200 \u03bcl of 50 mM Tris pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM CaCl, and was injected intravenously into mice (tail vain). Sera from individual mice were obtained 8 or 20 h after Con A injection. Serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured by an automatic analyzer.","Histological Examination","Livers from individual mice were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Specimens were examined under a light microscope.","In Vitro Stimulation of Splenocytes","Splenocytes were prepared as described above and plated at 2.0\u00d710cells per well in 96-well plates in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% FCS, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Titrated volumes of GC, \u03b1-GalCer, and ALIB-97 diluted in DMSO were added at final concentrations of 100 ng, 1 \u03bcg, and 10 \u03bcg\/ml. After 72 h of culture, 1 \u03bcCi of [H] thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well, and the cells were cultured for an additional 16 to 18 h. Cells were harvested with a cell harvester (Tomtec, Orange, Conn.), and the uptake of radioactivity was measured with a \u03b2-plate reader. To evaluate IFN-\u03b3 secretion in vitro, supernatants were harvested after 90 h of culture with glycolipids and stored until the cytokine levels were measured by ELISA.","Hepatic MRI Measurement of Fat Content","Hepatic fat content is measured using a double-echo chemical shift gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence that provides in-phase and opposed-phase images in a single acquisition for assessment\/quantification of fat in mouse liver. The T1-weighted opposed-phase MR imaging technique is sensitive for detection of relatively small amounts of tissue fat. MRI images are performed with a 1.5-T system (Sigma LX; GE, Milwaukee, USA). Double-echo MR imaging is performed with a repetition time (TR) of 125 msec, double echo times (TEs) of 4 and 6.5 msec, and a flip angle of 80\u00b0. Imaging parameters include section thickness of 3 mm, 13-cm field of view, 256*160 matrix, and one signal acquired, with use of a knee coil. Transverse (axial) and coronal images are acquired at the level of the liver with a 3 mm section thickness and no intersection gap. Quantitative assessment of signal intensity (SI) measurements of SI changes between in-phase and opposed-phase images is computed as described in previous reports [Mitchell, D. G, et al., Invest. Radiol 26:1041-1052 (1991); Tomohiro, N. et al., Radiology 218:642-646 (2001)]. The SI index was calculated as follows: SI index=(SI\u2212Si)\/SI, where SIis SI on in-phase images and SIis SI on opposed-phase images. The SI index reflects the fraction of SI loss on opposed phase images compared with the SI on in-phase images.","PC-12 Cell Culture","PC-12 cells are grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, and 100 U\/ml penicillin.

Each parameter is graded on a scale from 0 (completely normal) to 4 (most severe) by two experienced blinded examiners.","Grading of Histological Lesions","For histological evaluation of inflammation, distal colonic tissue (last 10 cm) is removed and fixed in 10% formaldehyde. Five paraffin sections from each mouse are then stained with hematoxyllin-eosin by using standard techniques. The degree of inflammation on microscopic cross sections of the colon is graded semiquantitatively from 0 to 4 [Madsen et al., (1997) ibid.; Trop et al., Hepatology 27:746-755 (1999)]. Grade 0: normal with no signs of inflammation; Grade 1: very low level of leukocyte infiltration; Grade 2: low level of leukocyte infiltration; and Grade 3: high level of infiltration with high vascular density, and bowel wall thickening; Grade 4: transmural infiltrates with loss of goblet cells, high vascular density, wall thickening, and disruption of normal bowel architecture.

The stepping adjustments test is repeated three times for each forelimb.","*Forelimb Placing Test","The forelimb-placing test assesses the rats' ability to make directed forelimb movements in response to a sensory stimulus. Rats are held with their limbs hanging unsupported. They are then raised to the side of a table so that their whiskers make contact with the top surface while the length of their body parallels the edge of the tabletop. Control rats place their forelimb on the tabletop in response to whisker stimulation almost every time, whereas injured rats do not. Each test includes 10 trials of placement of each forelimb and is repeated daily for three consecutive days. The results of both tests are expressed as percentage of forelimb stepping adjustments and placing in the lesioned side, as compared with the nonlesioned side. ANOVA analysis of repeated measures is used to determine significant differences in the motor performance.","*At the end of experiment striata of the animals are collected, and submitted to HPLC analysis for the presence of dopamine and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA).

When the mice can no longer continue running and fall from the cylinder, the total time they spend on the cylinder and final speed achieved is recorded electronically, thus allowing calculation of the total distance run. Each mouse performs three rotarod trials, and the best performance each week is recorded. A \u201cbaseline\u201d distance is established at 12 weeks of age to which subsequent performance is compared. Onset of disease-related weakness is defined as a sustained decrease of more than 30% of baseline maximum running distance. Survival is defined by an accepted artificial endpoint as the time at which the mouse is no longer able to right itself within 30 seconds of being placed on its side.","A clinical 5-point score is used for assessing the ability to move:","4=normal mobility; 3=movement with limited use of the hindlegs; 2=movement with the use of the forelegs; 1=movement only for a short period with the use of the forelegs; and 0=unable to move.","The time to onset and death\/survival of treated and control groups are compared using Kaplen-Meier curve analysis (using SPS 12 for Windows\u00ae).

Therefore, the different synthetic and natural derivatives of \u03b2-glycolipids of Formula II, III and IV [AD2897 (ALIB-97), AD2898, and AD2899, respectively], were examined using seven groups of C57Bl\/6 mice, as summarized by Table 1. Mice in experimental groups A-G (eight mice in each group) were injected with ConA. Group A mice were administered with 100 \u03bcl intraperitoneal injection of solvent only [15% Cremophor EL\/15% ethanol\/70% PBS](C:E). Mice in groups B, C, D, E, F, and G were administered with intraperitoneal injection of 1 \u03bcg or 10 \u03bcg of each of the three analogs Formulated in solvent as described in Experimental Procedures. Animals were sacrificed and examined.","In order to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of the three novel analogues of the invention on immune-mediated hepatitis, the effect of treatment with two concentrations of the three synthetic analogs on liver damage in all tested groups was assessed by determination of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.","As clearly shown by , both ALT and AST levels decreased in animals treated using either AD2897 (ALIB-97) or AD2898 as synthetic analogs, with the former requiring the administration of a 10 \u03bcg dosage and the later only a 1 \u03bcg dosage. As these liver transaminases provide evidence for hepatic cell injury their decrease in the serum suggest the alleviation of liver damage and immune mediated liver injury.","Assessment of the effect of any of the synthetic analogs on the immune response was next determined by analysis of the cytokine serum level of IFN\u03b3 in each animal using a commercial \u201csandwich\u201d ELISA kit, and by FACS analysis of intrahepatic and intrasplenic (peripheral) lymphocytes levels.","As shown by , mice treated with either AD2898 or AD2899 in both high and low dosages or with a low dosage of AD2897 (ALIB-97), exhibited a decrease in IFN\u03b3 serum levels, suggesting a negative effect upon this pro-inflammatory cytokine.","Treatment of animals with a low dosage of the AD2897 analog, a low dosage of the AD2898 analog or a high dosage of the AD2899 analog resulted in a decrease in intrahepatic NKT cell levels and a decrease in the intrahepatic\/peripheral ratio of these lymphocytes (, respectively).

Oral Administration of ALIB-97 Decreased Intrahepatic and Intrasplenic NKT Lymphocytes in B6 Mice","As shown by the previous Examples, the different novel analogs clearly affect different immune cell populations in diseased animals. To further investigate the effect of one of the novel analogs of the invention, the ALIB-97 derivative, on spleen and liver cell populations, B6 mice were used by the inventors as control animals. As shown by , oral administration of ALIB-97 resulted in a significant decrease in hepatic CD3\/NK1.1 lymphocytes after 8 hours (73%, p<0.05), as well as in the CD3\/CD4 lymphocyte ratio (20%, p=0.08). Hepatic CD3\/CD8 lymphocytes were unaffected. In the spleen, reduction of CD3\/CD8 and CD3\/CD4 cells was observed (30%, p<0.05; and 23%, p=0.07, respectively), and splenic CD3\/NK1.1 lymphocytes were markedly increased (>100%, p<0.05).  demonstrate the effect of intraperitoneal ALIB-97 administration at 8 and 20 h, respectively. At 8 h, ALIB-97 significantly reduced splenic CD3\/CD4 and CD3\/NKT cells (p<0.05 and <0.01, respectively). Hepatic CD3\/NKT cells were decreased by more than 55% (p<0.05). At 20 h, hepatic CD3\/CD4 cells increased by 33% (p=0.01), whereas splenic CD3\/CD4 cells were not affected. Taken together, as also shown by Example 2, oral administration of ALIB-97 resulted in a significant decrease in intrahepatic and intrasplenic NKT lymphocytes in healthy B6 mice.","II. Oral Administration of ALIB-97 Ameliorated Con A Hepatitis in B6 Mice","Since abnormalities in NK T cell populations were previously demonstrated in patients with autoimmune disorders, the inventors further examined in detail the observed effect of ALIB-97 on NK T cell population, and the applicability of this effect in amelioration of autoimmune diseases, such as the ConA induced hepatitis. Injection of Con A into mice is known as resulting in elevation of serum ALT and AST levels after approximately six hours. The elevated ALT and AST levels peak between twelve and twenty four hours [Biburger, M. and Tiegs, G. J. Immunol. 175: 1540-50 (2005)]. The inventors therefore examined the levels of these enzymes in B6 mice twenty hours after Con A injection (22 h after oral administration of \u03b2-GC and ALIB-97). As was also shown (Example 2) for all three analogs,  demonstrates that serum AST and ALT levels were significantly reduced following oral administration of ALIB-97 compared with the control (p<0.01). The effect was equivalent to that of dexamethasone and greater than that of the natural \u03b2-GC (p<0.05).","III. IP Administration of ALIB-97 Ameliorated Con A Hepatitis in B6, but not in CD1d and J\u03b118 KO, Mice","To examine whether the beneficial effect of ALIB-97 on ConA induced hepatitis was mediated by type I or type II NKT cells, the J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice were used. Both J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice that lack iNKT cells are known to be relatively resistant to Con A-induced hepatic injury [Kaneko, Y. et al. J. Exp. Med. 191: 105-14 (2000); Takeda, K. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97: 5498-503 (2000)]. The inventors therefore compared the effects of \u03b2-GC and ALIB-97 between B6 and both J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice.  shows that J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice were indeed relatively resistant to Con A-induced hepatitis, and ALIB-97 did not significantly alter the enzyme levels in these mice. However, intraperitoneal administration (IP) of ALIB-97 to B6 mice significantly reduced AST and ALT levels by more than 60% (p<0.05).  shows that the histological findings of degenerative changes in the liver correlate with serum aminotransferase levels.","IV. In Vitro Stimulation of Splenocytes","The inventors next studied in vitro splenocyte cytokine polarization resulting from NKT cell stimulation by \u03b2-glycolipids.  shows proliferation by [H] thymidine incorporation and supernatant IFN-\u03b3 levels that were measured over a range of \u03b2-glycolipid concentrations. The glycolipid ALIB-97 differed structurally from \u03b2-GC by having an adamantanyl residue instead of the fatty acid chain, and also by the feature of replacement of the amide bond with a thiocarbamide (thiourea) bond.  (III) shows that despite these modifications, 100 ng of ALIB-79 activated IFN-\u03b3 secretion more than 9-fold in mouse splenocytes. This cytokine activation was even higher than that induced by \u03b1GalCer. The response was iNKT cell-dependent, as demonstrated by the absence of these effects in both J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 and CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice. Interestingly, GC was the sole glycolipid capable of activating IFN-\u03b3 secretion in CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 splenocytes. However, as shown in , cell proliferation was not activated by either \u03b2-glycolipid, in contrast to \u03b1GalCer, which induced cell proliferation in B6 splenocytes.","V. Oral Administration of ALIB-97 Decreased IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 Serum Levels in B6 Mice","One hallmark of iNKT cells is their capacity to produce, within hours of activation, large amounts of cytokines, including the characteristic Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3. The inventors next determined the effects of orally administered ALIB-97 on serum cytokines after 20 hours.  shows that oral administration of ALIB-97 to B6 mice resulted in a significant decrease in serum IFN-\u03b3 levels compared to the control (p<0.01). This change was greater than that induced by dexamethasone and \u03b2-GC (p=0.05). Orally administered ALIB-97 also affected the serum levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 to a greater extant than that observed in response to dexamethasone (p<0.01, ).","VI. IP Administration of ALIB-97 Affects Serum Cytokine Secretion","Administration of \u03b1-GalCer to mice was previously shown as resulting in significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3 in the serum of wild type but not CD1d-deficient animals [Singh, A. K. et al. J. Exp. Med. 194: 1801-11 (2001)]. Next, the inventors determined whether IP administration of ALIB-97 had similar effects on several serum cytokines when compared with oral administration. . shows that intraperitoneal administration of ALIB-97 caused a marked decrease in serum IFN-\u03b3 levels in B6, but not in CD1d\u2212\/\u2212, mice. However, in J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 mice, which have only type II NKT cells, a substantial increase in serum IFN-\u03b3 was observed. Serum IL-10, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was increased following the injection of ALIB-97 in B6, CD1d\u2212\/\u2212, and J\u03b118\u2212\/\u2212 mice, suggesting a general iNKT mechanism. The inventors further assessed the secretion of two other pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Serum TNF-\u03b1 is known to be associated with the mechanism of Con A-induced hepatitis. ALIB-97 had a modest effect on serum TNF-\u03b1 secretion in B6 mice. Interestingly, the levels of TNF-\u03b1 were twice as high in both KO mice compared to B6 mice. These levels were decreased following ALIB-97 administration. Serum IL-6 levels were reduced after the injection of ALIB-97 in all three strains of mice. ALIB-97 did not affect the serum levels of IL-4 (data not shown).","VII. IP Administration of ALIB-97 Reduced STAT1 and STAT4 Phosphorylation and Increased the Expression of STAT6 in the Liver","To further analyze the potential signal transduction pathways affected by the novel ALIB-97 derivative, phosphorylation of STAT proteins was next examined.  shows the effect of ALIB-97 on several signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins in the liver. ALIB-97 increased STAT1 phosphorylation of Tyr 701 in the liver both in B6 and in CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice. STAT6 expression was slightly increased by ALIB-97. However, the endogenous expression of STAT6 in CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice was relatively low, and ALIB-97 markedly induced that expression.  shows that STAT4 expression was strikingly decreased in B6 mice, but remained unchanged in CD1d\u2212\/\u2212 mice.","Taken together, the ALIB-97 analog was shown by the invention as associated with a potent immune modulatory effect via suppression of type I NK T cells, suggesting that it may serve as an anti-inflammatory agent in NKT-dependent disorders.","Use of ALIB-97 for the Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome Associated Disorders","I. ALIB-97, the Novel \u03b2-Glycolipide Derivative Alters the Activation of JNK2 and AKT and Therefore is Applicable for Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome Associated Disorders","c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and plays a role in obesity and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is closely associated with chronic inflammation characterized by activation of a network of inflammatory signaling pathways. Alpha and beta-glycosphingolipids were previously described as having an immune-modulatory role, particularly via promotion of Tregs and modulation of their distribution. The inventors therefore examined the potential of the newly synthesized \u03b2-glycosphingolipid analogue (ALIB-97) as a modulator of the JNK pathway as a mean to alleviate insulin resistance, by alteration of adipose tissue and stromal tissue derived Tregs.","Therefore, five groups of male C57BL\/6 Ob\/Ob mice were studied. Mice (6 per group) were fed (per os) daily for 4 weeks with 15 or 45 \u03bcg of GC (groups B and C, respectively) and 15 or 45 \u03bcg of ALIB-97 (groups D and E, respectively). Control mice (Group A) were administered vehicle only.","Western blots of liver extracts prepared from all experimental groups were analyzed for JNK and AKT activation. As shown by , JNK2 activation was increased in all studied groups compared to control group. The high dose of 45 \u03bcg of GC (group C) resulted in 60% activation of JNK2. Akt is involved in insulin stimulation and glucose transport [Hajduch, 2000], the inventors next examined the effect of ALIB-97 on AKT phosphorylation.  shows that AKT activation was also increased in all groups except for group D where it was decreased. The maximal effect was, again, demonstrated in group C, where AKT activation was increased by 43%.","These results clearly demonstrate that the novel \u03b2-glycolipide derivative alters the activation of JNK2 and AKT and therefore may be applicable for treatment of metabolic syndrome associated disorders.","II. ALIB 97 Induces Tregs in Adipose Tissue and in the Adipose-Tissue Associated Stromal Vasculature","Obesity is known to induce inflammation derived from adipose tissue. Encouraged by the observe effect of the ALIB-97 derivative on the JNK pathway, the inventors next characterized the effect of this novel derivative on numbers and subsets of fat-associated T cells from adipose tissue and the spleen. Table 2 summarizes the main effects in these organs after administration of ALIB-97, as observed by flow cytometry. A significant alteration was demonstrated in several T cell sub-populations at various organs. Classical Tregs (CD4+ CD25+FOXP3+) in the adipose tissue were significantly induced (), while CD8+ CD25+FOXP3+ were increased in the spleen. This was associated with a decrease in splenic CD4+FOXP3+ and adipocytic both CD4+ and CD8+ FOXP3+IL17+ cells. Another interesting aspect of changes in the distribution of lymphocyte sub-population, was derived from the inspection of cell ratios between CD4+IL17+ lymphocytes (associated with autoimmunity) and CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes (associated with immune tolerance) and CD4+ CD25+FOXP3+. When comparing the spleen, adipose tissue and stromal vasculature, the adipose tissue alone had a baseline ratio >1 (leaning towards inflammation). A reversal of this ratio towards tolerance was achieved using GC ().

Alteration of Tregs in Adipose Tissue Alleviates the Insulin Resistance","Induction of Tregs in adipose tissue may lead to alleviation in insulin resistance. Therefore, the inventors next examined the effect of GC and the novel ALIB-97 derivative using glucose tolerance test (GTT) as reflecting insulin resistance. As demonstrated by , \u03b2-glycolipid treatment for four weeks resulted in lower fasting blood glucose (p\u22660.001 for all study groups). Additionally, glucose tolerance test (GTT) showed decreased insulin resistance as manifested by lower post prandial glucose levels (). When each time-point of glucose levels was calculated in respect to the initial levels (time 0) in each group prior to glucose loading, the decrease in glucose levels reached statistical significance at 60 minutes in group E (45 \u03bcg ALIB-97), 90 minutes in group D (15 \u03bcg ALIB-97) and 120 minutes in groups B and C (15 and 45 \u03bcg GC, respectively), meaning an earlier effect in ALIB-97 treated mice compared with GC treated. Interestingly, the decrease in glucose levels was dose dependent, as for both types of glycolipids lower glucose level were achieved in higher doses (groups C and E). None of the study groups had a significant change in insulin levels (), thus indicating the effect of lower blood glucose levels to be a result of decreased insulin resistance.","IV. ALIB-97 Induced Alteration of Tregs in Adipose Tissue Alleviates the Liver Injury in NASH","The inventors next examined whether the observed alleviation of insulin resistance caused by ALIB-97 induced alteration of Tregs may be applicable also in alleviating liver injury. Therefore, all experimental groups where tested for ALT and AST serum levels.  shows that both \u03b2-glycolipids (ALIB-97 and GC) significantly reduced AST (710 in group A vs. 330, 289 and 124 u\/L in groups C, D (p=0.01) and E respectively (p<0.01). 45 \u03bcg of ALIB-97 also significantly reduced ALT (370 in group A vs. 165 u\/L in group E, respectively, p<0.05).","V. Alteration of Tregs in Adipose Tissue Improves Serum TGs Profile","The inventors further examined the effect of ALIB-97 on serum TG. As demonstrated by , mice in all treated groups exhibited a significant decrease in their serum triglycerides (TGs), compare to control mice. However, serum cholesterol was not affected by the studied \u03b2-glycolipids. Also when the effect of \u03b2-glycolipids on intra hepatic TGs, was examined, no change was observed (data not shown).","Other parameters examined, for example, TGF-\u03b2 levels, initial or sacrifice weight and body\/liver weight ratio showed no significant difference among the tested groups.","In summary, the ALIB-97 novel derivative of the invention was shown herein as alleviating insulin resistance, reducing hepatic damage as reflected by reduction of serum levels of ALT and AST, and reducing serum TG. These effects are presumably mediated by induction of the JNK2 pathway and alteration of hepatic Tregs by the novel ALIB-97 derivative.
