{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","Detergent Components","Adjunct Materials","Product Form","Method of Use","Kit"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/426,429, filed Nov. 14, 2002.","The present invention is in the field of dishwashing, in particular it relates to dishwashing and automatic dishwashing products, auxiliaries and methods suitable for cleaning and protecting glassware.","Automatic dishwashing detergents constitute a generally recognized distinct class of detergent compositions whose purpose can include to breakdown and remove food soils; to inhibit foaming; to promote the wetting of wash articles in order to minimize or eliminate visually observable spotting and filming; to remove stains such as might be caused by beverages such as coffee and tea or by vegetable soils such as carotenoid soils; to prevent a buildup of soil films on wash ware surfaces; and to reduce or eliminate tarnishing of flatware without substantially etching or corroding or otherwise damaging the surface of glasses or dishes.","The problem of glassware corroding during washing the cycle of an automatic dishwashing appliance has long been known. Current opinion is that the problem of corrosion in glassware is the result of two separate phenomena. On the one hand, the corrosion is clearly due to minerals from the glass composition accompanied by hydrolysis of the silicate network. On the other hand, silicate material is released from the glass. After several washes in an automatic dishwashing appliance, both phenomena can cause damage to glassware such as cloudiness, scratches, and streaks.","Dissolution of the glassware's silicate network is known to be very low at pH values below 9.5 and increases with increasing pH. In institutional and domestic automatic dishwashing compositions, a strongly alkaline solution is produced and is used to wash dishes, glasses, and other cooking and eating utensils. Ordinary tap water can be used in preparing these strongly alkaline cleaning solutions and for rinsing the wash articles subsequent to the cleaning step. However, in European and in some North American (i.e. water softener users) applications, this tap water is often treated (softened) to remove hardness ions such as calcium and magnesium with the result that hard water residues on washware are reduced.","An unfortunate weakness in the performance of institutional and domestic automatic dishwashing compositions, both in compositions which are phosphated (i.e., containing inorganic phosphate builder salts) and those which are nonphosphated, is that they are particularly prone to attacking glasses and plates. Furthermore, the high alkalinity and high levels of builders add to corrosive effect on glassware. Thus, there is a continuing need to develop alternative automatic dishwashing compositions that provide the abovementioned benefits yet reduce the problem of glassware corrosion.","One approach to reducing glassware corrosion is to provide an automatic dishwashing composition comprising silicate. One approach is to provide an automatic dishwashing composition with a mixture of disilicate and metasilicate. Another approach is to provide an additive to an automatic dishwashing composition, such as, a copolymer of an organomineral siliconate, obtained by condensation polymerization of an alkali metal disilicate and an alkali metal siliconate. Another approach is to provide an automatic dishwashing composition with an alkali metal silicate partially substituted with calcium, magnesium, strontium or cerium as counterion. However, automatic dishwashing compositions comprising specific silicates or modified silicates to avoid dishwashing corrosion restricts the type of formulation to which these solutions are applicable. In particular, corrosion of glassware can be quite severe with compositions of low alkalinity, where silicates are of limited use because of their low stability.","Recently, another approach is the use of metal salts, particularly of aluminum, wherein the metal salt is sequestered to form a metal salt-sequestrant complex, such as, an aluminum(III)-sequestrant complex. In one example, a slow-dissolving aluminum salt is sequestered to form the aluminum(III)-sequestrant complex, which is added as a premix to an automatic detergent composition in the absence of silicate. Since these particular salts dissolve at a particular rate, they severely limit the selection of aluminum(III) species, which are useful. Another example of such an approach requires the selection of specific pKas and pHs to form an aluminum\/sequestrant premix. However, the usefulness of these aluminum\/sequestrant premix formulations is limited. In another example, the aluminum\/sequestrant premix must be added as an additional step to the process of forming the detergent compositions which adds cost to its commercial application. In another approach, a fast-dissolving aluminum salt is used yet must be combined with greater than about 10 wt. % silicate in high alkalinity products to avoid corrosion since corrosion is especially pronounced in alkaline automatic dishwashing compositions having an absence of silicate. However, the sequestering process is complicated since is composed of multiple process steps and involves precise adjustment of pH and the aluminum\/sequestrant complex is limited to detergent compositions wherein a 1% aqueous solution of the composition has a pH of 9.","A cost effective and simple approach to reducing glassware corrosion is to provide a glasscare active salt, for example an aluminum salt such as aluminum sulfate, to the automatic dishwashing composition. However, there are several drawbacks to this approach. For example, soluble (or slightly soluble) glasscare active salts in gel detergent lead to clumping of the gel product, which can also cause phase separation in certain detergents. These salts can also lead to a reduction in the cleaning performance for tea, stains by interfering with the bleach during the wash cycle.","One way to overcome the drawbacks disclosed above is through encapsulation. A variety of materials and methods can be used to coat particles. The majority of the encapsulation effort, however, has been directed to bleach and enzyme encapsulation. In particular, bleach and enzyme particles can be single-coated with fatty acids, polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycols or double-coated with an inner coat of paraffin or microcrystalline waxes having melting points of 40\u00b0\u201394\u00b0 C. and a second coat of material such as sodium carbonate. Alternatively, the double-coated encapsulated bleach and enzyme particles may have an inner coat of fatty acid or waxes and an outer coat of water-soluble cellulose ether. Other encapsulating coatings for bleach and enzyme particles include polymer latex; polycarboxylate materials; polyethylene waxes of melting point 50\u00b0\u201365\u00b0 C.; and various other waxes. The bleach and enzyme particles may also be coated with ethylene vinyl acetate, fatty acid, natural waxes, a synthetic resin or an inorganic coating. For example, the bleach and enzyme particles may be coated with silicone oil, petroleum jelly or alcohol waxes. Some precursor particles used in cleaning compositions have also been encapsulated with liquid paraffin waxes and polyvinyl alcohol.","It has surprisingly been found that by protecting certain glasscare active salts from dissolving in (or reacting with) the detergent composition good glassware corrosion protection can be achieved during washing and\/or rinsing cycles of an automatic dishwashing appliance. The drawback of clumping in gels can be avoided and the interaction of the glasscare active salts with detergent components can be minimized in liquids, powders and tablets by use of encapsulated glasscare active salts. The release of the encapsulated glasscare active salt can be delayed or sequenced depending on the type of encapsulating coating used. Thus, by sequencing and\/or delaying the release of the glasscare active salts in detergent compositions by encapsulation, bleaching agents, like oxygen bleach, can be used to remove tea stains before the glasscare active salt has time to react with the stain.","An automatic dishwashing detergent composition is disclosed that comprises: (a) from about 0.01% and about 70%, by weight of the composition of a glasscare active salt; (b) at least one detergent component; (c) optionally at least one adjunct material; and (d) balance water. The glasscare active salt is encapsulated via at least one encapsulating agent, which provides at least one encapsulating coating to a glasscare active salt. The automatic dishwashing detergent composition may in any form including, but not limited to, liquid, liquid gel, gel, paste, cream, granular solid, powder, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, glassware is protected from corrosion and fading. The combinations of the automatic dishwashing detergent composition with a method, and a kit are also disclosed herein.","Glasscare Active Salt","An automatic dishwashing detergent composition is disclosed herein that comprises an encapsulated glasscare active salt (hereinafter \u201cEGAS composition\u201d) comprising at least one of the following: aluminum, zinc, magnesium, calcium, lanthanum, tin, gallium, strontium, titanium, or mixtures thereof. Any convenient water-soluble or water-insoluble glasscare active salt can be used herein.

They may also be water-soluble, or water dispersible, or they may dissolve, disperse or melt in a temperature range of from about 40\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C.","The glasscare active salt may be generally incorporated in an EGAS composition in any suitable amount. In some embodiments, the EGAS composition may deliver from about 0.1 mM to about 10 mM, about 0.5 mM to about 5 mM, or about 1 mM to 2 mM of the glasscare active salt or complex in the wash and\/or rinse liquor. In one embodiment, the level of glasscare active salt that achieves a glassware protection benefit may be an amount between from about 0.01% and about 70%, by weight of the composition.","In one non-limiting embodiment, the EGAS composition may comprise an encapsulated aluminum salt comprising water-soluble aluminum salt, water-insoluble aluminum salt, slightly water-soluble aluminum salt, or mixtures thereof.","Water-soluble aluminum salts include, but are not limited to: aluminum acetate, aluminum ammonium sulfate, aluminum chlorate, aluminum chloride, aluminum chloride hydrate, aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum diformate, aluminum formoacetate, aluminum monostearate, aluminum lactate, aluminum nitrate, aluminum sodium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, aluminum stearate, aluminum tartrate, aluminum triformate, and mixtures thereof.

The at least one encapsulating coating may comprise a single-coat, multiple-coats, and combinations thereof in any suitable thickness. Encapsulating agents include, but are not limited to, fatty acids, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, builders, water-soluble cellulose and\/or cellulose ether, polymers, polymer latex; polycarboxylate materials, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene waxes of melting point 50\u00b0\u201365\u00b0 C., natural waxes, paraffin or microcrystalline waxes having melting points of 40\u00b0\u201394\u00b0 C., liquid paraffin waxes, alcohol waxes, synthetic resin, silicone oil, petroleum jelly, inorganic coatings, or mixtures thereof.","In one non-limiting embodiment, the at least one encapsulating agent may comprise polymers, polymer latex, polycarboxylate materials, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, or mixtures thereof. In other non-limiting embodiments, when the EGAS composition is in the form of a granular solid, powder, or mixtures thereof, the at least one encapsulating coating is substantially free of low critical solution temperature polymers. For example, low critical solution temperature polymers include those selected from the group consisting of alkylated and\/or hydroxyalkylated polysaccharides, cellulose ethers, polyisoproplylacrylamine, copolymers of polyisopropylacrylamide, and mixtures thereof.","In an alkaline or highly alkaline environment, encapsulation decreases the chemical degradation of the glasscare active salt prior to its release. Encapsulated glasscare active salts also provide product stability in detergent compositions by inhibiting interaction of the glasscare active salt with other detergent components, such as buffers, bleaches and polymers. For example, glasscare active salts will interact negatively with thickeners (i.e. polyacrylates) and bleaches in the detergent composition. Since the encapsulating agent is designed to provide a releasable coating which surrounds the glasscare active salt, neither the encapsulating agent nor the release mechanism need to be the same for any type or form of the EGAS composition. Nonetheless, the encapsulated glasscare active salt comprising at least one encapsulating coating should be stable in the product matrix (i.e. liquid, gel, and\/or powder) provided and also be designed to allow for the release of the glasscare active salt by dissolution and\/or disruption of the at least one encapsulating coating upon triggering by a specific active release mechanism.","The following references disclose a wide variety of encapsulating methods and materials: U.S. Pat.

No. WO 9811186A1.","Active Release Mechanism","The encapsulated glasscare active salt may be released from the at least one encapsulating coating at any time and by any means. For example, the encapsulated glasscare active salt may be released at a specific time after beginning the wash, at a specific pH, at a specific wash liquor concentration, or after a specific phase or activity has occurred. The release of the glasscare active salt may be accomplished by the dissolution and\/or disruption of the encapsulating agent or coating that surrounds the glasscare active salt. The delay or sequencing of the release of the glasscare active salt can be triggered via a number of release mechanisms including, but not limited to, time, temperature, hardness, interfacial tension, pH- sensitive, mechanical action, ionic strength, dilution, and combinations thereof.","A. Timed Release","In one non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt release mechanism is by timed release. A timed release relates to a coating that disintegrates mainly as a function of time. However, a timed release does not account for different main wash durations or different wash temperatures. A second outer coating may be provided to allow greater control of the release of the glasscare active salt.","B. Temperature Release","In another non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt is released by a specific temperature or temperature range common to automatic dishwashing operations. A temperature release mechanism may comprise to a coating that remains intact during the warm main wash but disintegrates during cold rinses. U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,916 discloses the use of multiple films (e.g. comprising a layer of PVA film and a layer of cellulose ether film) as a way of increasing the sensitivity of pouches designed to release in the rinse cycle. Films comprising cellulose ethers (e.g. HPMC, HBMC, and mixtures thereof) decrease in water-solubility as the temperature increases, making them more soluble in rinsewater than during the warm main wash. Premature dissolution at low wash temperatures may require a second outer coating to prevent exposure of the glasscare active salt until after warm up.","C. Hardness Release","In another non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt is released by the presence of hardness. A hardness release mechanism relates to a coating that does not release in the built main wash, but releases in the calcium-rich rinse water. Poor disintegration under soft water conditions may require a second outer coating to prevent exposure of glasscare active salt until after hardness removal by the builders.","D. Interfacial Tension Release","In another non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt is released due to the lack of surfactant or higher interfacial tension. An interfacial tension release mechanism relates to a coating that senses the lack of surfactants and dissolves during the higher interfacial tension rinse. Disintegration during the prewash cycle may require a second outer coating to prevent exposure of glasscare active salt until after surfactant dissolution.","E. Mechanical Action Release","In another non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt is released by mechanical action. A mechanical action release mechanism relates to a coating that shears during the vigorous water spraying wash and\/or rinse cycles. If release during the rinse cycle is desired, the at least one encapsulating coating could disintegrate during the main wash. Thus, a second outer coating may be provided to prevent exposure of glasscare active salt during the main wash.","F. pH-Sensitive Release","In another non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt is released by a lower pH or a pH change. A pH-sensitive release mechanism relates to a coating that may, for example, remain insoluble during the alkaline main wash but disintegrates during the lower pH rinse cycle. Two types of pH-sensitive release mechanisms are: amine protonation and PVA-boric acid films.","1. pH-Sensitive Release Via Amine Protonation","In one non-limiting embodiment, the glasscare active salt can be released via dissolution and\/or disruption of the encapsulating coating comprising pH-sensitive materials undergoing amine protonation. The common theme behind this class of rinse-sensitive materials is the selection of an appropriate compound with amine groups of a specific pKa, which causes them to be deprotonated at pH 10, but protonated (and hence soluble) at pH 9.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"24.55mm","wi":"43.26mm","file":"US07033980-20060425-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In one non-limiting embodiment, the encapsulated glasscare active salt can be released via dissolution and\/or disruption of the encapsulating coating comprising pH-sensitive materials comprising polymers with pendant amine groups.

The EGAS compositions will generally be built, but they may be non-built, and can comprise one or more detergent components which may comprise alkalinity sources, builders, surfactants, suds suppressors, enzymes, thickeners, bleaching systems (i.e. bleaching agents and catalysts), solvents, wetting agents, or mixtures thereof.","In one non-limiting embodiment, the EGAS composition can comprise an encapsulated glasscare active salt and a detergent component comprising at least one of the following: an alkalinity source, builder, surfactant, suds suppressor, enzyme, thickener, bleaching system, adjunct materials, or mixtures thereof.","Source of Alkalinity","To provide an alkaline pH, the EGAS composition may contain any suitable alkalinity source in any suitable amount. The pH may be raised to any suitable level. In certain embodiments, the alkalinity source may raise the pH of the EGAS composition to at least 10.0 in a 1 wt-% aqueous solution and or to a range of from about 10.5 to 14. Such pH is sufficient for soil removal and sediment breakdown when the chemical is placed in use and further facilitates the rapid dispersion of soils. The general character of the alkalinity source is limited only to those chemical compositions which have a substantial aqueous solubility. Alkalinity sources include, but are not limited to, alkali metal silicate, hydroxide, phosphate, carbonate, and combinations thereof. The alkalinity source can include an alkali metal hydroxide including sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and combinations thereof.","Mixtures of these hydroxide species can also be used. Alkaline metal silicates can also act as a source of alkalinity. Useful alkaline metal silicates correspond with the general formula (MO:SiO) wherein for each mole of MO there is less than one mole of SiO.
