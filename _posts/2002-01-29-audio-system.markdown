title: Audio system
abstract: An audio system comprises an audio source terminal  and a audio playback terminal  connected to each another by a wireless data link  The source terminal  comprises a source computer  and a cellular modem  The playback terminal  comprises a playback computer  having an internal processor  and an audio processor  Connected to the processor  is a cellular modem  an audio transducer  and a user control  Data relating to audio components, representing different services, is stored at the source terminal  where it is spatially processed and transmitted to the playback terminal. At the same time, each individual audio component is transmitted at a lower bit-rate than the spatially processed data, to the audio source terminal  whereafter it is spatially processed. Although the low bit-rate transmission causes a loss of audio quality, the positional data remains unaffected. Accordingly, when played, the combination of a high quality signal with low three-dimensional audio positional accuracy, and a set of low quality signals with high three-dimensional audio positional accuracy, results in restoration of the human perception of three-dimensional position to the degraded three-dimensional audio signal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The present application is based on, and claims priority from, British Application Ser. No. 0102230.0, filed Jan. 29, 2001, and British Application Ser. No. 0127753.2, filed Nov. 20, 2001, the disclosure of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","This invention relates to an audio system, to a playing terminal for an audio system, and to a method of operating a playing terminal for use in an audio system.","The use of sound as a means of presenting computer-based services previously represented in visual form (e.g. on a computer monitor) has been proposed. In particular, it has been proposed that spatialisation processing of different sounds be performed such that the sounds, when played through loudspeakers or some other audio transducer, are presented at particular positions in the three-dimensional audio field. It is envisaged that this will enable Internet-style browsing using only sound-based links to services.","Such a three-dimensional audio interface will use spatialisation processing of sounds to present services in a synthetic, but realistically plotted, three-dimensional audio field. Sounds, representing services and\/or information could be placed at different distances to the front, rear, left, right, up and down of the user. An example of a service is a restaurant. A pointer to the restaurant (the equivalent of a hyperlink) can be positioned in the audio field for subsequent selection. There are several ways in which the \u2018audio hyperlink\u2019 can be represented, for example by repeating a service name (e.g. the name of the restaurant) perhaps with a short description of the service, by using an earcon for the service (e.g. a memorable jingle or noise), or perhaps by using an audio feed from the service.","Such a system relies upon a high quality audio interface which is capable of rendering a three-dimensional audio field. Given that each sound, representing a service, is likely to be sent to a user's terminal from a remote device (e.g. the service provider's own computer) it follows that a data link is required. Where the data link has limited bandwidth, and is susceptible to interference and noise (for example, if a wireless telephony link is used) or if the channel employs lossy audio codecs (coder-decoders), it is likely that the link will degrade the three-dimensional nature of the audio. This may have the effect of masking any user-perception of three-dimensional positioning of sounds. This problem can be reduced if each audio component, i.e. each set of data relating to a particular sound, is transmitted independently to the user's terminal where the components are then combined to form the spatialisation processed data. This processed data is not subjected to the lossy transmission link. However, such a system will require larger overall bandwidth in order to carry the multiple audio components. In many network applications, particularly mobile wireless networks, the bandwidth of the access link or channel is a limited and expensive commodity.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an audio system comprising: an audio source; a playing terminal connected to the audio source by means of a data link; and audio transducer means connected to the playing terminal, wherein a plurality of audio components are provided at the audio source, each audio component comprising (a) audio data relating to an audible sound or track, and (b) positional data: relating to a position in three-dimensional space, relative to the audio transducer means, at which each audible sound or track is to be perceived, the audio source being arranged to (i) generate, from the plurality of audio components, a first set of spatially processed data for transmission over the data link at a first bit rate, and (ii) individually transmit each of the audio components at a bit-rate which is lower than that of the first bit rate, the playing terminal being arranged to receive the first set of spatially processed data and each individual audio component, at their respective bit-rates, to generate a second set of spatially processed data using the individual audio components, and to output the first and second sets of spatially processed data by means of the audio transducer means.","In this case, spatially processed data is a set of data representing a description of the intended audio field, and will comprise the audio data and positional data for each audio component to be emitted, i.e. through the audio transducer means.","As briefly mentioned above, where channels having limited capacity are used, spatially processed data subsequently transmitted over this lossy channel will result in a degradation of the three-dimensional spatialisation effect. In other words, the positioning of the sounds can be affected. Here, a lower quality (due to lower bit-rate) version of each audio component is separately transmitted from the audio source. The positional data in these separate components remains unaffected by the channel. When outputted from the audio transducer means, together with the spatialised data, the audible sound relating to each component tends to correlate with the spatialised data so as to enable association, by the human ear, of each component with the corresponding audio sound in the spatialised data. Ultimately, the combination of a high quality signal with low positional accuracy (due to channel degradation) and a set of low quality audio signals with high positional accuracy results in restoration of human perception as to the three-dimensional position of a sound or sounds. Since the transmitted audio components are sent at a lower bit-rate, the required channel bandwidth is kept low.","Preferably, each audio component individually transmitted to the playback terminal is spatially processed at the playback terminal. This may be performed using a separate audio processing means provided at the playback terminal.","In practice, each different sound may be representative of a different service, and in effect, may be considered equivalent to an Internet-style hyperlink. The sound may comprise, for example, a stream of sound indicative of the service, or perhaps a memorable jingle or noise. A user is then able to select a particular sound in the three-dimensional audio field and perform an initiating operation in order to access the service represented by the sound. Each sound could be equated with a window on a computer desktop screen. Some windows might not be the focus window, but will still be outputting information in the background. In this system, each sound will be active, although only one will be of interest to a user at a particular time.","The audio system may comprise a user control device connected to the playing terminal and arranged to enable user-selection of one the audible sounds or tracks, corresponding to one of the audio components outputted from the audio transducer means, as a focus sound or track. The user control device may comprise a position sensor for being mounted on a body part of a user, the position sensor being arranged to cause selection of an audible sound or track as the focus sound or track by means of generating position data indicating the relative position of the user's body part, the playing device thereafter comparing the position data with the positional data for each of the audio components so as to determine the audible sound or track to which the user's body part is directed. The position sensor may be a head-mountable sensor, the playing device being arranged to determine the audible sound or track to which a part of the user's head is directed.","As an alternative to the position type control device, the user control device may comprise a selection switch or button, e.g. a trackball, or a voice recognition facility arranged to receive audible commands from a user and to interpret the received commands so as to determine which audible sound or track is selected as the focus sound or track.","The data link may be a wireless data link. The wireless data link may be established over a mobile telephone connection. Alternatively, a wired connection could be used, e.g. using a conventional Internet connection over telephone lines.","The audio source may be a network-based device.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an audio system comprising: a playing terminal connected to one or more audio sources by means of a data link; and audio transducer means connected to the playing terminal, wherein the playing terminal is arranged to receive, by means of an input port, (a) a plurality of audio components sent from one or more of the audio sources, each audio component comprising (i) audio data relating to an audible sound or track, and (ii) positional data relating to a position in three-dimensional space, relative to an audio transducer means, at which each audible sound or track is to be perceived and (b) a first set of spatially processed data sent from one of the audio sources, the first set of spatially processed data being generated at said audio source using the audio components and being received at a bit-rate which is greater than that at which the plurality of audio components are each received, the playing terminal also being arranged to generate a second set of spatially processed data using the received audio components and to output the first and second sets of spatially processed data by means of an output port.","In this particular aspect, although spatially processed data is received from one audio source, the plurality of (non-spatialised) components which are transmitted to the playback terminal may be sent from one or a plurality of different audio sources.","According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a playing terminal for use in an audio system, the playing terminal comprising: a first port for receiving data from an audio source by means of a data link; and a second port for outputting data, from the playing terminal, to an audio transducer means, wherein the playing terminal is arranged to receive, by means of the first port, (a) a plurality of audio components, each audio component comprising (i) audio data relating to an audible sound or track, and (ii) positional data relating to a position in three-dimensional space, relative to an audio transducer means, at which each audible sound or track is to be perceived and (b) a first set of spatially processed data generated using the plurality of audio components, the spatially processed data being received at a bit-rate which is greater than that at which the plurality of audio components are each received, the playing terminal also being arranged to generate a second set of spatially processed data from the audio components received, and to output the first and second sets of spatially processed data by means of the second port.","According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of operating a playing terminal for use in an audio system, the method comprising: receiving, at the playing terminal, a plurality of audio components transmitted over a data link from a remote audio source, each component comprising (i) audio data relating to an audible sound or track, and (ii) positional data relating to a position in three-dimensional space, relative to an audio transducer means, at which each audible sound or track is to be perceived; receiving, at the playing terminal a first set of spatially processed data generated using the plurality of audio components, the spatially processed data being received at a bit-rate which is greater than the bit-rate at which each audio component is received; and generating, using the received plurality of audio components, a second set of spatially processed data and simultaneously playing the first and second sets of spatially processed data from a transducer means connected to the playing terminal.","A user control device may be connected to the playing terminal, in which case the method may further comprise operating the user control device so as to select an audible sound or track, corresponding to one of the audio components outputted from the audio transducer means, as a focus sound or track.","The step of operating the user control device may comprise operating a position sensor mounted on a body part of a user, the position sensor causing selection of an audible sound or track as the focus sound or track by means of generating position data indicating the relative position of the user's body part, the playing device thereafter comparing the position data with the positional data for each of the audio components so as to determine the audible sound or track to which the user's body part is directed. The position sensor may be a head-mountable sensor, the playing device determining the audible sound or track to which a part of the user's head is directed.","As an alternative to the use of a positional sensor, the step of operating the user control device may comprise operating a selection switch or button, or operating a voice recognition facility arranged to receive audible commands from a user and to interpret the received commands so as to determine which audible sound or track is selected as the focus sound or track.","As mentioned previously, the data link may be a wireless data link, possibly established over a mobile telephone connection.","According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program stored on a computer-usable medium, the computer program comprising computer-readable instructions for causing a processing device to perform the steps of: receiving, at the processing device, a plurality of audio components transmitted over a data link from a remote audio source, each component comprising (i) audio data relating to an audible sound or track, and (ii) positional data relating to a position in three-dimensional space, relative to an audio transducer means, at which each audible sound or track is to be perceived; receiving, at the processing device, a first set of spatially processed data generated using the plurality of audio components, the spatially processed data being received at a bit-rate which is greater than the bit-rate at which each audio component is received; and generating, using the received plurality of audio components, a second set of spatially processed data and simultaneously playing the first and second sets of spatially processed data from a transducer means connected to the playing terminal.","Referring to and different methods of generating spatially processed data are shown. These Figures are intended to provide background information which is useful for understanding the invention.","In a user device is shown connected to an audio source  by means of a data link . At the audio source  are provided a plurality of audio components , each comprising audio data relating to a plurality of audible sounds or tracks, and positional data relating to a position in three-dimensional space at which each audible sound or track is to be perceived by a user. The audio components are input to a three-dimensional audio processor  for transmission over the data link . The audio processor  generates spatially processed data representing a composite description of where each set of audio data is to be plotted in three-dimensional space. The data link  is established using an access network . Due to limited available bandwidth, processed data subsequently transmitted over this lossy channel will result in a degradation of the three-dimensional spatialisation effect.","The degradation of the three-dimensional spatialisation effect can be reduced using the system shown in Here, the user device  is provided with an audio processor. In this case, each audio component is transmitted separately to the user device  (or rather the audio processor of the user device) by means of separate channels , , and  over the access network . In this way, the spatialisation processing is performed after the link and so there will be no degradation of the spatialisation effect. However, there is the disadvantage that the link requires a greater total bandwidth to carry all three channels. In many network applications, particularly mobile network applications, the bandwidth of the access network is a limited and expensive commodity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["c ","b. ","c "],"b":["4","47","48","49","50","7"]},"Referring now to , an audio system according to an embodiment of the invention, comprises an audio source terminal  and a audio playback terminal , connected to each another by a wireless data link . The source terminal  comprises a source computer , and a cellular modem . The playback terminal  comprises a playback computer  having an internal processor  and an audio processor . Instead of being in the form of a computer, the playback terminal  could be provided as a mobile device, such as a mobile telephone or personal digital assistant (PDA). Connected to the processor  is a cellular modem , an audio transducer , and a user control . If the playback terminal was in the form of a mobile device such as a mobile telephone or PDA, the audio transducer and user control may well be integral with the mobile device. The wireless data link  is established using respective cellular modems ,  which enable a network connection to be set-up using existing cellular telecommunications networks (as are used in mobile telephony systems). The source computer  and the playback computer  can be conventional personal computer (PC) devices.","In use, the source terminal  acts as a server device by which remotely located computers (such as playback terminal ) can access particular services. These services can include, for example, E-mail access, the provision of information, on-line retail services, and so on. The audio source terminal  essentially provides the same utility as a conventional Internet-style server. However, in this case, the presentation of available services is not performed using visual data displayed at the remote terminal, but instead, audible sound is used to present services.","Source computer  includes an audio processor and a memory (neither being shown in ), which stores data relating to a number of audio components. In this case, data relating to first, second and third audio components is stored (however a fewer or a greater number of services may be provided). Storage of the audio components is not essential, it being possible for the components to be sent as live feeds from a remote device. Each audio component corresponds to a particular service which can be accessed either directly from the audio source terminal (i.e. from its internal memory), or by indirect means (i.e. by a further network connection to a remote device storing the information).","Each audio component comprises two types of data, namely (a) audio data relating to an audible sound or track which, when played, represents the service which is accessible from the source terminal , and (b) positional data. The positional data defines the position in space, relative to a sound output device (in this case the audio transducer  of the playback terminal ), at which the audio data is to be perceived by a user. Specifically, the positional data defines the three-dimensional position in space at which the audio data is to be perceived by a user. In this respect, it will be appreciated that three-dimensional processing and presentation of sound is commonly used in many entertainment-based devices, such as in surround-sound television and cinema systems. Indeed, such three-dimensional audio processing is now commonplace in computer games, whereby the so-called Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) is used. This transfer function has evolved to enable a sound source to be variably positioned in the three-dimensional audio field and relates source sound pressured to ear drum sound pressures. The operation by which the services, represented by the three components stored at the audio source terminal , are accessed by the audio playback terminal , will now be described with reference to . Since the operation of the cellular modems ,  is conventional, these modules are not shown in .","Initially, the wireless data link  is established between the source terminal  and the playback terminal . This data link  is established over a suitable access network, represented in  by the numeral . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the data link  will have restricted bandwidth, and be prone to interference and noise. Although the data link  described is in the form of a cellular communications network, other wireless data links could be used, e.g. IEEE 802.11, wireless LAN or even Bluetooth. At the source terminal , audio data relating to the first, second, and third audio components are input to an audio processor  whereby a set of spatially processed data, representing the audio field to be presented at the playback terminal, is generated. This spatially processed data comprises the audio data for each component suitably combined with its associated positional data. Also, the first, second and third audio components are separately input to first, second, and third codecs , , and , respectively.","The codecs , , and  are, in this case, variable bit-rate speech codecs. Such codecs are able to encode data at a number of bit-rates and can dynamically and rapidly switch between these different bit-rates when encoding a signal. This allows the encoded bit-rate to be varied during the course of transmission. This can be useful when it becomes necessary to accommodate changes in access network bandwidth availability due to congestion or signal quality. An example variable bit-rate codec is the GSM Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) codec. The AMR codec provides eight coding modes providing a range of bit-rates for encoding speech: 4.75 kbit\/s, 5.15 kbit\/s, 5.9 kbit\/s, 6.7 kbit\/s, 7.4 kbit\/s, 7.95 kbit\/s, 10.2 kbit\/s, and 12.2 kbit\/s. When operating in a coding mode, the input signal to such a codec is sampled at a rate of 8 kHz, and 20 ms frames of input samples are encoded into variable length frames according to the coding mode. In a decoding mode, the frames of coded samples are decoded into 20 ms frames of samples. The degradation in quality in the output relative to the input is more severe for the lower bit-rates than for the higher bit-rates.","In the next stage, the spatially processed data (generated in the audio processor ) is transmitted over the data link  to the processor  of the playback computer . This transmission is represented by channel . The spatially processed data is transmitted using the channel  at a first bit-rate b. At the same time, each of the individual audio components are also transmitted to the processor  by means of their respective codecs , , and . Specifically, the first, second and third codecs , , and  receive, respectively, the first, second, and third audio components stored in the source computer  and encode the components for transmission over the data link . These transmissions are represented by the channels ,  and  (which may be referred to as \u2018tracer channels\u2019). The codecs , , and  are configured to transfer the audio components at a second bit-rate bwhich is less than that of the first bit-rate b. Since the audio components are transmitted at a lower bit-rate, their audible quality (when played) will be degraded. Bandwidth requirements, however, are reduced. Also, it should be understood that it is not necessary for the individual audio components to be transmitted at the same, lower, bit-rate. For example, each of the three components could be transmitted at a different respective bit-rate. However, these different bit-rates are assumed to be lower than the first bit-rate. The bit-rates used could even be continuously variable. The point is that the overall bandwidth used is controlled at a suitable level whilst maintaining audible quality.","As mentioned previously, due to the nature of the data link  using the access network , the three-dimensional nature of the audio contained in the spatially processed data will be degraded, possibly masking perception of the intended three-dimensional positioning of sound. As regards the separately transmitted audio components, since these have not been spatially processed, the positional data will not be affected. At the processor  of the playback computer , the received spatially processed data is played through the audio transducer . At the same time, each of the low-bandwidth audio components are input to the audio processor  via the processor . This further set of spatially processed data is then played through the audio transducer . The overall effect of adding the spatially processed data (constructed from the low bit-rate versions of the individual audio components) to the audio field is to allow association, by the human ear, of the degraded spatially processed signal with poor positional accuracy, with the low-bit rate audio components having low quality audio (due to the low bit-rate transmission) but good positional accuracy. The net result will be restoration of human perception of the three-dimensional position information.","In order for the above technique to work, synchronisation of the spatially processed data and the audio components is catered for by the processor .","In order to keep the overall bandwidth of the data link  to a low level, the bit-rate bat which each audio component is sent from each codec , , and , to the playback computer , can be set significantly lower than the bit-rate, b, at which the spatially transmitted data is sent. As mentioned previously, the lower bit rate bdoes not necessarily have to be the same for each component.","Referring now to , a practical embodiment of the playback part of the audio system of  is shown. The playback computer  is connected, by a cable  to an audio transducer, in this case a set of speakers . Also, the playback computer  is connected to a user-control device, in this case a head-mountable position sensor . This connection is made by means of a cable . The use of the cables  and  is not essential, and the wireless data link methods mentioned above could be used (e.g. Bluetooth).","In use, a user is positioned in front of the speakers  and wears the head-mountable position sensor . The position sensor  is arranged to generate direction data which is representative of the direction in which the user is facing (alternatively, it may be chosen to be representative of the gaze direction of the user, i.e. where the user's general direction of sight is directed, though this requires a more sophisticated sensor). Next, the user listens to the sounds being emitted from the speakers . The spatially processed data and the first, second, and third audio components are received from the source computer  and so first, second and third sounds are heard at three different positions in the three-dimensional audio field. The first, second, and third sounds are represented by the symbols and The first sound is heard to the left of the user's head, the second sound in front of the user's head, and the third sound to the right of the user's head. The first, second, and third sounds and represent different services which may be accessed from the source computer  by means of the data link . The sounds are preferably indicative of the actual service they represent. Thus, the first sound may be \u201cE-mail\u201d if it represents an E-mail service, the second sound \u201crestaurant\u201d if it represents a restaurant information service, and the third sound \u201cbanking\u201d if it represents an on-line banking service. In use, the user will choose one of the sounds, in three-dimensional space, as a \u2018focus\u2019 sound, by means of looking in the general direction of the sound. This focus sound is chosen on the basis that the user will have an interest in this particular sound. The determination as to which sound is the focus sound may be used to output that sound at a higher volume, for example.","Referring to the specific case shown in it will be seen that the user's gaze direction is generally in the forwards direction, i.e. towards the second sound This is the focus sound. In the user has chosen the third sound as the focus sound.","The above-described method, whereby a set of spatially processed data, and separate audio components are received and output to a transducer means (e.g. a set of speakers) is controlled by software provided on the processor .","Whilst the above-described embodiment utilises a head-mountable position sensor , many different user-control devices  can be used. For example, the user might indicate the focus component by means of a control switch or button on a keyboard. Alternatively, a voice recognition facility may be provided, whereby the user states directional commands such as \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d in order to rotate the audio field and so bring the desired sound to a focus position. The command may even comprise the sound or jingle itself.","Once the user has decided that a particular sound should be operated (bearing in mind that each sound in the audio field represents a service which can be accessed from the source computer ) then, in a further stage, the user operates the service. This can be performed by the user pressing a particular button on a keyboard, or by saying a keyword, if a voice recognition facility is provided, when the desired service is selected as the focus sound. The effect of operating the service is analogous to a user clicking on an Internet-style hyperlink. By operating the service represented by sound, a further set of sound-based services can be presented as sub-links within the original sound based service. Thus, if the user operates the \u201cE-mail\u201d sound based service, then a further set of sounds may be presented, e.g. \u201cinbox\u201d, \u201coutbox\u201d, \u201csent E-mails\u201d and so on.","In the above embodiments, although the interactive audio system has been described with one audio source, it will be appreciated that the individual audio components might originate from a number of different audio sources. For some applications, the positional data for the audio components may, at least partly, be determined at the playback terminal, and transmitted to the audio source. An example of how this would be useful is where the exact position and relative orientation of the user within a locally defined co-ordinate system is known only by the playback terminal (e.g. from magnetic sensors and location sensors), the information from the sensors being sent back to the audio source so as to determine where each sound is to be located.","Whilst the concept of a \u2018focus\u2019 sound or track has been described above in relation to a single sound, it is possible for more than one sound or track to be a focus at a particular point in time.","As has been described above, a technique is provided in order to minimise, or at least reduce, the bandwidth required to transmit the audio components to the user device (i.e. the playback computer ), whilst preserving a high quality three-dimensional audio interface. In this technique, the three-dimensional audio processing is performed at the source of the audio components. This can be some network node that aggregates audio components. As discussed above, subsequent transmission across a lossy channel will result in a degradation of the three-dimensional spatialisation of the audio interface.","To combat this degradation, a low bandwidth \u2018tracer\u2019 for each audio component is transmitted to the user device in addition to the three-dimensional spatialised audio signal. The tracer may comprise a description of the component's intended position in the three-dimensional audio field and a low-bitrate version of the audio data. The low bit-rate audio data in the tracer is of much lower quality than the main three-dimensional audio signal and its components. However, due to its correlation with the original audio component, it is sufficient to allow association by the human ear with the corresponding component in the main three-dimensional signal.","At the user device, the tracers are used to add the low-bitrate (low quality) versions of each component to the three-dimensional audio field with high positional accuracy (noting that even poor quality audio signals may be positioned with high accuracy in a three-dimensional audio field). The combination of a high quality signal with low three-dimensional audio positional accuracy, and a set of low quality signals with high three-dimensional audio positional accuracy results in the restoration of the human perception of three-dimensional position to the degraded three-dimensional audio signal.","An advantage of this technique is that the three-dimensional audio channel may be generated in a network-based device, thereby reducing the bandwidth required in the access network to that of a stereo channel. Those devices capable of rendering three-dimensional audio may request the additional tracers whilst other devices may simply render the main stereo channel. The bandwidth required to transmit the tracers is small compared to that required to transmit all component signals."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a, ","b ","c "],"b":["1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":"4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
