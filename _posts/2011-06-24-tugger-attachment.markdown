{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) from provisional application Ser. No. 61\/420,103, entitled Tugger Attachment, filed on Dec. 6, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present inventive concepts relate generally to the field of warehouse equipment, and more particularly to equipment used to transport objects within a warehouse or similar environment.","A warehouse is a facility primarily used for storage of goods for commercial purposes. The storage is generally intended to be temporary; as such goods ultimately may be intended for a retailer, consumer or customer, distributor, transporter or other subsequent receiver. A warehouse can be a standalone facility, or can be part of a multi-use facility. Thousands of types of items can be stored in a typical warehouse. The items can be small or large, individual or bulk. It is common to load items on a pallet for transportation, and the warehouse may use pallets as a manner of internally transporting and storing items.","A well-run warehouse is well-organized and maintains an accurate inventory of goods. Goods can come and go frequently, throughout the day, in a warehouse. In fact, some large and very busy warehouses work three shifts, continually moving goods throughout the warehouse as they are received or needed to fulfill orders. Shipping and receiving areas, which may be the same area, are the location(s) in the warehouse where large trucks pick-up and drop-off goods. The warehouse can also include a staging area\u2014as an intermediate area between shipping and receiving\u2014and storage aisles and areas within the warehouse where the goods are stored. The staging area, for example, can be used for confirming that all items on the shipping manifest were received in acceptable condition. It can also be used to assemble or otherwise prepare orders for shipping.","Goods in a warehouse tend to be moved in one of two ways, either by pallet or by cart (or trailer). A pallet requires a pallet transport for movement, such as a pallet jack, pallet truck, forklift, or stacker. A stacker is a piece of equipment that is similar to a fork lift, but can raise the pallet to significantly greater heights, e.g., for loading a pallet on a warehouse shelf A cart requires a tugger (or \u201ctow cart\u201d), which pulls the cart from place to place.","A pallet transport can be manual or motorized. A traditional pallet jack is a manually operated piece of equipment, as is a traditional stacker. When a pallet transport is motorized, it can take the form of a powered pallet jack, pallet truck, or forklift (or lift truck). A motorized stacker is referred to as a power stacker. A motorized pallet jack is referred to as a powered pallet jack, which an operator cannot ride, but walks beside. A pallet truck is similar to a powered pallet jack, but includes a place for an operator to stand.","As with motorized pallet transports, a tugger can be in the form of a drivable vehicle or in the form of a powered vehicle along the side of which the operator walks. In either form, a tugger includes a hitch that engages with a companion part on the cart, such as a sturdy and rigid ring or loop.","Automatic guided vehicle (AGV) forms of pallet trucks and powered tuggers exist. An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers to make its way without direct or remote control by an operator. They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or a warehouse, such as in the case of AGV forklifts and AGV tuggers.","To date, pallet transports and tuggers represent two distinct types of equipment. In the case of powered equipment, such units are not only expensive to purchase or lease, but can also be expensive to maintain. For this reason, motorized pallet transports and tuggers tend to be in short supply in a warehouse, and if such a unit becomes inoperable, the efficiency of the warehouse is naturally negatively impacted. Such negative impacts can ripple though the supply chain, as an underperforming warehouse can cause delays in receiving and shipping of goods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","112","112","112","100","114","112","114"]},"The pallet truck  includes a front drive portion  that includes a housing , within which may be located a motor and drive mechanism (not shown). Within or adjacent to housing  is a battery . Pallet truck  is controlled using a drive control arm , which includes start, drive, and stop mechanisms. A wheel (not shown) is also located in the front drive portion , usually beneath a linkage (not shown) at the bottom of drive control arm .","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a tugger attachment configured for use with a pallet transport. The pallet transport has a drive portion and a load portion having a pair of forks. The tugger attachment includes a body; a fork coupling member configured to secure the body to the forks; and a hitch supported by or coupled to the body.","The tugger attachment can be configured so that, when the tugger attachment is loaded onto the forks, the hitch is disposed substantially midway between a set of load wheels located in an end of the forks distal from the drive portion.","The tugger attachment can be configured so that, when the tugger attachment is loaded onto the forks, the hitch is disposed not beyond a centerline of a set of load wheels located in an end of the forks distal from the drive portion.","A length of the body can be such that when fully engaged by the forks, the body extends from a vertical face of the load portion of the pallet transport and places the hitch substantially at the centerline of the set of the load wheels.","The tugger attachment can further include a front coupling member that attaches the body to the pallet transport, proximate to where the drive portion meets the load portion.","The tugger attachment can further include a linkage assembly configured to couple the hitch to the forks, such that raising the forks closes the hitch and lowering the forks opens the hitch.","The linkage assembly can include a lever having a first end with an idler wheel that engages one of the load wheels; a linking member connected between a second end of the lever and a coupler hook of the hitch; and a pivot bolt located between the lever first and second ends, about which the lever pivots in response to a pulling force of the linking member.","The body can define a storage cavity.","A length of the body can be variable.","The tugger attachment can include at least one pallet transport hinge mechanism that couples the tugger attachment to the pallet transport, and is configured to enable the tugger attachment to be rotated away from the forks.","The pallet transport can be a pallet truck, fork lift, or pallet jack.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, provided is a hitch for use with a pallet transport having a pair of forks. The hitch includes a coupler that has a movable coupler hook; a connection point formed on the coupler hook; and a linkage assembly coupling the connection point of the coupler hook to at least one fork from the pair of forks, such that raising the pair of forks closes the hitch and lowering the forks opens the hitch.","The linkage assembly can include a lever having a first end with an idler wheel that engages a load wheel of the at least one fork; a linking member connected between a second end of the lever and the connection point of the coupler hook; and a pivot bolt located between the lever first and second ends, about which the lever pivots in response to a pulling force of the linking member.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, provided is a method of adapting a pallet transport for use as a tugger, the pallet transport having a drive portion and a load portion having a pair of forks. The method includes coupling a tugger attachment to the pair of forks of the pallet transport. The tugger attachment includes a body; a fork coupling member configured to secure the body to the forks; and a hitch coupled to or supported by the body.","The method can further comprise loading the tugger attachment onto the forks, such that the hitch is disposed substantially midway between a set of load wheels located in an end of the forks distal from the drive portion.","The method can further comprise loading the tugger attachment on the forks such that the hitch is disposed not beyond a centerline of a set of load wheels located in an end of the forks distal from the drive portion.","The method can further comprise using a front coupling member of the tugger attachment to attach the body to the pallet transport, proximate to where the drive portion meets the load portion.","The method can further comprise using a linkage assembly of the tugger attachment to couple the hitch to the forks, such that raising the forks closes the hitch and lowering the forks opens the hitch.","The method can further comprise adjusting a length of the body to position the hitch proximate to the load wheels.","The method can further comprise coupling the tugger attachment to the pallet transport with a hinge that enables the tugger attachment to be rotated away from the forks.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms.

Also in this embodiment, a protective bar  wraps around levers  of the linkage assembly , where the levers  are functionally coupled to the hitch  using a linking member, such as cables . The protective bar  protects the linkage assembly  and hitch  from impacts.","In the preferred embodiment, the body  is made of a rugged material, e.g., steel, that provides a stable support for the hitch . In this figure, the body  takes the form of a rigid box. However, in other embodiments, body  can take the form of a rigid frame, which does not form an enclosure. In various embodiments, the length of the body  may be made adjustable to enable selectable positioning of the hitch  with respect to load wheels  of the pallet transport.","In this embodiment, the body  defines a cavity  configured for storage, e.g., to receive one or more traction weights. The cavity is covered by a hatch door , in this embodiment. The hatch door  can be secured to the rest of body  by, for example, four hexagon socket button head cap screws, or by other known securing mechanisms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 6A"],"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["240","242","210","240","243","241","210","237","241","245"]},"In this embodiment, linkage assembly  includes cable  having a first end that attaches to connection point  of hitch . Cable  passes through an opening in the body , and a second end of cable  connects to a lever . Lever  also passes through body  and attaches to protection bar  via a pivot bolt . An idler wheel  is attached to an opposite end of lever  and engages with a fork when the tugger attachment  is loaded on a pallet transport. In this embodiment, therefore, linkage assembly  can include cable  and lever  with pivot bolt  and idler wheel . The linkage assembly could include two lever , pivot bolt , and idler wheel  combinations, one for each fork, as in various embodiments shown herein. But in other embodiments, only one such combination may be used.","In operation, when the tugger attachment  is loaded onto a pallet transport, such as pallet truck , the idler wheel  is at rest on a load wheel  of fork . When the forks are raised, the fork wheels remain on the ground and the idler wheel  remains at rest, while the body  and hitch  are raised with the forks. This causes the lever  to rotate about pivot bolt  and reduce tension on cable , which in turn lowers coupler hook  into the closed position. Conversely, when the forks are lowered, the lever  is rotated in the opposite direction, which applies tension to cable , which in turn pulls open coupler hook . As a result, the coupler hook  is automatically opened and closed with the lowering and raising of the forks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["200","210","210","220","210","220","222","216","224","210","224","222","226","224","222","226","222","100","118","110","120","100","224","222","200","120","100"]},"Also visible from the side view is fork coupling member  disposed at the bottom  of the tugger attachment , which aids in securing the tugger attachment  to the forks of a pallet transport.
