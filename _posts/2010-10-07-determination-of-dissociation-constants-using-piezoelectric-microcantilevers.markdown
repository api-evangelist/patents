title: Determination of dissociation constants using piezoelectric microcantilevers
abstract: A method for determining the dissociation constant (K) by plotting resonance frequency shift as a function of time for various target analyte concentrations. From this graph, the fraction of saturation, i.e. equilibrium fraction of bound binding sites out of all available binding sites on the sensor surface may be estimated by taking the ratio of the equilibrium resonance frequency shift at a selected concentration to the equilibrium frequency shift of the sensor. The dissociation constant is the inverse slope of the line produced by graphing the fraction of saturation as a function of concentration. This method is particularly useful for the study of protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions.

This work was also supported by the Nanotechnology Institute (NTI) of southeastern Pennsylvania.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to methods for determining dissociation constants.","2. Description of the Related Technology","Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, as they are the main components of the physiological metabolic pathways of cells. Quantification of protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions is an important step towards understanding the physiological metabolic pathways. A key parameter that characterizes the strength of any protein-protein or protein-mRNA interaction is the equilibrium dissociation constant, K(in units of molar (M)) between the two molecules. Traditionally, Kis measured using equilibrium dialysis through a semipermeable membrane, which is tedious and time consuming.","Alternatively, one can use a surface plasma resonance (SPR) instrument, such as the optical sensor offered by Biacore, to measure K. However, such optical sensors are expensive and many laboratories do not have access to an optical sensor capable of SPR.","In this disclosure, we show that the dissociation constant, K, between two molecules can be easily and accurately measured using piezoelectric microcantilever sensors (PEMS). The advantage of the PEMS methodology is low-cost. In addition, the PEMS measurement is rapid and label-free.","U.S. Pat. No. 2006\/0065046 (Battiston) suggests a method for measuring binding constants, association or dissociation constants by measuring a piezoelectric microcantilever deflection in a stagnant body of analyte liquid and measuring deflection as a function of time for a flowing body of analyte liquid. Battiston, however, fails to provide details regarding how the dissociation constant is calculated.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,913 (Morozov) discloses a method for determining ligand interaction with macromolecules, such as proteins. In Example 1, a cantilever sensor was allowed to contact a ligand and glucose solution. Morozov estimated the binding constant from a graph of tension as a function of time for various glucose solution concentrations. By graphing the inverse tension changes of the cantilever sensor as a function of the inverse glucose concentration, Morozov was able to calculate the dissociation constant. Morozov's method, however, does not use a piezoelectric microcantilever.","Piezoelectric microcantilever sensors (PEMS) consisting of a highly piezoelectric layer bonded to a nonpiezoelectric layer are a new type of biosensors whose mechanical resonance can both be excited and detected by electrical means. With receptors immobilized on the PEMS surface, binding of antigens shifts PEMS resonance frequency. Real-time, label-free antigen detection is achieved by electrically monitoring the PEMS resonance frequency shift. J. W. Yi, W. Y. Shih, and W. H. Shih, \u201cEffect of length, width, and mode on the mass detection sensitivity of piezoelectric unimorph cantilevers,\u201d 91 (3), 1680 (2002). PEMS detection sensitivity is strongly related to the thickness and the size of the PEMS. Generally, a PEMS detection sensitivity increases with a reduced PEMS size and thickness. For example, a lead zirconate titanate (PZT)\/glass PEMS about 1 mm long consisting of a 127 \u03bcm commercial PZT layer on a 75-150 \u03bcm glass layer with a 2 mm long glass tip generally exhibited a mass detection sensitivity on the order of 10g\/Hz.

A lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate, (PbMgNbO)\u2014(PbTiO)(PMN-PT)\/tin PEMS 600-1200 \u03bcm long consisting of an 8 \u03bcm thick PMN-PT layer bonded with a 5 \u03bcm thick tin layer exhibited a mass detection sensitivity on the order of 10-10g\/Hz.

Due to thickness and size differences, for Her2 detection, with the same single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, H3, immobilized on the PEMS 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) insulation surface, a 127-\u03bcm thick PZT\/glass PEMS exhibited only a \u03bcg\/ml concentration sensitivity while an 8-\u03bcm thick PMN-PT PEMS exhibited a much lower, clinically relevant 5 ng\/ml concentration sensitivity, both in a background of 1 mg\/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) using lower-frequency flexural modes.","As shown by more recent studies, Q. Zhu, W. Y. Shih, and W.-H. Shih, \u201cMechanism of Flexural Resonance Frequency Shift of a Piezoelectric Microcantilever Sensor during Humidity Detection,\u201d 92, 183505 (2008) and Q. Zhu, W. Y.

Shih, \u201cLength and Thickness Dependence of Longitudinal Flexural Resonance Frequency Shifts of a Piezoelectric Microcantilever Sensor due to Young's Modulus Change,\u201d 104, 074503 (2008). PEMS detection resonance frequency shift was primarily due to the elastic modulus change in the piezoelectric layer from the binding-induced surface stress. As a result, the mass sensitivity of a PMN-PT PEMS and that of a PZT PEMS were respectively 300 times and 100 times higher than could be accounted for by mass loading alone. With a DC bias electric field, the mass sensitivity of a PMN-PT PEMS could even be further enhanced to more than 1000 times higher than could be accounted for by mass loading alone. Q. Zhu, W. Y. Shih, and W.-H. Shih, \u201cEnhanced Detection Resonance Frequency Shift of a Piezoelectric Microcantilever Sensor by a DC Bias Electric Field in Humidity Detection,\u201d Sensors and Actuators, B 138, 1 (2009). These studies also revealed that due to the presence of the highly piezoelectric layer, PEMS could exhibit high-frequency non-flexural resonance modes such as width, length and thickness extension modes that silicon-based microcantilevers lack. Q. Zhu, W. Y. Shih, and W.-H. Shih, \u201cMechanism of the Flexural Resonance Frequency Shift of a Piezoelectric Microcantilever Sensor in a DC Bias Electric Field,\u201d 92, 033503 (2008).","At the same time, it was also shown that as a result of the elastic modulus change mechanism, a PEMS relative resonance frequency shift, \u0394f\/f, was directly proportional to the binding-induced surface stress and inversely proportional to the PEMS thickness where \u0394f and f denotes a PEMS resonance frequency shift and resonance frequency, respectively. This suggests that under the same detection conditions, \u0394f could be higher with a high-frequency resonance mode to result in higher detection sensitivity. As non-flexural extension mode resonance occur at a much higher frequency than flexural-mode resonance, detection using non-flexural resonance modes potentially can increase PEMS sensitivity without size reduction.","The invention is directed to a method for determining the dissociation constant (K) by plotting resonance frequency shift as a function of time for various target analyte concentrations. From this graph, the fraction of saturation, i.e. equilibrium fraction of bound binding sites out of all available binding sites on the sensor surface may be estimated by taking the ratio of the equilibrium resonance frequency shift at a selected concentration to the saturated equilibrium frequency shift of the sensor at a higher concentration. The dissociation constant is the inverse slope of the line produced by graphing the fraction of saturation as a function of concentration.","For illustrative purposes, the principles of the present invention are described by referencing various exemplary embodiments thereof.

Receptors are coated on the surface of PEMS to bind molecules of interest. The PEMS detects a change because newly bound target molecules shift the mechanical resonance frequency of the device. By monitoring the resonance frequency shifts, a PEMS is capable of rapid, label-free, in situ quantitative detection of organic compounds or molecules including pathogens, antigens and proteins in a small volume solution (e.g. 100 \u03bcl) or in a cell culture using simple all-electrical measurements. PEMS are capable of electric actuation and detection and may also be constructed as an array for simultaneous monitoring of multiple target compounds or molecules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1(","FIG. 1("],"i":["a","a"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","9"]},"Conductive elements ,  may be any element capable of conducting an electrical signal from the piezoelectric layer to a device for detecting that signal. In a preferred embodiment, conductive elements  and  are electrodes which may be constructed from any conductive material. Preferably, the first electrode  is constructed from Au\/Cr or Pt\/Ti and subsequently patterned in several regions. The second electrode  is preferably constructed from Pt\/TiOon SiOfor PZT\/SiOPEMS or Pt\/Ti on a metal substrate or non-piezoelectric layer and subsequently patterned as well.","In order to maintain functionality in solution by preventing conduction, it may be useful to electrically separate or buffer conductive element  and second conductive element . Conductive element  is patterned slightly smaller than the piezoelectric layer  to ensure complete insulation of the edges and corners thereof. Any electrically insulating layer  may be used as a coating to achieve electrical separation or buffering.","Alternatively, a PEMS may be insulated using self-assembled monolayers with hydrophobic properties, preferably methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) or a combination of MTMS with parylene coatings of varying thicknesses, may also be used. When immersed in a PBS solution, an MTMS insulated piezoelectric microcantilever yields strong resonance peak intensities and prevents background resonance frequency shifts greater than 30 Hz over a period of 30 minutes.","Other insulation materials may include 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane, AlO, SiOand any functional hydrophobic silane, having a hydrophobic group selected from the group consisting of alkyl, phenyl, alkyl halide, alkene, alkyne, and sulfhydryl. In a preferred embodiment, the insulation material is mercaptopropylsilane (MPTS), which can also function to immobilize a receptor on the cantilever.

Any receptor, such as specially synthesized cavitants, DNA oligonucleotides, proteins, single chain variable fragments (scFvs), enzymes, and antibodies to cells, antigens, pathogens, viruses, parasites, or combinations thereof may be bound to the sensor surface.","Any means of adhering receptors  to the sensor surface may be utilized. In a preferred embodiment, receptors  are bound to the electrodes using an immobilization coating 4, such as self assembled monolayers (\u201cSAM\u201d), MPTS and bi-functional linkers. In one embodiment, for purposes of binding scFv, the immobilization coating may be a self assembled monolayer of 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA) on a copper and gold-coated electrode activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropy)carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 5 mg\/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS).","The PEMS also includes at least one non-piezoelectric layer , which may be fabricated from any compatible material, including a ceramic material, a polymeric material, a metallic material or combinations thereof. Preferably the non-piezoelectric layer  is fabricated from silicon dioxide (SiO) and silicon nitride (SiN) for PZT-thin film based PEMS. For example, a silicon nitride coating on single crystal silicon wafer may be prepared by low press chemical vapor deposition. A low stress silicon dioxide layer may subsequently be deposited on the silicon nitride layer by growing silicon dioxide films using low temperature oxide deposition or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. For PMN-PT-based PEMS, the non-piezoelectric layer can be any ceramic, metallic, or polymeric layer. A metallic layer such as Cu, tin, Ni, Ti, etc., or any combination is preferred because it can be provided by simple electroplating.","Non-piezoelectric layer  may be bonded to a shorter piezoelectric layer  so that the portion of non-piezoelectric layer  extending beyond the end of piezoelectric layer  forms a non-piezoelectric tip. Both piezoelectric layer  and non-piezoelectric layer  may be attached to a clamp. In an alternative embodiment, piezoelectric layer  may extend beyond non-piezoelectric layer , forming a piezoelectric tip. Optionally, the PEMS may be constructed so that neither piezoelectric layer  nor the non-piezoelectric layer  extends beyond the other. In order to achieve the best results, one of the piezoelectric  and non-piezoelectric layers  preferably extends beyond the other to form a tip. A PEMS may also include multiple piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric layers. For example, a non-piezoelectric layer may be placed between two piezoelectric layers or a piezoelectric layer may be placed between two non-piezoelectric layers.","A significant aspect of the microcantilever device is the fabrication of a highly piezoelectric layer , which enables electrical detection and actuation within the cantilever. The piezoelectric layer may function as a driving element, vibrating element and sensing element. Applying an AC voltage (input) across the piezoelectric layer bends and vibrates the PEMS, which in turn induces a piezoelectric voltage that produces readily detectable changes in the magnitude and phase of the output voltage. The resonance frequency of the PEMS is obtained by monitoring the maximum of the phase shift of the output voltage. This measurement is accomplished all-electrically, i.e., electrical actuation and electrical sensing.","Piezoelectric layer  may be constructed from any piezoelectric material, including a lead-free piezoelectric material such as (NaK)LiNbO(hereinafter \u201cSb\u2014NKNLN\u201d), Sb\u2014(NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(hereinafter \u201cSb\u2014NKNLT\u201d), Sr\u2014(NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(Sr\u2014NKNLN), Sr\u2014NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(Sr\u2014NKNLT), SbSr\u2014(NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(SrSb\u2014NKNLN), SrSb\u2014NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(SbSr\u2014NKNLT), solid solutions with (BiK)TiO, (BiNa)TiO, Ba(ZrTi)O.

The simplest standing wave that can form under these circumstances is one-quarter wavelength long. To make the next possible standing wave, both a node and an antinode are added, dividing the drawing up into thirds. This now gives three-quarters of a wavelength. Repeating this procedure, five-quarters of a wavelength is obtained, then seven-quarters, etc. In this arrangement, there are always an odd number of quarter wavelengths present. Thus the wavelengths of the harmonics are always fractional multiples of the fundamental wavelength with an odd number in the denominator Likewise, the frequencies of the harmonics are always odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. ) depicts the waves that satisfy the boundary conditions for length mode extension vibrations. Therefore as a result of the boundary conditions, the equation that can be used to predict the frequency of the length mode is",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"c","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"L"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"m","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"L"}},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mi":["Y","\u03c1"]}}}}}}}},"The value f is resonant frequency, w is the width, a is a constant indicating the number of wavelengths and, is the speed of sound, which is defined by the square root of the Young's modulus (Y) divided by density (\u03c1). Similar to the width mode, this equation can be validated by constructing 20 PEMS with varying lengths, and measuring the frequency for the first mode of length vibration. The lengths of the cantilevers were measured under a microscope at 6\u00d7, and the standard deviation accounts for the fact that the cantilevers were not perfect rectangles and the lengths will vary due to imperfections in the geometry. The resonant frequency is measured using an impedance analyzer, and the standard deviation of the frequency accounts for the variations in Q values and any twinning that might occur in the peak. Only the first length modes are included in the analysis and as a result the value m is set to 1.","Length mode peaks are different from low-frequency flexural modes in that the frequency of the length extension mode can be related to the length of the PEMS as F=c\/41 where F is the resonance frequency, c the sound velocity, and 1 the length of the cantilever. For the first width extension mode and thickness extension mode, the resonance frequencies are related to the width, w and thickness, t as F=c\/2w and F=d\/2t, respectively. The difference between an extension mode and a flexural mode is that given the same applied ac voltage, the vibration amplitude of an extension mode is much smaller than that of the flexural mode. For example, give an ac voltage amplitude of 0.1V, the vibration amplitude of the first length mode of a 1 mm long PEMS is around one tenth of a nm whereas the vibration amplitude of the first flexural mode is around a hundred nm. Because of the small vibration amplitude involved in a length extension mode, liquid damping does not shift the resonance frequency as much as it does to the low-frequency, high-vibration amplitude of flexural mode, an advantage in in-liquid detection. The present invention can be operated in any of the length, width and thickness extension modes.","To further increase sensitivity and expedite the detection process, the PEMS may be immersed in a flowing solution for in-solution detection.

In one exemplary embodiment, the change in the Young's modulus may be up to about 70%. The change in the Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer is preferably greater than about 25%. Most preferably, the change in the Young's modulus may be about 25% to about 70%. One of the factors that induces a change in the Young's modulus is non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching.","By inducing and\/or enhancing non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching, it may be possible to further increase the detection sensitivity of the PEMS in comparison to non-piezoelectric or weak piezoelectric microcantilevers of the same dimension. One means for inducing non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching may be application of stress produced by the binding of target molecules or compounds. In another exemplary embodiment, non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching may be induced by exposing the PEMS to a DC bias electric field. The DC bias electric field may be established using any conventional means and may involve applying a DC voltage across a thickness, length or width of piezoelectric layer . Preferably, the established DC bias electric field (E) is from about \u221220 kV\/cm to about 20 kV\/cm, more preferably, from about \u221210 kV\/cm to about 10 kV\/cm, and, most preferably, from about \u22128 kV\/cm to about 10 kV\/cm. A positive value for E denotes an applied electric field that is parallel to the poling direction of the piezoelectric layer. A negative value for E denotes an applied electric field that is opposite to the poling direction of the piezoelectric layer. By establishing a DC bias electric field, the flexural frequency shift and hence, detection sensitivity, may be further increased by a factor of up to about three in comparison to the sensitivity PEMS operated without a DC bias electric field. The DC bias electric field changes the polarization configuration such that it increases polarization domain switching, which in turn enhances the resonance frequency shift enabling enhanced detection sensitivity. The degree of detection sensitivity enhancement is dependent upon the piezoelectric material, the thickness of the piezoelectric layer, whether it is bonded to a non-piezoelectric layer, the physical properties, i.e. thickness and\/or material characteristics of the non-piezoelectric layer and any combination thereof.","The method may further involve enabling detection of a species of interest using any resonance frequency peak and any resonance frequency modes. In an exemplary embodiment, the PEMS may be operated in a flexural resonance mode, a longitudinal resonance mode, such as a length mode, a width mode and\/or a thickness mode, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the PEMS may be capable of length-mode and width-mode detection, which enables more sensitive detection with high peak frequency intensities and minimized damping effects. More preferably, the PEMS is capable of enhanced detection sensitivity using both flexural and longitudinal resonance modes. In an exemplary embodiment, the PEMS may be used at resonance frequencies within the range of about 10 kHz to about 10 GHz.","The present invention is generally applicable for the investigation and study of, for example, protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions. This is an important step towards understanding the physiological metabolic pathways. A key parameter that characterizes the strength of protein-protein or protein-mRNA interactions is the equilibrium dissociation constant, K(in units of molar (M)) between the two molecules which can be determined using the method of the present invention.","The invention is applicable to, for example, antigen and antibody interactions. The specific association of antigens and antibodies is dependent on intermolecular forces between antigen and antibody such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic forces, and van der Waals forces. These are all noncovalent bonds, but can be quite strong, with interaction forces ranging from 10 to 100 pN.

In each case, the dissociation constant, Kd, can be determined using the method of the present invention. In each case, appropriate receptors are selected for immobilization on the cantilever sensor and the same methodology is employed as for determining the dissociation constant for protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Suitable receptors may include, for example, a complementary strand of DNA or a substrate that allows reversible adsorption of a particular gas. Skilled persons can choose a suitable receptor for a particular reaction to determine the dissociation constant.","The invention is directed to a method for determining the dissociation constant (K) by plotting resonance frequency shift as a function of time for various target analyte concentrations. From this graph, the fraction of saturation, i.e. equilibrium fraction of bound binding sites out of all available binding sites on the sensor surface may be estimated by taking the ratio of the equilibrium resonance frequency shift at a selected concentration to the equilibrium frequency shift of the sensor. The dissociation constant is the inverse slope of the line produced by graphing the fraction of saturation as a function of concentration.","For obtaining a resonance frequency shift, the piezolelectric microcantilever sensor (PEMS) is contacted with the target analyte, for example, using a flow cell. Other suitable, conventional methods for contacting the PEMS with the target analyte are also possible and within the scope of the present invention.","The resonance frequency shift of the PEMS sensor is then determined as a function of time for a plurality of known target analyte concentrations. An equilibrium frequency shift of the sensor can be determined by plotting the resonance frequency shift versus time and identifying when the equilibrium condition has been reached, e.g. when the frequency shift stabilizes. The sensor is also calibrated to determine its equilibrium frequency shift in the absence of the analyte so as to provide a baseline for the determination.","From this information, the fraction of saturation (\u03b8) may be accurately estimated by taking the ratio of the equilibrium resonance frequency shift at a selected concentration to the equilibrium frequency shift of the sensor. The dissociation constant may then be determined by calculating the inverse slope of the line produced by graphing the fraction of saturation as a function of the plurality of known analyte concentrations.","The present method provides a reliable, easily implemented method for the determination of dissociation constants which employs relatively inexpensive equipment and can be carried out in real-time.","The PZT\/glass PEMS used in this study consisted of a commercial PZT layer (T105-H4E-602, Piezo System, Cambridge, Mass.) 127 \u03bcm thick, 970 \u03bcm long and 580 \u03bcm wide bonded to a 75 \u03bcm thick glass layer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.) with a 1.8 mm long glass tip protruding from the free end. The PEMS was fabricated by first bonding the PZT layer to the glass layer using a nonconductive epoxy (Loctite, Rocky Hill, Conn.) and embedding the PZT\/glass bilayer in wax. The PZT\/glass bilayer was then cut to strips with a wire saw (Princeton Scientific Precision, Princeton, N.J.). After attaching the wires to the top and bottom electrodes using conductive glue (XCE 3104XL, Emerson and Cuming Company, Billerica, Mass.), a PZT\/Glass strip was glued to a glass substrate to form the microcantilever shape. An optical micrograph of the PZT\/glass PEMS is shown in . The resonance peak used for this detection was the first longitudinal extension mode at around 504 kHz in air with a Q value of 45 and around 429 kHz in diluted serum with a Q value of 15 as shown in the resonance spectra in .","For the initial 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) deposition, the PEMS were first cleaned in a diluted (1:100 in water) piranha solution (two parts of 98% sulfuric acid (Fisher, Fair Lawn, N.J.) with one part of 30% hydrogen peroxide (FisherBiotech, Fair Lawn, N.J.)) at 20\u00b0 C. for 1 minute followed by soaking in a 40 mM MPS solution in ethanol covered with paraffin film for 4 hours and rinsing by de-ionized (DI) water. They were then soaked in a 0.01 M NaOH solution overnight for cross-linking, followed by soaking in DI water for 1 hour and overnight vacuum-oven drying (Model 1400E, VWR International) at 762 mm Hg to conclude the first MPS coating. For each of the subsequent MPS depositions, they were soaked overnight in a freshly prepared 40 mM MPS solution in ethanol titrated to pH=4.5 with acetic acid. This procedure was repeated two times to give a total of 3 MPS depositions to provide an MPS thickness of about 150 nm.","The target Her2 extracellular domain (ECD) was expressed from stably-transfected HEK-293 cells and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) in a conventional manner. The anti-Her2 scFv, H3, was isolated from a na\u00efve human scFv phage display library using conventional techniques. Her2 ECD obtained as described above was coated onto a Maxisorp-Immunotube (NUNC, Denmark) at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg\/mL in coating buffer (Bup-H carbonate bicarbonate buffer; Pierce) at 4\u00b0 C., overnight. scFv-Phage library stock (100 \u03bcL; 1.3\u00d710pfu\/mL) was added to the immunotubes to pan (isolate) anti-Her2 scFv-phage clones. The H3 clone was isolated following four rounds of selection, was sequenced and subcloned into the pCyn expression vector. Soluble scFv were expressed in TG1, isolated from the periplasmic space and purified by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography and HPLC on a Superdex75 column (Pharmacia). Final yields were 1-2 mg of pure H3 scFv per liter of expression culture. Specificity for Her2 ECD was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore 1000 instrument and by flow cytometry against Her2 overexpressing human tumor cell lines.","Sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (Pierce) was used as the bi-functional linker for scFv immobilization on MPS. First, the scFv was linked to sulfo-SMCC using a 1 ml solution 900 nM scFv and 80 \u03bcM sulfo-SMCC for 2 hr at 4\u00b0 C. The NHS-ester in the sulfo-SMCC will react with a primary amine of the scFv. Unreacted sulfo-SMCC molecules were then removed by repeating microcentrifugation at 6000 RPM with a 10 kD filter (Millipore) three times. The MPS-coated PEMS was then soaked in the sulfo-SMCC-linked scFv solution with 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Pierce) for 2 hr to immobilize the scFv on the MPS coating surface via the reaction of the maleimide of the sulfo-SMCC with the sulfhydryl of the MPS. The adsorption density, F, of the SMCC-linked scFv on the MPS was estimated to be \u0393=7 ng\/mm. from a separate measurement using a quartz crystal microbalance.","A human serum typically contains about 40 mg\/ml of albumin which helps maintain the blood osmotic pressure to prevent leaking of the fluid from the blood to tissues. Albumin is by far the most abundant protein in serum and the major source of potential non-specific binding. To minimize potential non-specific binding in diluted serum (1) the detection was carried out in 1 in 40 diluted human serum (one part of human serum with 40 parts of PBS, and (2) the sensor surface was blocked with a 30 mg\/ml BSA (Bovine serum Albumin) solution in PBS prior to detection.","For Her2 detection, the scFv-immobilized PEMS was then immersed in a home-built flow cell with a peristaltic pump (model 77120-62, Cole-Parmer's Master Flex, Vernon Hills, Ill.) for both BSA blocking and Her2 detection with the PEMS's two faces tangential to the flow at a flow rate of 0.7 ml\/min. The flow cell contained 6 ml of liquid.","To illustrate the real-time nature of the PEMS, after the scFv was chemically bonded to SMCC as described above, the MPS-coated PEMS was then placed in the flow cell and subjected to scFv immobilization, BSA blocking, and Her2 detection at a flow rate of 0.7 ml\/min. The resonance frequency shift versus time in this sequence is shown in . It started with immersing the PEMS in PBS for 15 minutes in period I at t=0-15 min. As can be seen, during this period, the resonance frequency of the PEMS remained at 0\u00b130 Hz.","This PBS period was followed with the immobilization of the SMCC-linked scFv in period II at t=15-44 minutes in which the resonance frequency of PEMS decreased with time, yielding a resonance frequency shift of roughly \u2212430 Hz at=44 min. After the scFv immobilization procedure, PBS was then flown for 15 minutes in period III at t=44-59 minutes to remove any unbound scFv from the flow cell. During this second PBS period, the shift in resonance frequency was 0\u00b125 Hz, again indicating that the resonance frequency of PEMS was stable with time in PBS. Between t=59 minutes to 185 minutes in period IV, a 30 mg\/ml BSA solution in PBS was flown in the flow cell to preemptively saturate the unoccupied sites on the sensor surface with BSA to minimize potential non-specific binding later in the Her2 detection in diluted human serum.","The resonance frequency shift due to the non-specific BSA binding to the unoccupied sites saturated at around t=172 minutes, yielding a net resonance frequency shift of about -1470 Hz. Following the BSA blocking, the PEMS was rinsed with a 10 mg\/ml BSA and 0.1% Tween20 solution in period V at t=185-195 minutes. Again, during this rinsing period, the resonance frequency of the PEMS remained fairly stable throughout. The PEMS was then exposed to the flow of diluted human serum containing 600 ng\/ml of Her2 in period VI at t=185-278 minutes over which period the PEMS exhibited a resonance frequency shift of \u2212520 Hz. A final background check of flow of diluted serum was conducted in period VII at t=278-295 minutes. As can be seen, in period VII, the resonance frequency of the PEMS also remained stable in diluted serum after the detection.","To show that the resonance frequency shifts shown in  at various times were indeed reliable, the phase angle versus frequency resonance spectra of the PEMS is shown at t=5 minutes in PBS, at t=50 minutes after the scFv immobilization, at t=180 minutes after the BSA blocking, and at t=275 minutes after the Her2 detection during the above test in . As can be seen, the shape and height of the resonance peak remained roughly constant throughout the test, indicating that the resonance frequency shifts shown in  were indeed reliable.","To find out the detection concentration limit of the longitudinal extension mode of the PZT\/glass PEMS, the dose response of Her2 in diluted human serum was examined. Before each detection step the PEMS was stripped of the bound scFv and reinsulated with MPS. Fresh scFv was then immobilized on the PEMS surface using procedures as described above. The PEMS was then subjected to a PBS flow across the PEMS surface for 10 minutes to establish the background followed by 30 mg\/ml BSA blocking in a flow until the resonance frequency of the PEMS saturated (about 2 hours) followed by rinsing with 10 mg\/ml BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. The PEMS was then exposed to diluted human serum spiked with Her2 in one of the following concentrations: 60,000, 6,000, 600, 60, and 6 ng\/ml. In this study, the scFv was immobilized after each detection step as opposed to simply releasing the Her2 in a glycine\/HCl buffer solution after detection to ensure that the binding performance of the scFv in each detection step was roughly identical.","The obtained resonance frequency shift versus time in diluted serum with 60,000, 6,000, 600, 60, 6, and 0 ng\/ml (corresponding to 600, 60, 6, 0.6, 0.06, and 0 nM) of Her2 is shown in  where each curve was the average of two independent tests. As can be seen, at t=60 minutes, the PEMS yielded a resonance frequency shifts of 2250\u00b1120, \u22121060\u00b1170, \u2212531\u00b1110, \u2212160\u00b1150, \u221235\u00b115, and 0\u00b115 Hz in diluted serum with 60,000, 6,000, 600, 60, 6 and 0 ng\/ml of Her2, respectively. Note that at 0 ng\/ml of Her2 in diluted serum, the PEMS exhibited no net shift in resonance frequency throughout the 60 minutes of exposure with a standard deviation of about 15 Hz. The 35\u00b115 Hz shift at t=60 minutes at 6 ng\/ml seemed well above the standard deviation of the control (15 Hz) or that at 6 ng\/ml (also 15 Hz). The reason for the slow, almost linear response over the 60 minutes of detection at this concentration was in part due to the low concentration of 6 ng\/ml as well as the moderately low affinity of this scFv. It is also worth noting that the noise level (standard deviation) was considerably higher at a higher Her2 concentration: 120, 170, 110, 150 at 60,000, 6,000 600, 60 ng\/ml of Her2, respectively as opposed to 15 Hz at 6 and 0 ng\/ml of Her2. The same trend has been observed in in-situ detection of other biological systems, indicative that the noise during detection was likely related to binding, unbinding and re-arrangement of the antigen on the sensor surface.","As can be seen from , at t=60 min, the resonance frequency shifts at all concentrations appeared saturated. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the resonance frequency shifts at t=60 minutes as equilibrium resonance frequency shift at theses Her2 concentrations. Therefore, in , equilibrium resonance frequency shift is plotted as approximated by the resonance frequency shift at t=60 minutes versus Her2 concentration, c.","Because the preliminary Kobtained by earlier BIAcore studies was 3.4\u00d710M, which was about 18 times smaller than the concentration of 600 nM at 60,000 ng\/ml, we thus approximated the t=60 min resonance frequency shift, \u22122250 Hz at this concentration shown in  as the equilibrium saturated resonance frequency shift, \u0394f. The fraction of saturation, \u03b8, which is defined as the equilibrium fraction of bound binding sites out of all available binding sites on the sensor surface can be estimated as the ratio of the equilibrium resonance frequency shift \u0394f(c) at concentration, c to \u0394f. Approximating the resonance frequency shift at t=60 min at concentration, c as the equilibrium \u0394f(c), the equilibrium fraction of saturation can then be deduced as \u03b8=\u0394f(c)\/\u0394f. The obtained \u03b8 versus c is plotted as open squares in .

(4), at low concentrations, \u03b8 is linear to c with a slope that is the inverse of K. In , c versus \u03b8 is plotted for the concentrations below 6 nM where \u03b8 was less than 0.25. By approximating the slope of c versus \u03b8 of  to be K, the following equation was obtained: K=3.0\u00b10.3\u00d710M. Using the obtained K, \u03b8 was calculated for all concentrations and the calculated \u03b8 was plotted as the solid line in . As can be seen, the solid line agreed well with the experimental data points, indicating the deduced Kwas reasonable. Based on the calculated \u03b8, a theoretical resonance frequency shift curve is also plotted in  as a solid line. Similar to , the solid line also agreed with the experimental data.","The binding kinetics of H3 scFv to Her2 were also examined using a BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore, Piscataway, N.J.) using recombinant Her2 bound to a CM5 sensor chip with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) bound to a different CM5 sensor chip as the reference. The response of the BIAcore was recorded at H3 scFv concentrations 150 nM and 76 nM across the Her2 and EGFR chips, respectively, and the results are shown in . The response measured from the EGFR chip was used as an assessment of the background and was subtracted from the response measured for the Her2 chip. The response of the Her2 chip after the background correction is shown in .

(4) could also be obtained as the ratio of the equilibrium response, R, to the maximum response R, as R\/R. With R=308 RU, the values of \u03b8 were determined to be 0.83 and 0.74 for 150 nM and 76 nM, respectively. These values were also plotted in  as full circles. Clearly, the full circles from the BIAcore measurements fell on the solid line deduced by the PEMS results, indicating the agreement of the Kvalue determined from BIAcore based on the fractional equilibrium response with the results obtained with the PEMS. The deduced Kvalue from the BIAcore data by fitting to Eq. (4) was also 3\u00d710M, again, in agreement with the PEMS result of 3\u00b10.3\u00d710M. In addition, the Chiparameter of the present BIAcore measurements was 6 and was smaller than 10, which indicates that the values for k, k, Kdeduced from the BIAcore were statistically valid, further conforming the validity of the Kvalue determined by the PEMS.","Real-time, label-free, in-situ detection of Her2 in diluted serum using a PZT\/glass PEMS with H3 scFv immobilized on the MPS insulation layer of the PEMS surface was demonstrated.

Furthermore, using the detection results at 0.6, 6, and 60 nM of Her2 in diluted serum, a dissociation constant, K, of 3.3\u00d710M was deduced and confirmed as being consistent with that obtained by use of a conventional BIAcore device.","Using the dose response curves of )-() and calibration curves for Herceptin and L26, the dissociation constant can be determined using the Langmuir isotherm.
