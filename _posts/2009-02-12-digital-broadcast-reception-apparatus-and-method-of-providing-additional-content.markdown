Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to digital broadcast, and more particularly, to a digital broadcast reception apparatus for inserting and providing additional content, such as advertisements, during digital broadcasts and a method of providing additional content.","2. Description of the Related Art","Client-based digital program insertion (DPI) is a function in which a multi system operator (MSO) uses an application such as a target engine or a decision engine installed in a client device, such as a set-top box, to display particular advertisements during advertising time slots between broadcast programs.","An application performs advertisement insertion by using a channel switch function, which is a function for switching from a current broadcast channel to a channel via which an advertisement stream is transmitted, and the advertisement stream is transmitted from a headend in real time in the form of an MPEG-2 transport stream (TS). A channel switching process in a client device is complex and is performed by using large amounts of resources of the client device, and thus it takes at least around one second or two seconds to perform the channel switching process.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention overcome the above disadvantages and other disadvantages not described above. Also, the present invention is not required to overcome the disadvantages described above, and an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may not overcome any of the problems described above.","The present invention provides a method of providing additional content, such as advertisements, without switching channels while a user is watching digital broadcast.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of providing additional content in a digital broadcast reception apparatus, the method including receiving a locator of additional content from a broadcast server while a user watches a broadcast program, receiving an instruction to insert the additional content from the broadcast server, receiving and reproducing the additional content from a content providing server designated by the locator, and switching back to the broadcast program.","The reception and the reproduction of the additional content may include searching for the additional content by using an address of the content providing server and a file path of the additional content that are included in the locator.","The locator may include an identifier of a channel into which the additional content is to be inserted, and the search of the additional content may further include verifying whether the broadcast channel is a channel into which the additional content is to be inserted or not by using the locator.","The content providing server is a web server. The file path is in the form of URL (uniform resource locator) and includes at least one of an identifier of a channel to insert the additional content, a switch ID for identifying a switch from a broadcast program to advertisement content, and a filename of the additional content. The search of the additional content may include, if the broadcast channel is the same as a channel into which the additional content is to be inserted, searching for a file having the same file path in the content providing server.","The reception and the reproduction of the additional content may further include, if the additional content is not found in the content providing server, reproducing underlying additional content included in a content stream of the broadcast program.","The reception of the instruction may include receiving a DPI (digital program insertion) trigger from the broadcast server.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer readable storage medium having recorded thereon a computer program for executing the method of providing additional content.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a digital broadcast reception apparatus including a broadcast reception unit receiving data from a broadcast server, an additional content reception unit receiving data from a content providing server, a playback unit reproducing data received by the broadcast reception unit and the additional content reception unit, and a control unit, which, when a locator of additional content and an instruction to insert the additional content are received while a user watches a broadcast program, controls the additional content reception unit to receive the additional content designated by the locator and controls the playback unit to switch back to the broadcast program after reproducing the received additional content.","Certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , while a user watches a broadcast program, a digital broadcast reception apparatus receives a locator of additional content to be inserted into the broadcast program of a particular channel (operation ). At this point, the locator of additional content may be transmitted in a signal indicating that additional content such as an externally provided advertisement is to be inserted into a current channel.","The locator of additional content includes information for searching for additional content to be inserted, such as an address of a content providing server which provides additional content and file paths of additional content. Furthermore, the locator of additional content may include information regarding a broadcast channel to which additional content will be inserted, and information regarding a channel may be embodied in the form of a channel identifier. Furthermore, the locator of additional content may include information for identifying insertion of additional content, that is, identifying a switch from a current broadcast program to additional content, in a current channel. Furthermore, the locator of additional content may include the name of files corresponding to additional content. The channel information, the information for identifying insertion of additional content, and the filenames may be included in the locator of additional content in the form of pathnames of files and transmitted. In the case where a content providing server is a web server, locator of additional content may be generated in the form of uniform resource locator (URL).","When a digital broadcast reception apparatus is instructed by a broadcast server to insert additional content (operation ), insertion of additional content begins. Insertion of additional content may be instructed by transmitting a digital program insertion (DPI) trigger. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and various other methods such as a timeline method may be used.","Next, additional content is received from a content providing server designated by the locator of additional content (operation ). The locator of additional content is used to search for additional content in a content providing server. If particular additional content corresponding to insertion instruction exists, the additional content is reproduced (operation ). If particular additional content corresponding to insertion instruction is not found, underlying additional content included in a content stream of a current broadcast program is reproduced. For example, underlying advertisement included in a broadcast stream is reproduced.","In the case where a channel identifier is included in the locator of additional content, it is determined whether a channel designated by the channel identifier is the same as a current channel. If the channel designated by the channel identifier is the same as the current channel, that is, if the current broadcast channel is a channel into which additional content is to be inserted, the additional content is received and reproduced. If the channel designated by the channel identifier is different from the current channel, underlying additional content included in a content stream of a current broadcast program is reproduced.","When reproduction of additional content is completed, a current broadcast program is restored (operation ).","According to the embodiment described above, a separate channel for additional content and channel switching for inserting additional content are not required, and thus additional content can be inserted precisely at an instructed time point without wasting resources. As a result, additional content can be provided without delay at a time point for inserting additional content and without any overlapping of additional contents and broadcast content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["220","221","22","223","224"]},"The broadcast reception unit  receives data, such as signals, broadcast content stream, etc., from a broadcast server . The additional content reception unit  receives additional content and data required for reproducing the additional content from a content providing server . The playback unit  reproduces a broadcast stream and additional content that are received via the broadcast reception unit  and the additional content reception unit . The control unit  controls the broadcast reception unit , the additional content reception unit , and the playback unit  to insert and reproduce additional content during playback of broadcast stream. When a locator of additional content and an instruction to insert additional content are received via the broadcast reception unit  while a user watches a broadcast program, the control unit  controls the additional content reception unit  to receive additional content designated by the locator, and controls the playback unit  to switch back to a current broadcast program after reproduction of the received additional content is completed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Referring to , a host device  communicates not only with a headend , but also with a web server  providing advertisement for insertion, and includes a decision engine , other applications , an OCAP , a switch engine , and an OCAP DPI application programming interface (API) .
