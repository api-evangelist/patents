title: System and method for creating extensible content
abstract: A system and method for generating validated extensible content using (i) a ubiquitous portable application as a lightweight data form entry tool, (ii) a business-specific DTD, and (iii) a transformation extensible stylesheet language construct (XSL). In an exemplary use, the system and method is employed to create advertisements for, e.g., a directory. Basic copy information is received in a first database accessible to advertisement salespeople. A second database that is accessible to a graphics artist periodically receives the basic copy information from the first database. The second database is in communication with a graphics workstation, wherein the workstation is operable to (i) access the second database, (ii) launch a first software program, the first software program presenting a form that is displayed on the workstation, wherein the first software program has a native file saving format that is different from a format of an XML file, (iii) at least one of modify selected fields in the form and add data to fields other than the selected fields, (iii) spawn a graphics page using the first software program to display a graphic consistent with the information in form, and (iv) save the information in the form as an XML file.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of any one of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to data management. More particularly, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for gathering data and, using an arbitrary structure such as a document type definition (DTD), generating and emitting world wide web consortium (W3C) compliant extensible markup language (XML).","While the present invention is directed generally to generating or creating any content, the following patent description focuses on collecting data (content) for creating a graphics package in the form of a dining guide directory. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that this particular instance or use of the invention is to be considered non-exhaustive and exemplary in nature only.","2. Background of the Invention","The field of graphics has enjoyed substantial growth over the past few years. As high performance computers and printers have become more readily available and inexpensive, software application writers have developed several graphics applications that have significant capabilities. For example, PhotoShop and Illustrator both from Adobe (San Jose, Calif.) provide, respectively, advanced image editing capabilities and vector graphics software. These software packages allow graphics designers to complete a graphics design from beginning to end on a single personal computer and output, for example, a portable data format (PDF) file, which can be displayed on another personal computer or can be printed.","Typically, programs such as PhotoShop and Illustrator operate using proprietary file formats that may not lend themselves to being easily manipulated for other programs to use or for any other purpose that a user might desire. In the case of yet another Adobe software package, namely Acrobat, a file format known as XFDF is employed. While this file format is known to those skilled in the art and useful for the purpose for which it was designed, the format is not universally employable. That is, the format works well with software programs written by Adobe, but may not be convenient to be used for other business-specific purposes.","Another problem existing in prior art graphics systems is the lack of data validation, meaning, for example, that required content parts related to a pre-defined structure are present. While there are tools for data entry validation against standardized structures (e.g., Documentum (Pleasonton, Calif.)), they are typically full-blown, large, stand-alone applications in their own right.","The present invention provides a ubiquitous, inexpensive way to utilize particular business structure files (e.g., document type definitions (DTDs), SML Schema, or other similar files) to allow data entry on multiple devices and platforms without rewriting the entry tool each time business content structures are changed. The present invention also provides control over the interface for data entry with a standardized construct.","More particularly, the present invention utilizes an existing, ubiquitous, portable application (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) as a lightweight (small software footprint) data form entry tool. Combined with business-content structure files (DTDs) and procedural code written to operate in conjunction with a standardized application (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) using standardized transformation extensible stylesheet language construct (XSL), the present invention provides a complete, ultra-lightweight, extensible\/repurposable tool for validated content entry and creation of content in an extensible markup language (XML) format.","Although the present invention has wide ranging applicability, it may be, for example, implemented in the specific context of publishing dining guides that may be distributed along with or in telephone books (i.e., the Yellow pages) in a particular locality. In this example, advertisement salespeople sell advertisement space in the dining guide and enter basic information such as restaurant name, address, and advertisement type in a database. This information is then populated in a form that is displayed to a graphics artist. The graphics artist modifies and\/or adds to the form as necessary. Then, the graphics artist is given an opportunity to edit the advertisement itself, which includes at least some of the information that was displayed by the form.","The graphics artist may also edit photographs and logos that may be included as part of the advertisement. Ultimately, the graphics artist saves the advertisement. In accordance with the present invention, the advertisement is saved not only in the native format of the graphics application being used (e.g., Adobe Acrobat's XFDF format), but the native format is also preferably transformed into and saved as world wide web consortium (W3C) compliant and valid XML using XSLT (extensible stylesheet language). As a result, the data\/information underlying the advertisement can be subsequently retrieved and\/or repurposed.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system and method that is designed to generate content by employing a ubiquitous and lightweight software package as a data entry tool and saving resulting data files in an XML format.","It also an object of the present invention to provide a system and a method of employing XML to easily repurpose information that might originally be collected with a different purpose in mind.","It is also an object of the present invention to facilitate the overall generation of content directed to a graphics design, directory, etc. through the use of graphics generation software packages, databases and XML.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide an extensible stylesheet language construct to transform a native application file format into a business-specific XML format.","These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent upon a reading of the following detailed description of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The purpose of the present invention is to facilitate, using standardized tools and systems, the generation of extensible content, one instance of which could be a multi-page book, insert, or other directory that comprises several types of entries. While much of the following describes an instance of a graphics product, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the scope of the present invention is intended to cover, generally, any extensible content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","201","203","203","203"],"i":["a ","b ","a","b ","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["303","301","303","305","307","307","309","303","305","303","305"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 4\u201310","FIGS. 4\u201310","FIG. 4"],"b":["307","301","303"]},"Assuming there is a match between a copy ID (and thus a corresponding file) in graphics database  and the copy ID entered in the log-on screen of , then a screen such as, for example, the screen of  is preferably displayed to the graphics artist. Using the data from the corresponding file, the form of  is populated with the information collected and stored by the salesperson. The form of  also displays an advertisement or Ad ID. While the copy ID is an identifier of a particular advertisement that may be used in, for example, several different dining guides, the Ad ID identifies a particular advertisement for a particular dining guide. In other words, each Ad ID might be associated with several different copy IDs.","Referring still to , information such as the restaurant name, its address and telephone number, as well as an e-mail address, website URL, the year the restaurant was established and a main selling point (e.g. \u201ccentrally located,\u201d or \u201creasonable prices\u201d) are displayed.","In the middle section of the screen of  additional information about the particular ad is displayed including the directory in which the ad will be published, a customer ID and the salesperson responsible for selling the ad.","In addition, on the right hand side of the middle portion of the screen of  the graphics artist is given the opportunity to choose, via a pull-down menu, a restaurant heading. An exemplary pull-down menu for restaurant headings is shown in . Also, the graphics artist is requested to include information related to heading code (HC), which is a number associated with a specific Yellow page directory heading category. The graphics artist can also choose the type of cuisine through a pull-down menu such as that shown in . Still further, the graphics artist can choose, via a pull-down menu like that shown in , a universal directory advertising code (UDAC) which specifically identifies a particular advertisement style.

Other available options can be readily gleaned from the form of . and show, respectively, additional options that would be displayed to the graphics artist in the lower left hand portion of  if the UDAC selected was a DGDL or DGTL, which are respectively a dining guide double listing and dining guide triple listing. In the case of the former, a logo or photo can be included with the advertisement. In the case of the latter, three logos or photos can be selected. As will be readily understood by those skilled in the art, the screens and options presented to the graphics artist will depend substantially on the UDAC that has been selected. In this way, the graphics artist will be prompted only for the information that is necessary to fill out and complete a particular advertisement style, thereby streamlining the overall task.","Referring again to , the lower left-hand corner of the bottom portion of the form includes an area that, after being used for, e.g., the forms of or (if necessary), preferably displays the advertisement in the format corresponding to the selected UDAC. In a preferred embodiment, the system of the present invention permits the graphics artist to click on the edit ad button located immediately below that area, thereby spawning a new graphics page within Adobe Acrobat (assuming that is the software application being used) that shows a more comprehensive view of the advertisement.  shows an exemplary screen shot of the newly-spawned page. PhotoShop or Illustrator can be used to create or edit photos or logos that are to be included in the advertisement. Once the session with PhotoShop or Illustrator is complete and the specific graphic (photo or logo) is saved, the application controlling the process according to the present invention reverts the user back to the spawned page shown in . The artist completes the ad by entering the body copy and returns to the form of  and then saves the ad in accordance with the principles of the present invention, which will be described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1101"]},"Having received the PO, the artist launches a software program by opening a file such as \u201clogin.pdf\u201d(step ), which is a PDF formatted file that causes Adobe Acrobat to be automatically launched. Login.pdf is a form that preferably includes fields for entering an artist's user ID and a copy ID (), which presumably is available from the PO. The copy ID is a numeric number tagged to a particular file and is preferably linked to a particular customer. Preferably, each customer has its own unique number.","At step , the process according to the present invention checks graphics database , for example, to match the entered copy ID with an existing file, and preferably an existing XML file, as will be explained in more detail below. If a match is found (step ), then at step , a form like that shown in  is launched and populated with data for the ad corresponding to the copy ID. If no match is found, then an error message is preferably generated and displayed at step  and the process ends.","Assuming the form of  is an Adobe Acrobat form, the data would be formatted according to Adobe's native XFDF file format, which is employed by Acrobat and is used to reload information back into a previously-created PDF form. In accordance with the present invention, the information that is reloaded, namely, the information entered by a salesperson (or employee) or the graphics artist himself, is stored not only in an XFDF format, but also preferably in an XML format, thereby exploiting the advantages of world wide web consortium (W3C) compliant and valid XML.","More specifically, data for each advertisement is saved not only in an XFDF format, but also as XML, in accordance with, for example, a document type definition (DTD) such as the DTD set forth in Appendix A, which is designed, in this case, with a particular dining guide structure in mind. As a result, it is significantly easier, for example, to modify and\/or repurpose the information after it has been stored. In the case where existing content that has been previously created in accordance with the process of the present invention needs to be edited, the XFDF format file is opened by the Acrobat application and directly populates the form. After corrections are made the process of saving XML is repeated whereby the originally-saved XML file is replaced with another one of the same name, which includes the revisions. Also, another revised XFDF file is created to replace the previous version. An exemplary XSLT file is appended hereto as Appendix B, and those skilled in the art will readily appreciate how to apply such an XSLT file to data stored in an XFDF format, for example.","At step , the artist fills out or edits any fields in the form of  that are missing or need correcting. The artist also chooses ad size, amenity icon locations and, depending on the ad size and available options, chooses the numbers of logos and\/or photos, and then clicks the edit button. In other words, the graphics artist clicks on all the desired boxes in the lower third of  and chooses from the several available options depending on the particular UDAC (advertisement style). Each of the icons is preferably preset as part of an overall data structure that defines the overall dining guide, namely the DTD, or document type definition. In the case of a basic advertisement, for example, the XML file comprises elements such as \u201cpayment options,\u201d wherein a subset of payment options might include the possibility \u201caccept credit cards,\u201d and wherein a subset of \u201caccept credit cards\u201d might include \u201cAmerican Express,\u201d \u201cDiner's Club\u201d or \u201cno credit cards accepted.\u201d These elements are easily recognizable in the DTD of Appendix A.","The XML representation and storage of the data upon which a particular advertisement is based is a significant aspect of the invention. The resulting XML file, which includes separate structured elements, is not directly related to printing or any other predetermined use. Accordingly, the XML file can be easily repurposed, as desired. One example of repurposing might include using a portion of the text of an advertisement (e.g., a slogan or main selling point) as the content for a voice portal, whereby when a person dials into the voice portal to find or learn about a restaurant, the person would hear the selected text synthesized and spoken to them, via a text-to-voice system. Another repurposing example is to use the selected text as part of a text message advertisement that is sent, on demand, to a wireless pocket pager.","Referring again to , at step , upon clicking the edit button in , a new page is spawned on workstation  showing the actual advertisement layout with the correct advertisement size along with populated data, correctly colored, etc. This spawned page preferably uses Adobe Acrobat (or a similar graphics program) and the graphics artist then proceeds to complete the ad (step ) by making any necessary color changes or modifications to logos or photos, for example.","The new page that is spawned is based on the selected template or UDAC. If a logo or photo is called for in the layout, then a graphics box is preferably allocated at a predetermined location. The artist clicks on this location to launch, for example, Adobe Illustrator or PhotoShop for editing that graphics box. In the XML that is ultimately saved, the logo or photo is saved as a file name or link to a file.","There are significant advantages to relying on XML instead of a native format of a particular software application, such as Adobe's XFDF format. For example, a standard option of XML is validation. Valid XML means that the XML file must be consistent with the structure of the corresponding DTD. Thus, if a firm (a restaurant in the example described above) name is required in the corresponding DTD, the corresponding XML file will not be valid unless a firm name has been entered. In addition, with XML it is possible, for example, to delineate how many characters are permitted within a selected section of an advertisement, e.g. 100 characters, 500 characters, etc. Accordingly, the structural capabilities of XML are greater than the typical formats of native graphics applications, including Adobe Acrobat.","To exploit the advantages of XML, the present invention uses a structure having several hierarchical nested structures that describe the various combinations available, including each UDAC, sub-UDACs and combinations of UDACs. As can be readily appreciated, using Adobe Acrobat as a data entry tool enables the use of a business specific structure without having to require a user to have a business specific application.","When the artist has finished with Illustrator or PhotoShop, the screen displayed to the artist will revert back to that shown in . The artist will then have the opportunity to save the advertisement by clicking the save button, step . Then, at step  the information related to the entire advertisement that is being saved is saved in the native application format (Adobe XFDF in this case), XML for later retrieval by employing transformation using a pre-designated XSLT file, and preferably also encapsulated PostScript (EPS) (step ), which is preferably used by printing devices.","While the directory generating implementation of the present invention has been described in the context of workstation  being connected to a database, workstation  could be operated independently, that is, not connected to a network. In such a case, an entire ad could be generated without ever accessing an external database.","Again, to generate the XML file, an XSLT file is used to translate or transform the XFDF native format. A Javascript \u201cplug-in\u201d can be used to interact with the Adobe Acrobat, for example, via Acrobat's available application program interface (API) to access the native XFDF. The XSLT ensures that the XML that is formed is compliant to the pre-specified DTD, whereby the XML will be valid and well-formed, meaning that, for example, beginning and ending tags are accurately provided.","Thus, as can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention provides advantageous systems and methods that help to facilitate the generation of extensible content generally, and in at least one specific example, the publication of directories, such as dining guides.","As can also be readily appreciated in view of the foregoing, the present invention provides the ability to use any arbitrary structure (e.g., a DTD, etc.) to plug directly into the form data entry application of the present invention to obtain validated data entry. One exemplary use of an arbitrary structure might be to employ a predefined DTD for ordering lunch. The \u201cordering lunch DTD\u201d could be plugged into a ubiquitous or otherwise readily available software package such as Adobe Acrobat, whereby a user could easily generate W3C compliant XML based on the specified DTD. Of course, some program code would be needed to create the form fields consistent with the structure in the arbitrary DTD.","There is also great potential to use various software clients on different devices to allow the use of XSL files to automatically create input screens on the devices. This would mean both a structure file (e.g. DTD, XML schema, etc.) and a screen controlling XSL file could be plugged into the client application to automatically control the look and feel of the user interface for that device. For example, employing the same lunch ordering scenario, one could extend the ordering functionality to a wireless device by sending an XSL file corresponding to the handheld device's characteristics, along with a DTD file to a person wishing to create content on that device. Accordingly, the steps required to create a data entry screen would be unnecessary, because the XSL file for that device would automatically create the data entry screen based on the XML structure in the DTD.","The foregoing disclosure of the preferred embodiments of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many variations and modifications of the embodiments described herein will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the above disclosure.
