title: System and method for seamlessly integrating separate information systems within an application
abstract: The present invention is, in one embodiment, a system and method based on a client-server architecture for seamlessly integrating various information systems. In one embodiment, a bundle of files is deployed to a collaboration client, in order to enable the integration of the collaboration client with disparate information systems and content. In one embodiment, content within a mailbox item is allowed to become a “live” object, and is associated with trigger events, and actions, including sending all or part of the content to a separate information system. In one embodiment, mailbox items are subjected to predefined searches to assess whether they include certain content objects. In another embodiment, panel item elements are visible in the overview panel of the collaboration client. The user may interact with the panel items by dragging content onto them, double clicking them, and invoking actions from a context menu if one is available.

Each of these applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","This application is also related to co-pending application Ser. No. 12\/258,793, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Seamlessly Integrating Separate Information Systems within an Application\u201d, which was filed on Oct. 24, 2008. This application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to integrating various separate information systems seamlessly for a user, and more particularly, to allowing a user to interact with separate information systems from within a collaboration suite application.","2. Description of the Related Art","Collaboration suite applications typically include functionality such as email messaging, calendaring, and contact storage and retrieval, where email messages, calendar appointments, contacts, etc. are commonly referred to as \u201cmailbox items.\u201d The Zimbra Collaboration Suite from Zimbra, Inc. (San Mateo, Calif.), Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook from Microsoft Corp. (Redmond, Wash.), and Lotus Notes from IBM (Armonk, N.Y.) are examples of collaboration suite applications.","Most information within a mailbox item cannot be acted upon by separate information systems (e.g., external applications running on the same or other computers, web servers, etc.). For example, if a purchase order number is included in an email, and the user wants approve that purchase order, he typically has to cut (or copy) the purchase order number, open a separate information system, paste that purchase order number into it, and then take any necessary steps to approve that purchase order. These steps are time consuming, annoying and inconvenient for a user.","There have been a few attempts made at addressing such problems. Some email programs can identify Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) within email messages, and a user can click on the URL to open up the corresponding web page. However, such a solution is strictly dependent on the collaboration suite client application, and no customization of any type is provided for. For instance, it is not possible for a user to recognize some other content (e.g. P.O. numbers, phone numbers, etc.), and\/or to perform some other type of action upon recognizing specific content (e.g., logging the URL into a prespecified log rather than opening the corresponding web page). Thus this type of solution is non-extensible, non-flexible, and non-customizable.","Some other prior approaches attempted to provide extensible linking and actionable content. However, most of these require the author of the mailbox item (e.g., email) to identify and link the content. This is problematic for several reasons. First, the author of the item is burdened with the task of annotating the content appropriately. Second, this type of solution requires intelligence at the originating end, and its corresponding intelligence at the receiving end. This can be particularly problematic when the item originates with customers, business partners, or even employees on their home computers, all of which often rely on collaboration software (or email software) that is other than the receiving user's internal standard. It is much more desirable to have actionable content work seamlessly for all in-bound items, regardless of their source and their authors' actions.","Other approaches exist to extensible linking and actionable content, such as Smart Tags from Microsoft Corp. (Redmond, Wash.). Smart Tags were developed for Office desktop applications (Excel, Word, Outlook, etc. as well as Internet Explorer\/IE). Smart Tags do not implement a client-server architecture, and rely on only client-side installation and execution of the linking and action defining code. They are problematic for numerous reasons. For instance, Smart Tags are severely limited in their user interface (UI), in that they merely created dotted lines under content identified as Smart Tag content, and the user can then click appropriately to display a pop-up menu. Other intuitive user interactions, such as mousing over the content, dragging and dropping the content onto other places, and displaying a pop-up panel which displays content (including 3party content) is not available with Smart Tags. Second, Smart Tags are tied to Microsoft Applications, and are thus not compatible with all web browsers (e.g., non-Microsoft web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, etc.) and all operating systems (e.g., non-Microsoft compatible operating systems such as Linux, MacOS, etc.). Further, Smart Tags are not designed to work across the range of client devices that support the Web such as mobile phones, PDAs, tablet PCs, set-top boxes, and so on. Moreover, since there is no centralized server, Smart Tags cannot provide for indexing across clients (e.g., for search\/discovery across mailboxes) such as is required for Sarbanes-Oxley or Human Resources compliance, fiduciary isolation of business units (such as automatically recognizing equity-related communications), and so on. Further still, performing all indexing\/matching on the client increases computation overhead on the client. Furthermore, tight integration with Web 2.0 technologies like Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) based user interfaces running in the browser, without any a prior installation of controls\/plug-ins, is not feasible with Smart Tags, since they are based upon desktop applications rather than upon open internet technologies. In addition, client-side DLLs are also a security risk, particularly when they are permitted to access to client data or arbitrary services on the Internet.","Thus there is a need for a method and system based on a client-server architecture for seamlessly integrating various information systems with an application such as a collaboration suite application, in a generic and customizable manner. In addition, there is a need for a method and system which provides such integration via an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface. Furthermore, there is need for a method and system which provides such integration in a secure environment.","The present invention is a system and method based on a client-server architecture for seamlessly integrating various information systems with an application such as a collaboration suite application in a generic and customizable manner. Some embodiments of the present invention provide such integration via an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface. Some embodiments of the present invention provide such integration in a secure environment.","In one embodiment, separate information systems are integrated with a collaboration suite client application (\u201ccollaboration client\u201d). Examples of separate information systems include third party servers, as well as the collaboration server application that serves the collaboration client. In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, Zimlets are used to integrate separate systems with a collaboration client. A Zimlet is a bundle of files that is deployed to the collaboration client. The files comprising the Zimlet bundle enable the integration of the collaboration client with disparate information systems and content.","In one embodiment, there are at least two ways in which separate information systems can be integrated with a collaboration client. (i) Content objects: Content that would otherwise have been static within a mailbox item is allowed to become a \u201clive\u201d object, and to be associated with trigger events, and actions, including sending the object to a separate information system and taking some action upon information corresponding to the object within the separate information system. Examples of content objects include phone numbers, purchase order numbers, contacts and calendar appointments. In addition, mailbox items can be subjected to predefined searches based on whether certain content objects are included in them. (ii) Panel item elements in the application overview panel of the collaboration client: The user may interact with the panel items by dragging content such as mail messages, contacts and calendar appointment onto them, double clicking them, and invoking actions from a context menu if one is available. For instance, for integrating with a mapping program, a user may drag one of his contacts onto a panel item, and the collaboration client will send the address from that contact to an external mapping program, such as Google maps or Mapquest, with a request for a map corresponding to such address.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, Zimlets provide an extensible mechanism for integrating separate information systems into a collaboration suite application in that a system administrator can define the type of window generated (size, graphics, etc.), the type of content that the window accepts, and the action associated with that window. Therefore, a system administrator can tailor such Zimlets to interface with whatever information systems best suit user needs.","A system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention consists of a client and server framework, as well as a set of web services and JavaScript APIs. They will be exposed to the end user via a client. In one embodiment, the client is implemented using Asychronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The server component is responsible for Zimlet life cycle management, server side indexing, and security. The client component is responsible for providing the framework to support presentation, user interaction, and customizing\/authoring of Zimlets by the system administrator. This architecture enables the implementation of a broad range of these Zimlets, from those requiring little or no custom code (i.e. entirely declarative) to those that use JavaScript to tightly integrate rich UI behavior within the client. Such an architecture also makes it possible to have the server index content, such as email messages and attachments that contain content objects, so that the end user may search for such content by using either the \u201chas\u201d clause of the query language or by checking the appropriate checkbox in the relevant panel of the search builder. So if a Zimlet defining phone numbers has registered with the server for indexing, then a user may, for example, search for content containing phone numbers by issues the following search query: has:phone.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the collaboration client serves as a user interface to not only the collaboration suite server but also to various other remote servers. When content objects and\/or panel items are recognized and\/or interacted with, the communication from the user's computer goes to the Zimlet server, which in turn communicates with the various remote servers as appropriate. Routing the communications to the remote servers via the Zimlet server has several advantages, such as enhancing security.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the bundle of files comprising the Zimlet includes a Zimlet definition file. In one embodiment, this file is implemented in XML. In one embodiment, it is possible to define content objects and their corresponding context menus and tool tips, as well as template panel items and their actions, solely with XML. In other cases, it may be necessary or desirable to provide for complementary files in order to carry out the desired functions. This implementation is then referenced in the template definition file and included as part of the template bundle. In one embodiment, the complementary files are in JavaScript.","The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all-inclusive, and particularly, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter, resort to the claims being necessary to determine such inventive subject matter.","The figures (or drawings) depict a preferred embodiment of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. It is noted that similar or like reference numbers in the figures may indicate similar or like functionality. One of skill in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention(s) herein. It is to be noted that while the following discussion focuses on embodiments of the present invention as applied to a collaboration suite, the invention can be applied to other applications, where a tighter integration between different information systems is desired. Further, each bundle of files that integrates the collaboration client with a separate information system is referred to as a \u201cZimlet.\u201d This is only a name used for reference, and it has no connection to functionality. Moreover, some examples are described with respect to the Zimbra Collaboration Suite from Zimbra Inc. (San Mateo, Calif.) who is the assignee of this patent application, but the invention is in no way limited to the Zimbra Collaboration Suite.","Various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for integrating separate information systems with a collaboration suite client application (\u201ccollaboration client\u201d). Examples of separate information systems include third party servers, as well as the collaboration server application that serves the collaboration client. Further, in some embodiments of the present invention, user interfaces within the collaboration suite itself are \u201cmashed-up\u201d (intermixed). For instance, calendar information and contacts information may be mashed-up within the user's email. The term \u201cmash-up\u201d describes the aggregation and customization of multiple web interfaces and web services to eliminate context-switching between existing systems, a process which delivers a richer experience and a wider range of capabilities to the end user. Several technologies have enabled developers to create new and interesting ways of providing some very effective integrations. One example is Asychronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), which facilitates creation of web applications with increased interactivity, speed, and usability of web pages. This is done by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes, so that the entire web page does not have to be reloaded every time there is a change. Another example of such technologies is Representational State Transfer (REST), which is an architecture for distributed hypermedia systems like the world wide web. The term is generally used loosely for web-based interfaces that use XML and HTTP without extra abstractions such as the SOAP protocol.","The functionality, system architecture, and implementation of systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention are described below.","Overview of Functionality","In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, Zimlets are used to integrate separate systems with a collaboration client. A Zimlet is a bundle of files that is deployed to the collaboration client. The files comprising the Zimlet bundle enable the integration of the collaboration client with disparate information systems and content.","In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, there are at least the following ways in which separate information systems can be integrated with a collaboration client. The functionality of these various ways is described below from a high-level. Further details regarding each of these are provided below under the system architecture and implementation sections.","1. Content Object Zimlets:","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, content that would otherwise have been static within a mailbox item is allowed to become a \u201clive\u201d object (referred to herein as \u201ccontent object\u201d), and to be associated with trigger events, and actions, including sending the object to a separate information system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["110","120"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["The content object is the address ","The trigger event is the user mousing over the content object","The action is popping up a separate window within the collaboration suite, with the window displaying a separate information system, and with the text of the content object being passed as a parameter to the separate information system","The separate information system is Google maps."]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":"150","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["The content object is the URL ","The trigger event is the user mousing over the content object","The action is popping up tooltip within the collaboration suite, with the tooltip displaying a separate information system, and with the text of the content object being passed as a parameter to the separate information system","The separate information system here is alexa.com, from Amazon (Seattle, Wash.), which provides screen captures of websites.

In one embodiment, the query languages \u201chas\u201d clause is used for this purpose. For example, in an embodiment where phone numbers are recognized as content object, a user can search for mailbox items containing phone numbers, via the \u201chas:phone\u201d clause. In one embodiment, mailbox items containing a particular phone number can also be searched for.","2. Panel Item Zimlets within the Collaboration Client Interface:","In one embodiment, the collaboration client in accordance includes various panel items in the application overview panel, which are essentially ways to access various information systems.  is a screen shot which shows various such panel items  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In , the following panel items are shown: \u201cMaps\u201d, \u201cPackage Tracker\u201d, \u201cPurchase Order\u201d, and \u201cTravel Tracker\u201d. These panel items are shown for illustrative purposes alone, and this list is no way limiting.","The user interacts with the panel items in various ways, such as by dragging content such as mail messages, contacts and calendar appointment onto them, double clicking them, and invoking actions from a context menu. When the user interacts with a panel item, in one embodiment this results in sending the entered information (or the value of one more attributes of a mailbox item) to a separate information system, along with any applicable instructions\/commands for acting upon such information.","Referring to , the result of a user dragging a contact onto the \u201cMaps\u201d panel item is shown. In one embodiment, when a user drags one of his contacts onto the panel item  \u201cMaps\u201d, the collaboration client sends the address from that contact to an external mapping program, such as Google maps from Google, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), Yahoo, Inc (Sunnyvale, Calif.) or Mapquest from Mapquest, Inc. (Denver, Colo.), with a request for a map corresponding to such address.","In an alternate embodiment, the panel items  do not create a window when activated. Instead the panel item icon itself may act as an interface to a separate information system. For example, a message that needs to be sent to a remote data storage or enterprise system can be dragged to a panel item  designed to send messages to a remote data storage or enterprise system. Instead of a window opening when a message is dragged to the panel item icon, the panel item icon may just flash or turn a different color to acknowledge that the message has been accepted.","In one embodiment, a panel item may be used for more passive actions, such as displaying a message. In one embodiment, this may be triggered by the user's logging in. For instance, a motivational message of the day could be displayed when the user logs in. In one embodiment, information  regarding music being played is displayed in a pre-specified location (e.g., lower left hand corner of the collaboration client interface). This can be seen in . In yet another embodiment, a panel item results in a display, of say, a monthly calendar , in a pre-specified location (e.g., lower left hand corner of the collaboration client interface). This can be seen in . In still another embodiment, such a passive display may be triggered by a lapse of a predefined amount of time. For instance, at the beginning of every month, some type of reminder may show up.","Panel items  are a different user interface to disparate information systems as compared to content objects . Further, panel items  can also serve as fallback options if certain content cannot be recognized as a content object . This can happen, for example, in situations where certain information as the defined content object is not recognized as such because of some difference in format, etc. For example, even if an address is to be recognized as a content object, a foreign address may be formatted in such a way that the content object cannot be recognized. In such a situation, the user can simply drag the address over to the \u201cmaps\u201d panel item  to obtain the map for the address.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["252","254","256","258"]},"System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","350","360","362","364","366","368"]},"The user's computer  is a conventional computer system, that may include a CPU, a storage device, a network services connection , and conventional input\/output devices such as, a display, a mouse, a printer, and\/or a keyboard, that may couple to a computer system. The computer also includes a conventional operating system, an input\/output device, and network services software. Several of these components are not shown in  for purposes of clarity. The computer, the storage device, and the network services connection, may be available from, for example, IBM Corporation (Armonk, N.Y.), Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.), Hewlett-Packard, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.), or Apple (Cupertino, Calif.)","The user's computer  includes several modules on it. One of the modules is the Collaboration Suite Client . As mentioned above, the Collaboration Suite Client  includes an Email application , a Contacts application , and a Calendar application . Some Collaboration Suite Clients  include other modules such as a To-Do List application, a Memo application, and so on. Outlook from Microsoft Corp. (Redmond, Wash.), Zimbra Collaboration Suite from Zimbra, Inc. (San Mateo Calif.), and Lotus Notes from IBM (Armonk, N.Y.) are examples of Collaboration Suite Clients .","Several other application clients are also resident on the user's computer . These include an (Instant Messaging) IM client , a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) client , a Purchase Order client , and an Other Proprietary System client .","The IM client  can be any available IM application. Some examples of the currently available IM programs are America OnLine Instant Messenger (AIM) from America Online, Inc. (Dulles, Va.), MSN\u00ae Messenger from Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.), and Yahoo!\u00ae Instant Messenger from Yahoo! Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.).","The VoIP client  can be any available VoIP application. Some example of currently available VoIP programs are Skype from Skype (Luxemborg), AT&T CallVantage from AT& Inc. (San Antonio, Tex.), and Vonage from Vonage (Holmdel, N.J.).","The Purchase Order client  can be any available Purchase Order application. Some example of currently available Purchase Order programs include applications provided by Oracle Corp. (Redwood Shores, Calif.), as well as accounting applications such as Peachtree Accounting from Sage Software (New Castle, UK), Quickbooks from Intuit, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), and Microsoft Dynamics GP from Microsoft Corp. (Redmond, Wash.).","The Other Proprietary System client  can include various other applications, such as, but not limited to, invoice tracking applications (such as those provided by Oracle Corp.), SKU management or inventory control applications, partner\/VAT portals, order processing, shipment tracking, CRM applications, billing software, MLS software for Real Estate, etc.","The network service connection  includes hardware and software components that allow for connecting to a conventional network service. For example, the network service connection may include a connection to a telecommunications line (e.g., a dial-up, digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d), a T1, or a T3 communication line).","The network  can be any network, such as a Wide Area Network (WAN) or a Local Area Network (LAN), or any other network. A WAN may include the Internet, the Internet 2, and the like. A LAN may include an Intranet, which may be a network based on, for example, TCP\/IP belonging to an organization accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization. A LAN may also be a network such as, for example, Netware\u2122 from Novell Corporation (Provo, Utah) or Windows NT from Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.). The network  may also include commercially available subscription-based services such as, for example, AOL from America Online, Inc. (Dulles, Va.) or MSN from Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.).","The Collaboration Suite Server , the IM Server , a VoIP server , a Purchase Order Server , and an Other Proprietary System Server , are servers with which the Collaboration Suite client , the IM client , the VoIP client , the Purchase Order client , and the Other Proprietary System client , respectively communicate.","Any communication that occurs from a client  or - on the user's computer  to a remote server - occurs via Path A (from the client to the network , via the network services connection ), and then Path A (from the network  to the remote server). The user has to open each client separately in order to use it and to communicate with the corresponding server. For instance, consider that the user is reading an email in the Collaboration client  in which an IM Id is provided. In order to conduct an IM conversation with the person who's IM Id is provided in the email, the user has to open the IM client , cut and paste (or retype) the IM Id into the IM client.

Each of these is discussed in further detail below. The client  is responsible for providing the framework to support presentation and user interaction.","It can be seen from  that, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, several of the clients - that were on the user's computer  in the prior art system  are not needed on the user's computer in system . This is because the Collaboration client  can serve as a user interface to not only the collaboration suite server  but also to the other remote servers -. In another embodiment, the client applications - still reside on the user's computer .","In the embodiment shown in , when panel items  or content objects  are interacted with and\/or recognized, the communication from various applications on the user's computer  goes, via the network services connection , to the network  via path B, and then on to the Zimlet server  via path B.

In one embodiment, these Zimlets include content objects  as well as panel items . In one embodiment, not all Zimlets can be used by all users. Rather, each user is granted access to specific Zimlets. This access may be granted, in one embodiment, by the system administrator. In one embodiment, some generic Zimlets are provided to each user, while other Zimlets are available only to specific users. For instance, the map panel item may be available to all users, while purchase order content items and their approval\/rejection can only be done by, say, manager level users. In one embodiment, even custom Zimlets written by the users and\/or administrators are stored on the Zimlet server .","When a content object Zimlet  is recognized, or a panel item Zimlet  is interacted with, all requests to the Zimlets are transmitted to the servlet module  in the Zimlet server . For security reasons, Zimlets do not communicate directly with remote servers  . . . . Instead, they talk to the servlet module . In one embodiment, the servlet module  is comprised of a proxy servlet  and a JSP . As mentioned above, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a Zimlet running on the user's computer  cannot directly communicate with a remote server  . . .  for security reasons. Instead, Zimlets will have access to the servlet module  in order to fetch and manipulate the contents from remote servers  . . . . The proxy servlet  is used, in one embodiment, to simply pass on an HTTP request after appropriate authentication. The proxy servlet  authenticates the request to the server in conjunction with the server access module in the security module . Each Zimlet needing the access to proxy servlet  need to be listed in the proxy servlet , along with the white list of the URLs that the Zimlets need. The requests made to URLs not in the white list will be denied. For all the authenticated requests, the proxy servlet  in turn makes HTTP request to one or more remote machines  . . .  on behalf of the Zimlet, and proxies the result back to the Zimlet.","In one embodiment, the Zimlet JSP  implements any other server side data retrieval and manipulation for the actions to be performed on the client. The UI passes the matching text and which action button the user selected to the JSP . In one embodiment, Simple Object Acces Protocol (SOAP), a protocol for exchanging XML-based messages over a computer network, can be used to implement this. The Zimlet jsp code may then use any protocol or API needed to fetch data or act on the user's selection. For example, the JSP  is used to talk to remote databases in SQL, or in other protocols (such as UDP), and so on.","The security module  serves two main purposes. First, it verifies that a given client  from which the request originated has access to a given Zimlet based on whether the user's class of service permits access to the requested Zimlet. This is performed, in one embodiment, by the client access module . In one embodiment, the user's class of service is established by the server administrator. Second, it prevents unauthorized access to remote servers by Zimlets by ensuring that each request has a valid authentication token. This is performed, in one embodiment, by the server access module .","An index storage  is present on the server  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. This indexing is described in more detail below in the context of the matching module .","In one embodiment, the matching module  performs two functions: (i) it analyzes the content of any mailbox item for any matches with content objects ; and (ii) it searches mailbox items for any predefined index searches. In another embodiment, a separate module exists for indexing\/searching. In yet another embodiment, the content of mailbox items is searched for content objects in the client  rather than in the server .","As mentioned before, indexes\/predefined searches can be performed in one embodiment, based on the indexes in the index storage . In one embodiment, if a mailbox item contains a search term, a Boolean flag is set to \u201cTrue\u201d (or 1) for that mailbox item. When, for example, an email is received at server , it is parsed to check if it contains any indexed terms, and the Boolean flag is set appropriately. The email is then sent on to the collaboration client . When a user later desires to retrieve the indexed items, all mailbox items with the Boolean flag set appropriately are retrieved.","Because of the client-server architecture, indexing\/searching of content objects  can be performed across various collaboration suite applications such as email , contacts , and calendar . In addition, indexing\/searching can also be performed across various user computers  (for example, the mailboxes of all employees of an organization). Such indexing across different computers (e.g., for search\/discovery across mailboxes) provides for compliance with various regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, Human Resources, litigation discovery processes, fiduciary isolation of business units (such as automatically recognizing equity-related communications), and so on.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, pre-indexed searches of content (such as email message bodies, calendar appointment notes, and contact fields) that contains one or more content objects can be combined with live searches. For instance, a pre-indexed search \u201chas: phone\u201d can be combined with a live search for a specific name, \u201cJack\u201d. The result would return any content which has the name Jack and which includes a phone number.

The Zimlet user interface in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention has been discussed above with reference to  and A-C. In addition, the client  includes a toolkit . The toolkit  serves the purpose of allowing the user and\/or administrator of the collaboration client  to create new and\/or customized Zimlets. The toolkit includes basic UI elements  and a Zimlet helper framework . The basic UI elements  includes fundamental UI elements such as pop-ups, menus, etc. The Zimlet helper framework  provides for more complex Zimlet authoring. The Zimlet helper framework  provides common methods for tasks like Network Access, XML document conversion, access to Collaboration data like user preferences, or contact and event info. The Zimlet Helper framework  also provides the Zimlet author with per user storage for Zimlet preferences or state data specific to that Zimlet\/User combination. Further details regarding how Zimlets can be written are in the following section.","Implementation","This section describes in some detail how Zimlets are implemented in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As mentioned above, a Zimlet is a bundle of files that enable the integration of the ZCS platform with disparate information systems and content. It is possible, in one embodiment for a system administrator to write his or her own Zimlets and\/or tailor them to interface with whatever information systems best suit user needs. Further, Zimlets can be customized to display the results in a format and manner preferred by the system administrator, and based upon triggers (e.g., mousing over, right clicking, etc.) preferred by the system administrator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":["Zimlet Definition file : In one embodiment, this is implemented as an XML file <Zimlet>.xml.
