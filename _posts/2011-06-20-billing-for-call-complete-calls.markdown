{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the following patent applications:\n\n","The specifications of the above referenced patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","In telecommunication networks, a call made by a calling party to a called party is routed through a source switch of the calling party to a destination switch of the called party. If the called party is unavailable, for example, due to the called party's communication device being switched off, an occurrence of a busy signal, or an out of network signal, the call is sometimes redirected to a server that provides, for example, voice services such as an automatic voice short message service (AVSMS), voicemail, etc., or non-voice services at the called party side. This redirection results in the call being answered at the destination switch, but not by the called party.","Conventionally billing of the calling party is under the control of the source switch. It is the source switch that decides whether to charge for the call and if so, the amount to be charged. In the case of toll free calls, the source switch knows that it is a toll free call and thus does not charge the calling party. In the case of a toll free call, the call charge is billed to the called party, and the destination switch generates the call charges events and charges the called party accordingly.","Conventionally, a charging server associated with the calling party bills the calling party for utilizing voice services and non-voice services provided by the server based on a subscription plan of the calling party. The server that provides the voice services or the non-voice services and to which the call is redirected by the destination switch has no control over billing the calling party via the destination switch for the services utilized by the calling party. There is a need for providing control of billing of the calling party to the server based on services provided to the calling party by the server.","Hence, there is a long felt but unresolved need for a method and system that detects the redirection of an unanswered call attempt made to the called party by the calling party to a server at the called party side, disables billing of the calling party via the source switch, and initiates billing of the calling party via the destination switch based on services provided to the calling party by the server.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described in the detailed description of the invention. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential inventive concepts of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The method and system disclosed herein addresses the above stated needs for detecting redirection of an unanswered call attempt made to a called party by a calling party to a voice server at the called party side, disabling billing of the calling party via a first network component, that is, a source switch, and initiating billing of the calling party via a second network component, that is, a destination switch based on services provided to the calling party by the voice server. As used herein, the term \u201cunanswered call attempt\u201d refers to a call attempt made by a calling party to a called party, that is not received or answered by the called party due to an occurrence of, for example, a busy signal, an out of coverage signal, an unreachable signal, a switched off signal, network congestion, an unanswered signal from the called party, etc. Also, as used herein, the term \u201ccalling party\u201d refers to a user who originates a call or attempts to place a call to a called party. The term \u201ccalled party\u201d refers to a user who is a recipient or an intended recipient of a call made by the calling party. The method and system disclosed herein enables billing of the calling party via the destination switch instead of the source switch, for the unanswered call attempt made to the called party.","The method and system disclosed herein provides a billing management application in communication with a voice server for managing billing of a calling party. In an embodiment, the billing management application is implemented within the voice server. In another embodiment, the billing management application is implemented on an independent application server. The first network component receives a call attempt from the calling party to contact the called party. The first network component routes the received call attempt to the second network component for establishing a communications link between the calling party and the called party. As used herein, the terms \u201cfirst network component\u201d and \u201csecond network component\u201d refer to, for example, a mobile switching center (MSC), a base station subsystem (BSS), a radio access network (RAN), a telephone exchange, a telephone switch, etc., serving the calling party and the called party respectively.","The second network component redirects the call attempt unanswered by the called party to the voice server. The voice server provides one or more services, for example, automatic voice short message services (AVSMS), voicemail services, emergency services, non-voice services, etc. The second network component redirects the call attempt to the voice server due to an occurrence of, for example, a busy signal, an out of coverage signal, an unreachable signal, a switched off signal, network congestion, or an unanswered signal from the called party. The billing management application detects the redirection of the call attempt unanswered by the called party to the voice server.","The billing management application then indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party for the unanswered call attempt. In an embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by transmitting one or more message parameters to the first network component, for example, prior to, during, and\/or after receipt of a call answer message from the voice server. In another embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by transmitting one or more message parameters to the first network component, in the call answer message of the call attempt.","In another embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by direct communication between the billing management application and the first network component via a proprietary communications protocol. For example, the billing management application directly communicates with the first network component by invoking one or more proprietary application programming interface (API) calls provided by the first network component. In another embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by informing a charging server associated with the calling party to disregard billing requests made by the first network component for billing of the calling party. In another embodiment, the billing management application indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by an absence of a billing communication between the billing management application and the first network component. The first network component disables the billing of the calling party due to the absence of the billing communication.","The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, initiates billing of the calling party based on billing criteria, via the second network component for utilizing one or more services provided by the voice server. The billing criteria comprise, for example, one or more of event based criteria, time duration based criteria, a charging limit defined by the charging server, state of the call attempt, number of services utilized by the calling party, type of services utilized by the calling party, etc., or any combination thereof. In an embodiment, the billing management application determines the billing charge for the calling party based on one or more of the billing criteria. In another embodiment, the billing management application detects utilization of one or more services by the calling party and informs the charging server to bill the calling party as directed by the billing management application. Therefore, the calling party is billed via the second network component instead of the first network component for utilization of one or more services provided by the voice server. The billing management application can determine the billing charge in communication with the voice server, via the second network component and instruct the charging server associated with the calling party to bill the calling party that billing charge. If the initiation of billing of the calling party by the billing management application fails, the billing management application can instruct the voice server not to offer the services requested by the calling party.","In an embodiment, the billing management application detects redirection of repeated call attempts made by the calling party to contact the called party within a short period of time to the voice server as emergency call attempts. The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, initiates the billing of the calling party via the second network component for utilizing one or more emergency services provided by the voice server for the emergency call attempts unanswered by the called party.","In another embodiment, the voice server provides one or more services to the calling party based on one or more of the billing criteria, for example, a charging limit defined by the charging server. The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, initiates the billing of the calling party based on one or more of the billing criteria via the second network component for utilizing the provided services. In an embodiment, the billing management application, the calling party, or the first network component can terminate the utilization of the services provided by the voice server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The method disclosed herein provides  a billing management application in communication with a voice server. The billing management application is a software application implemented on an independent application server or within a voice server for managing billing of the calling party. A first network component receives  a call attempt from the calling party to contact a called party. The first network component routes  the received call attempt to a second network component for establishing a communications link between the calling party and the called party. As used herein, the terms \u201cfirst network component\u201d and \u201csecond network component\u201d refer to, for example, a mobile switching center (MSC), a base station subsystem (BSS), a radio access network (RAN), a telephone exchange, a telephone switch, etc., serving the calling party and the called party respectively. The first network component is, for example, an originating switch or a source switch associated with the calling party. The second network component is, for example, a terminating switch or a destination switch associated with the called party. Also, as used herein, the term \u201ccommunications link\u201d refers to a transmission medium for exchanging telecommunication signals. The first network component directs the call attempt received from the calling party to the called party, for example, based on the called party's number dialed on a communication device of the calling party. The communication device is, for example, a mobile phone, a laptop, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computing device, etc.","The second network component redirects  the call attempt unanswered by the called party to the voice server. The voice server provides one or more services, for example, voice services such as automatic voice short message services (AVSMS), voicemail services, etc., non-voice services, emergency services, etc. The second network component redirects the call attempt to the voice server due to an occurrence of, for example, a busy signal, an out of coverage signal, an unreachable signal, a switched off signal, network congestion, or an unanswered signal from the called party. The billing management application detects  the redirection of the call attempt unanswered by the called party to the voice server. Moreover, the billing management application comprises logic for determining the billing charge and processing the billing of the calling party, for example, based on the voice services utilized at the voice server by the calling party, the state of the call attempt, etc. The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, determines the billing charge for billing the calling party and instructs a charging server associated with the calling party to bill the calling party the determined billing charge.","The billing management application indicates  to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party for the unanswered call attempt. In an embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by transmitting, for example, one or more message parameters to the first network component prior to, during, and\/or after receipt of a call answer message from the voice server. As used herein, the term \u201ccall answer message\u201d refers to a message sent by the voice server to initiate provision of one or more services, for example, voice services, to the calling party on detection of an unanswered call attempt. In an example, the message parameters are transmitted as part of the integrated services digital network (ISDN) user part (ISUP) standard call handling message. The ISUP is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard for exchanging messages for call control. In another embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by transmitting one or more message parameters to the first network component, in the call answer message of the call attempt. The message parameters inform the charging server associated with the calling party not to bill the calling party for utilizing one or more services provided by the voice server. The charging server is a server that performs and tracks the billing of the calling party. In an example, the billing management application sends one or more message parameters during integrated services digital network (ISDN) user part (ISUP) signaling, where an ISUP answer message comprises a billing indicator \u201cno charge\u201d.","In another embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by direct communication between the billing management application and the first network component via a proprietary communications protocol. In this embodiment, the charging server associated with the calling party provides proprietary application programming interface (API) calls for handling the billing of the calling party. The billing management application invokes the API calls and thereby instructs the charging server when and how to bill the calling party. The API calls can be proprietary, and hence the details of the API calls vary from one implementation to another.","In another embodiment, the billing management application communicates with and indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by informing the charging server to disregard billing requests made by the first network component for billing of the calling party. In this embodiment, the billing management application communicates with the charging server, for example, using the Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) standard, the Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) protocol, etc.","In another embodiment, the billing management application indicates to the first network component to disable billing of the calling party by an absence of a billing communication between the billing management application and the first network component. That is, if the first network component is not configured to handle the message parameters that indicate to the first network component to disable the billing of the calling party, the billing management application disables transmission of an event such as an answer message to the first network component to prevent the first network component from billing the calling party. The first network component disables the billing of the calling party due to the absence of the billing communication. In this embodiment, the charging server responsible for billing the calling party does not receive charging events, for example, an answer signal or message and therefore does not bill the calling party. In an example, the billing management application does not transmit one or more message parameters that comprise an indication to bill the calling party prior to, during, and\/or after receipt of the call answer message from the voice server to prevent the first network component from billing the calling party.","The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, initiates  billing of the calling party based on billing criteria, via the second network component, for utilizing one or more services provided by the voice server. The billing criteria comprise, for example, one or more of event based criteria, time duration based criteria, a charging limit defined by the charging server, state of the call attempt, number of services utilized by the calling party, type of services utilized by the calling party, etc., or any combination thereof. The event based criteria comprise, for example, billing the calling party at the start of utilization of a service such as a voice service by the calling party. The event based criteria is independent of the duration of the utilization of the service provided by the voice server. The time duration based criteria comprise, for example, billing the calling party in proportion to the duration of utilization of the service provided by the voice server. That is, the longer the utilization of the service, the higher is the billing charge. The billing management application instructs the charging server to bill the calling party based on the billing criteria. The billing management application also disables billing of the calling party by the charging server based on the subscription plan of the calling party. In an embodiment, the billing management application detects utilization of one or more services by the calling party and informs the charging server to bill the calling party as directed by the billing management application. The calling party is therefore billed via the second network component instead of the first network component for utilizing one or more services provided by the voice server.","In an embodiment, the billing management application detects redirection of repeated call attempts made by the calling party to contact the called party within a short period of time to the voice server as emergency call attempts. The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, initiates the billing of the calling party via the second network component for utilizing one or more emergency services provided by the voice server for the emergency call attempts unanswered by the called party.","In another embodiment, the voice server provides one or more services to the calling party based on one or more of the billing criteria, for example, a charging limit defined by the charging server. The billing management application, in communication with the voice server, initiates the billing of the calling party based on one or more of the billing criteria via the second network component for utilizing the provided services. In an embodiment, the billing management application, the calling party, or the first network component can terminate the utilization of the services provided by the voice server.","Consider an example where the calling party attempts to call the called party. If the called party is unavailable, for example, due to the called party's communication device being switched off, an occurrence of a busy signal, or an out of network signal, the call attempt by the calling party is redirected to the voice server that provides voice services, for example, automatic voice short message services (AVSMS), voicemail services, etc. The method disclosed herein enables billing of the calling party by the billing management application via the second network component based on the voice services utilized by the calling party at the voice server and disables the billing of the calling party via the first network component based on the subscription plan of the calling party. In this manner, the method disclosed herein enables the billing management application to determine the billing charge of the calling party and to instruct the charging server to bill the calling party, for example, based on the voice services, one or more events, a duration for the voice services, actions of the calling party, etc., or any combination thereof. If the billing management application or the voice server associated with the second network component fails to initiate billing of the calling party for the voice services, the billing management application instructs the voice server to disable the voice services provided to the calling party.","Consider another example where the calling party attempts to call the called party. If the called party does not answer the call, the calling party is redirected to the voice server associated with the called party due to the unavailability of the called party. In this example, the voice server associated with the second network component prompts the calling party to leave a voice recording for the called party. The billing management application communicates with the charging server to disable the billing of the calling party based on the subscription plan of the calling party. In this example, the billing management application further communicates with the charging server to bill the calling party based on the calling party leaving a voice recording for the called party as specified by the voice server via the second network component. The call attempt may be terminated by the calling party or the first network component.","In an example, when a calling party A calls a called party B, and if called party B does not answer the call, then the second network component redirects this call to the voice server. The voice server then decides if the calling party A is to be given the option of leaving, for example, a voice SMS in the voice server for the called party B. If the voice server provides this option, the method disclosed herein enables the billing management application, in communication with the voice server, to initiate billing of the calling party A based on the charge as determined by the voice server or the billing management application rather than the voice call charge as per the subscription plan of the calling party A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","204","200","202","203","205","207","208","209","209","209"]},"When the calling party  attempts to make a call using a communication device  to contact the called party , the communication device  of the calling party  connects to the network  via the first network component .

As used herein, the term \u201cnon-transitory computer readable storage medium\u201d refers to all computer readable media, for example, non-volatile media such as optical disks or magnetic disks, volatile media such as a register memory, processor cache, etc., and transmission media such as wires that constitute a system bus coupled to the processor , except for a transitory, propagating signal.","The computer program product disclosed herein comprises one or more computer program codes for managing billing of a calling party  for an unanswered call attempt made to a called party . For example, the computer program product disclosed herein comprises a first computer program code for detecting redirection of the call attempt made by the calling party  and unanswered by the called party  to the voice server , a second computer program code for indicating to the first network component  to disable billing of the calling party  for the unanswered call attempt, and a third computer program code for initiating billing of the calling party  based on one or more of the billing criteria, in communication with the voice server , via the second network component , for utilizing one or more services provided by the voice server , whereby the calling party  is billed via the second network component  instead of the first network component  for the utilization of one or more services provided by the voice server . The computer program product disclosed herein further comprises additional computer program codes for performing additional steps that may be required and contemplated for managing billing of the calling party  for an unanswered call attempt made to the called party .","The computer program codes comprising the computer executable instructions for managing billing of the calling party  for an unanswered call attempt made to the called party  are embodied on the non-transitory computer readable storage medium. The processor  of the computer system  retrieves these computer executable instructions and executes them. When the computer executable instructions are executed by the processor , the computer executable instructions cause the processor  to perform the method steps for managing billing of the calling party  for an unanswered call attempt made to the called party .

If the called party B  is a mobile customer in the GSM network , switch B  is the base station controller (BSC) where the called party B  is currently connected as per a home location register (HLR) status and\/or a visitor location register (VLR) status of the called party B . When switch B  receives  the call attempt at an integrated services digital network user part (ISUP) level, switch B  checks  whether the called party B  is available for alerting. If the called party B  is not available for alerting, the call attempt is deemed  as an unsuccessful call attempt. Switch B  redirects  the unsuccessful call attempt to the voice server  associated with switch B . If the called party B  is available for alerting, the called party B  is alerted , for example, by ringing.","If the called party B  answers  the call attempt, the communications link is established between the calling party A  and the called party B . As per billing rules in conventional GSM networks , switch A  bills the calling party A  for regular voice calls and switch B  bills the called party B , if the call is a toll free call. In this example, the call is a regular voice call and switch A  bills  the calling party A  based on the subscription plan of the calling party A .","If the call attempt is unanswered  by the called party B , switch B  redirects  the call attempt to the voice server  associated with switch B . The voice server  provides voice services, for example, automatic voice short message services (AVSMS), voicemail, etc. The billing management application  detects  the redirection of the call attempt to the voice server .","The billing management application  then indicates  to switch A  to disable billing of the calling party A  for the unanswered call attempt. The billing management application  indicates to switch A  to disable billing the calling party A  in one of the following methods: In a first method, the billing management application  sends one or more message parameters during ISUP signaling, in which an ISUP answer message comprises a billing indicator, for example, \u201cno charge\u201d. In a second method, the billing management application  withholds transmission of the ISUP answer message comprising the billing indicator. Since the ISUP answer message is not received by switch A , switch A  does not initiate billing of the calling party A  by the charging server  associated with the calling party A . In a third method, the billing management application  directly communicates with switch A  to not initiate billing the calling party A  via a proprietary communications protocol. In a fourth method, the billing management application  instructs the charging server  to disregard the billing requests by switch A  for billing the calling party A . The billing management application  indicates to the first network component  to disable billing of the calling party A , for example, prior to initiation of call processing by the voice server .","The billing management application  communicates with the charging server  to bill the calling party A  based on services provided by the voice server  to the calling party A . The voice server  offers a voice based menu and allows the calling party A  to make choices as per services to be utilized by the calling party A . The voice server  also has capability to record the voice messages as spoken by the calling party A . Since this voice recording is independent of language, the voice recording can be performed in any language and is therefore language agnostic.","The billing management application  detects  that the calling party A  has utilized one or more services provided by the voice server , for example, that the calling party A  has left a voice recording for the called party B . The billing management application  then communicates  with the charging server  to bill the calling party A  via switch B  based on the service utilized by the calling party A , that is, for the voice recording left for the called party B  by the calling party A . After the calling party A  has completed utilization of the service by completing the voice recording, the call attempt is terminated  by the calling party A , the billing management application , or switch A .","It will be readily apparent that the various methods and algorithms disclosed herein may be implemented on computer readable media appropriately programmed for general purpose computers and computing devices.
