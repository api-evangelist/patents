{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT\/IB2013\/058895, filed on Sep. 26, 2013, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/709,497, filed on Oct. 4, 2012, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The invention described herein relates to certain pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine compounds and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds. The invention also relates to the processes for the preparation of the compounds, compositions containing the compounds, and the uses of such compounds and salts in treating diseases or conditions associated with tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk), activity. More specifically the invention relates to the compounds and their salts useful as inhibitors of Trk.","Tropomyosin-related kinases (Trks) are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases activated by neurotrophins. Trks play important roles in pain sensation as well as tumour cell growth and survival signaling. Thus, inhibitors of Trk receptor kinases might provide targeted treatments for conditions such as pain and cancer. Recent developments in this field have been reviewed by Wang et al in Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2009) 19(3): 305-319 and an extract is reproduced below.","\u201c1.1 Trk Receptors","As one of the largest family of proteins encoded by the human genome, protein kinases are the central regulators of signal transduction as well as control of various complex cell processes. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a subfamily of protein kinases (up to 100 members) bound to the cell membrane that specifically act on the tyrosine residues of proteins. One small group within this subfamily is the Trk kinases, with three highly homologous isoforms: TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. All three isoforms are activated by high affinity growth factors named neurotrophins (NT): i) nerve growth factor (NGF), which activates TrkA; ii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4\/5, which activate TrkB; and iii) NT-3, which activates TrkC. The binding of neurotrophins to the extracellular domain of Trks causes the Trk kinase to autophosphorylate at several intracellular tyrosine sites and triggers downstream signal transduction pathways. Trks and neurotrophins are well known for their effects on neuronal growth and survival.","1.2 Trks and Cancer","Originally isolated from neuronal tissues, Trks were thought to mainly affect the maintenance and survival of neuronal cells. However, in the past 20 years, increasing evidence has suggested that Trks play key roles in malignant transformation, chemotaxis, metastasis, and survival signaling in human tumors. The association between Trks and cancer focused on prostate cancer in earlier years and the topic has been reviewed. For example, it was reported that malignant prostate epithelial cells secrete a series of neurotrophins and at least one Trks. In pancreatic cancer, it was proposed that paracrine and\/or autocrine neurotrophin-Trk interactions may influence the invasive behavior of the cancer. TrkB was also reported to be overexpressed in metastatic human pancreatic cancer cells. Recently, there have been a number of new findings in other cancer settings. For example, a translocation leads to expression of a fusion protein derived from the N-terminus of the ETV6 transcription factor and the C-terminal kinase domain of TrkC. The resulting ETV6-TrkC fusions are oncogenic in vitro and appear causative in secretory breast carcinoma and some acute myelogenous leukemias (AML). Constitutively active TrkA fusions occurred in a subset of papillary thyroid cancers and colon carcinomas. In neuroblastoma, TrkB expression was reported to be a strong predictor of aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis, and TrkB overexpression was also associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy in neuroblastoma tumor cells in vitro. One report showed that a novel splice variant of TrkA called TrkAIII signaled in the absence of neurotrophins through the inositol phosphate-AKT pathway in a subset of neuroblastoma. Also, mutational analysis of the tyrosine kinome revealed that Trk mutations occurred in colorectal and lung cancers. In summary, Trks have been linked to a variety of human cancers, and discovering a Trk inhibitor and testing it clinically might provide further insight to the biological and medical hypothesis of treating cancer with targeted therapies.","1.3 Trks and Pain","Besides the newly developed association with cancer, Trks are also being recognized as an important mediator of pain sensation. Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a disorder of the peripheral nerves (and normally innervated sweat glands) that prevents the patient from either being able to adequately perceive painful stimuli or to sweat. TrkA defects have been shown to cause CIPA in various ethnic groups.","Currently, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opiates have low efficacy and\/or side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal\/renal and psychotropic side effects, respectively) against neuropathic pain and therefore development of novel pain treatments is highly desired. It has been recognized that NGF levels are elevated in response to chronic pain, injury and inflammation and the administration of exogenous NGF increases pain hypersensitivity. In addition, inhibition of NGF function with either anti-NGF antibodies or non-selective small molecule Trk inhibitors has been shown to have effects on pain in animal models. It appears that a selective Trk inhibitor (inhibiting at least NGF's target, the TrkA receptor) might provide clinical benefit for the treatment of pain. Excellent earlier reviews have covered targeting NGF\/BDNF for the treatment of pain so this review will only focus on small molecule Trk kinase inhibitors claimed against cancer and pain. However, it is notable that the NGF antibody tanezumab was very recently reported to show good efficacy in a Phase II trial against osteoarthritic knee pain.\u201d","International Patent Application publication number WO2009\/012283 refers to various fluorophenyl compounds as Trk inhibitors; International Patent Application publication numbers WO2009\/152087, WO2008\/080015 and WO2008\/08001 and WO2009\/152083 refer to various fused pyrroles as kinase modulators; International Patent Application publication numbers WO2009\/143024 and WO2009\/143018 refer to various pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines substituted as Trk inhibitors; International Patent Application publication numbers WO2004\/056830 and WO2005\/116035 describe various 4-amino-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as Trk inhibitors.

The whole contents of those application in their entirety are herewith included by reference thereto.","Thus Trk inhibitors have a wide variety of potential medical uses. There is a need to provide new Trk inhibitors that are good drug candidates. In particular, compounds should preferably bind potently to the Trk receptors in a selective manner compared to other receptors, whilst showing little affinity for other receptors, including other kinase and\/or GPC receptors, and show functional activity as Trk receptor antagonists. They should be non-toxic and demonstrate few side-effects. Furthermore, the ideal drug candidate will exist in a physical form that is stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated. They should preferably be e.g. well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and\/or be injectable directly into the bloodstream, muscle, or subcutaneously, and\/or be metabolically stable and possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties.","Among the aims of this invention are to provide orally-active, efficacious, compounds and salts which can be used as active drug substances, particularly Trk antagonists, i.e. that block the intracellular kinase activity of the Trk, e.g. TrkA (NGF) receptor. Other desirable features include good HLM\/hepatocyte stability, oral bioavailability, metabolic stability, absorption, selectivity over other types of kinase, dofetilide selectivity. Preferable compounds and salts will show a lack of CYP inhibition\/induction, and be CNS-sparing.","The present invention provides compounds of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"38.02mm","wi":"66.63mm","file":"US09163021-20151020-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["A ","B","C ","D ","1 ","102 "],"sub":["1-4 ","2","2-4 ","1-4 ","1-3 ","3-6 "]},"The invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The invention is also directed to a method of treating a disease or condition indicated for treatment with a Trk antagonist, in a subject, by administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the remaining description and claims.","Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are potent antagonists at Trk receptors, and have a suitable PK profile to enable once daily dosing.","The compounds of the present invention are potentially useful in the treatment of a range of disorders where a Trk antagonist is indicated, particularly pain indications. Depending on the disease and condition of the patient, the term \u201ctreatment\u201d as used herein may include one or more of curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.","According to the invention a compound of the present invention may be useful to treat any physiological pain such as inflammatory pain, nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, acute pain, chronic pain, musculo-skeletal pain, on-going pain, central pain, heart and vascular pain, head pain, orofacial pain. Other pain conditions which may be treated include intense acute pain and chronic pain conditions which may involve the same pain pathways driven by pathophysiological processes and as such cease to provide a protective mechanism and instead contribute to debilitating symptoms associated with a wide range of disease states.","Pain is a feature of many trauma and disease states. When a substantial injury, via disease or trauma, to body tissue occurs the characteristics of nociceptor activation are altered, this leads to hypersensitivity at the site of damage and in nearby normal tissue. In acute pain the sensitivity returns to normal once the injury has healed. However, in many chronic pain states, the hypersensitivity far outlasts the healing process and is normally due to nervous system injury due to maladaptation of the afferent fibres (Woolf & Salter 2000 Science 288: 1765-1768). Clinical pain is present when discomfort and abnormal sensitivity feature among the patient's symptoms. There are a number of typical pain subtypes: 1) spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning, or stabbing; 2) pain responses to noxious stimuli are exaggerated (hyperalgesia); 3) pain is produced by normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia) (Meyer et al., 1994 Textbook of Pain 13-44). Pain can be divided into a number of different areas because of differing pathophysiology, these include nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic pain among others. It should be noted that some types of pain have multiple aetiologies and thus can be classified in more than one area, e.g. Back pain, Cancer pain have both nociceptive and neuropathic components.","Nociceptive Pain","Nociceptive pain is induced by tissue injury or by intense stimuli with the potential to cause injury. Pain afferents are activated by transduction of stimuli by nociceptors at the site of injury and sensitise the spinal cord at the level of their termination. This is then relayed up the spinal tracts to the brain where pain is perceived (Meyer et al., 1994 Textbook of Pain 13-44). The activation of nociceptors activates two types of afferent nerve fibres. Myelinated A-delta fibres transmit rapidly and are responsible for the sharp and stabbing pain sensations, whilst unmyelinated C fibres transmit at a slower rate and convey the dull or aching pain. Moderate to severe acute nociceptive pain is a prominent feature of, but is not limited to pain from strains\/sprains, post-operative pain (pain following any type of surgical procedure), posttraumatic pain, burns, myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, and renal colic. Also cancer related acute pain syndromes commonly due to therapeutic interactions such as chemotherapy toxicity, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiotherapy. Moderate to severe acute nociceptive pain is a prominent feature of, but is not limited to, cancer pain which may be tumour related pain, (e.g. bone pain, headache and facial pain, viscera pain) or associated with cancer therapy (e.g. postchemotherapy syndromes, chronic postsurgical pain syndromes, post radiation syndromes), back pain which may be due to herniated or ruptured intervertabral discs or abnormalities of the lumbar facet joints, sacroiliac joints, paraspinal muscles or the posterior longitudinal ligament.","Neuropathic Pain","According to the invention a compound of the present invention can potentially be used to treat neuropathic pain and the symptoms of neuropathic pain including hyperalgesia, allodynia and ongoing pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system (IASP definition). Nerve damage can be caused by trauma and disease and thus the term \u2018neuropathic pain\u2019 encompasses many disorders with diverse aetiologies. These include but are not limited to, Diabetic neuropathy, Post herpetic neuralgia, Back pain, Cancer neuropathy, HIV neuropathy, Phantom limb pain, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, chronic alcoholism, hypothyroidism, trigeminal neuralgia, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Neuropathic pain is pathological as it has no protective role. It is often present well after the original cause has dissipated, commonly lasting for years, significantly decreasing a patients quality of life (Woolf and Mannion 1999 Lancet 353: 1959-1964). The symptoms of neuropathic pain are difficult to treat, as they are often heterogeneous even between patients with the same disease (Woolf & Decosterd 1999 Pain Supp. 6: S141-S147; Woolf and Mannion 1999 Lancet 353: 1959-1964). They include spontaneous pain, which can be continuous, or paroxysmal and abnormal evoked pain, such as hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to a noxious stimulus) and allodynia (sensitivity to a normally innocuous stimulus).","Intense Acute Pain and Chronic Pain","Intense acute pain and chronic pain may involve the same pathways driven by pathophysiological processes and as such cease to provide a protective mechanism and instead contribute to debilitating symptoms associated with a wide range of disease states. Pain is a feature of many trauma and disease states. When a substantial injury, via disease or trauma, to body tissue occurs the characteristics of nociceptor activation are altered. There is sensitisation in the periphery, locally around the injury and centrally where the nociceptors terminate. This leads to hypersensitivity at the site of damage and in nearby normal tissue. In acute pain these mechanisms can be useful and allow for the repair processes to take place and the hypersensitivity returns to normal once the injury has healed. However, in many chronic pain states, the hypersensitivity far outlasts the healing process and is normally due to nervous system injury. This injury often leads to maladaptation of the afferent fibres (Woolf & Salter 2000 Science 288: 1765-1768). Clinical pain is present when discomfort and abnormal sensitivity feature among the patient's symptoms. Patients tend to be quite heterogeneous and may present with various pain symptoms. There are a number of typical pain subtypes: 1) spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning, or stabbing; 2) exaggerated pain responses to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia); 3) pain is produced by normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia) (Meyer et al., 1994 Textbook of Pain 13-44). Although patients with back pain, arthritis pain, CNS trauma, or neuropathic pain may have similar symptoms, the underlying mechanisms are different and, therefore, may require different treatment strategies.","Chronic Pain","Chronic pain comprises one or more of, chronic nociceptive pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic inflammatory pain, breakthrough pain, persistent pain hyperalgesia, allodynia, central sensitisation, peripheral sensitisation, disinhibition and augmented facilitation.","Chronic pain includes cancer pain, e.g. cancer pain arising from malignancy, adenocarcinoma in glandular tissue, blastoma in embryonic tissue of organs, carcinoma in epithelial tissue, leukemia in tissues that form blood cells, lymphoma in lymphatic tissue, myeloma in bone marrow, sarcoma in connective or supportive tissue, adrenal cancer, AIDS-related lymphoma, anemia, bladder cancer, bone cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, carcinoid tumour s, cervical cancer, chemotherapy, colon cancer, cytopenia, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, head cancer, neck cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's, nervous system tumours, oral cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, skin cancer, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, urethral cancer, bone cancer, sarcomas cancer of the connective tissue, cancer of bone tissue, cancer of blood-forming cells, cancer of bone marrow, multiple myeloma, leukaemia, primary or secondary bone cancer, tumours that metastasize to the bone, tumours infiltrating the nerve and hollow viscus, tumours near neural structures. Cancer pain also comprises visceral pain, e.g. visceral pain which arises from pancreatic cancer and\/or metastases in the abdomen, somatic pain, e.g. somatic pain due to one or more of bone cancer, metastasis in the bone, postsurgical pain, sarcomas cancer of the connective tissue, cancer of bone tissue, cancer of blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, multiple myeloma, leukaemia, primary or secondary bone cancer.","Inflammatory Pain","Inflammatory conditions include acute inflammation, persistent acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, and combined acute and chronic inflammation.","Inflammatory pain includes acute inflammatory pain and\/or chronic inflammatory pain wherein the chronic inflammatory pain can be pain involving both peripheral and central sensitisation and\/or mixed etiology pain involving both inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain or nociceptive pain components. Inflammatory pain also comprises hyperalgesia, e.g. primary and\/or secondary hyperalgesia. Additionally or alternatively the inflammatory pain can include allodynia. Inflammatory pain also comprises pain that persists beyond resolution of an underlying disorder or inflammatory condition or healing of an injury.","Inflammatory pain is pain resulting an inflammatory condition. e.g. in response to acute tissue injury due to trauma, disease e.g. an inflammatory disease, immune reaction, the presence of foreign substances, chemicals or infective particles for example micro-organisms. Inflammatory conditions can be either acute or chronic inflammation or both.","Inflammatory pain can result from an inflammatory condition due to an inflammatory disease such as inflammatory joint diseases, inflammatory connective tissue diseases, inflammatory autoimmune diseases, inflammatory myopathies, inflammatory digestive system diseases, inflammatory air way diseases, cellular immune inflammation diseases, hypersensitivities and allergies, vasular inflammation diseases, non-immune inflammatory disease, synovitis, villonodular synovitis, arthralgias, ankylosing spondylitis, spondyloarthritis, spondyloarthropathy, gout, Pagets disease, periarticular disorders such as bursitis, rheumatoid disease, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis in particular, represents ongoing inflammation associated with severe pain. Arthritic pain is a form of inflammatory pain and arises from inflammation in a joint which causes both peripheral sensitization and central sensitization. Under inflammatory conditions the nociceptive system is activated by normally innocuous and nonpainful mechanical stimuli. Additionally when the joint is at rest pain is present and appears as spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia (augmented pain response on noxious stimulation and pain on normally nonpainful stimulation). Inflammatory processes in peripheral tissues lead to central sensitization in the spinal cord, which contributes to hyperalgesia and allodynia typically associated with inflammatory pain. Other types of inflammatory pain include inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).","Other Types of Pain","Other types of pain include but are not limited to:\n\n","Head pain including but not limited to migraine, migraine with aura, migraine without aura cluster headache, tension-type headache. Orofacial pain including but not limited to dental pain, temporomandibular myofascial pain, tinnitus, hot flushes, restless leg syndrome and blocking development of abuse potential.

A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid; a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose; or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.","Other Technologies","The compounds and salts of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and\/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.","Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91\/11172, WO 94\/02518 and WO 98\/55148.","For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds and salts of the invention is typically in the range 0.1 mg to 200 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration, preferred in the range 1 mg to 100 mg and more preferred in the range 1 mg to 50 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses.","These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 65 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.","For the above-mentioned therapeutic uses, the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound or salt employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the disorder indicated. The total daily dosage of the compound of formula (0\/salt\/solvate (active ingredient) will, generally, be in the range from 1 mg to 1 gram, preferably 1 mg to 250 mg, more preferably 10 mg to 100 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses. The present invention also encompasses sustained release compositions.","The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.","Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.","Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefor, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.","Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form, as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the chemotherapeutic agent and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.","Thus, the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the disclosure provided herein, that the dose and dosing regimen is adjusted in accordance with methods well-known in the therapeutic arts. That is, the maximum tolerable dose can be readily established, and the effective amount providing a detectable therapeutic benefit to a patient may also be determined, as can the temporal requirements for administering each agent to provide a detectable therapeutic benefit to the patient. Accordingly, while certain dose and administration regimens are exemplified herein, these examples in no way limit the dose and administration regimen that may be provided to a patient in practicing the present invention.","It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated, and may include single or multiple doses. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. For example, doses may be adjusted based on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters, which may include clinical effects such as toxic effects and\/or laboratory values. Thus, the present invention encompasses intra-patient dose-escalation as determined by the skilled artisan. Determining appropriate dosages and regiments for administration of the chemotherapeutic agent are well-known in the relevant art and would be understood to be encompassed by the skilled artisan once provided the teachings disclosed herein.","A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a \u201cunit dose\u201d is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage.","For parenteral dosages, this may conveniently be prepared as a solution or as a dry powder requiring dissolution by a pharmacist, medical practitioner or the patient. It may be provided in a bottle or sterile syringe. For example it may be provided as a powder in a multicompartment syringe which allows the dry powder and solvent to be mixed just prior to administration (to aid long-term stability and storage). Syringes could be used which allow multiple doses to be administered from a single device.","The relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100% (w\/w) active ingredient.","In addition to the active ingredient, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may further comprise one or more additional pharmaceutically active agents.","Controlled- or sustained-release formulations of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be made using conventional technology.","As used herein, \u201cparenteral administration\u201d of a pharmaceutical composition includes any route of administration characterized by physical breaching of a tissue of a subject and administration of the pharmaceutical composition through the breach in the tissue. Parenteral administration thus includes, but is not limited to, administration of a pharmaceutical composition by injection of the composition, by application of the composition through a surgical incision, by application of the composition through a tissue-penetrating non-surgical wound, and the like. In particular, parenteral administration is contemplated to include, but is not limited to, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, and kidney dialytic infusion techniques.","Formulations of a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water or sterile isotonic saline. Such formulations may be prepared, packaged, or sold in a form suitable for bolus administration or for continuous administration. Injectable formulations may be prepared, packaged, or sold in unit dosage form, such as in ampules or in multi-dose containers containing a preservative. Formulations for parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, suspensions, solutions, emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, pastes, and implantable sustained-release or biodegradable formulations as discussed below. Such formulations may further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, suspending, stabilizing, or dispersing agents. In one embodiment of a formulation for parenteral administration, the active ingredient is provided in dry (i.e. powder or granular) form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water) prior to parenteral administration of the reconstituted composition.","A composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. The route and\/or mode of administration vary depending upon the desired results. The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems.","Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are described by e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1978). Pharmaceutical compositions are preferably manufactured under GMP conditions.","The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared, packaged, or sold in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension or solution. This suspension or solution may be formulated according to the known art, and may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, additional ingredients such as the dispersing agents, wetting agents, or suspending agents described herein. Such sterile injectable formulations may be prepared using a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, such as water or 1,3-butane diol, for example. Other acceptable diluents and solvents include, but are not limited to, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, and fixed oils such as synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Other parentally-administrable formulations which are useful include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form, in a liposomal preparation, or as a component of a biodegradable polymer system. Compositions for sustained release or implantation may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials such as an emulsion, an ion exchange resin, a sparingly soluble polymer, or a sparingly soluble salt.","The precise dosage administered of each active ingredient will vary depending upon any number of factors, including but not limited to, the type of animal and type of disease state being treated, the age of the animal, and the route(s) of administration.","The following non-limiting Preparations and Examples illustrate the preparation of compounds and salts of the present invention.","The Preparations and Examples that follow illustrate the invention but do not limit the invention in any way. All starting materials are available commercially or described in the literature. All temperature are in \u00b0 C. Flash column chromatography was carried out using Merck silica gel 60 (9385) or Redisep silica. NMR was carried out using a Varian Mercury 400 MHz NMR spectrometer or a Jeol ECX 400 MHz NMR. Where it is stated that compounds were prepared in the manner described for an earlier Preparation or Example, the skilled person will appreciate that reaction times, number of equivalents of reagents and reaction temperatures may have been modified for each specific reaction, and that it may nevertheless be necessary, or desirable, to employ different work-up or purification conditions.","Where singleton compounds have been analysed by LCMS, there are several methods used.
