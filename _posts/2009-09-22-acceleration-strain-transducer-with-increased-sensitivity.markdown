title: Acceleration strain transducer with increased sensitivity
abstract: An accelerometer has a substantially linear strain sensor with a transducer joined to the strain sensor. The transducer has a base that provides rigidity perpendicular to a preferred measurement direction. A plurality of outer flaps are joined to the base supporting the strain sensor. The outer flaps are capable of translating acceleration in the predefined direction to strain in the strain sensor. Two centermost flaps are positioned on either side of the center line of the transducer. Struts are joined between a lower portion of one the centermost flap and an uppermost portion of the nearest outer flap. The struts enhance strain by linking outer flap motion to the centermost flaps. Bridges are joined between each two adjacent outer flaps supporting the strain sensor.

No. 11\/934,846, filed 5 Nov. 2007. This application repeats a substantial portion of prior filed application Ser. No. 11\/934,846, filed 5 Nov. 2007, and adds and claims additional disclosure not present in the prior filed application.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to instruments and more particularly to a transducer that can be used with a strain sensor to make an accelerometer.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Traditional electrical accelerometers use a magnetic mass supported by a spring in a housing. An induction coil is wound around the interior of the housing. Acceleration is sensed by measuring the electromotive force induced in the induction coil by movement of the magnetic mass. Piezoceramic transducers use a piezoelectric effect to produce a low voltage output in response to force. These sensors usually require a preamplifier to be placed in close proximity. In remote applications, especially those involving arrays of accelerometers, the preamplifiers and telemetry combining signals for transmission to the receive site, can be large and a major factor in the system expense.","Fiber optic sensor systems remove the requirement for preamplification and electronic telemetry. Very low sensitivity accelerometers are based on the acceleration causing two optical waveguides to be misaligned, thus varying the intensity of the light signal. Other accelerometers use large coils of tens of meters of optical fiber. The large amount of fiber and the limited bend diameter of the fiber limit these to fairly large sizes.","Another type of optical accelerometer uses a fiber optic segment positioned between a base and a ridged reaction mass. Acceleration causes the reaction mass to pinch the fiber optic segment against the base. Acceleration can be measured by measuring the modulation of the light passing through the fiber optic segment.","Sometimes it is more convenient to measure strain, and a conventional technique is the use of a force transducer to translate acceleration into strain. Strain sensors include a foil strain gauge having a plurality of foil traces on a backing material. This gauge is mounted on an object to measure elongation of the object. Strain is measured by measuring the increased resistance in the strain gauge. Another linear electrical strain sensor can be constructed by providing mercury or some other conductive material in an elastomeric tube. The elastomeric tube is mounted to the object. Stretching of the tube results in a narrowing of the cross-sectional area which increases electrical resistance in the conductive material. This resistance can be measured giving an indication of strain.","A fiber optic sensor can also be used to measure strain. A piece of fiber optic is provided that has a Bragg grating written in the fiber optic at either end of a sensing region. The sensing region is mounted to an object being measured, and elongation of the sensor can be measured by providing light pulses at a known interval in the fiber optic and collecting the reflected pulses. Elongation of the fiber optic sensor region causes a measurable delay in the pulses.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/934,850, which is incorporated by reference herein, teaches use of a fiber optic laser to measure strain. , below, has additional details concerning the use of fiber laser sensors.","As discussed herein, there is provided an accelerometer having a transducer that can be used with a variety of strain sensors.","Accordingly, there is provided an accelerometer having a substantially linear strain sensor with a transducer joined to the strain sensor. The transducer has a base that provides rigidity perpendicular to a preferred measurement direction. A plurality of outer flaps are joined to the base supporting the strain sensor. The outer flaps are capable of translating acceleration in the predefined direction to strain in the strain sensor. Two centermost flaps are positioned on either side of the center line of the transducer. Struts are joined between a lower portion of one the centermost flap and an uppermost portion of the nearest outer flap. The struts enhance strain by linking outer flap motion to the centermost flaps. Bridges are joined between each two adjacent outer flaps supporting the strain sensor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","12","14","16","14","14","16","18","18","12","12"]},"After coherent light passes through distributor , it is absorbed by the doping material in fiber laser . Absorption of this light causes the doping material to emit photons which are gathered by resonance between the gratings. This causes fiber laser  to emit a narrow single mode of light. Fiber laser  is mounted to a transducer  such that acceleration of the transducer material strains the fiber laser cavity. This strain shifts the emission wavelength of the fiber laser . Transducer  can have a wide variety of constructions that will be discussed hereinafter.","Fiber laser emission returns along fiber  to wavelength division multiplexer  where it is separated onto analysis path . An interferometer  such as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is positioned on analysis path . Interferometer  converts the shifted emission wavelength of fiber laser into a phase shift of the fiber laser light. Interferometer  typically includes a first beam splitter A having a delay loop B on one leg and a modulator C on the second leg. Signals from the delay loop B and modulator C are combined in a second beam splitter D to produce the phase shifted signal. Other interferometer designs can produce the same type of signal. A receiver  receives the phase shifted signal. Receiver  is capable of demodulating and detecting the signal from the fiber laser by various methods well known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","28","20","28"]},"Transducer  has at least one flap . Flap  is attached to a base  of the transducer  and extends toward a center  of strain sensor  at an angle. Equal numbers of flaps  can be provided on each side of center , and all flaps  angle toward the center . Transducer  can be made from a polymer material. Transducer  allows vertical movement of flaps , as shown, but resists movement in the transverse direction because of its geometry. Movement in the longitudinal direction cannot be controlled without affecting the vertical motion induced by acceleration. The affect of the longitudinal motion tends to cancel out because of the flap arrangement. The volume in between flaps  can be a vacuum, gas, liquid, or solid; however, it should allow movement of flaps . A gas, liquid or solid could provide damping, if necessary. In this embodiment, the combined top surfaces  of the flaps  form an interrupted surface  that is higher near center . Sensor  is mounted under tension across the top surfaces  of the flaps  and fixed to the outer two flaps with an adhesive  such as ultra-violet cured epoxy. Adhesive  should not interfere with sensor . Mounting to the outermost flaps  reduces the constraint on the ends of the sensor  and yields greater sensitivity to acceleration.","Increasing the height of interrupted surface  near center  allows sensor  contact with all of the flap upper surfaces . Friction holds the sensor  in place laterally. The body of each flap  serves as an inertial mass. When transducer  is accelerated away from sensor , flaps  move toward sensor  and outward from the center  due to the angle of the flaps . This causes an unsupported portion  of the sensor  between the centermost two flaps  to be further tensioned. The outer flaps  move with the inner flaps  and produce additional strain on the fiber portion at center . The flaps  have sufficient width in the direction perpendicular to the direction being sensed to ensure that the flaps  are much more stiff against motion in that direction. This stiffness in the transverse direction ensures that the accelerometer  has good isolation against responding to accelerations in that direction, known as cross-axis isolation. Transducer  structure also provides good isolation against longitudinal accelerations in the direction parallel to sensor . In this direction, the half of the flaps  on one side of the center  move upward and outward, while the half of the flaps  on the other side of the center  move downward and inward. These two motions tend to cancel, producing little net strain on the center  of the sensor .","The unsupported fiber portion  between the center two flaps  can also vibrate in a string mode. This mode is undesirable because it is equally susceptible to acceleration in both directions transverse to the sensor . Thus, it is desirable to minimize this mode and push its resonance to a frequency above that in the sensing range. The response of this mode is controlled by mounting the sensor  to the transducer  with sufficient tension.","A transducer of this form is basically a mass\/spring system operated well below resonance. In an idealized mass\/spring system the natural or resonant frequency of the system is given by the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","n"]},"mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":["K","M"]}},"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sub":["n ","0 "],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["a=a","t"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"X","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"Ma","mn":"0"},"mi":"K"},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c9","msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","n"]}}},"mn":"2"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["0","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"X","msub":{"mi":"a","mn":"0"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":["M","K"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["28","30"],"sub":"n"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["44","28","44","28","44","40","44","46","48"]},"This embodiment has outer flaps  and centermost flaps  for translating accelerations perpendicular (upward in the FIG.) to transducer  into tensions in sensor . The centermost flaps  are positioned on each side of and proximate to center line , and the outer flaps  are positioned horizontally along base  between the centermost flap  and an end of base . A first end A of each flap is joined to base  and a second end B of each flap supports sensor . The second ends B of combined flaps form a curved surface for maintaining contact between the flaps and the sensor. The flaps are angled towards the center line  of the transducer .","The flaps are configured based on their position in transducer . Outer flaps  each have a neck  joined to a body . Neck  acts to reduce the spring constant K of the outer flap . Body  acts as a mass. One bridge  is joined between each adjacent outer flap . A strut  is joined between a lower portion of each centermost flap  and an upper portion of the adjacent outer flap .","The centermost flaps  are designed to be stiff but less massive than outer flaps . The outer flaps  have most of their mass away from base  to maximize the force that they apply to the centermost flap . Resonance frequency of the outer flaps  is maintained by having greater stiffness than the centermost flaps . Stiffness can be adjusted by changing the width of the centermost flaps  or by providing voids in the flaps or necks.","In operation, when the transducer is accelerated vertically, inertia of outer flaps  causes them to move downward toward base  and toward center line . The second ends B of outer flaps  move together because of linking by bridges . Struts  transfer this force to centermost flaps . Each centermost flap  acts as a lever arm. A small motion of strut  results in a relatively large motion at second ends B of centermost flaps .
