{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","PRIORITY CLAIM","FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention claimed herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract, and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 USC 202) in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.","This application claims the benefit of PCT application PCT\/US2008\/001136, filed 28 Jan. 2008.","The present invention relates to electron paramagnetic resonance imaging.","Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging has been recently recognized as an important tool for non-invasive imaging of free radicals and REDOX (reduction\/oxidization) metabolism. In principle, electron paramagnetic resonance may be observed at frequencies of a few MHz in magnetic fields of a few Gauss, up to the microwave region in a magnetic field of a few thousand Gauss. Traditionally, the latter frequency region is often chosen because the signal-to-noise ratio is usually much improved with the use of relatively high magnetic fields, which implies a relatively high Lamour frequency. However, the use of microwave radiation (e.g., in the 1 GHz to 60 GHz region) is currently known to require a special resonance cavity that is not suitable for non-invasive imaging of a large size living animal, such as a human. For example, the motion of an animal in a resonance cavity, such as motion due to respiration or a beating heart, may cause changes in the resonance frequency of the cavity. In addition, generally the skin depth decreases as the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation increases, which may preclude imaging within regions of interest in a human for EPR imaging systems operating in the 1 GHz to 60 GHz region. Furthermore, high magnetic fields often pose a safety hazard.","The high frequency microwave radiation of prior art EPR imaging systems appears to pose a physical and biological hindrance to the advance of EPR imaging technology for large size living animals. Recently, there has been work in developing an EPR imaging system that employs low magnetic fields (e.g., on the order of 10 mT) at radio frequencies (e.g., about 300 MHz) where the RF (radio frequency) energy may penetrate into biological objects. However, EPR techniques developed for clinical applications to date still rely on conventional RF detection schemes which are believed to degrade signal-to-noise ratio at low magnetic fields.","In the description that follows, the scope of the term \u201csome embodiments\u201d is not to be so limited as to mean more than one embodiment, but rather, the scope may include one embodiment, more than one embodiment, or perhaps all embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","104","102","102","104"]},"The remaining components in the detector of  are kept at a low temperature during operation so that they operate in their superconducting state. For some embodiments, the temperature is about 4.2 Kelvin, although for some embodiments, high-temperature superconductors may be used. The superconducting temperature is maintained by operating these components in a Dewar or cryostat, with electrical connections available for room temperature components. For ease of illustration, only a portion of a Dewar, labeled as , is shown in .","The EPR imaging embodiment of  comprises a second order gradiometer within dashed rectangle  to receive the electron spin echo pulses from object . In the particular embodiment of , the gradiometer comprises two turns (A), four turns (B), and two turns (C) of 80 \u03bcm diameter Nb (Niobium) wire wound on a MACOR\u00ae former grooved for the wire. MACOR is a registered trademark of Corning Glass Works Corporation, Houghton Park, Corning, N.Y. For the particular embodiment of , the gradiometer baseline is 55 mm and the loop diameter is 25.4 mm. The inductance of the gradiometer is 1.02 \u03bcH. The total effective sensing area of the gradiometer is about 6.5 mm. The average distance from the gradiometer to object  is about 15 mm. By using a gradiometer, the EPR imaging system of  is not sensitive to homogeneous magnetic fields, such as unwanted magnetic fields from far away sources that are essentially homogenous over the scale of the gradiometer. Other embodiments other than that described with reference to  may utilize other types of pickup coils sensitive to electron spin echo pulses.","Coil  is electrically connected to the gradiometer and is magnetically coupled to SQUID . SQUID  comprises SQUID loop A and Joshepson junctions B, and for the embodiment of  is a DC (Direct Current) SQUID. Magnetic flux from coil  links SQUID loop A. The combination of coil  and the gradiometer serves as a flux transformer. In practice, the physical dimension of SQUID  is on the order of microns, whereas the gradiometer is on the order of centimeters.","Using a flux transformer is a practical way of providing SQUID detection of magnetic flux due to the electron spin echo pulses generated by the unpaired electrons within object . Furthermore, by using SQUID  with the flux transformer, the operation frequency may be significantly lowered when compared to prior art systems. For example, for some embodiments, the operating frequency may be 1.4 MHz at the Earth's magnetic field of 0.5 Gauss. At this relatively low frequency, the electron spin echo pulses may be detected by use of a gradiometer without the need for a cavity resonator. Furthermore, the skin depth of muscle tissues at 2 MHz is approximately 30 cm. The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is essentially negligible for an operating frequency in the 1 MHz range.","The embodiment of  also makes use of a SQUID array amplifier, comprising a plurality of coils coupled to the output of SQUID , and a plurality of SQUIDs magnetically coupled to the coils. For simplicity, only four SQUIDs in an array amplifier are shown in , but in practice, there may be on the order of one hundred SQUIDs in a SQUID array amplifier. In the simplified SQUID array amplifier of , coils A, A, A, and A are connected in series with each other, and connected to the output of SQUID  by way of resistor . SQUIDs B, B, B, and B are connected in series with each other, where SQUID B is magnetically coupled to coil A, SQUID B is magnetically coupled to coil A, SQUID B is magnetically coupled to coil A, and SQUID B is magnetically coupled to coil A.","The output of the SQUID array amplifier is taken across series-connected SQUIDs B, B, B, and B. For some embodiments, the SQUID array amplifier is expected to have a bandwidth of about 1 MHz using commercially available SQUIDs.","Well-known components used in the art of SQUID detectors are not shown in  for simplicity. For example, typically, SQUID readout electronics employ feedback to keep the flux in the SQUID loop at a sensitive part of its response (modulation) function and to linearize the response.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","202","204","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","102","212","212","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["106","210"]},"The measurement sequence includes a pre-polarization interval, followed by encoding and acquisition. Pre-polarization coil  polarizes object  in a higher magnetic field than the homogeneous static magnetic field provided by Helmholtz coil , and this pre-polarization technique uses a fast ramping-down of the pre-polarizing field. For the embodiment of , pre-polarizing coil  comprises two identical short and thick solenoids, and has a symmetric design so that it does not induce an appreciable magnetic flux to the gradiometer. In this way, a current-limiting device is not necessarily needed in the gradiometer to protect SQUID  from an excessive current that may be induced by a fast change (about 10 T\/s) of the pre-polarizing field. It was found that any remaining residual asymmetry in the coil design and position of pre-polarization coil  may be sufficiently corrected by moving Dewar  with respect to pre-polarization coil  while observing the SQUID voltage response to a low-frequency AC (Alternating Current) magnetic field induced in pre-polarization coil . For some embodiments, the polarization provided by pre-polarization coil  may not be required for the EPR detection if the signal strength is large enough.","The shape and the separation of the two solenoids for pre-polarization coil  may be chosen for easy construction, convenient imaging volume access, and based upon the tentative sample size of object . The thickness and the diameter of the wire for pre-polarization coil  were determined to maximize the field strength at the center at fixed power. Once the shape and the size are determined, the ratio of the field strength to the applied power is independent of the wire diameter and the number of windings. The coil former was built out of fiberglass to prevent eddy current effects and induced magnetization. For this same reason, most of the experimental setup for an embodiment was built out of various fiberglass materials with adequate magnetic characteristics for each component.","For some embodiments, it was found that if the two solenoids forming pre-polarization coil  were aligned coaxially, then the close proximity of the massive copper coils to the gradiometer induced significant thermal noise. To reduce the noise and to increase the magnetic field with the distance from the gradiometer, the solenoids were aligned in a V shape so that the separation is larger at the top end near the gradiometer. This arrangement was found to partially compensate the sensitivity profile of the gradiometer.","For an experimental embodiment, the parameters for the coil system of  may be described as follows. For pre-polarization coil , two solenoids were used, each with an outer diameter of 204 mm, an inner diameter of 38 mm, a thickness of 35 mm, with a top separation of 149 mm and a bottom separation of 19 mm. The windings comprised 398 turns in 6 parallel groups, to provide a magnetic field of 2.4 mT\/A. Helmholtz coil  is a square shaped coil with a 1108 mm side and a separation of 603 mm. The windings comprised 30 turns to provide 44 \u03bcT\/A. Maxwell coil  is a square shaped coil with a 1108 mm side, with windings comprising 15 turns in two parallel groups, to provide a magnetic field gradient of 32 \u03bcTmA. X-gradient coil  and y-gradient coil  are each a bi-planar coil, each with a long side of 1087 mm, a short side of 188 mm, having a plane separation of 1108 mm and an in-plane separation of 647 mm. Each has windings comprising 15 turns in two parallel groups, to provide a magnetic field gradient of 12 \u03bcTmA. Excitation coil  comprised a pair of rectangular coils, each with a long side of 400 mm, a short side of 319 mm, with a separation of 183 mm, with each winding comprising 2 turns to provide a magnetic field of 9.5 \u03bcT\/A.","Various modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as defined below."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
