MV37 according to the method of Murray et al., (Nucl. Acids Res., 8, 4321, 1980). PCR was performed using the thus obtained chromosomal DNA as a template and the above-synthesized primers. As a result, an about 830-bp DNA fragment thought to be a portion of the TPM gene was obtained. PCR was performed under reaction conditions specified in the instruction manual using PrimeStar (Takara Bio Inc.) as DNA polymerase. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment was determined by direct sequencing. The nucleotide sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 in the sequence listing.","(Determination of the Full-Length TPM Gene Sequence by Inverse-PCR Method)","The chromosomal DNA of sp. MV37 was completely digested with a restriction enzyme (Fba I, Pst I, Xho I or Sph I). The thus obtained digests were each intramolecularly cyclized using T4 DNA ligase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). With the use of the resultant as a template, the full nucleotide sequence of the TPM gene on the chromosomal DNA was determined by the inverse-PCR method based on the above-found partial nucleotide sequence information of the TPM gene (Nucl. Acids Res., 16, 8186 (1988)). PCR was performed using TaKaRa LA Taq with GC buffer (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) under reaction conditions specified in the instruction manual.

Also, the amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 in the sequence listing.","Based on the nucleotide sequence determined in Example 3, primer 3 (SEQ ID NO: 6 in the sequence listing) was synthesized by adding a Nde I site to the initiation codon of the TPM gene and primer 4 (SEQ ID NO: 7 in the sequence listing) was synthesized by adding a Sac I site so that it immediately followed the termination codon of the TPM gene. PCR was performed using the chromosomal DNA of sp. MV37 obtained in Example 3 as a template and these primers. Thus, double-stranded DNA containing the Nde I site added to the initiation codon of the TPM gene and the Sac I site added so that it immediately followed the termination codon was obtained. PCR was performed under reaction conditions specified in the instruction manual using a PrimeSTAR (Takara Bio Inc.). The DNA was digested with Nde I and Sac I and then the digest was inserted between the Nde I recognition site and the Sac I recognition site downstream of an lac promoter of plasmid pUCNT (WO94\/03613), so that a pNTTPM recombinant vector was obtained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0204"},"i":["E. coli ","E. coli "]},"The HB101 (pNTTPM) obtained in Example 5 was cultured in 2\u00d7 YT media (triptone 1.6%, yeast extract 1.0%, NaCl 0.5%, pH7.0) containing 200 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin.
