title: Quality of service (QoS) resources within a wireless communications system
abstract: In an embodiment, an access terminal sends a request for a level of Quality of Service (QoS) resources to an access network, the QoS resource request associated with a call attempt by the access terminal. The access terminal proceeds with call set-up for the call attempt irrespective of whether the access network grants the QoS resource request. Alternatively, the access terminal waits for an extended period of time before the call attempt is permitted to fail. In a further example, in the event of call failure, the access terminal can refrain from informing a user thereof of the call failure. In another embodiment, the access network can respond to the QoS resource request with an allocation of a lower level QoS resources than requested if the requested QoS resources are not available. The access terminal can likewise be permitted to participate in the call with the lower level QoS resources.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to acquisition and allocation of quality of service (QoS) resources within a wireless communications system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as \u201cunicast\u201d. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A \u201cbroadcast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a \u201cmulticast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or \u201cmulticast group\u201d may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a given group, sector, subnet, etc.), similar to a broadcast.","Broadcasts and\/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast\/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled \u201cPush-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007\/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques.","Additionally, modern wireless networks are built using network technologies with the ability to offer distinctly different classes (or \u201cquality\u201d) of service to user applications. As an example, voice and multimedia based applications often require and are given a higher quality of service from wireless networks, as voice based services tend to be sensitive to network interruptions (packet loss) and delays (jitter). Generic (low-speed) data applications, however, are typically less sensitive to packet loss and jitter that may be introduced by a wireless network.","Real-time multimedia based applications that require quality-of-service guarantees to offer service (including but not limited to VoIP-based applications such as high-performance push-to-talk (PTT)) are hence particularly sensitive to the inability of a wireless network to offer the specific quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees required by such services. These QoS guarantees may at times be difficult for the network provide because the QoS guarantees can either (i) require a higher level of quality of service than what the network may have been originally designed to provide across various geographical and mobility scenarios that can be encountered in the network. Including, for example, mobility events that require transfer of the packet data session or quality-of-service parameters between different parts of the network, (ii) require a type of quality-of-service that the network cannot always provide, particularly during periods of high network utilization or when multiple services simultaneously compete for the same limited network resources, or (iii) require quality-of-service guarantees that may have availability constraints that are unique to the application's specific quality-of-service requirements.","As a result, when initially deployed in a new network environment, applications relying on QoS guarantees (e.g., real-time multimedia tend) to experience abrupt (rather than graceful) disruptions in service availability when the network is unable to provide the necessary QoS guarantees. An abrupt service disruption provides a degradation to the user experience and may lead to the reduced demand of such applications.","Conventional solutions to this problem involve dedicating network resources to ensure that the application (e.g., a real-time multimedia application) always has access to the required quality-of-service. While this approach may be effective, it is also expensive, and does not offer much flexibility in providing a graceful degradation of the offered service if the quality-of-service resources are not available. Applications that rely dedicating network resources to ensure service availability typically do not scale well. Scalable applications that require network-level quality-of-service guarantees are typically allowed to only request such guarantees at \u201ccall time\u201d and release the guarantee when the resources are no longer required for that call instant (e.g. when the \u201ccall\u201d terminates).","In an embodiment, an access terminal sends a request for a level of Quality of Service (QoS) resources to an access network, the QoS resource request associated with a call attempt by the access terminal. The access terminal proceeds with call set-up for the call attempt irrespective of whether the access network grants the QoS resource request. Alternatively, the access terminal waits for an extended period of time before the call attempt is permitted to fail. In a further example, in the event of call failure, the access terminal can refrain from informing a user thereof of the call failure. In another embodiment, the access network can respond to the QoS resource request with an allocation of a lower level QoS resources than requested if the requested QoS resources are not available. The access terminal can likewise be permitted to participate in the call with the lower level QoS resources.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A10 connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA10 connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA10 connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u2019)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Generally, as discussed herein group communications, PTT calls, multimedia communications can be provided by various wireless technologies and protocols. For example, a group call can be performed using broadcast, multicast, and\/or unicast protocols. Accordingly, embodiments are not limited to any specific wireless technology or protocol.","In wireless communications systems, Quality of Service (QoS) is a general term that incorporates parameters such as, bandwidth, latency, and\/or jitter to describe a network's ability to customize the treatment of specific classes of data. For example, QoS can be used to prioritize video transmissions over Web-browsing traffic. Advanced networks can offer greater control over how data traffic is classified into classes and greater flexibility as to how the treatment of that traffic is differentiated from other traffic. For example, an AT can request a particular QoS level (\u201cQoS resources\u201d) to be associated with a communication session. If the RAN  has sufficient QoS resources in the AT's sector, the QoS level can be allocated to the requesting AT.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1","120","400","120","1","1","1"]},"The RAN  receives the request for QoS resources and determines whether sufficient QoS resources are available with AT 's sector for allocation to AT . For example, the determination of  can be based on the RAN 's QoS resource obligations to other ATs within AT 's sector. In  of , assume that the RAN  determines that sufficient QoS resources are not available for AT . In other words, the RAN  cannot accommodate AT 's request for QoS resources. In this case, the RAN  sends a message on a downlink channel to AT  indicating that AT 's QoS request for resources has been denied, . For example, in 1xEV-DO Rev. A or 1xEV-DO Rev. B networks, the denial message of  may correspond to a Fwd\/RevReservationReject message on the downlink channel.","In , AT  notifies its user of the call failure. After AT  receives the message indicating that the QoS resource request has been denied, , and indicates the call-failure to the user, , the user of AT  can instruct AT  to either re-attempt to obtain QoS resources from the RAN  (e.g., by sending another ReservationOnRequest on the reverse link access channel to the RAN , as in ), or can drop the call. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, call failures can frustrate subscribers, can cause subscribers to abandon call attempts and\/or can otherwise degrade the subscriber's experience with the service, as discussed above.","Embodiments of the present invention, which will now be described in more detail, are directed to increasing a likelihood that an AT wishing to participate in a call with a given amount of QoS resources will be granted at least a partial amount of the requested QoS resources, and\/or decreasing a delay before which the full or partial amount of QoS resources are allocated to the AT.","Multiple approaches for providing a graceful degradation in service availability for an application that nominally requires a high-level of quality-of-service guarantee from a network are described in the following. In each approach, the logic surrounding how the application (e.g., a multimedia application) itself requests quality-of-service at \u201ccall-time\u201d is modified to allow for a graceful degradation of service availability. As used herein the term \u201ccall\u201d refers to any communication session within a wireless network (e.g., a PTT call, video streaming, etc.) and \u201ccall time\u201d refers to the initial communication to setup and\/or establish the communication session.","For purpose of describing the various aspects of embodiments of the invention, it is assumed that an application that is dependent on the network to provide a certain quality-of-service guarantee in order for the application to offer service would follow a high level procedure of (1) first requesting quality-of-service from the network at \u201ccall time\u201d and either (2A) offering the service if the network is able to grant the requested quality-of-service at call-time or (2B) denying access to the service until the next call attempt if the network is not able to grant the quality-of-service at call-time. In the case of (2A), the application is assumed to release the granted quality-of-service when the call terminates.","In one embodiment, the application nominally always requests quality-of-service at call-time as described above, but ignores the result of requesting quality-of-service for the purpose of determining whether the call can proceed. The application uses any provided quality-of-service guarantee to place the call when the network is able to provide the requested quality-of-service guarantee, but also allows the call to proceed without the requested quality-of-service guarantee in the event the network is not able to provide the requested quality-of-service guarantee.","This embodiment provides for a graceful degradation in service by allowing a high-quality version of the application to be offered when the network is able to provide the quality-of-service guarantee, and a lower (e.g., degraded) version of the application to be offered when the network is not. However, because the degraded form of the application is offered without the benefit of any quality-of-service guarantees, the degraded form of the application service can be highly dependent on network performance when the requested quality-of-service guarantee is not available. Conventionally, as will be appreciated from the description of  above, the RAN  will simply fail QoS in the event a requested service level is unavailable for assignment, and will not provide a degraded level of service. RANs, such as the RAN , are generally designed to honor specific QoS profiles and not to make decisions in the event that the entire profile cannot be honored.","The QoS request may be conventional or may be bundled with other messages in an initial communication. For example, the QoS resource request message (e.g., the ReservationOnRequest message in 1xEV-DO networks) may be sent independently of other messages (i.e., non-bundled). In another example, the ReservationOnRequest message may be bundled with other messaging, such as a ConnectionRequest message that requests a TCH assignment, a Data-over-Signaling message, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","1","120","120","120","1","510","510","1","510","120","1","510","120","520","500","1","120","505","1","1","1","515","120"]},"As will be appreciated, the determined amount of QoS resources (i.e., the RAN 's \u2018best effort\u2019 at satisfying the QoS resource request message) is less than that amount of QoS resources requested by AT , because the RAN  determined in A that the requested amount of QoS could not be granted. Again, it is understood that the RAN  would simply grant the requested QoS resources if those resources are available.","Returning to , assume that the RAN  may maintain, for a period of time, the initial QoS resource request message received from AT  at A. During AT 's call, the RAN  continues to monitor its available QoS resources, A. Accordingly, if the monitoring of A indicates that additional QoS resources become available during the call, the RAN  may, on its own initiative (e.g., without receiving a subsequent ReservationOnRequest message) determine if the requested QoS can be granted. If so, the RAN  grants the newly available QoS resources to AT , A. After which, AT  communicates with the RAN  based on the granted QoS resources, A. The monitoring and additional QoS resource allocation of A and A, respectively, may continue until the amount of QoS resources indicated by the QoS resource request message of A is allocated to AT . Accordingly, even though the \u2018best effort\u2019 QoS resources are allocated relatively quickly in A, this does not preclude the RAN  from sending a later message granting a higher level of QoS resources (e.g., the full requested level).","In , the QoS resource request of A has been described for an initial call attempt. However, it is possible that the process of  can alternatively describe a subsequent call attempt (e.g., a second call attempt) that follows an earlier call attempt, as will now be described with respect to .","In an alternative embodiment, the requesting application (e.g., a multimedia application) nominally requests quality-of-service at call-time, as described above, and fails the call when the requested quality-of-service guarantee cannot be provided by the network. However, for a (subsequent) call attempt that closely follows (e.g., within a relatively short period of time) a call attempt that failed due to the network previously not being able to offer the requested quality-of-service guarantee at call-time, the application requests quality-of-service but ignores the result of requesting quality-of-service for the purpose of determining whether the subsequent call can proceed. The application uses any provided quality-of-service guarantee to place this subsequent call when the network is able to provide the requested quality-of-service guarantee, but also allows the subsequent call to proceed without the requested quality-of-service guarantee in the event the network is not able to provide the requested quality-of-service guarantee.","This embodiment results in a graceful degradation in service by allowing a high-quality version of the application to be offered when the network is able to provide the quality-of-service guarantee, and a lower (degraded) version of the application to be offered after an initial failure when the network is not. The algorithm provides a degraded form of the application service that is highly dependent on network performance only when the requested quality-of-service guarantee cannot be initially provided available; otherwise, the application provides the high-quality version of the service after a single initial failure.","Referring to , in B, a given AT (\u201cAT \u201d) sends a message (e.g., on a reverse link access channel) to the RAN  to request a given amount of QoS resources for a requesting application. In the example of , it is assumed that the QoS resource request of B is associated with an initial call attempt (i.e., a first time AT  has attempted to make a particular call). The QoS resource request may otherwise be configured as discussed above with respect to A of  (e.g., as part of a bundled call request message that also requests a traffic channel, as an independent message, etc.). The RAN  receives the QoS resource request, and denies the requested QoS resources in B. After receiving the denial of the QoS resource request, AT  indicates to a user of AT  that the call has failed, B, and an attempt to make the call, if it closely follows the original call attempt, B, follows the process defined in . Specifically, if AT  determines to re-attempt the call, the process advances to A of . Alternatively, if the re-attempt does not closely follow the initial, the process will just indicate the call has failed and possibly return to the top to repeat the initial request, B.","Accordingly, in the example of , the process of  is executed for a subsequent call attempt instead of during an initial call attempt. Thus, in this example, the call set-up that occurs irrespective of whether QoS resources are granted occurs after an initial call failure.","In this embodiment, the application nominally always requests quality-of-service at call-time as described above, but waits a prescribed period of time before failing the call when the requested quality-of-service guarantee cannot be provided by the network (RAN ). During a prescribed period of time, if the requested quality-of-service guarantee becomes available (late), the application allows a delayed form of the original call to proceed rather than failing the call. If the requested quality-of-service guarantee does not become available during the prescribed period, the application fails the call. According to embodiments of the invention, the prescribed period of time can be either predefined or configurable by either the operator offering the application or the user using the service.","This embodiment can result in a graceful degradation in service by allowing a high-quality version of the application to be offered when the network is able to provide the quality-of-service guarantee, and a lower (degraded) version of the application to be offered after an initial failure when the network is able to offer the requested quality-of-service guarantee after a delay. The algorithm is useful in offering a degraded form of the service when the ability of the network to provide requested quality-of-service guarantee is highly dependent on the specific instance of when the request is made. As such the degraded form of the application takes the form of a delayed version of the original high-quality service in the embodiment of , discussed next.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["600","1","605","120"]},"Accordingly, in A, AT  sends a message (e.g., on a reverse link access channel) to the RAN  to request QoS resources. For example, in 1xEV-DO Rev. A or 1xEV-DO Rev. B networks, the request of A may include a ReservationOnRequest message on the reverse link access channel. In another example, the ReservationOnRequest message may be bundled with other messaging, such as a ConnectionRequest message that requests a TCH assignment, as discussed above, for a given call (e.g., a PTT call). While the standard timer is illustrated in  as starting before the QoS resource request is transmitted in A, in another embodiment the standard timer can be started after the QoS resource request is sent. In any case, the starting of the standard timer generally approximates the time at which the QoS resource request is sent.","In A, AT  determines whether a response to the QoS resource request is received before an expiration of the standard timer. In an example, assume that AT  determines that no QoS response has been received A, and the process advances to A. At this point, a conventional AT would infer that QoS resources would not be granted and would fail the call. However, in A in embodiments of the invention, AT  refrains from indicating call failure and starts a second Defer Timer. It will be appreciated that while both a first timer (i.e., standard timer) and a second timer (i.e., defer timer) are implemented within the embodiment of , in another embodiment of the invention, the first and second timers can be replaced by a single timer having an expiration period that is longer than the standard timer's expiration period (e.g., equal to the expiration period of the standard timer plus the expiration of the defer timer). Essentially, starting the defer timer permits AT  a longer wait-time before inferring that it will not be assigned QoS resources by the RAN  for a particular QoS resource request. Thus, reference to the defer time is intended to encompass either (i) starting a separate timer after expiration of the standard timer, or (ii) a timer period extending beyond that of the standard timer where the standard timer period and defer timer period correspond to a single timer, unless one of these alternative embodiments is referred to explicitly.","Accordingly, in A, AT  determines whether a QoS response has been received before the Defer Timer has expired. If a response is received before the Defer Timer has expired, the process advances to A. Otherwise, if the defer timer has expired, AT  indicates, to the user of AT , that the call attempt has failed, A.","Turning to the RAN , after the QoS resource request is received in A, the RAN  determines whether to grant the QoS resource request, A. In, A, if the RAN  determines not to grant the QoS resource request, the RAN  sends a QoS resource denial message (e.g., Fwd\/RevReservationOff message). Otherwise, in A, if the RAN , if the RAN  determines to grant the QoS resource request, the RAN  sends a QoS resource grant message (e.g., Fwd\/RevReservationOn message).","Turning back to AT , AT  receives the QoS resource allocation message sent by the RAN  (e.g., as indicated by a \u201cYes\u201d in decision block A or A, depending on when the QoS resource allocation message is received), and determines that whether its requested QoS resources have been granted in A. In A, if AT  determines that its requested QoS resources have not been granted, AT  indicates call failure to the user in A.","Otherwise, if AT  determines that its requested QoS resources have been granted in A, AT  communicates with the RAN  and supports the call based on the granted QoS resources, A, and AT  indicates call success to the user, A.","In , the QoS resource request of A has been described for an initial call attempt. However, it is possible that the process of  can alternatively describe a subsequent call attempt (e.g., a second call attempt) that follows an earlier call attempt, as will now be described with respect to .","In this embodiment, aspects of some of the prior discussed embodiments are combined The application nominally always requests quality-of-service at call-time as described above, and fails the call when the requested quality-of-service guarantee cannot be provided by the network. However, for a (subsequent) call attempt that immediately follows a call attempt that failed due to the network previously not being able to offer the requested quality-of-service guarantee at call-time, the application waits a prescribed period of time before failing the subsequent call when the requested quality-of-service guarantee cannot be provided by the network. During the prescribed period of time, if the requested quality-of-service guarantee becomes available (late), the application allows a delayed form of the subsequent original call to proceed rather than failing the subsequent call. If the requested quality-of-service guarantee does not become available during the prescribed period, the application fails the subsequent call.","Referring to , in B, a given AT (\u201cAT \u201d) sends a message to the RAN  to request QoS resources. In the example of , assume that the QoS resource request of B is associated with an initial call attempt (i.e., a first time AT  has attempted to make a particular call). The QoS resource request may otherwise be configured as discussed above with respect to A of  (e.g., as part of a bundled call request message that also requests a traffic channel, as an independent message, etc.). The RAN  receives the QoS resource request, and denies the requested QoS resources in B (e.g., as in  and  of ). After receiving the denial of the QoS resource request, AT  fails the call, but does not indicate that the call attempt has failed to a user of AT , B. AT  (or a user of AT ) determines whether to re-attempt the call, B. In an example, AT  can automatically determine to re-attempt the call after an initial call failure without waiting for an explicit request from the user of AT  (e.g., because the user of AT  is not informed of the initial call failure). If AT  determines to re-attempt the call, the process advances to A of .","Accordingly, in the example of , the process of  is executed for a subsequent call attempt instead of an initial call attempt. Thus, in the example of , the prolonged wait period at AT  for a QoS resource grant is only invoked after an initial call attempt failure. In another example, while not shown in  and\/or , each subsequent call attempt following a second call failure based on the process of  may be performed in accordance with , such that the prolonged wait period is used for each such call attempt (e.g., because a user of AT  may be more concerned with setting up the call with QoS resources than setting up a call in a timely manner).","Further, in an embodiment of the invention, in , the second QoS resource request (e.g., and\/or any subsequent call requests) of the second call attempt upon executing the process of  after determining to re-attempt the call in B may be associated with reduced QoS resources (e.g., less stringent requirements) Alternatively, the second QoS resource request may be associated with the same QoS resources as requested in the first QoS resource request.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
