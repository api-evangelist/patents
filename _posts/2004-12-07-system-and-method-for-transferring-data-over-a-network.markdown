title: System and method for transferring data over a network
abstract: A system and method are provided for transferring a set of data over a network by monitoring the level of actual network bandwidth utilization. The method identifies a maximum monitored level of actual utilization and calculates a threshold level of utilization as a function of the maximum monitored level of utilization. If the actual level of utilization is less than the threshold level, at least a portion or segment of the data is received over the network. Each time a portion of the data is received, the monitoring step is repeated and a counter is incremented. The size of the discrete portions of the data is a function of the value of the counter and is increased when the value of the counter is greater than a predetermined value.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/505,735, filed Feb. 16, 2000.","Not applicable.","The present invention relates to computer software and, more particularly, to a system and method for transferring data over a network such as the Internet.","A computer system in which one or more client machines communicate with one or more servers over a network is a common arrangement. For example, there are millions of personal computers (PCs) connected to the Internet for communication with various servers. Many of these PC users acquire new or updated software on their PCs by downloading the software from a remote server over the Internet.","Conventional methods of downloading new and updated software to a PC over a network such as the Internet interfere with the PC user's ability to browse the Internet or to otherwise communicate over the network during the download. With increased processing speeds for PCs, it is the bandwidth to the Internet which is becoming a significant bottleneck to the user's browsing experience. Because conventional downloads typically occupy 100% of the user's available communication bandwidth until the download is complete, the user is unable to utilize the network for other tasks during the download. Moreover, if the download is interrupted for some reason (e.g., the network connection is lost), it may be necessary to restart the download from the beginning of the file, thus wasting significant network resources. Other conventional downloading software permits the user to schedule the download for a designated time. In any event, conventional methods for downloading software over a network such as the Internet severely limit the user's ability to engage in other network activity.","Providing software updates is beneficial to PC users because it corrects problems and improves the performance of their PCs. Additionally, the software vendor benefits from a reduction in the number of product support calls, which in turn reduces the substantial resources the vendor might otherwise allocate to handling such calls.","Microsoft Corporation provides a software update service in connection with its WINDOWS 98 operating system under the mark \u201cWINDOWS UPDATE\u201d. By accessing the \u201cWINDOWS UPDATE\u201d Internet website, WINDOWS 98 users can have their system evaluated and download both critical and non-critical software updates (e.g., a fix or a patch) over the Internet. Upon determining there are updates available that are not already loaded on the user's PC, the user is notified that such updates are available, and the user is prompted to select one or more of them for downloading over the Internet. While this is a convenient method for providing software updates to users, such downloads could interfere with other network activity. Moreover, it is likely that many users will not take the initiative to navigate to the \u201cWINDOWS UPDATE\u201d website and download operating system updates for their PCs. Consequently, users who have not yet downloaded critical updates are more likely to encounter problems with their PCs, and they will likely call the vendor's product support line when a problem arises.","Accordingly, there is a need for an effective method for downloading software updates over a network so that interference with other network activity is minimized. One potential solution is simply to increase network bandwidth. However, increased bandwidth is expensive and has historically been followed by increased user demands. Thus, even as available bandwidth increases with technological advances, there will continue to be a need to eliminate interference with other network activity because of the corresponding increases in user demands.","The present invention is directed to a system, method, and one or more computer-readable media for transferring a set of data over a network. In one aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the invention is directed to a method. The method includes the steps of monitoring the level of actual network bandwidth utilization and identifying a maximum monitored level of actual utilization. Then, the method calculates a threshold level of utilization as a function of the maximum monitored level of utilization. If the actual level is less than the threshold level, a number of discrete portions of the set of data are separately received over the network. The monitoring step is repeated and a counter is incremented each time a discrete portion of the set of data is received. The size of the discrete portions of the data may be a function of the value of the counter. The method increases the size of the discrete portions of data when the value of the counter is greater than a predetermined value.","In another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the invention takes the form of one or more computer-readable media having computer-useable instructions embodied thereon for performing a method for transferring a set of data over a network. The method includes the steps of monitoring the level of actual network bandwidth utilization and identifying a maximum monitored level of actual utilization. The method then calculates a threshold level of utilization as a function of the maximum monitored level of utilization. If the actual level is less than the threshold level, a number of discrete portions of the set of data are separately received over the network. The monitoring step is repeated and a counter is incremented each time a discrete portion of the data is received over the network. The size of the discrete portions of the data is a function of the value of the counter and is increased when the value of the counter is greater than a predetermined value.","Yet another aspect of the invention is directed to a system for transferring a set of data over a network. The system includes a monitoring component, an identifying component, a calculating component, a receiving component, and a counter. The monitoring component monitors the level of actual network bandwidth utilization. The identifying component identifies a maximum monitored level of actual utilization. The calculating component calculates a threshold level of utilization as a function of the maximum monitored level of utilization. The receiving component separately receives a number of discrete portions of the set of data over the network if the actual level is less than the threshold level. The counter is incremented each time a discrete portion of the data is received over the network. The size of the discrete portions of the data is a function of the value of the counter and is increased when the value of the counter is greater than a predetermined value.","The present invention provides a system and method for transferring data over a network such as the Internet.  illustrates an example of a suitable computing system environment in which the invention may be implemented. The computing system environment is only one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention.

Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer .

By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, digital video tape, Bernoulli cartridges, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) . Alternatively, the hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  may be connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface, a magnetic disk drive interface, and an optical drive interface, respectively.","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  or a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers and printers, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface.","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface  or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Although many other internal components of the computer  are not shown, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such components and the interconnection are well known. Accordingly, additional details concerning the internal construction of the computer  need not be disclosed in connection with the present invention.","Those skilled in the art will understand that program modules such as the operating system , application programs  and data  are provided to the computer  via one of its memory storage devices, which may include ROM , RAM , hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive  or optical disk drive . Preferably, the hard disk drive  is used to store data  and programs, including the operating system  and application programs .","When the computer  is turned on or reset, the BIOS , which is stored in the ROM  instructs the processing unit  to load the operating system from the hard disk drive  into the RAM . Once the operating system  is loaded in RAM , the processing unit  executes the operating system code and causes the visual elements associated with the user interface of the operating system  to be displayed on the monitor . When an application program  is opened by a user, the program code and relevant data are read from the hard disk drive  and stored in RAM .","With reference to , an exemplary system for practicing the present invention is designated generally by reference numeral . The system  includes a client machine such as a PC  and a communications device  such as a modem for accessing a network  (e.g., the Internet). A server  is also connected to the network  in a conventional manner. The PC  and modem  establish a connection with the server  over the network  to facilitate the transfer of data between the client and the server.","A system  set forth in  is similar to the system  of , except that the system  includes a first client A and a second client B which are connected to one another over a link  such as an intranet. As with the system , the communications device  (e.g., a modem) establishes a connection between the first client A and the network . Accordingly, the clients A, B can exchange data with the server  over the network .","Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the present invention encompasses many possible variations to the systems ,  shown in . Of course, any number of client and server machines may be connected to the network  (either directly or indirectly). For example, the system  could include more than two client machines, one of which would act as a proxy for the others. In that case, the client machines could be connected to one another over an intranet, and the network card in the proxy machine could be connected to a router which is linked to the network  over a T line. Moreover, the network  could be the Internet or any other public or private network. Additionally, the communications device  may be part of the PC  or an independent hardware device.","In one application of the present invention, the client machine is the PC , the device  is a 56 Kbps (Kilobits per second) modem, the network  is the Internet, and the server  is a website accessible over the Internet for downloading software updates for the operating system of the PC. Referring to , a curve  represents the level of actual network bandwidth utilization for a client PC accessing the Internet over a period of time. The curve  rises from Tthrough Tto reflect the flurry of network activity which typically occurs as the user initially accesses the Internet. Then, after a brief decrease in network activity at T, the client's actual utilization again rises dramatically to a peak at T. This peak could represent any number of possible actions initiated by the client, such as the downloading of a webpage or the opening of an email message. While the user at the client machine reads the web page or the email message, or perhaps listens to music over the Internet, the actual network utilization decreases to a significantly lower level from Tthrough T.","The relatively low level of actual network bandwidth utilization shown from Tthrough T() is sometimes referred to as \u201cnetwork idle.\u201d This concept differs from \u201cmachine idle,\u201d which occurs when a PC user is not currently using the keyboard or mouse. If the machine remains idle for a period of time, a screen saver may be invoked. However, network utilization may be high at the same time the machine is idle (e.g., during a download), and the network interface may be \u201cidle\u201d when the machine is not. Thus, the present invention is directed to the transfer of a set of data, such as a software update, over a network at a time when the network utilization is relatively low. This transfer of data is intended to be transparent to the user, and the user's machine need not be idle during the transfer.","As described below in connection with , the present invention monitors the level of actual utilization represented by the curve  () and calculates a threshold level of utilization below which the transfer of data between the client and server is not likely to interfere with other network activity. In a preferred embodiment, the threshold level is equal to approximately 33% of the maximum detected level of actual network utilization. As shown in , the threshold level is generally designated by reference numeral  and is initially set to zero. Network activity is periodically sampled, and a new threshold level is calculated each time a new maximum is identified. At T, the level of actual bandwidth usage is 15 Kbps, which is a new maximum, so the threshold  is set to 5 Kbps. The level of actual bandwidth usage is again sampled at T, and another new maximum of 30 Kbps is identified. Consequently, the new threshold  is calculated to be 10 Kbps.","When the level of actual usage  drops below the threshold level , as at T, a brief transfer of data should not significantly interfere with other network activity. The transfer of data could be initiated immediately upon first detecting that the actual usage is below the threshold level. However, a more conservative approach, in that it is more deferential to the user, is to detect at least two consecutive occurrences of low usage before initiating a download. In any event, a new maximum of 45 Kbps is detected at T, thereby triggering the calculation of an updated threshold level of 15 Kbps. Consequently, if any data transfer were initiated at T, then it would be immediately suspended at T. At T, the actual usage  once again drops below the threshold level . This time, the level of actual usage  remains between 5\u201310 Kbps, which is less than the threshold level of 15 Kbps, from Tto T. Thus, the transfer of data over the network would not interfere with other network activity during this time period.","The preferred architecture of the client of the present invention is set forth in . A client  includes an update client , an update engine , an update downloader  and an update applet . The client  is connected to a server such as via an update website  over a pair of links , , which are preferably HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) links. The update client  is responsible for notifications and personalization options for the user. The update engine  controls content interaction with the update site  as well as detection, installation and logging of software updates. The update downloader  is responsible for implementing the packet background downloading\/throttling and incoming packet queue management. The update applet  determines the configuration of update notifications to the user and other interactions with the user. The backend content and catalogs are available from the update site .","The present invention utilizes a data structure  illustrated in . The data structure  includes a first field  which contains the maximum identified level of actual bandwidth utilization and a second field  which contains the threshold level of utilization. As shown in , both the maximum identified level and the threshold level can vary over time depending on the level of actual utilization. As mentioned above, the threshold level is calculated as a function of the maximum identified level of actual usage. Therefore, a new threshold level is calculated each time a new maximum level is detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"120"},"Once the client is connected to the same network as the server, the level of actual network bandwidth utilization is obtained at step . As shown in , the actual usage is sampled periodically (e.g., every five seconds). Preferably, this is done by tracking the number of incoming and outgoing packets over a given time period (e.g., one second) at the communications interface between the client and the network. For a PC running the \u201cWINDOWS 98\u201d operating system, this information is available using the \u201ciphlpapi\u201d function call.","Relatively large files provide a more accurate basis for measuring the level of actual network bandwidth usage at the network interface. For example, it is difficult to accurately measure the download time for a 200 byte file because the overhead of measurement is significant and the small file does not saturate the available bandwidth. Consequently, the present invention preferably updates the maximum level of utilization only when the measurement of the actual level of utilization is based on the transfer speed of a file that is at least 4 KB in size.","Preferably, each of the \u201cvirtual devices\u201d is enumerated to ensure accurate monitoring, especially in a system which is more complex than the system . The term \u201cvirtual device,\u201d as used herein, refers to any networking device with a device driver, such as modems (including cable modems and ISDN modems), network cards and DSLs (Digital Subscriber Lines). Each channel of a 2-channel ISDN modem is considered to be a separate virtual device for the purposes of the present invention.","Importantly, the level of actual network bandwidth utilization is monitored rather than simply relying on the rated or listed throughput of the network device. The rated value is not reliable because, as a practical matter, the maximum throughput achieved by a modem is less than its listed throughput and may be different for each network session. Variables such as the quality of the telephone connection typically result in a maximum available bandwidth of less than 50 Kbps for a 56 Kbps modem.","Moreover, rated values cannot be assumed to be accurate when a client is connected to the network by a proxy. In the system , there is a peer-to-peer connection between the first client A and the second client B over the intranet , and the first client A is in turn linked to the network  by a modem . Assuming a 56 Kbps modem and a 10 Mbps intranet, the modem  is the bottleneck to the network . Thus, if the first client A were utilizing 40 Kbps of the network bandwidth at the same time the second client B is utilizing only 5 Kbps of the bandwidth, there would not be sufficient network bandwidth available to download a set of data (e.g., a software update) from the server  to either client without degrading their other network activity. Moreover, it would not be accurate to assume either that the second client B has a maximum throughput of 10 Mbps or that substantial bandwidth is available because the second client B is only using 5 Kbps of the network interface. Here, in the case of remote access, the level of actual bandwidth utilization for the second client B can be obtained from the RAS (Remote Access Service) device table. Thus, monitoring the actual throughput at each virtual device advantageously adapts to configuration changes between sessions and is therefore a more reliable approach.","Referring again to , the maximum detected level of actual usage is initially set to zero. Then, at step , it is determined whether the actual usage is greater than the current maximum. If not, the actual usage is sampled again at step . However, if the actual usage is greater than the current maximum, then a new maximum is set equal to the current actual level at step . Next, a threshold level is calculated as a function of the maximum at step . The threshold is initially set to zero, and a new threshold is calculated each time a new maximum is detected. As a general proposition, the threshold level could be anywhere from approximately 5%-80% of the maximum detected level. However, the presently preferred threshold level for Internet applications is approximately 33% of the maximum detected level. Once the new threshold level has been calculated, the actual usage is sampled again at step .","It should be noted that the present invention calculates the threshold level as a percentage of actual network bandwidth in Kilobits per second, as opposed to some other parameter, such as the percentage of time the network connection is busy over a given period. For example, a client machine utilizing its network connection 75% of the time over the course of an hour is not necessarily using 75% of its available bandwidth. In fact, if the user at the client PC is merely reading a webpage, reading email, listening to music or the like, it is likely that the level of actual bandwidth utilization is well below the maximum available bandwidth. Those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention, which is implemented at the client level, is fundamentally different from methods for limiting bandwidth at the hardware level (e.g., sockets).","Each time the level of actual network bandwidth utilization is obtained at step , it is also compared to the current threshold level. At step , it is determined whether the actual usage is less than the threshold level. If so, a software update (or other set of data) available from the server can be downloaded over the network to the client. To minimize interference with any other present or future network activity of the client, the download is preferably performed by downloading the software update in several segments. Accordingly, at step , one segment of the file is downloaded from the server to the client. If the client's network activity increases after downloading the first segment, the download of the entire file can be suspended until the actual usage drops back down below the threshold level. However, if the network is idle for an extended period of time, the download can be accelerated by downloading progressively larger segments of the file over the network.","A counting device is provided in a preferred embodiment of the present invention to facilitate the downloading of progressively larger file segments. For example, a 144 KB file may be downloaded from the server to the client over the Internet by first transferring an 8 KB segment of the file at step  of . A small segment such as 8 KB has been found to be an effective default because it uses 100% of the pipeline for a short period of time and permits frequent monitoring of actual usage between segments. Even if a user clicks on an URL (Uniform Resource Locator) during the download of an 8 KB block, there will be no noticeable delay to the user. Moreover, in the event an interruption occurs, 8 KB is the most data that can be lost.","At step , it is determined whether the entire file has been downloaded. Since the 8 KB block was the first segment of the 144 KB file, the entire file has not been downloaded and the counter, which is initially set to zero, is incremented to \u201c1\u201d at step . The counter keeps track of the number of segments that have been downloaded consecutively without interruption so that the size of the segments can be increased so long as network activity remains low. As an example, the size of the segments could be increased to 16 KB if the counter is equal to \u201c2\u201d, and the size of the segments could be increased to 32 KB if the counter is equal to \u201c4\u201d. This would enable the 144 KB file to be downloaded in seven progressively larger segments as opposed to 18 of the smaller 8 KB segments, provided network activity stays below the threshold level. Although the larger segments take longer to download and therefore result in less frequent monitoring of the actual usage, this approach takes advantage of any extended periods of low network activity. Typically a header accompanies each segment, so transferring a smaller number of larger segments also reduces network overhead by reducing the total number of headers transferred over the network. Presently, a 64 KB segment is the largest segment that is preferred when using a 56 Kbps modem.","After incrementing the counter at step , steps  and  are repeated. If the level of actual usage is no longer less than the threshold level, the file download is suspended and the counter is cleared (i.e., set to zero) at step . Then, the actual utilization is sampled again at step . In the event the download is suspended, the download will be resumed from the point of suspension. However, if the actual usage remains below the threshold level, the next segment is downloaded at step , and the process is repeated until it is determined at step  that the entire file has been downloaded. If so, the counter is cleared at step  and the loop ends at step .","It should be noted that the progressive download feature of the present invention may require filtering or a similar technique to overcome the limitations of some existing servers. While progressive downloads have been widely available at the FTP (file transfer protocol) level, they were not available at the HTTP level until HTTP 1.1 servers became available. As discussed above, the present invention utilizes a byte range approach with 8 KB file segments as a default. For the first segment, a byte range of \u201c0\u20137999\u201d is specified in the download request from the client, the range \u201c8000\u201315999\u201d is specified in the download request for the second segment, and so on. However, the byte range portion of the request would be lost an HTTP 1.0 server is encountered, and the entire file would be downloaded at once. One way to avoid this problem is to use an ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) filter to simulate an HTTP 1.1 byte request across an HTTP 1.0 proxy. Then, even if an HTTP 1.0 server is encountered, the byte range information will not be lost.","Of course, the preferred size of the segment or byte range can vary dramatically based on factors such as the speed of the modem. The foregoing examples (e.g., the default segment size of 8 KB) are based on the assumption that a large number of users will access the network with 56 Kbps modems. However, it may be appropriate to assume that a large number of users will access the network with 28 Kbps modems. In that case, the preferred default segment size would be 4 KB rather than 8 KB. Likewise, the progressively larger segments would be 8 KB and 16 KB rather than 16 KB and 32 KB. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the use of a variety of other segment sizes is also contemplated by the present invention.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the monitoring of actual bandwidth usage during an extensive download may be given more weight than the monitoring of actual bandwidth usage before or after such a download. That is, if a predetermined number of segments are downloaded consecutively, the average level of usage for each of the segments is adopted as the new \u201cmaximum\u201d level. For example, if the predetermined number of segments is 10, the average level of usage during the downloading of ten consecutive segments would replace the previous maximum level even if the average level is less than the previous maximum value. Moreover, if 11 segments are consecutively downloaded, the average level would be calculated for segments 2\u201311 so that a moving average of 10 downloads determines both a new maximum level and a new threshold level.","Using a moving average to identify the maximum level advantageously provides a dynamic increase or decrease to the threshold level in response to changing network traffic conditions without compromising the accuracy of the measurement. Preferably, the maximum level will remain frozen at the most recent moving average (of the predetermined number of segments) until another extensive download occurs. In other words, a maximum level based on an extensive download is deemed to be a more accurate reflection of available bandwidth than the initial maximum level measured prior to a download. Likewise, the download of an isolated segment may not provide an accurate reflection of available bandwidth. To keep track of the number of consecutive downloads for the moving average, a counter such as the one referenced in  may be used.","The present invention has been described in connection with exemplary embodiments which are intended to be illustrative rather than restrictive.
