The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to fluorous tin compounds and to methods of using fluorous tin compounds, and, especially, to fluorous tin reaction components that are easily separated from non-fluorous compounds via fluorous separation techniques.","Organic compounds are typically synthesized by reactions in which a starting material or reactant is contacted with one or more other reactants, reagents, or catalysts to form a new organic product. The separation of the desired products from any added reactants, reagents or catalysts (and\/or from any byproducts derived from such reaction components) can be tedious and time consuming. Accordingly, improved methods for the separation of organic reaction products from other reaction components are needed.","Along these lines, the use of fluorous reagents, reactants and catalysts has recently begun to offer attractive new options. The use of such fluorous techniques is illustrated in general terms in FIG. . An organic (non-fluorous) starting material or reactant is contacted with a fluorous reactant, reagent or catalyst, possibly with other non-fluorous reaction components, and typically in a solvent, to form a new organic product or mixture of products. The organic product(s) are then separated from the unreacted fluorous reactant, reagent or catalyst and any other fluorous byproducts derived therefrom by simple fluorous-organic phase separation techniques such as liquid-liquid separation and\/or solid-liquid separation. Such techniques have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,777,121 and 5,859,247, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Organotin reactants, reagents and catalysts are a powerful class of molecules that effect many useful transformations of organic starting materials or reactants to organic products. Accordingly, the use of organotin compounds is common practice in organic synthesis. See, for example, Davies, A. G. ; VCH: Weinheim, pp 327 (1997) and ; 2nd ed.; Smith, P. J., Ed.; Blackie: London, pp 578 (1997). However, the separation of the newly formed, non-tin containing organic products from the remaining tin compounds in the reaction mixture is notoriously difficult and improvements in separation techniques are needed to unlock the potential power of organic reactions mediated by organotin compounds.","Many of the most popular types of organotin reagents have the formula RSnX, where R is an alkyl group, often butyl, and X is a group which is involved in the reaction with an organic substrate. A few among many possible examples of such compounds include BUSnH, BuSnN, BuSnCl and BuSnPh. Recently, fluorous analogs of these compounds have been introduced. The fluorous analogs are generally designed to accomplish reactions similar to the corresponding non-fluorous compound but to facilitate separation after reaction. In currently available fluorous tin reagents, each of the three alkyl groups R is replaced by a spacer group Rs attached to a fluorous group Rf according to the following general formula: [(Rf)Rs)]SnX. Examples of such fluorous tin reagents include (CFCHCH)SnH, (CFCHCH)SnN, (CFCHCH)SnCl, (CFCHCH)SnPh, etc.","Illustrative examples of the uses of one of these fluorous tin reagents, (CFCHCH)SnH, are shown in FIG. . Reduction of adamantyl bromide with 1 equiv of (CFCHCH)SnH followed by fluorous-organic liquid-liquid extraction provides the organic product adamantane on evaporation of the organic liquid phase and the fluorous product (CFCHCH)SnBr on evaporation of the fluorous phase. A similar reduction can be conducted in a more economical way by using a catalytic amount of the fluorous tin hydride along with an inexpensive inorganic reductant like sodium cyanoborohydride. A three-phase liquid extraction then provides the respective products: inorganic salts (from the aqueous phase), adamantane (from the organic phase), and the tin hydride catalyst (from the fluorous phase).","While currently available fluorous tin reagents provide advantages over the traditional (non-fluorous) trialkyltin class of reagents, some disadvantages remain that restrict the broad application thereof. For example, existing reagents with three fluorous chains can have low solubility in organic solvents. This low solubility can lead to problems in selecting suitable reaction solvents since it is often desirable that the tin compounds have substantial solubility under the reaction conditions. For example, the reactions in  require a non-standard solvent or co-solvent such as benzotrifluoride. Moreover, the large numbers of fluorines in currently available fluorous tin reagents result in compounds of high molecular weight, which is a detraction from the standpoint of expense and atom economy. Finally, certain classes of organotin reagents, for example BuSnO, have fewer than three alkyl chains and cannot be rendered fluorous by current strategies.","It is thus very desirable to develop fluorous reaction compounds or components that substantially reduce or eliminate such problems.","The present invention provides fluorous tin reaction components (that is, reagents, reactants and\/or catalysts) bearing only two or one fluorous groups or chains. Surprisingly, even though the fluorous reaction components of the present invention have many fewer fluorines than currently available fluorous reagents, the fluorous reaction components of the present invention can still be separated efficiently from organic (non-fluorous) reaction components by fluorous separation techniques. In addition, the fluorous tin reaction components of the present invention can be substantially more soluble in organic reaction solvents. Thus, the scope of application in chemical reactions of the fluorous tin reaction components of the present invention is dramatically increased without compromising the scope of separation. These features, coupled with lower molecular weight and increased atom economy, give the fluorous tin reaction components of the present invention significant advantages over currently available fluorous reagents.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of carrying out a reaction comprising the steps of:","mixing at least one organic reaction component with at least one fluorous reaction component having the formula:\n\nXSn(R)[Rs(Rf)], XXSn[Rs(Rf)]or O\u2550Sn[Rs(Rf)]\n\nwherein n is 1 or 2, R is a C-Calkyl group, Xand Xare independently, the same or different, H, F, Cl, Br, I, N, OR, OORSR, SeR, CN, NC, NRR, an aryl group, a heteroaryl group, an alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbons, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, \u2014C(O)R(an acyl group), M((Rs\u2032)(Rf\u2032)), OM((Rs\u2032)(Rf\u2032))or OOM((Rs\u2032)Rf\u2032)), wherein M is Si, Ge, or Sn, and wherein Rand Rare each independently the same or different H, an alkyl group, \u2014SORor \u2014C(O)R, wherein Ris an alkyl group or an aryl group, and wherein Rs and Rs\u2032 are each independently the same or different a spacer group, and wherein Rf and Rf\u2032 are each independently the same or different a fluorous group;\n\ncarrying out a reaction to produce an organic product; and after producing the organic product, separating any excess of the fluorous reaction component and any fluorous byproduct of the fluorous reaction component using a fluorous separation technique.\n","As used herein, the term \u201cfluorous\u201d, when used in connection with an organic (carbon-containing) molecule, moiety or group, refers generally to an organic molecule, moiety or group having a domain or a portion thereof rich in carbon-fluorine bonds (for example, fluorocarbons or perfluorocarbons, fluorohydrocarbons, fluorinated ethers and fluorinated amines). Fluorous compounds generally preferentially partition into a fluorous phase during fluorous-organic phase separation. For example, perfluorinated ether groups can have the general formula \u2014[(CF)O(CF)])CF, wherein x, y and z are integers. Perfluorinated amine groups can, for example, have the general formula \u2014[(CF)(NR)CF)]CF, wherein Rcan, for example, be \u2014(CF)CF, wherein n is an integer. Fluorous ether groups and fluorous amine groups suitable for use in the present invention need not be perfluorinated, however. As used herein, the term \u201cperfluorocarbons\u201d refers generally to organic compounds in which all hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The terms \u201cfluorohydrocarbons\u201d and \u201chydrofluorocarbons\u201d include organic compounds in which at least one hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom has been replaced by a fluorine atom. A few examples of suitable fluorous groups Rf and Rf\u2032 for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, \u2014CF, \u2014CF, \u2014CF, \u2014C, F, \u2014C(CF)CF, \u2014CFCF(CF), \u2014CFCFOCFCFOCFand \u2014CFCF(NCF)CFCFCF.","Perfluoroalkyl groups and hydrofluoroalkyl groups are well suited for use in the present invention. For example, Rf and Rf\u2032 can independently be a linear perfluoroalkyl group of 3 to 20 carbons, a branched perfluoroalkyl group of 3 to 20 carbons, and a hydrofluoroalkyl group of 3 to 20 carbons. Hydrofluoroalkyl groups preferably include up to one hydrogen atom for each two fluorine atoms. In the case of perfluoralkyl groups and hydrofluoroalkyl groups, Rf and Rf\u2032 are preferably a linear perfluoroalkyl group of 6 to 12 carbons, a branched perfluoroalkyl group of 6 to 12 carbons, or a hydrofluoroalkyl group of 6 to 12 carbons.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a chemical compound of the formula\n\nXSn(R)[Rs(Rf)],\n\nwherein n is 1 or 2, R is a C-Calkyl group, Xis H, F, Cl, Br, I, N, OR, OORSR, SeR, CN, NC, NRR, an aryl group, a heteroaryl group, an alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbons, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, \u2014C(O)R, M((Rs\u2032)(Rf\u2032)), OM((Rs\u2032)(Rf\u2032))or OOM((Rs\u2032)Rf\u2032)), wherein M is Si, Ge, or Sn, and wherein Rand Rare each independently the same or different H, an alkyl group, \u2014SORor \u2014C(O)R, wherein Ris an alkyl group or an aryl group, and wherein Rs and Rs\u2032 are each independently the same or different an alkylene group of 1 to 6 carbons or a phenylene group, and wherein Rf and Rf\u2032 are each independently a fluorohydrocarbon group, a perfluorocarbon group, a fluorinated ether group or a fluorinated amine group.\n","In another aspect, the present invention provides chemical compound having the formula:\n\nO\u2550Sn[Rs(Rf)]\n\nwherein Rs is an alkylene group of 1 to 6 carbons or a phenylene group and wherein Rf is a fluorohydrocarbon group, a perfluorocarbon group, a fluorinated ether group or a fluorinated amine group. Such molecules can exist as oligomers or polymers with the formula (O\u2550Sn[Rs(Rf)]).\n","In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a chemical compound having the formula:\n\nXXSn[Rs(Rf)]\n\nwherein Xand Xare independently, the same or different, H, N, OR, OORSR, SeR, CN, NC, NRR, a heteroaryl group, an alkyl group of 2 to 20 carbons, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, \u2014COR, M((Rs\u2032)(Rf\u2032)), OM((Rs\u2032)(Rf\u2032))or OOM((Rs\u2032)Rf\u2032)), wherein M is Si, Ge, or Sn, and wherein Rand Rare each independently the same or different H, an alkyl group, \u2014SORor \u2014COR, wherein Ris an alkyl group or an aryl group, wherein Rs and Rs\u2032 are each independently the same or different an alkylene group of 1 to 6 carbons or a phenylene group, and wherein Rf and Rf\u2032 are each independently a fluorohydrocarbon group, a perfluorocarbon group, a fluorinated ether group or a fluorinated amine group.\n","In several embodiments, Xand\/or Xare (independently), for example, an allyl group, Br, F, Cl, I or H. In several other embodiments, Rs is an alkylene group (preferably, \u2014CHCH\u2014), and\/or Rf is a perfluoroalkyl group.","Separation of the fluorous reaction components of the present invention and any fluorous byproducts thereof from organic products and other organic compounds is achieved by using fluorous separation techniques that are based upon differences between\/among the fluorous nature of a mixture of compounds. As used herein, the term \u201cfluorous separation technique\u201d refers generally to a method that is used to separate mixtures containing fluorous molecules or organic molecules bearing fluorous domains from each other and\/or from non-fluorous compounds based predominantly on differences in the fluorous nature of molecules (for example, size and\/or structure of a fluorous molecule or domain or the absence thereof). Fluorous separation techniques include but are not limited to solid phase extraction or chromatography over solid fluorous phases such as fluorocarbon bonded phases or fluorinated polymers. See, for example, Danielson, N. D. et al., \u201cFluoropolymers and Fluorocarbon Bonded Phases as Column Packings for Liquid Chromatography,\u201d ., 544, 187-199 (1991) and Curran, D. P.; Hadida, S.; He, M. . 62, 6714 (1997). Examples of suitable fluorocarbon bonded phases include commercial Fluofix\u00ae and Fluophase\u2122 columns available from Keystone Scientific, Inc. (Bellefonte, Pa.), and FluoroSep\u2122-RP-Octyl from ES Industries (Berlin, N.J.). Other fluorous separation techniques include liquid-liquid based separation methods such as liquid-liquid extraction or countercurrent distribution with a fluorous solvent and an organic solvent.","The terms \u201calkyl\u201d, \u201caryl\u201d, and other groups refer generally to both unsubstituted and substituted groups unless specified to the contrary. Unless otherwise specified, alkyl groups are hydrocarbon groups and are preferably C-C(that is, having 1 to 15 carbon atoms) alkyl groups, and more preferably C-Calkyl groups, and can be branched or unbranched, acyclic or cyclic. The above definition of an alkyl group and other definitions apply also when the group is a substituent on another group. The term \u201caryl\u201d refers generally to an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl (Ph) group or napthyl group.","The term \u201cheteroaryl group\u201d refers generally to an aromatic ring of five or six atoms in which one or more of the atoms is oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The heteroaryl groups or rings can be substituted or unsubstituted and can be isolated or fused to benzo rings. Examples of isolated heteraryl rings include, but are not limited to, furan rings. Examples of benzo-fuzed heteraryl ring include, but are not limited to, benzofurans.","The term \u201calkenyl\u201d refers generally to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon group with at least one double bond, preferably with 2-15 carbon atoms, and more preferably with 3-10 carbon atoms (for example, \u2014CH\u2550CHRor \u2014CHCH\u2550CHR, wherein Ris, for example, H or an alkyl group). The term \u201calkynyl\u201d refers generally to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon group with at least one triple bond, preferably with 2-15 carbon atoms, and more preferably with 3-10 carbon atoms (for example, \u2014C\u2261CRor \u2014CHC\u2261CR). The term \u201calkylene\u201d refers generally to bivalent forms of an alkyl group. The term \u201cphenylene group\u201d refers generally to bivalent forms of an a phenyl group (\u2014CH\u2014) wherein the two groups attached thereto are situated ortho, meta or para.","The groups set forth above, can be substituted with a wide variety of substituents. For example, alkyl and alkylene groups can preferably be substituted with a group or groups including, but not limited to, halide(s), alkenyl groups, alkynyl and aryl groups. Aryl groups and heteroaryl groups can preferably be substituted with a group or groups including, but not limited to, halide(s), alkyl group(s), cyano group(s) and nitro group(s). As used herein, the terms \u201chalide\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d refer to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Preferred halide substituents are F and Cl.","The fluorous tin reagents of the present invention can generally be made by modification of reactions known to those skilled in the art of organotin chemistry. See, for example, Davies, A. G. ; VCH: Weinheim, pp 327 (1997) and ; 2nd ed.; Smith, P. J., Ed.; Blackie: London, pp 578 (1997). For example, Grignard reagents such as Rf(CH)MgI, organolithium reagents Rf(CH)Li, or related organometallic reagents can be reacted with known tin electrophiles YSn(X)R to give (Rf(CH))Sn(X)R. In tin reagent YSn(X)R, Y is a leaving group. There are many types of leaving groups known to those skilled in the art and examples of some of the preferred groups Y for the current invention are chloride, bromide or triflate. In another approach, alkenes such as Rf(CH)CH\u2550CHcan be hydrostannated with HSn(X)R via radical or metal catalyzed reactions to give (Rf(CH))Sn(X)R.","The interchange of groups X in (Rf(CH))SnRX for other groups X is well known to those skilled in the art and can be accomplished by large classes of reactions wherein a nucleophilic precursor of the product X group (for example, cyanide, azide, alkoxide, RMgBr, etc.) replaces the leaving group X (for example a halogen or a triflate, etc.) in the tin precursor (for example, stannylation of an alcohol), by reactions wherein a tin nucleophile (X=metal) adds to or substitutes an electrophilic precursor of the product X group (for example, allylation of a tin metal reagent with an allyl halide), by reactions wherein the Sn\u2014X bond adds to a multiple bond (for example, hydrostannation of a carboncarbon or carbon-oxygen double bond), or by reactions involving electrophilic cleavage of an Sn\u2014X bond (for example, conversion of a tin hydride or vinyl or aryl tin to a tin bromide by reaction with dibromine). Other types of reactions to exchange X groups, including metal catalyzed reactions such as Stille and related couplings, are also used.","Analogous transformations are possible starting from YSn(R)X or HSn(R)X to make Rf(CH)SnRX reagents. Examples that illustrative a few of the many possibilities are shown in FIG. . Fluorous iodides 1a-c were converted to appropriate organometallic derivatives, which were in turn reacted with allyldimethyltin to give the new tin reagents 2a-c bearing one fluorous chain. These fluorous allyltin reagents can be used for the allylation of various organic molecules such as aldehydes under standard reaction conditions. They can also be used to make other fluorous tin reagents. For example, reaction of 2a-c with dibromine generated tin bromides 3a-c. These tin bromides can be reacted with a wide range of nucleophiles to make other new fluorous tin reagents. In the example of , tin bromides were reacted with lithium aluminum hydride to make the tin hydrides 4a-c.","Some of the advantages of the fluorous tin reagents of the present invention are illustrated by the series of reactions of FIG. . Reduction of napthyl ethyl iodide with tin hydrides 4b and 4c under the standard conditions, followed by rapid solid phase extraction over fluorous reverse phase silica gel, provided pure 2-ethyladamantane in a simple and effective reaction and separation process. This simple separation compares very favorably to the use of the standard reagent BuSnH, which requires careful chromatographic separation or application of some other specialized separation technique. Moreover, the currently available fluorous reagent (CFCHCH)SnH is not expected to form the product efficiently under these conditions because it is insoluble or nearly insoluble in t-butanol. A suitable solvent or cosolvent like benzotrifluoride is be needed in that case.","An example of a fluorous tin reagent bearing two fluorous chains is (CFCHCH)SnO, for which a synthetic route is shown in FIG. . The synthetic route of  modifies an approach reported synthesis of BuSnO, and like the standard alkyl tin oxide, the fluorous alkyltin oxide is not monomeric but instead appears to exists as oligomers and\/or polymers. See Kong, X.; Grindley, B.; Bakshi, P. K.; Cameron, T. S. . 12, 4881 (1993). Reaction of the Grignard reagent derived from 1a in suitable stoichiometry gave the bis-phenyltin reagent 5a, which was converted to the bis-chloroacetate 6a. Exposure of this reagent to hydroxide gave the tin oxide 7a.","Among other uses, the mono-functionalization of diols is one of the most popular applications of BuSnO. Martinelli and coworkers have recently introduced a catalytic variant of the traditional stoichiometric procedure, but the tin catalyst must still be separated from the desired organic product. See Martinelli, M. J., et al. ., 1, 447 (1999). As shown in , the tin oxide reaction components of the present invention can also be used to catalyze the mono-tosylation of diols under the conditions reported by Martinelli. No fluorinated reaction solvent or cosolvent is needed. Simple purification of the crude reaction mixture by liquid-liquid extraction or solid-liquid extraction provided the pure organic tosylate (organic phase) separate from the recovered tin oxide 7a (fluorous phase). The recovered tin oxide 7a can be reused.","Allyl-dimethyl-(3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-tridecafluorooctyl)stannane (2a).
