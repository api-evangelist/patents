title: Operationally enhanced bioreactor
abstract: Biofilm on glass beads deposited within a bottom portion of a vertically elongated bioreactor housing for possible experimental evaluation through a testing port in the housing which is also provided with inlet ports for aeration and infeed of nutrients with liquid. The biofilm collected within the housing chamber undergoes growth on glass slides within a cross-sectionally rectangular portion of the bioreactor housing from which the slides may be upwardly withdrawn under selective control without biofilm damage. The bioreactor housing arrangement also provides a high length to width ratio designed to enhance aeration.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/465,231 filed Apr. 25, 2003, entitled \u201cOPERATIONALLY ENHANCED BIOREACTOR\u201d, incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to bioreactors through which evaluation of biofilms is enhanced.","The structural and functional condition of biofilms is presently studied and evaluated by use of experimental laboratory devices such as bioreactors as generally known in the art. Such bioreactors induce growth of biofilm therein on glass microscope slides from which the biofilm is collected on glass beads subject to aeration within a testing chamber for experimental evaluation purposes. However, various problems heretofore arose with respect to such use of bioreactors involving poor aeration during the biofilm growth process and difficulty in selective removal of microscope slides without disruption of biofilm growth on the slides and collection thereof on the glass beads.","Pursuant to the present invention the housing of a bioreactor has several ports for aeration of biofilm coated glass beads deposited therewithin, to supply nutrients and liquid thereto, and to allow outflow from the housing chamber. Microscope slides on which biofilm growth occurs are located within the bioreactor housing from which a microscope side is slidably withdrawn from the open end of the bioreactor housing by removing a holder holding the slide or by forceps to avoid biofilm disruption caused by withdrawal. A relatively high length to width dimensional ratio for the bioreactor housing is provided, such as 7:1, so as to ensure complete aeration within the bioreactor housing chamber during biofilm growth.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrate a bioreactor  having a vertically elongated housing  which includes an upper sealable top end portion  from which insertable retraction rods, actuating means,  may project. An upper housing section  of the housing  which can be of a smaller diameter than the top end portion  extends downwardly therefrom. The upper housing section  has an outlet port  connected thereto. From the upper housing section , a cross-sectionally mid-housing section  further extends downwardly to a lower housing section  of smaller diameter, closed at its bottom end to form a testing chamber  within the bioreactor housing  having internally threaded inlet ports ,  and . Aeration inflow  and nutrient infeed supply  to the testing chamber  of the housing are respectively delivered thereto through the ports  and  as shown in .","As shown in ,  and , a plurality of glass slides  are positioned in the mid-housing section  above the lower housing section  by retention within a holder  having a bottom  within which an opening  is formed, through which upflow of feed fluid and aeration is conducted between the slides  from the lower housing section  and testing chamber within which glass beads  are deposited to fill the lower housing section , up to the lower portion of the mid-housing section .","The slide holder  with the slides  therein may be retracted upwardly from the mid-housing section  for removal from the bioreactor  through its top end portion  by means of the rod(s) . At least one rod , metal, plastic, glass or the like, is accordingly provided with a threaded end , threadedly inserted into the bottom  of the holder  as shown in .","It will be apparent from the foregoing description, that beneficial location of the aeration inlet port, the feed supply port, and the possible testing port , ,  to the testing chamber portion  of the bioreactor housing  enhances aeration fluid flow and testing. Also, removal and replacement of the slides  is enhanced by the holder  with the rod(s)  connected thereto, in an arrangement which accommodates a housing configuration providing a large length to width ratio of 10:1 to 5:1, preferably 7:1, in order to achieve increased aeration. Furthermore, the bioreactor arrangement as previously described provides for a relatively high ratio (above 10 square centimeters per milliliter) for internal surface area in the housing chamber  on the slides  and the beads , to the volume of the infeed liquid being processed. Housing chamber  includes , ,  and up-to outlet port  of .","Referring now to , a bioreactor \u2032 in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The bioreactor \u2032 has a vertically elongated housing \u2032 which includes the aforementioned lower housing section  with the closed testing chamber  and the three ports ,  and . The rest of the housing \u2032 is formed by a cross-sectionally contoured mid-housing section \u2032 extending from the lower housing section  to the upper sealable top end portion  just above the outlet port . The mid-housing section \u2032 has fixedly mounted on opposite sides walls  thereof adjacent the lower section  a plurality of closely spaced guide rods  above a neck  between the housing sections \u2032 and  as shown in . The aforementioned glass slides  are accordingly manually positioned and removed from within the mid-housing section \u2032 above the collection of deposited beads  in the lower housing section  between the guide rods  by insertion into the housing \u2032 through the open end of the sealable top portion , using tweezers (not shown). As shown in , the guide rods have a diameter of about 0.7 mm.  also shows the distance between the closely spaced guide rods to be about 1.1 mm.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
