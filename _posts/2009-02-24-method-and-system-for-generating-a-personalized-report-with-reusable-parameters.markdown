title: Method and system for generating a personalized report with reusable parameters
abstract: Methods and systems for generating personalized reports are disclosed. In some embodiments, a report generating application or service facilitates generating reports that can be personalized on a per-user and per-report basis. Accordingly, after personalizing a report to include only those columns desired, and formatting the report to have the columns appear in a desired order, the report generating application or service enables a user to save the personalization preferences to a file. Upon receiving a subsequent report request from the same user, the report generating application or service automatically generates the report in accordance with the user's saved personalization preferences. In addition to personalizing the report by specifying the particular columns and format, a user may establish, and save for later use, other report parameters (e.g., such as a date range) that are required in order to generate the report.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to generating reports. Some example embodiments relate more specifically to methods and systems for generating personalized reports, at runtime, in accordance with previously established personalization preferences of a user.","A variety of tools and methods exist for generating and displaying reports. For instance, one commonly used application for generating reports, particularly in a business intelligence context, is a report generating application referred to as Crystal Reports. Crystal Reports is a software application available from SAP AG that can be used to design and generate reports by pulling data from a wide range of data sources.","Typically, when a business entity uses a report generating application, such as Crystal Reports, the application includes a set of original or master reports, or more precisely, master report definitions. A report definition is a file that specifies the format and source of data to be included in a particular report. Accordingly, the report generating application utilizes the report definition to generate an instance or version of a particular report. Many conventional report generating applications include features, or come with separate applications, that allow for a user to customize a master report definition to generate customized report definitions. Customized report definitions can be defined to enhance or replace the master reports, and are generally useful for displaying the specific data that is applicable to the nature of the particular business entity.","Each report, whether a master report or a customized report, typically contains a set of fields that are displayed as columns in a table format. Oftentimes users only want to view a report with a subset of the columns of the original report, and this is achieved through the process of report personalization. Traditionally, personalizing a report has been achieved through the same, or a very similar, process as is used for customizing a report. For instance, when personalizing a report, the user modifies the definition of an original report (e.g., a master or customized report definition) by removing the columns and column headings that the user does not want displayed on the report. The user may also need to manually move the remaining columns and column headings in order to fill in the blank space left by the removed columns. The user then saves a copy of the modified report, and then generates an instance of the modified report for viewing.","A variety of problems exist with the way in which reports are personalized using conventional report generating applications, such as Crystal Reports. One issue with the current methods of report personalization is that each user has to have both the skills and permissions (e.g., file access permissions) to modify a report definition for each original (e.g., default or customized) report. Typically, a large number of users may have permission to generate and view a report, but it is not always the case that those users will have permission to modify or personalize the report definition for the report. Furthermore, not all users will have working knowledge of the report design tools, features and user interfaces that are used to modify or personalize a report definition.","Typically, when a report is personalized, the modified report definition is saved as a new report definition, independent of the original. This is problematic for a number of reasons. First, managing the reports (specifically, the report definitions) becomes a hassle as multiple personalized reports with similar names may be generated, making it difficult for a user to determine which report is the correct report. Additionally, because a personalized report definition is independent of the original report definition from which it was generated, any changes made to the original do not carry over or flow through to the personalized report definition. For instance, if the original report definition is modified such that in the modified report definition, data is selected from a different data source than in the original report definition, or a field is formatted differently, the modification will not flow through to the personalized report definition. Consequently, with conventional report generating applications, to keep a personalized report in unison with its original counterpart, a user may be forced to periodically update the personalized report definition to reflect any changes made to the original report definition.","Another issue that frequently arises with conventional report generating applications involves user inputs\u2014referred to herein as report parameters\u2014that are required to generate an instance of a report. Often, when a user wants to generate a report, the user will be prompted to provide one or more report parameters (e.g., a date range) before the user can generate and view the report. Traditionally, these report parameter values have to be entered by the user every time the user logs in to the report generating application or service and generates an instance of the report to view. Often, the report parameter values do not change between user sessions. Consequently, the user is forced to perform a tedious data entry process to fill in the report parameter values each time the user generates and views the report. This is especially inconvenient when the report definition requires that many report parameters be specified in order to generate an instance of the report.","A method and system for generating personalized reports are described. In some embodiments of the invention, a computer-based reporting application or service is accessible via an online enterprise portal and enables a user to personalize a report by specifying report personalization preferences. For instance, in one embodiment, reports may be personalized by specifying the data and format of data to be included in a personalized instance of the report. In addition, in some embodiments, a user can personalize a report by specifying that certain report parameters\u2014required to generate an instance of a report\u2014are to be reused during a subsequent request for the same report. In some embodiments, specifying report personalization preferences for a particular report results in a file being generated to store the personalization preferences, for example, within a personal content directory of a user. The personalization preferences may be stored on a per-user and per-report basis, such that each individual user of the online enterprise portal can generate a personalized instance of any report, without modifying the master report definition on which a report is based.","Consistent with an embodiment of the invention, when a request is received for a particular report, the request is analyzed to determine which report is being requested and who (e.g., which user) has requested the report. Based on the specific report being requested and the particular user requesting the report, a determination is made as to whether the user has established any report personalization preferences for the requested report. If no personalization preferences have been established by the user, the original or master report definition is used to generate an instance of the report with no further modifications. However, if the user has established report personalization preferences, the personalization preferences are used to generate a personalized instance of the report. For instance, in some embodiments, the master report definition is modified in accordance with the personalization preferences, such that the resulting report is personalized based on processing the modified report definition. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the master report definition is used to generate an instance of the report, and then the personalization preferences are used to modify the instance of the report to generate a personalized instance of the report. In any case, the personalization preferences can be utilized to generate the personalized report at runtime, for example, in response to a request from a user. Because the personalization preferences for a particular report are established and stored independent of the corresponding master report definition for the report, but operate in conjunction with the master report definition, any changes made to the master report definition subsequent to establishing the personalization preferences will automatically be reflected in a personalized instance of the report. Furthermore, the user is presented with a single report selection (e.g. report name) for each available report, as opposed to forcing the user to choose between a master report and one or more customized reports having slight variations from the master report, on which the customized reports are based. When a user selects a particular report, for example, by manipulating a cursor control device (e.g., mouse) to select or \u201cclick\u201d a report name, or some other representation of the report, if personalization preferences exist for the selected report, the personalization preferences will automatically be used to generate an instance of the report. If no personalization preferences exist, the master report definition associated with the selected report is used to generate the report with no further modifications being made.","In some embodiments, a user can establish reusable report parameters that can automatically be utilized to generate an instance of a report. For example, in some embodiments, when a user selects a report to view, a determination is made as to whether the report definition for the corresponding selected report requires report parameters in order to generate an instance of the report. If report parameters are required, and the user has not previously established report parameters, the user will be prompted to provide or select the report parameters. The user will also be prompted to save the report parameters for subsequent use in processing a request for the same report. Accordingly, during a subsequent request for the same report, a determination is made as to whether the user has established report parameters for use with the report definition in generating an instance of the report. If report parameters have previously been established, the report parameters will automatically be used to generate an instance of the report, thereby saving the user the time that would otherwise be required to specify or select report parameters for use in generating an instance of the report.","Other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the detailed description that follows.","Methods and systems for generating personalized reports are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","Consistent with an embodiment of the invention, a computer-implemented report generating application or service enables a user to personalize a report by specifying data to be included in a personalized instance or version of the report, and by specifying the format of the data to be included in the personalized instance of the report. Accordingly, a user can save personalization preferences, such that the personalization preferences can be utilized automatically to generate a personalized instance of a report at runtime, for example, in response to a user requesting to view a report. In addition, report parameters used to generate an instance of a particular report can be saved and automatically used during a subsequent request for the same report. A report parameter may include some form of user input (e.g., a date range) for use in querying or selecting data to be included in the report.","After a user has established personalization preferences for a particular report, when the user requests to view an instance of the report, the report generating application generates a personalized instance of the report in accordance with the report personalization preferences established by the user. In one embodiment, when a user establishes personalization preferences for a particular report, the report personalization preferences will be stored in a file separate from the master report definition for the report. Accordingly, when a user requests to view a particular report, if personalization preferences for the report have been established, the report will be generated in accordance with the personalization preferences. If, on the other hand, no personalization preferences have been established for the selected report for the requesting user, the original or master report definition will be utilized to generate an instance of the requested report, with no further modifications to the report. Because the personalization preferences for a particular report are established and stored independent of the corresponding master report definition for the report, but operate in conjunction with the master report definition to generate an instance of a report, any changes made to the master report definition subsequent to establishing the personalization preferences will automatically be reflected in a personalized instance of the report. For instance, any change made to the master report definition will automatically carry over or flow through to the user's personalized version of the report. Various additional aspects of the invention are described below in connection with the description of the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","1","14"]},"In general, a master report definition specifies both the data content to be included in a report as well as the format of the content. For example, the content may be specified in the form of one or more queries to be executed against one or more particular data sources, such as a database table. Accordingly, the data to be included in an instance of a report are selected at runtime. In addition, each report definition typically includes commands, directives and\/or instructions that specify how the content is to be formatted and displayed. Additionally, in some embodiments, the commands, directives and\/or instructions included in a report definition will specify a data connection type to be used when establishing a connection with a data source to be queried. In some embodiments, the report definition may include formulas for calculating or deriving data values based on data values received as a result of processing a query. These data queries, commands, directives and instructions are executed or processed when a report server processes the report definition in response to a user requesting the report. Accordingly, processing a report definition results in the generation of an instance of the report. Each report available to a user is associated with a corresponding master report definition. For those specific reports for which a user has established personalization preferences and\/or report parameters, a file containing the personalization preferences and\/or report parameters for the particular report will exist in the user's personal content directory . In some embodiments, the file with the personalization preferences and\/or report parameters (e.g., file ) will include a report identifier that identifies the master report definition with which the personalization preferences are associated. For instance, in , the personalization preferences and report parameters stored in the file with reference number  are shown to be associated with the report identifier, \u201c004\u201d, which maps the personalization preferences and report parameters to the master report definition with name, \u201cMREPORT_.RPT\u201d . Accordingly, when User  requests to view the report corresponding with the report definition, \u201cMREPORT_.RPT\u201d , the personalization preferences and report parameters in the file  in the user's personal content directory will be used to generate a personalized instance of the report.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that  depicts one of many ways in which report definitions might be stored and associated with user's personalization preferences on a per-user and per-report basis. For instance, in other embodiments, the personalization preferences and report parameters may be stored in a manner that differs from what is depicted in . For instance, as opposed to being stored within a directory and file of a file system, personalization preferences and report parameters might be stored within a table of a database system. Additionally, although reports are to be generated on a per-user and per-report basis, it is not necessarily the case that in every embodiment the personalization preferences and report parameters of users will be stored on a per-user basis. For instance, in some embodiments, report personalization preferences and report parameters for multiple users might be stored within the same file or same database table. In some embodiments, a mapping of a report to a report definition exists within a personal content directory of a user only for those reports that have been personalized. For instance, a separate mapping mechanism might be used for master report definitions which do not have corresponding personalization preferences. Regardless of the specific manner in which the report definitions and personalization preferences are stored and mapped to the names of reports, they will generally be stored in such a manner that allows each user to personalize a report without impacting the original report definition, such that any change made to the original or master report definition will not negatively affect a user's personalization preferences, and such changes will automatically flow through to each user's personalized reports. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the naming convention used in the example of  is for illustrative purposes. In various embodiments of the invention, any number of naming conventions, directory structures or database schemas might be utilized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","32","34"]},"As illustrated in , there is an enterprise portal server , a business objects server , and a reporting server . The three servers provide a set of distinct functions that together comprise a reporting application or service, enabling the generation and viewing of personalized reports. In general, the enterprise portal server  provides a front-end and user interface via which users interact with a reporting service. For instance, the enterprise portal server  includes a user interface module , which in conjunction with a web server or web application server (not shown), facilitates the presentation of a list of user-selectable reports. Upon selecting a report to view, a request is generated and communicated from the user's web browser application or the enterprise portal server  to the business objects server . The request is processed by the report server  of the business objects server , which, in turn, processes a report definition stored in the report repository . For instance, the user-initiated request to view a report may include a report identifier to identify the particular report definition on which the instance of the report will be based. As part of processing the report definition, one or more commands are communicated from the business objects server  to the report engine API  of the reporting server . For example, the report engine interface module  may direct queries to the report engine API module . The queries are then processed by the report engine , which selects data, for example, from the report source database , or some other data source. This selected data is then communicated to the report server  of the business objects server , where it is further processed in accordance with any formatting commands, directives or instructions of the report definition to generate an instance of the selected report. As described in greater detail below, if personalization preferences have been established for the selected report, the instance of the report will be generated in accordance with the personalization preferences before it is communicated to the user's web browser or client application for display.","In one embodiment, the enterprise portal server  may be an implementation of SAP Enterprise Portal (also referred to as SAP NetWeaver Portal), which is a bundle of software providing users with role-specific, web-based and secure access to a wide variety of relevant information, applications and services for a business entity. In the case of the SAP Enterprise Portal, the enterprise portal  contains the NetWeaver components: Portal, Knowledge Management, and Collaboration. In addition, the enterprise portal  may include other predefined content. Typically, a user of an enterprise portal will utilize a web browser application to access applications and services after having been authenticated by the user authentication module  of the portal. As shown in , the enterprise portal  includes a user interface module  which, in conjunction with a web server and\/or web application server (not shown), provides a user with a graphical user interface by which the user interacts with the various applications and services, including the reporting application or service.","The reporting module  serves as a front-end for the reporting service embodied in-part in the business objects server  and reporting server . Accordingly, in one embodiment, the reporting module  of the enterprise portal  includes a report personalization module  and a report selection module . The report personalization module  includes the logic and user interface elements for allowing a user to personalize a report. For instance, in one embodiment, the report personalization module  enables the personalization of a report via a user interface such as that depicted in , and described in greater detail below. In one embodiment, during a user session, as data flows between a user's web browser and the enterprise portal, the reporting module  communicates with the business objects server  and reporting server  as is necessary. For example, in some embodiments, after a user submits a request to view a report for which personalization preferences have been established, the request may be forwarded to the business objects server , where it is received and processed.","In some embodiments, personalization preferences and report parameters are communicated to the business objects server  with the initial request to view a report. Accordingly, the personalization preferences and report parameters may be processed by the report server  in conjunction with the master report definition associated with the selected report. In such a case, any query specified by the master report definition might be tailored, based on a personalization preference or report parameter, such that only relevant data is selected by the report engine  for inclusion in the personalized instance of the report. Alternatively, personalization preferences may be processed subsequent to the data selection process, such that certain data returned to the report server  by the report engine  are discarded, if a personalization preference indicates the data are not to be included in the personalized instance of the report. In yet another embodiment, the personalization preferences are not communicated to the report server , but instead are processed at the reporting module  of the enterprise portal server . For instance, in some embodiments, an instance of the requested report is generated in accordance with the master report definition, and then communicated to the enterprise portal server  where it is personalized in accordance with the personalization preferences established for that particular report, before being communicated to the user's web browser to be displayed.","The report selection module  includes the logic and user interface elements for presenting reports to a user for selection. For instance, after logging in to the enterprise portal , a user may opt to view a list of reports available to the user by selecting a link to a reporting service. In one embodiment, the report selection module  includes logic to query the reporting server , or the business objects server , for a list of reports accessible to the particular user. The list of reports available to the user may be generated in real time, based on the user's credentials (e.g., username, password, enterprise-assigned role) and returned to the report selection module , which in turn, causes the list of reports available to the user to be displayed. For instance, a web page may be presented to the user with a listing of selectable links to the accessible reports. In one embodiment, a single report listing will be provided for an available report regardless of whether the user has established personalization preferences for the report. Accordingly, if a user has established personalization preferences for a particular report, the single report listing for that particular report, when selected, will cause the report server  to generate a personalized instance of the report in accordance with the user's personalization preferences. If the user has not established personalization preferences for the particular report, the single report listing for that particular report, when selected, will cause the report server  to generate an instance of the report in accordance with the master report definition, with no further modifications. In an alternative embodiment, two selectable reports may be displayed to the user\u2014a first selectable report corresponding to the master report definition, and a second selectable report corresponding to a personalized view of the report based on the user's personalization preferences for the particular report.","When a user selects a report from the displayed list of reports, the report selection module  detects and processes the selection. In one embodiment, the report selection module  determines whether the user has established personalization preferences for the selected report. For instance, the report selection module  identifies the existence of a particular file within the requesting user's personal content directory. Assuming the file exists, the report selection module  reads mapping information, such as a report identifier, from the file. The mapping information maps personalization preferences and\/or report parameters to a master report definition to be used when generating the requested report for the particular user. In some embodiments, a file will exist in the user's personal content directory only for those reports that have been personalized by the requesting user. Accordingly, if the report selection module  determines that no file exists in the personal content directory of the user for a particular selected report, the master report definition is automatically used to generate the requested report. Regardless of how the actual mapping is implemented, once the report selection module  has determined the report definition to be used for the selected report, a command or request is communicated to the report server to request that an instance of the report be generated.","In one embodiment, the report server  receives a request to generate a report using a master report definition that is identified by a report identifier. For instance, a command or request received from the enterprise portal server  includes a report identifier specifying a report definition to be used to generate an instance of a report. The report server  processes the identified report definition, which includes directing one or more commands including a query to the report engine  of the reporting server . The command received at the reporting server  will generally be consistent with an application programming interface (API) command in accordance with the report engine API  of the reporting server. Accordingly, the report engine interface module  of the business objects server  may direct a query to the report engine . The query may, for instance, be based on, or directly read from, the report definition being processed to generate the requested report. In some embodiments, the query may be based in part on a personalization preference of the user for the requested report. The report engine  processes the query and selects the appropriate data from various data sources, and communicates the selected data to the report server  where the data are formatted in accordance with formatting directives in the report definition. In some embodiments, the data may be formatted in accordance with personalization preferences that are processed at the report server . Alternatively, the personalization preferences may be processed at the report personalization module  of the enterprise portal server . Finally, the user interface module  of the enterprise portal server  generates a view of the report for display to the user. In one embodiment, the report is \u201cwrapped\u201d in accordance with an iView associated with the enterprise portal server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["60","62","64"]},"Once the personalization view is displayed, the user can add data fields from the list of data fields shown in the box  with heading \u201cAVAILABLE\u201d by clicking on the corresponding box to the left of a particular field (e.g., box  for the field with name, \u201cFIELD_\u201d). Then, the user can utilize the buttons  to move a data field to the box  with heading \u201cSELECTED.\u201d Similarly, a data field can be moved from the \u201cSELECTED\u201d column to the \u201cAVAILABLE\u201d column. In this manner, the user can include or exclude data fields, which will cause those data fields to be included or excluded in the instance of the personalized report. In addition to including or excluding certain data fields from the report, by manipulating the arrow buttons  shown at the bottom of the \u201cSELECTED\u201d column, a user can change the order of the selected fields, thereby changing the appearance of the fields in the generated report. It will be appreciated that the user interface shown in  is provided as an example, and in various alternative embodiments, the user interface may be different from what is depicted in  without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"80"},"At method operation , once a particular report has been identified by way of the report request, it is determined whether the user-requested report has previously been personalized by the requesting user. For example, if a user has previously established report personalization preferences for the requested report, a file containing the user's personalization preferences for the report will reside in a predetermined directory of the user. Accordingly, determining if a user has established personalization preferences for a report may be as simple as identifying a file with a particular filename in a predetermined directory of the user. In such a scenario, the existence of a file in the predetermined directory indicates that the user has previously established personalization preferences. The file may include mapping information mapping the name of the selected report to a report identifier associated with a master report definition used to generate the requested report. For instance, the report identifier will be associated with and identify a master report definition used to generate an instance of the report. However, if no file is found within the personal content directory of the user, it can be assumed that no personalization preferences for the requested report have been established by the user. In such a case, the master report definition for the requested report is automatically used to generate the instance of the selected report. In other embodiments, the manner in which the determination is made will differ.","If it is determined that the requesting user has not previously established personalization preferences for the requested report, at method operation  the original requested report is displayed. In such a case, the original report is generated based on the master report definition for the report. That is, the original report is displayed without processing any personalization preferences of the user. Before displaying the report, the report definition identified in the request is processed by a report server, and in some cases a report engine, to generate an instance of the report. The data representing the instance of the report will then be formatted in accordance with an enterprise portal iView. For instance, in some embodiments such as those utilizing the SAP Enterprise Portal, an instance of a report will be wrapped in an iView\u2014a web-based visual representation of an application, information or service with a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\u2014and then communicated to the user's client machine to be rendered and displayed to the user.","In some embodiments, once the user is done viewing the report, the user may be prompted to personalize the report, as indicated at method operation . If the user selects an option indicating a desire to personalize the report, at method operation  a report personalization view or user interface is displayed. The report personalization view may be similar in concept to the user interface depicted in , and described above. In any case, at method operation , user input is received identifying those data fields which are to be shown (unhidden) or not shown (hidden) for a personalized instance of the report. This may be accomplished, for example, by manipulating user interface buttons and\/or clicking the names of the desired columns to be included in the report. Once the data fields or columns to be shown and not shown are selected, at method operation  the personalization selections are automatically saved. For instance, by selecting to save the personalization selections, a file in the user's personal content directory may be generated and saved. Accordingly, the next time the report is requested by the user, the personalization preferences stored in the user's personal content directory will be accessed and utilized to personalize the instance of the report.","If it is determined at method operation  that a user has previously personalized the report being requested, then at method operation  the requested report will be generated by modifying the report according to the requesting user's personalization preferences, as those preferences are specified within the file corresponding to the requested report in the user's personal content directory. Accordingly, at method operation  a personalized instance of the report is generated. This may be achieved in a number of ways. In some embodiments, the personalization preferences associated with the report selected by the user in connection with method operation  will be processed by a report server, for example, residing on a business objects server. The resulting instance of the report will then be communicated to a reporting module on the enterprise portal, which will format the data for display to the user. Finally, at method operation , the data representing the personalized instance of the report is communicated to the client computer where it is displayed to the user. After displaying the personalized report, the user may be prompted to modify or save the personalization settings that the user had previously established.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","102","104","106"]},"If at method operation  it is determined that report parameters are required in order for the report to be generated, then at method operation  it is determined whether the user has previously specified report parameters to be used for generating the selected report. For instance, in some embodiments, a reporting application executing on the enterprise portal where the report request is received may attempt to locate a file in the requesting user's directory with the previously specified report parameters. If the file exists and includes specified report parameters for the requested report, the report parameters can be used to generate the report without prompting the user to provide the report parameters a second time. Accordingly, if it is determined that the report parameters exist, at method operation , an instance of the requested report is generated using the previously specified report parameters. For example, the previously established report parameters may be communicated to the report server along with the request to generate the selected report. After the report is generated with the specified report parameters, at method operation , the instance of the report is displayed to the requesting user. For instance, the generated report data may be communicated to a client machine where it is rendered and displayed in a browser application window.","If, at method operation , it is determined that no report parameters have previously been established by the user for the selected report, then at method operation  the user is prompted to provide the report parameters necessary for generating an instance of the selected report. For instance, a web page may be displayed with one or more forms where a user can enter the required data. Alternatively, a user may be provided with a drop down list of data selections available for use as report parameters. In any case, once the report parameters have been provided, at method operation , the report is generated based on the user-provided report parameters. For instance, the report definition and the provided report parameters are processed by the report server to generate an instance of the report. At method operation  the generated report is displayed to the requesting user.","In some embodiments, after displaying the report that was generated based on the user-provided report parameters, the user is prompted to save the user-provided report parameters to be used the next time the user selects the report. Accordingly, at method operation , the user is prompted to save the user-provided report parameters. If the user selects to save the report parameters, then at method operation , the report parameters are saved to a file and stored in the user's personal content directory. In some embodiments the file will be named with a filename that is in accordance with a naming convention established for the reporting service. Consequently, the reporting module of the enterprise portal can identify the existence of personalization preferences, including report parameters, by simply determining that a particular file exists in the user's personal content directory.","It will be appreciated that the method operations of the methods illustrated in  and described above may be altered to a certain degree without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, although displayed as two distinct methods in , in some embodiments, the methods may be combined in some manner such that a report may be generated with personalization preferences including report parameters. Additionally, one or more of the method operations may occur in an order different from what is proposed in . For example, the user may be prompted to save the user-provided report parameters prior to being presented with a view of the generated report. Without departing from the spirit of the invention, other modifications to the methods are possible as well.","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine or computer, but deployed across a number of machines or computers. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or at a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or within the context of \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., Application Program Interfaces (APIs)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a display unit , an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), and a user interface (UI) navigation device  (e.g., a mouse). In one embodiment, the display, input device and cursor control device are a touch screen display. The computer system  may additionally include a storage device  (e.g., drive unit), a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker), a network interface device , and one or more sensors , such as a global positioning system sensor, compass, accelerometer, or other sensor.","The drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures (e.g., software ) embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software  may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system , the main memory  and the processor  also constituting machine-readable media.","While the machine-readable medium  is illustrated in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d may include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention, or that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine-readable media include non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.","The software  may further be transmitted or received over a communications network  using a transmission medium via the network interface device  utilizing any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, Plain Old Telephone (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g., Wi-Fi\u00ae and WiMax\u00ae networks). The term \u201ctransmission medium\u201d shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible medium to facilitate communication of such software.","Although an embodiment has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention.
