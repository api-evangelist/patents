title: Device and method for laying and joining pipe
abstract: An auto-advancing pipe installation device and a method for laying consecutive lengths of bell and spigot pipe. The auto-advancing pipe installation device installs sequential lengths of pipe in a trench. The auto-advancing pipe installation device includes a locomotion system adapted for advancing engagement within the trench, a pipe feed system, a pipe alignment system and a pipe joining system. The pipe feed system positions a pipe length on a forward section of the pipe alignment system. The pipe alignment system aligns the forward pipe length with a rearward pipe length positioned in a pipe alignment system rearward section. The pipe joining system applies a force to a first end of the forward pipe length as a pipe restraint applies a restraining force against the rearward pipe length, joining the forward and rearward pipe lengths.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims benefit to a provisional application, Ser. No. 60\/528,318, filed on Dec. 8, 2003, entitled Automated Pipe Laying Device, which is incorporated by reference herein.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to devices for laying pipe and, more specifically, to a device that is capable of auto-advancement, laying and joining pipe.","2. Background of the Invention","The process of laying sections of pipe for an underground pipeline involves the excavation of a trench to a desired depth followed by placement and positioning of pipe in the trench. When a bell and spigot pipe is being installed, the lengths are typically joined by applying mechanical pressure to a most recently laid section of pipe in order to engage the spigot end of that length with the bell end of a previously laid length. This method involves placing one or more workers in the trench to guide a lowered section of pipe into contact with a previously installed section. The workers must also disengage rigging from the pipe that was used in lowering the length into the trench. Once a pipe length is positioned in the trench, it is manually joined to a preceding pipe length. In deep trenches, a work crew commonly works within the confines of a trench shoring box that provides increased safety in the trench working condition.","Excavation and placement functions are typically performed by a single piece of equipment, an excavator. The excavator is a relatively costly piece of equipment, often track mounted, that performs primarily an excavation function. One disadvantage of the current popular method is the fact that a costly piece of equipment is oftentimes moved between tasks, excavation and pipe installation, that may otherwise proceed at different rates. Additionally, where shoring is required it is often moved along the length of the trench by the excavator as the pipeline advances requiring yet a third function or task of the excavator.","Devices, including excavators that position or otherwise place pipe at the bottom of a trench, pose a number of disadvantages. These devices are positioned outside the trench and typically place pipe by maneuvering along a top edge of the trench over tailings that have been placed alongside the trench during excavation. These surfaces are rarely, if ever, flat and therefore make the task of placement more difficult. Additionally, activity at grade level, depending on soil conditions, may increase a probability of trench collapse.","Advantage may therefore be found in providing an auto-advancing device that is capable of laying and joining pipe in a trench. Additional advantage may be found in providing an apparatus that auto-advances along a pre-excavated trench, laying and joining pipe in the trench. Additional advantage may be found in providing a method for advancing a device for feeding, laying and joining pipe along a trench. Advantage may also be found in providing a pipe installation device that is capable of auto-advancing along the floor of an excavated trench by engagement with at least one surface of the trench selected from a group of trench surfaces including a floor and two generally opposing sidewalls defining the trench.","The present invention is directed to an auto-advancing pipe installation device for installing sequential lengths of pipe in a trench that includes a frame and a locomotion system connected to the frame. The locomotion system is adapted for advancing engagement with the trench. The auto-advancing pipe installation device also includes a pipe alignment system and a pipe feed system, both connected to the frame, the pipe alignment system is positioned to receive a forward pipe length from the pipe feed system onto a pipe alignment system forward section, the pipe alignment system adapted to align the forward pipe length with a rearward pipe length positioned in a pipe alignment system rearward section. The auto-advancing pipe installation device also includes a pipe joining system connected to the pipe alignment system, a pipe restraint adapted to selectively restrain the rearward pipe length against rearward movement, the pipe joining system adapted to apply a force to a first end of the forward pipe length, the force being substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the forward pipe length, joining the forward pipe length to a restrained rearward pipe length.","In the preferred embodiment, the locomotion system of the auto-advancing pipe installation device includes a first travel ram connected to the frame, the first travel ram adapted for linear extension and retraction in a line substantially parallel to a direction of travel of the auto-advancing pipe installation device and a second travel ram connected to the frame, the second travel ram adapted for a substantially simultaneous opposing linear retraction and extension with respect to the linear extension and retraction of the first travel ram. The locomotion system also includes a first anchor ram connected to and movable with the extension and retraction of the first travel ram, the first anchor ram including a first pair of opposing side anchor plates connected to and movable with opposing ends of the first anchor ram and a second anchor ram connected to and movable with the extension and retraction of the second travel ram, the second anchor ram including a second pair of opposing side anchor plates connected to and movable with opposing ends of the second anchor ram. The first anchor ram is adapted for extension upon completion of the linear extension of the first travel ram and retraction upon completion of the linear retraction of the first travel ram. Similarly, the second anchor ram is adapted for extension upon completion of the linear extension of the second travel ram and retraction upon completion of the linear retraction of the second travel ram.","In the preferred embodiment, the auto-advancing pipe installation device includes a pipe supply system, including a pipe cradle adapted to hold a supply of pipe, a pipe feed chute adapted to receive a single pipe length from the pipe cradle and a pipe feed ram for advancing the single pipe length from the pipe feed chute from a first position wherein the pipe is supported in the pipe feed chute to a second position wherein the pipe is supported by the pipe feed system.","In the preferred embodiment, the pipe joining system of the auto-advancing pipe installation device includes a pipe seating ram adapted to exert a force to an end of a pipe length positioned in the pipe alignment system forward section, the force substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the pipe length positioned in the pipe alignment system forward section. The force exerted by the pipe seating ram is adjustable so that various pipe diameters may be accommodated and so that sufficient force is applied to insert a spigot end of the forward pipe length into the bell end of the rearward or trailing pipe length. Ideally, the force applied should be sufficient to overcome the resistance of a gasket positioned in a gasket race of the bell to insertion of the spigot end, but not so great so as to \u201cbottom out\u201d the spigot in the bell.","The present invention is also directed to a method for laying consecutive lengths pipe using an auto-advancing pipe installation device including the steps of advancing the auto-advancing pipe installation device along the length of the trench by engaging at least one surface of the trench selected from a group of trench surfaces including a floor and two generally opposing sidewalls defining the trench, to a selected position, feeding a pipe length onto a forward section of a pipe alignment system, aligning the pipe length with a previously laid pipe length positioned on a rearward section of the pipe alignment system, restraining the previously laid pipe length against rearward movement, joining the pipe length in the forward section of a pipe alignment system by exerting a force substantially along a longitudinal axis of the pipe length in the forward section of a pipe alignment system and consequently against the previously laid pipe length positioned in the rearward section of the pipe alignment system so that a spigot end of one of the pipe length in the forward section of a pipe alignment system engages a bell end of the pipe length positioned in the rearward section of the pipe alignment system. Once the pipe length in the forward section of a pipe alignment system and the pipe length positioned in the rearward section of the pipe alignment system are joined, restraint of the pipe length positioned in the rearward section of the pipe alignment system is discontinued and forward travel of the self-advancing auto-advancing pipe installation device resumes. A joined pipe length including the pipe length positioned in the forward section of a pipe alignment system and the pipe length positioned in the rearward section of the pipe alignment system are deposited at a rear end of the auto-advancing pipe installation device as the auto-advancing pipe installation device resumes its forward travel.","The present invention consists of the parts hereinafter more fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings and more particularly pointed out in the appended claims, it being understood that changes may be made in the form, size, proportions and minor details of construction without departing from the spirit or sacrificing any of the advantages of the invention.","Referring to , auto-advancing pipe installation device  for laying consecutive lengths pipe in trench T is shown to advantage. As shown, in , auto-advancing pipe installation device  is positioned in the bottom of trench T. Trench T, in this instance has been previously excavated by an excavator, not shown, and as shown in , includes generally opposing sidewalls W and W and floor F. Referring to , auto-advancing pipe installation device  includes locomotion system  connected to frame . Locomotion system  provides the motive force required for advancing auto-advancing pipe installation device  through trench T. Pipe supply system  is connected to frame  and is adapted to receive and hold one or more lengths of pipe P. Pipe feed system  feeds a single pipe length P to pipe alignment system  as required. Auto-advancing pipe installation device  also includes pipe alignment system  connected to frame  and positioned to receive a pipe length P from pipe feed system . As seen in  pipe alignment system  aligns pipe length P with a previously positioned pipe length P. Auto-advancing pipe installation device  also includes pipe joining system  connected to frame  and adapted to displace pipe length P a predetermined distance along a longitudinal axis L of pipe length P against the previously laid pipe length P. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, locomotion system  is adapted for advancing engagement with the trench T to motivate auto-advancing pipe installation device  through trench T.","Referring to , pipe alignment system  includes alignment frame forward section  and alignment frame rearward section , which in the preferred embodiment is detachably connected to alignment frame forward section  with connection hardware  for transport. V-rollers A\u2013C and D, (shown in ), are connected to alignment frame forward section  and alignment frame rearward section  and positioned at intervals to allow low-friction advance of pipe through pipe alignment system .","Referring to , as auto-advancing pipe installation device  advances along trench T, (as more fully discussed herein below), pipe lengths P and P pass over V-rollers A\u2013D, depositing to the rear of auto-advancing pipe installation device . Referring to , as the end of pipe length P advances past pipe passage sensor , which provides input to control system  indicating that a pipe length is positioned so as to block pipe passage sensor  or in the alternative that a pipe length has passed pipe passage sensor . Bell restraint fork  pivots from a \u201cdown\u201d position, as seen in , to an \u201cup\u201d position, as shown in , in response to input from pipe passage sensor  that a pipe length has passed pipe passage sensor . At the same time forward travel of auto-advancing pipe installation device  ceases as a pipe feeding sequence completes.","Referring to , auto-advancing pipe installation device  is positioned as shown with respect to trench T. Locomotive system  is connected to frame  and is shown engaging sidewalls W and W of trench T. Frame  also supports power system  and control system . Pipe supply system  includes carriage  supported by four wheels, A\u2013D. Pipe supply system  is connected to frame  by a pair of arms A and B, which attach at their first ends to frame  and at their second ends to pivotable front axle . Rear wheels C and D are steerable by action of rear steering rams A and B. The fact that front wheels A and B and rear wheels C and D are steerable permitting pipe supply system  to track accurately behind frame  even though trench T may curve, as is often the case.  also shows alignment frame forward section  of pipe alignment system  attached to frame  by a universal connection , thereby permitting freedom of angular motion between frame  and pipe alignment system .","Referring to , pipe supply system  is shown including two sets of generally opposing cradle arms, front cradle arms A and B, seen in , and rear cradle arms C and D, seen in . Referring to , front pipe translation bar A attaches to front cradle arm B and slopes in a manner such as to guide the supply of pipe P against front cradle arm A. As shown in , rear pipe translation bar B attaches to rear cradle arm B. Referring again to , it will be noted that front pipe translation bar A is adjustable to permit handling of various diameters of pipe. By connected ends of front pipe translation bar A at various apertures  a slope and a distance between a distal end of front pipe translation bar A and front cradle arm A may be varied. Similarly, by attaching the ends of support bar  at various first end apertures  and second end apertures  a slope and a distance between a distal end of front pipe translation bar A and front cradle arm A may be varied. The pair of front cradle arms A and B and their arrangement to one another and front pipe translation bar A is typical of the arrangement of the pair of rear cradle arms A and B, shown in , to one another and the rear pipe translation bar B.","Referring again to , pipe feed system  includes a means for receiving and lowering a pipe length to pipe alignment system . In the preferred embodiment pipe feed system  includes first winch A and second winch B for raising and lowering first strap A and second strap B respectively. Referring to , pipe length P is gravity fed into pipe feed chute  with bell end PB of pipe length P supported by first bell keep\/barrel guide plate A and second bell keep\/barrel guide plate B and spigot end S of pipe length P supported by crossbar . Referring to , as pipe feed ram  extends, push bar  contacts pipe length P and displaces pipe length P forward with respect to first bell keep\/barrel guide plate A and second bell keep\/barrel guide plate B, seen in , which initially supports bell end PB. As pipe length P is pushed forward with respect to first bell keep\/barrel guide plate A and second bell keep\/barrel guide plate B, bell end PB, having a diameter PBD, passes first bell keep\/barrel guide plate A and second bell keep\/barrel guide plate B and spigot end S, having a diameter D, that is less than D, falls between first bell keep\/barrel guide plate A and second bell keep\/barrel guide plate B. Spigot end S, shown in , drops off of crossbar  and pipe length P is, at that point, supported by first strap A and second strap B.","As shown in , first winch A and second winch B are, in the preferred embodiment, configured as a pair of hydraulically operated winches. As seen in , first strap A has a first end attached to first winch A and a second end attached to first strap tail hold A. Similarly, referring again to , second strap B has a first end attached to second winch B and a second end attached to second strap tail hold B. When pipe feed ram  has traveled to an outer travel limit, operation of first winch A and second winch B is initiated and first strap A and second strap B begin to feed off first winch A and second winch B respectively at a controlled rate of feed. As pipe length P lowers it is eventually sensed by lowered pipe sensor  which provides input to control system  () indicating that pipe length P has been lowered to a pre-selected elevation. First winch A and second winch B continue to feed first strap A and second strap B respectively for a pre-selected duration of time, assuring that pipe length P is lowered onto V-rollers A and B and feed first strap A and second strap B are positioned below and out of the way of pipe length P as shown in .","While the mechanism employed in the present embodiment as pipe feed system  for lowering a pipe length to pipe alignment system  is described as including a pair of retractable straps, other mechanisms or systems are to be considered within the scope of the present invention for accomplishing such function. For instance a mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or electrically operated elevator may be employed to lower a pipe length onto pipe alignment system . In practice it has been found however that the means described herein is suitable for handling a wide variety of pipe diameters as well as pipe manufactured from a wide variety of materials including various plastics and even cast iron.","Additionally, it should be noted that a pipe feed system for use with the present invention may take various forms and still be in keeping with the spirit of the present invention. For instance in certain situations, advancing a pipe supply system supported on a set of wheels may become difficult or ill advised, for instance where the condition of the terrain becomes extreme. In these instances a boom mounted to the frame of the auto-advancing pipe installation device  may pick and set single lengths of pipe into pipe alignment system . Alternately, pipe supply and feed systems may be adapted so as to be supported entirely by a frame that supports or otherwise contains the pipe alignment system as well. A pipe feed system may include two pairs of arms, each arm including a first end pivotally attached to a frame of the pipe alignment system  and a cross-member, for instance a sling, attaching each pair of arms near a second end each arm. The pair of arms selectively alternate between an up position and a down position by operation of an actuator. In an \u201cup\u201d position, a pipe length may be received onto the cross-member as discussed above, due to the action of a pipe feed ram that moves a pipe length from a first position wherein the pipe is supported by a pair of bell keep\/barrel guide plates and a frame member, to a second position wherein the pipe is supported by cross-members that join each pair of arms. In a \u201cdown\u201d position, the pair of arms pivot, positioning the pipe length on the V-rolls. Alternately, a pipe length may be manually positioned on the cross-members joining the pairs of arms, and subsequently positioned on the V-rolls by operation of the arms from the \u201cup\u201d position to the \u201cdown\u201d position.","Auto-advancing pipe installation device  also includes pipe joining system , as shown in , adapted to displace pipe length P a predetermined distance along a longitudinal axis L of pipe length P against the previously laid pipe length P. As seen in , auto-advancing pipe installation device  also includes bell restraint fork  which, as seen in , is positioned in an up position inhibiting passage of bell end PB of pipe length P, and as seen in  is positioned in a down position permitting passage of joined pipe lengths P and P. As pipe seating ram  extends, push bar  contacts pipe length P, as seen in  and displaces pipe length P against pipe length P. In the preferred embodiment, bell restraint fork  is positioned just behind a gasket race GR of the bell end PB as seen in . In the preferred embodiment, bell restraint fork  is adjustable to accept pipe of various diameters.","Referring to  inclusive, the structure and operation of locomotion system  will be described. As shown, locomotion system  is mounted to frame  and as such frame  advances with advancement of locomotion system . Locomotion system  includes first travel ram  and second travel ram . First anchor ram  is connected to and movable with the extension and retraction of first travel ram . Similarly, second anchor ram  is connected to and movable with the extension and retraction of second travel ram . First anchor ram includes a pair of opposing side anchor plates A and B connected to and movable with opposing ends of first anchor ram . Similarly, second anchor ram  includes a second pair of opposing side anchor plates A and B that are connected to and movable with opposing ends of the second anchor ram . Lift ram  connects to frame  at connection  and to vertically slideable frame member  at connection . Foot  is attached to and extends below vertically slideable frame member . First travel ram  is connected to slideable frame member , which is attached to frame . Second travel ram  is connected to slideable frame member  which is attached to frame .","Referring to , a discussion is offered illustrating one manner in which a locomotion system  may be adapted for advancing engagement within trench T. Referring to  when first travel ram  is positioned at an inner limit of its travel, first anchor ram  retracts, second anchor ram  extends, and as seen in , lift ram  extends, exerting a downward force on vertically slideable frame member , extending foot  which contacts floor F of trench T. At least a portion of the weight of frame  is borne by foot  and side anchor plates A and B. In some situations, for instance in shallow trenches or trenches having unstable soil conditions along an upper strata of the trench wall, side anchor plates A and B may be removed altogether and forward travel may be accomplished by engagement of foot  making contact with floor F of trench T followed by retraction of second travel ram . As seen in , first travel ram  lifts with a forward portion of frame .","Referring to , with first anchor ram  retracted and side anchor plates A and B withdrawn from opposing sidewalls W and W of trench T, and with second anchor ram  extended with side anchor plates A and B in contact with sidewalls W and W of trench T, second travel ram  retracts advancing frame in direction D. Simultaneous to the retraction of second travel ram , first travel ram  extends. Referring to , once first travel ram  has extended and second travel ram  has retracted, first anchor ram  extends, second anchor ram  retracts and as seen in  lift ram  retracts.","Referring to , once first anchor ram  has extended and anchor plates A and B are in contact with sidewalls W and W of trench T and second anchor ram  and anchor ram  have retracted, first travel ram  retracts advancing frame in direction D. Simultaneous to the retraction of first travel ram , second travel ram  extends. Finally, referring to , once first travel ram  has retracted and second travel ram  has extended, first anchor ram  retracts, second anchor ram  extends and as seen in  lift ram  extends. The cycle described above with reference to  repeats until suspended as discussed herein with pipe passage sensor , seen in , providing input to control system  indicating that a pipe length has passed pipe passage sensor .","While the mechanism employed in the present embodiment as a locomotion system adapted for advancing engagement with the trench, other mechanisms or systems are to be considered within the scope of the present invention for accomplishing such function. For instance the locomotion system may include a single travel ram and a single anchor ram although not preferred as such a system would most likely be slower it may be in fact somewhat more simplified. Additionally, the pair of travel rams may be oriented differently than shown. Additionally, a tracked device, although most likely having greater power consumption requirements and being heavier and more costly to manufacture, may nonetheless be considered locomotion systems adapted for advancing engagement with the trench.","Referring to , a representative schematic diagram is provided showing features of power system  and control system . In the preferred embodiment, power system  includes generator  and hydraulic pump  connected to engine . Hydraulic reservoir  is fluidly connected to hydraulic pump . Control system  includes the control valves, sensing devices and controller . Control system  may also include a remote control device, not shown, that permits an operator to control functions of the auto-advancing pipe installation device including \u201con-off\u201d, travel, stop, energize feed system, energize pipe joining system and \u201ckill.\u201d As shown, control valve , a 3-position 4 way solenoid operated control valve, controls operation of first and second travel rams  and .

Pipe passage sensor  provides input to control system  indicating that a pipe length has advanced beyond pipe passage sensor . Lowered pipe sensor  provides input to control system  indicating the presence or absence of a pipe length positioned upstream of pipe passage sensor  in alignment frame forward section , as shown in . Control system  also includes winch circuit pressure sensor  which provides input to control system  indicating that first strap A and second strap B have been rolled up onto first winch A and second winch B respectively to a pre-selected torque setting.
