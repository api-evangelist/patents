title: Biometric adjustments for touchscreens
abstract: In some embodiments, a touchscreen may display a graphical user interface with one or more input options and may detect which input options are selected by a user by detecting a user's contact on the touchscreen. The system may determine a new graphical user interface configuration to increase the size and/or spacing of the input options. In some embodiments, one or more of the input options may be removed to increase the space available to increase the size of the other input options. In some embodiments, the system may maintain a history of input option use to determine which input options to remove. In some embodiments, the new graphical user interface configuration may include smaller (and/or additional) input options (e.g., if the contact areas are detected as consistently within the displayed input options).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to input systems; and more particularly, it is directed to touchscreen input systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Electronic devices such as mobile phones (e.g., the iPhone\u2122, Blackberry\u2122, and Android\u2122 phones), global positioning system (GPS) devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and computer systems (including desktop and mobile computers) may use touchscreens for input. Touchscreens allow users to use their finger (or, for example, a stylus) to press a displayed input option (such as an on-screen icon of a virtual keyboard). For example, mobile phones may display a numeric keypad on a touchscreen and a user may enter a phone number by pressing on the touchscreen at positions corresponding to numbers on the displayed numeric keypad. Devices such as PDAs may include a touchscreen with a displayed alpha-numeric keypad to receive text, numbers, etc. for entry of data into electronic appointment calendars, contacts, etc.","While touchscreens provide convenience, they may be challenging to use if the displayed input options are too small for a particular user (this may especially be the case with smaller touchscreens used in portable electronic devices). For example, a user with large fingers or poor hand-eye coordination may have difficulty pressing a specific input option without the user's fingertip overlapping another input option. Because users have different sized fingers and press down with different levels of force (resulting in different contact areas on the touchscreen for different users) it may be difficult to design a touchscreen that is suitable to a variety of users.","Various embodiments of systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for touchscreen input systems are disclosed. Touchscreens may be used to receive user input for a variety of electronic devices. The touchscreens may display a graphical user interface with one or more input options (such as icons) and may detect which input options are selected by a user by detecting a user's contact on the touchscreen. The user's contact with the touchscreen may result in a detectable contact area on the touchscreen. The system may detect a position of the contact area and make one or more biometric measurements of the contact area (e.g., measurements of the size\/shape of the contact area). The position of the contact area may be correlated with the displayed input options to determine which input option the user selected. If the contact area is too large, it may overlap multiple displayed input options and may therefore be difficult to accurately correlate to the input option the user intended to select. If the contact area is overlapping multiple input options, the system may determine a new graphical user interface configuration to increase the size and\/or spacing of the input options. Other reasons for increasing the size and\/or spacing of the input options are also contemplated (e.g., if the user input is being received slowly from the user or if the user is making multiple input mistakes). In some embodiments, one or more of the input options may be removed to increase the space available to increase the size of the other input options. In some embodiments, the system may maintain a history of input option use to determine which input options to remove. In some embodiments, the new graphical user interface configuration may include smaller (and\/or additional) input options (e.g., if the contact areas are detected as consistently within the displayed input options, if the user's input is faster than a specified threshold, if the user is not making multiple input mistakes, etc).","In various embodiments, determining a new graphical user interface configuration may include the system detecting the position of the contact area corresponding to a user's input and making biometric measurements of the contact area to determine a size\/shape of the contact area. In some embodiments, the system may average a history of biometric measurements of at least two past detected contact areas. Determining a second graphical user interface configuration may include determining positions, sizes, and\/or spacings of the input options to better accommodate the detected contact areas.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 12"],"b":["100","107","107","105","103","100","103","103","107","107","107","107","105","105","105","105","100","103","103","100","103","1210","103","105","103"],"i":["a","a ","a","d","a, b, c","a","d","a","k"]},"In various embodiments, touchscreens  may include capacitive touchscreens (including capacitive grid touchscreens), resistive touchscreens, surface acoustic wave touchscreens, and infrared touchscreens. Touchscreens may detect touch by detecting changes in current, sound waves, capacitance, etc. and determining a position corresponding to the change. For example, resistive touchscreens may use multiple conductive layers that form an electronic connection when a user presses on the touchscreen (and correspondingly presses two conductive layers together at a point). Surface acoustic wave touchscreens detect a touch by detecting a resulting change in ultrasonic waves passing over the touchscreen. Capacitive touchscreens may detect changes in the capacitance of a touchscreen resulting from the user's touch. Devices  may use the change in current, etc. to detect a position of a user's touch on the touchscreen .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["103","201","103","201","201","103","201","201","105","100","201","201","100","103","201","103","103"],"i":["a","b","a, b","a,b ","a,b","a ","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["103","201","201","201","105","201","201","201","100","105","100","105","100","201","100","201","100"],"i":["c","d","c ","d "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["103","201","201","105","105","105","105","201","201","100"],"i":["e","f","e","f"]},"In some embodiments, device  may be operable to detect when a user makes a mistake (e.g., presses an input option  that does not correspond to the input option  the user intended to press). Mistakes may be detected through actions taken by the user to correct the mistake (e.g., backspace key, accepting a device-provided correction option such as a correct spelling for a misspelled word, etc). Other mistake determinations may also be used (e.g., device  may predict which inputs are mistakes based on predetermined\/predicted patterns of input). In the example shown in , the device may determine that the user correctly pressed the intended input options  to provide input for the mobile phone number for a new contact. For example, the determination may have been based on the user not having to make corrections to the entered contact information. Conversely, in  and , the user may have needed to backspace to correct the spelling of \u201cJohn\u201d. The backspace may have indicated the presence of one or more errors (e.g., by comparing the corrected \u201cJohn\u201d to the originally entered \u201cJphb\u201d, the device may be able to determine that the user's contact areas for \u201co\u201d and \u201cn\u201d were incorrectly entered by the user as \u201cp\u201d and \u201cb\u201d, respectively. In some embodiments, device  may be able to detect the number of corrections and\/or where the corrections were applied and may use this information in determining the graphical user interface configuration (e.g., by determining which input options  need to be resized).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","107","105","107","105","105","105","105","105","103","105","107","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105"],"i":["b ","a","e ","f ","a ","b ","g ","c"]},"In some embodiments, contact area  corresponding to the user touch and biometric measurements of contact area  (e.g., size\/shape of contact area ) may be detected and used by device  to determine a configuration for graphical user interface . The biometric measurements of contact area  may correspond to the biometric measurements of the user's fingerprint. In some embodiments, the configuration for graphical user interface  may include which input options  are to be displayed, the size of input options , the arrangement of input options , etc. In some embodiments, if device  determines the user's contact area  is too large for the current graphical user interface configuration, device  may provide a new graphical user interface configuration. For example, as displayed in , device  may increase the size of input options  (e.g., see graphical user interface ). In some embodiments, the biometric measurements may also indicate to device  which fingers the user is using for input. For example, device  may store characteristic shapes\/positions for thumb inputs, forefinger inputs, etc., and may compare these characteristic shapes\/positions to the shapes of contact areas  detected. If device  detects the user is using their thumbs for input, device  may propose\/implement a graphical user interface configuration that is easier for thumb inputs (e.g., with larger input options , more space between input options , and\/or with more input options  toward an edge of touchscreen  and fewer toward the center).","In some embodiments, device  may also adjust other aspects of the display to accommodate the new graphical user interface configuration. For example, device  may reduce the size of output display area . Other accommodations may also be made (e.g., less information may be displayed on output display , output display  may be made brighter, may use a larger font, etc). In some embodiments, output display area  may be on a separate screen or may be displayed on the same screen as graphical user interface . In some embodiments, device  may automatically adjust graphical user interface  and other display characteristics. In some embodiments, device  may suggest a different graphical user interface  and\/or display characteristics to a user who may then accept or reject the suggestions. For example, device  may display a new graphical user interface  along with a message such as \u201cKeep new input interface (Y\/N)?\u201d and wait for a user input. In some embodiments, device  may provide a reason for why a new graphical user interface  is being suggested.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","107","105","105","107","100","105","107","105","105","100","105","105","105","100","105","105","100","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","105","201","105","105","100","107","201","105","105","100","105","201"],"i":["c ","c","v ","w ","e ","f ","a ","b ","x ","g ","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"i":["a","b ","d","e ","a ","d ","h","e ","b","i","a ","a ","d ","b ","b ","e"],"b":["107","105","100","105","107","107","105","107","107","105","105","107","105","105","105","701","107","701","107","107","105","107"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["107","105","105","100","105","105","100","100","105","105","105","105","105","107","105","100","105","201","100","105","201","100","105","100","105","107","105","105","105"],"i":["f ","f "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"i":["a ","g ","g ","b ","h ","p ","h ","a","n ","g ","b"],"b":["107","100","107","105","105","105","105","107","105","107","105","107","105","107"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a ","j ","j ","r ","q ","j ","a ","g,h","k ","b","t ","s ","k ","j","m ","c","m.

For example, a default configuration (such as seen in , , and ) may be displayed. In some embodiments, the user may select which input options  should be displayed in the initial graphical user interface .","At , device  may detect contact area  corresponding to a user's input on graphical user interface  (e.g., see contact area on input option ). Information about contact area  may be received by software interacting (or at least listening) to signals from touchscreen . For example, the software may be part of an application programming interface (API) that acts as an interface between the detected signals (from touchscreen ) indicative of contact area  and the operating system. In some embodiments, software objects may be attached to input options  for display and the software objects may interact with the touchscreen signals to detect characteristics about contact area  for adjusting the size\/position of the displayed input option . In some embodiments, device  may detect biometric measurements of contact area  (e.g., size\/shape). For example, contact area  may include an approximate width times an approximate height. In some embodiments, the width and height may be measured in pixels (the size of the pixels may depend on the screen resolution of touchscreen ). Other measurements of contact area  are also contemplated. In some embodiments, device  may measure only one dimension (e.g., the width or height of contact area ) to use in the graphical user interface configuration determination. In some embodiments, the biometric measurements may also indicate to device  which fingers the user is using for input. For example, device  may store characteristic shapes for thumb inputs, forefinger inputs, etc., and may compare these characteristic shapes to the shapes of contact areas  detected to determine if the detected contact areas  have similar shapes as the stored characteristic shapes. Other finger determination algorithms are also contemplated.","At , device  may average a history of at least two past-detected contact areas . For example, device  may average the past n touches to determine average characteristics for contact area  (e.g., n may be 10, 20, 50, 100, etc). N may be a system default value and\/or may be user provided. Device  may be made more sensitive by decreasing the value of n (such that the average characteristics react more rapidly over time). In some embodiments, device  may change the graphical user interface configuration only after a minimum of n touches have occurred since touchscreen device  was activated (or, for example, after a minimum of n touches of recent activity occurring after a delay of greater than t seconds, where t may be a default or user provided value (such as 30 seconds)). Characteristics may include an area calculation of the contact area , the width, height, and\/or radius of the contact area , a characteristic shape of the contact area (e.g., approximately matches a thumbprint, forefinger print, stylus, etc).","By using averaging, device  may adapt to different users. For example, if a different user starts using touchscreen device , device  may adapt the graphical user interface configuration for the different user after the different user has touched device  at least n times. Device  may then adapt back to the original user's graphical user interface configuration after the original user touches touchscreen  at least n subsequent times. Device  may also adapt to different input characteristics from the same user. For example, if the same user begins to have a larger contact area  (e.g., because the user is pressing down with greater force or is using different fingers), device  may adapt the graphical user interface configuration accordingly.","At , device  may determine a second graphical user interface configuration based at least partially on detected contact area . In some embodiments, the second graphical user interface configuration may be determined based on the average contact area. In some embodiments, device  may determine an input option size that will encompass detected contact area  (or average detected contact area). For example, device  may make the area\/size of the input option (herein the \u201cinput option area\u201d)=factor*contact area or input option area=factor*average contact area. The factor may be, for example, 1.2. Other factors are also contemplated (e.g., 1.5, 2, 3, etc.). In some embodiments, the factor may be a default value and\/or may be set by the user. In some embodiments, the factor and\/or other characteristics about the graphical user interface configuration may be used for other applications. For example, the factor and\/or input option spacings may be determined while the user is playing a game, but the same factor and\/or input option spacings may be used during a word processing application. In some embodiments, the factor may be adjusted between applications.","The input option area may be used to determine the configuration of various input options. For example, the height and width for the corresponding area may be determined, for example, according to an equation such as 1.2 w*w=input option area where w is the width and 1.2 w is the height. Other equations are also contemplated (e.g., 5 w*w=input option area). In some embodiments, a factor may be determined and applied directly to only one dimension of input option . For example, a factor may be determined based on contact area  and applied to the width of input option  (and, therefore, in some embodiments, the height may not be adjusted (and vice versa)). Other shapes are also contemplated. For example, pi*r*r=input option area where r is the radius of a circular input option (e.g., input option ).","In some embodiments, the new graphical user interface configuration may include a repositioned input option . For example, device  may use the biometric measurements to determine which fingers are being used. If device  detects the user is using their thumbs for input, device  may propose\/implement a graphical user interface configuration that is easier for thumb inputs (e.g., with larger input options  and\/or with more input options  toward an edge of touchscreen  and fewer toward the center). Device  may also move input options  for other reasons. For example, if a user has mistakenly pressed one input option  when another specific input option  was intended, device  may move the intended input option  to the position the user is anticipating input option  to occupy. For example, if a user presses the down arrow key when the left arrow key was intended (as determined by analyzing how the user corrects his mistake), device  may switch the left arrow key and the down arrow key. In some embodiments, device  may propose new graphical user interface  with the moved input option  and\/or point out new graphical user interface  to the user.","Other considerations may also affect the graphical user interface configuration determination. In some embodiments, device  may be able to detect the number of corrections and\/or where the corrections were applied and may use this information in determining the graphical user interface configuration. For example, if the user is continuously correctly pressing the space bar (e.g., input option ), the new graphical user interface configuration may not increase the size of the space bar (even though, for example, the size of the other input options  may be increased).","Speed of input may be another consideration for determining the new graphical user interface configuration. In some embodiments, if the user input is being received slowly (e.g., less than a threshold of x inputs\/minute, where x is, for example, 70 inputs\/minute), device  may increase the size and\/or spacing of input options  on graphical user interface . Other thresholds are also contemplated (e.g., 30 inputs\/minute, 120 inputs\/minute, etc). The thresholds may be application sensitive. For example, a fast paced gaming application may have a higher threshold (e.g., 200 inputs\/minute) and a contact entry application may have a lower threshold (e.g., 30 inputs\/minute). In some embodiments, device  may adjust the input option size\/spacing based on the detected speed. For example, a faster input speed may result in smaller input options  than a slower input speed. In some embodiments, input options  of graphical user interface  may be shrunk and\/or additional input options  may be included if the input speed is above a threshold (e.g., y inputs\/minute such as 120 inputs\/minute). In some embodiments, device  may consider a number of mistakes detected prior to decreasing the input option size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","1210","1200","1210","1220"]},"In one embodiment, a specialized graphics card or other graphics component may be coupled to the processor(s) .

The one or more imaging devices may include various types of raster-based imaging devices such as an LCD display (liquid crystal display).
