title: Explosive pulse testing of protective specimens
abstract: A transducer is fixedly positioned within a supporting frame, covered by a shield in underlying relation to an enclosure within which explosion pulses are generated for testing purposes. The explosion pulses are profiled during emergence thereof through an aperture in the shield onto a specimen of cellular protective material to be tested by positioning thereof on the transducer. The enclosure is filled with a fluid media such as water to establish a water column corresponding for example to an underwater environment within which such explosion pulses would be generated. The energy of the profiled explosion pulses, not absorbed within the specimen, is measured through the transducer and recorded as a function of time for evaluation of the explosion protective capability of the specimen material being tested.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates generally to the testing of specimens utilized for explosion protective or absorption purposes.","Cellular materials have been utilized to resist being crushed during quasi-static and collision types of loading events. Compression or drop weight testing facilities have been used for load measurements of such cellular materials subject to loading during such events. However, no comparative method of testing of such cellular materials is presently available under extreme loading conditions associated with explosive detonations within air or underwater environments. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for the testing of protective cellular materials, such as foamed plastics and honeycomb metal configurations, so as to provide data with respect to their capabilities and costs for absorbing explosive energy.","Pursuant to some embodiments of the present invention, a sample of the protective cellular material to be tested is prepared as a specimen positioned on top of a calibrated load transducer assembled between a frame supported base and a covering shield. An enclosure containing a water column is positioned on the shield. Explosion pulses generated within the water column enclosure are profiled by emergence through an aperture in the shield before being applied onto the specimen. Some embodiments of the present invention omit a water column, the cellular material specimen being tested by application of profiled air generated pulses. The energy is measured of the profiled explosion pulses transmitted without absorption through the specimen as a function of time. Equivalently expressed, the extent to which the energy of such profiled explosion pulses is absorbed by the specimen is measured by the calibrated load transducer as a function of time. The measurement can be recorded by a readout recorder electrically connected to the load transducer by a transmission cable.","Reference is now made to ,  and , which illustrate an embodiment of an assembled testing apparatus  in accordance with the present invention. Cellular material specimen  is positioned therein as shown in . The inventive testing apparatus  features an outer support frame  within which a base  is fixedly positioned on a bottom support . The base  is spaced below a top cover shield  attached to the frame . The test specimen  is positioned on a load transducer  attached to the base  as shown in , from which a measurement transmission cable  extends out of the testing apparatus  to a diagrammatically illustrated measurement readout recorder . An explosion to be utilized for testing of the specimen  is performed at a fixed standoff distance above the specimen  within a compartment enclosure  enclosing a quantity of water such as a water column  positioned on top of the shield . A central opening aperture  is formed within the shield , through which the specimen  is subjected to the energy of profiled explosion pulses  as diagrammed in , generated by the testing explosion within the compartment enclosure . The enclosure  is shown internally lined with a (e.g., 4-6 mil.) waterproof membrane lining .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["10","12","22","20","14","22","20","14","26","20","12","22","10","12"]},"With reference to , the specimen  is positioned so as to project into a the aperture , formed within the shield , and contact an upper interface material layer  situated in the aperture . The bottom of the specimen  is then in contact with a lower interface material layer  positioned within a central recess  formed in a top tray portion  of the load transducer . The load transducer  has a bottom support portion  attached to the top of the base . The measurement signals are transmitted from the load transducer  through the cable . A plurality of parallel spaced vertical load gauge columns  of the load transducer  extend between and are attached to the support portion  and the tray portion . The load gauge columns  are calibrated to establish transducer measurement of the test explosive profiled pulse energy as a function of time.","Upon the occurrence of a test explosion, a quantity of explosive energy is encountered by specimen . Some of the explosive energy encountered by specimen  is absorbed by the specimen , and some of the explosive energy encountered by specimen  is not absorbed by the specimen . Load transducer  measures loading associated with the portion of explosive energy encountered by specimen  that is not absorbed by specimen  and that concomitantly is transmitted to load transducer . According to typical inventive practice, the amount of encountered explosive energy that is transmitted to load transducer  is commensurate with the amount of encountered explosive energy that is not absorbed by specimen . The higher is the measured loading, the higher is the energy unabsorbed by the specimen , and hence the lower is the energy absorbed by the specimen . The measurement by the load transducer  is thus indicative of the amount of encountered explosive energy that is not absorbed by the specimen  and that accordingly is transmitted by specimen  to load transducer . Furthermore, according to typical inventive practice, the load transducer  is calibrated with respect to a standard corresponding to complete non-absorption of encountered explosive energy by a specimen , the calibration standard thereby corresponding to complete transmission of encountered explosive energy to the load transducer ; therefore, the measurement by load transducer  is not only indicative of the amount of encountered explosive energy that is not absorbed by specimen  (and is transmitted by specimen  to load transducer ), but is also indicative of the amount of encountered explosive energy that is absorbed by specimen .","Based on the foregoing description of the inventive testing apparatus , an embodiment of an inventive measurement method is performed as diagrammed in . Initially the specimen  undergoes a positioning step  for placement within the assembled testing apparatus  between the water column enclosure  and the load transducer , before the step  of applying an explosive testing charge followed by a measurement step . Finally, a specimen loading readout step  is obtained from the load transducer  to determine energy absorption by the specimen  at extreme loading rates associated with the pulses  explosively generated within the enclosure .","Alternatively, the explosive pulses may be generated within air corresponding to an air environment, as distinguished from being generated within water (such as water  contained in enclosure ) corresponding to an underwater environment. Specimens such as the specimen  may be quickly tested with quick turnarounds, and a permanent record may be provided with regard to each specimen by the readout recorder , in this manner determining explosive pulse loading as a function of time with regard to each of plural specimens for comparative purposes.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
