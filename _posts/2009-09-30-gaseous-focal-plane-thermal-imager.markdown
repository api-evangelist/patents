title: Gaseous focal plane thermal imager
abstract: A thermal imager including a cell containing a fluid whose refractive index varies with temperature and, optical components for focusing the infrared image of a scene to be viewed onto the cell to produce local temperature differences across the fluid. The local temperature differences give rise to local refractive index differences. The thermal imager also includes a Schlieren optical system for reading out the local refractive index differences to reproduce the scene.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","This invention relates in general to thermal imagers, and more particularly, to hyper-spectral imagers.","Staring array imagers use a solid semiconductor focal plane surface to generate a television-type thermal image display. The focal plane surfaces are extremely thin and may be subject to permanent thermal shock damage from excessive thermal energy. Since these focal planes are relatively expensive to fabricate, a new type of self-healing focal plane array lower in cost is desirable.","It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a more damage-resistant staring thermal imager than is available in the current art.","This and other objects of the invention are achieved in one aspect by an improved thermal imager. The thermal imager includes a cell containing a fluid whose refractive index varies with temperature, means for focusing the infrared image of a scene to be viewed onto the cell to produce local temperature differences across the fluid which give rise to local refractive index differences, and means for reading out the local refractive index differences to reproduce the scene.","Another aspect of the invention involves an improved method of generating thermal images comprising the steps of providing a cell containing a fluid whose refractive index varies with temperature, focusing the infrared image of a scene to be viewed onto the cell to produce local temperature differences across the fluid, the local temperature differences giving rise to local refractive index differences, and reading out the local refractive index differences to reproduce the scene.","Additional advantages and features will become apparent as the subject invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein.","Referring to the drawing, wherein like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts,  shows a first embodiment of the thermal imager. The optical components of the thermal imager are enclosed in an airtight container  with an IR-transparent window . The container  is either evacuated or filled with a dry non-IR-absorbing gas such as Nitrogen. IR light  from a scene to be viewed enters the window  and is focused by means for focusing, e.g., an LWIR\/MWIR objective lens  onto a thin optical cell , after being reflected off a dichloric (visible\/NIR transmitting, SWIR\/LWIR reflecting) beam splitter . The optical cell  has entrance and exit windows that are LWIR\/MWIR as well as visible\/NIR transparent. The optical cell  contains an IR-absorbing, but optically-transparent fluid, such as the gas Sulfur Hexafluoride, with IR absorption characteristics consistent with the desired IR image wavelength pass-band (and optical\/NIR transparency characteristics consistent with visible\/NIR optical readout). The IR energy from the scene to be viewed that is focused on the fluid in the optical cell  gives rise to local temperature differences across the optical cell corresponding to the focused IR light image of the scene to be viewed. These local temperature differences give rise in turn to local optical refractive index differences. The resulting optical refractive index map in the cell is then read out by means of a Schlieren optical system wherein a parallel beam of visible\/NIR light  is passed through the optical cell  from a point source illuminator  and a collimating mirror , and then focused with a secondary objective mirror , after traversing the beam splitter , onto a visible\/NIR, CCD or CMOS camera focal plane array  which transforms the image of the scene to be viewed into a suitable electronic format for computer or TV presentation. The use of Schlieren optical systems to optically read out a high-resolution thermal refractive index map is well known in the art and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,181,416 to Falk, and in the article R. Aaron Falk, \u201cBackside Thermal Mapping Using Active Laser Probe,\u201d Electronic Device Failure Analysis News, May 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["33","27","29","21","11","13","11","25","33","35","19","25","35","19","33","25","35"]},"In operation, IR light  from the scene to be viewed passes through the IR transparent window  and is focused by means for focusing, e.g., the mirror  on the optical cell . The resulting optical refractive index map is read out by means of light  emitted by the visible or NIR-emitting point source  which is reflected off the mirror , passes through the optical cell , and is intercepted by the visible\/NIR focal plane imager . The focal plane imager  may optionally have a pass-band filter  placed just in front of it, as shown. The purpose of this filter is to pass only the near IR or visible narrowband wavelength emitted by the point source , and to block any other wavelengths, thereby reducing the cost, band-pass, and material requirements of the larger entrance window .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["43","19","11","13","11","15","13","17","43","21","23","43","25","27","29","21","31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["43","19","11","13","11","25","33","35","43","25","35","43","33","39","25","33","43","35","35","41"]},"In both the third and the fourth embodiments, the IR energy from the scene to be viewed that is focused on the Bragg cell gives rise to local temperature differences across the cell corresponding to the focused IR light image of the scene to be viewed. These local temperature differences give rise in turn to local acoustic refractive index differences. The resulting acoustic refractive index map in the cell is then read out by means of the Schlieren optical system. The temperature-induced variation of the acoustic refractive index of a fluid such as air is well known to be roughly a million times greater than the corresponding optical refractive index variation, mainly due to the difference between the speeds of light and sound. Therefore, the third and fourth embodiments produce a greatly enhanced refractive index map to be read out by the Schlieren optical system.","It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
