title: Micropyrolyzer for chemical analysis of liquid and solid samples
abstract: A micropyrolyzer has applications to pyrolysis, heated chemistry, and thermal desorption from liquid or solid samples. The micropyrolyzer can be fabricated from semiconductor materials and metals using standard integrated circuit technologies. The micropyrolyzer enables very small volume samples of less than 3 microliters and high sample heating rates of greater than 20Â° C. per millisecond. A portable analyzer for the field analysis of liquid and solid samples can be realized when the micropyrolyzer is combined with a chemical preconcentrator, chemical separator, and chemical detector. Such a portable analyzer can be used in a variety of government and industrial applications, such as non-proliferation monitoring, chemical and biological warfare detection, industrial process control, water and air quality monitoring, and industrial hygiene.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to a pyrolyzer and use thereof, and more particularly, to a micropyrolyzer capable of pyrolysis, heated chemistry, or thermal desorption of small liquid and solid samples for subsequent gas phase chemical analysis.","Pyrolysis is the rapid decomposition or dissociation by thermal energy of materials into smaller chemical fragments. As a sample preparation and introduction technique, pyrolysis can be performed on a wide variety of samples ranging from aerosols and complex polymers to biological samples. By such rapid heating, solids can be decomposed or dissociated, liquids can be vaporized, and species within a liquid can also be decomposed. In practice, programmed temperatures from 300 to 1000\u00b0 C. are applied to the liquid or solid sample in a short time duration, typically ranging from milliseconds to a few seconds. The gas phase products of the sample pyrolysis are usually introduced or transferred into another device for some type of chemical analysis. These analysis devices can include a gas chromatograph (GC), mass spectrometer (MS), spectrophotometer, or other chemical analysis separator and\/or detector. While these analysis devices are being reduced in size for commercial use, currently available commercial pyrolyzers require large power sources that are not compatible with field use. In addition, conventional pyrolyzers use metal wires or foils for heating, which may be incompatible with some sample materials.","There are several types of instrumentation used to perform pyrolysis, including gas chromatographic inlet, infrared, Curie-point, and resistive pyrolyzers. In gas chromatographic inlet pyrolysis, a liquid sample is introduced into the heated inlet of a commercial gas chromatograph and vaporized for subsequent analysis. In the infrared pyrolysis method, pulsed infrared laser radiation rapidly heats the sample, depending upon the irradiance or energy per unit area focused upon the sample during the pulse. In Curie-point pyrolysis, a magnetic metal foil or wire of particular alloy composition is excited by radio frequency energy. The metal heats until the characteristic Curie-point temperature of the alloy is reached, at which point the metal is no longer magnetic and ceases to heat. Resistive pyrolysis is perhaps the simplest of the common pyrolysis methods, requiring only a metal filament (often platinum) and a capacitive power supply capable of sending a large current rapidly through the filament.","Heated chemistry is used to derivatize (chemically react) an analyte to form a new species that has enhanced properties for analysis in a gas chromatograph or other analysis unit. The new species is often more volatile, or may have more desirable properties for subsequent detection (such as adding chlorine for electron capture detection). The derivative chemistry reactions are often performed in separate glassware, followed by injection into the gas chromatograph for vaporization and analysis.","Thermal desorption is a common technique for recovering (for analysis) volatile and semi-volatile chemical species from solid samples. Examples include gasoline components from soils, phthalates from plastic components, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from many types of solids. Heating is usually limited to an upper limit of about 350\u00b0 C. due to the polymeric gaskets used to connect the heating device to the analytical instrument.","Pyrolysis, heated chemistry, and thermal desorption for chemical analysis have applications both in the standard laboratory and in field use. Applications of interest to the government include non-proliferation monitoring, counter-terrorism and first responder efforts, and chemical and biological warfare agent detection. Applications of interest to industry include efficient industrial process control, emissions control, water and air quality monitoring, food and water safety, agricultural quality control, biomedical diagnostics, and law enforcement activities such as drug and forensic analyses. Additional applications include the analysis and\/or identification of bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and various pathogens and pathogenic activity in both animals and plants for food and water safety, biologically active process monitoring, and industrial hygiene.","Conventional pyrolyzers have several shortcomings for many of these applications. Conventional pyrolyzers can require large power supplies and control units and costly equipment. For example, a commercially available Curie-point pyrolyzer can require tens of Watts of power, occupy over 10,000 cmof space, and weigh nearly 20 kg. In particular, due to increased regulations, cost issues, and public concern, there exists a need for field portable analyzers for on-site contamination detection and remediation, process control, emission monitoring, and other applications.","The micropyrolyzer of the present invention enables the development of a truly portable, self-contained (e.g., battery operated) pyrolysis-based analyzer that is not available with conventional analysis devices. The ability of the micropyrolyzer to be integrated with other on-chip components allows reduced operation, manufacture, and replacement costs; increased flexibility; and increased portability. Furthermore, the micropyrolyzer can be constructed from semiconductor materials, thereby enabling analysis of chemical samples that may be reactive with the metal wire or foil heating elements of conventional pyrolyzers. For pyrolysis, the micropyrolyzer allows smaller samples with lower dead volumes to be heated to higher temperatures, reducing sample consumption and power requirements and providing a wider range of available procedures. For heated chemistry, the micropyrolyzer enables derivatization and vaporization of a small sample to be performed in the same device. For thermal desorption from solids, the micropyrolyzer enables a needed portable field unit.","The present invention is directed to a micropyrolyzer for vaporization or pyrolyzation of a liquid or solid sample, comprising a substrate having a suspended membrane formed thereon, the membrane having a top side facing the substrate for accepting the liquid or solid sample; and a resistive heating element disposed on the membrane such that the sample will be vaporized upon heating of the membrane by the resistive heating element. The micropyrolyzer can be fabricated of semiconductor materials and metals.","The invention is further directed to a method for pyrolyzing a liquid or solid sample for analysis, comprising depositing the sample on the pyrolysis stage of a micropyrolyzer; heating the sample in the micropyrolyzer so as to vaporize the sample; and removing the vaporized product of the sample through an outlet of the micropyrolyzer to a chemical analysis unit. The sample size can be less than 3 microliters and the sample heating rate can be greater than 20\u00b0 C. per millisecond.","The invention is further directed to a portable analyzer for the chemical analysis of a liquid or solid sample, comprising a micropyrolyzer for heating the liquid or solid sample to produce a vapor, a chemical preconcentrator for sorption of the vapor and release of the sorbed vapor, a chemical separator for separating the chemical species of the released vapor, and a chemical detector for analysis of the chemical species in the separated vapor. Alternatively, the vapor can be injected directly into the chemical separator or the chemical detector.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","141","142","143","130","141","141","150","121","121","120","150","121","110","111","111","120","110","121","130","100"],"sup":"3 "},"The micropyrolyzer  can be formed by a fabrication method similar to that for the chemical preconcentrator disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,378 to Manginell and Frye-Mason, which is incorporated herein by reference. This chemical preconcentrator comprises a sorptive material, to selectively sorb one or more chemical species from a gas or vapor over a relatively long time duration, that can be rapidly heated by a resistive heating element to release the sorbed chemical species for detection and analysis in a relatively high concentration and over a relatively short time duration. Unlike the chemical preconcentrator that is used to release a sorbed vapor, the micropyrolyzer  of the present invention is constructed to rapidly pyrolyze a liquid or solid sample  for subsequent analysis of the decomposition, dissociation, or vaporization product. Accordingly, the micropyrolyzer  can accommodate liquid or solid samples  on the pyrolysis stage , and there is no sorptive material disposed on the membrane  to concentrate chemical species from a vapor. However, with the exception of the absence of a sorptive material, the processing steps of material deposition, photolithography, masking, etching, mask stripping and cleaning required to form the micropyrolyzer  are similar to those disclosed by Manginell and Frye-Mason and are generally well-known in the semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry.","The fabrication of the micropyrolyzer  comprises the steps of forming a suspended membrane  on the substrate  and forming a resistive heating element  on the suspended membrane . The substrate  used to form the micropyrolyzer  generally comprises a semiconductor (e.g., silicon or gallium arsenide) or a dielectric (e.g., a glass, quartz, fused silica, a plastic, or a ceramic), with a thickness generally about 400\u2013500 \u03bcm.","The step of forming the suspended membrane  comprises depositing a film on the surface of the substrate  and removing material from the substrate  underneath a portion of the deposited film. This removal can be done using either anisotropic wet etching (e.g., with potassium hydroxide) or by reactive ion etching, or by a combination of both types of etching. The suspended membrane  is typically formed as a rectangle or polygon with lateral dimensions from about one to a few millimeters on a side (e.g., a square of 1\u20133 mm on a side), or alternatively as a circle or ellipse with a size from one to a few millimeters. The suspended membrane  is supported at its edges by attachment to the substrate . The membrane  can be sufficiently thick (generally about 0.5\u20131 \u03bcm total thickness) for robustness as required for handling and to support the resistive heating element  and the sample . Additionally, the membrane  can be sufficiently robust to withstand any stress induced by a mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of the membrane  and the supporting substrate  upon heating to a temperature of over several hundred \u00b0 C. Low-pressure chemically vapor deposited silicon nitride is a preferred membrane material due to its low stress, low thermal conductivity, low heat capacity, and compatibility with IC processing steps. The low thermal conductivity minimizes heat loss to the substrate  and the low heat capacity enables rapid heating of the pyrolysis stage  to elevated temperatures. Other materials such as polycrystalline silicon, silicon oxynitride, and silicon carbide can also be used to form the membrane .","The resistive heating element  generally can comprise one or more circuitous metal traces formed from one or more layers of deposited metals including platinum, molybdenum, titanium, chromium, palladium, gold, and tungsten that can be patterned on the underside of the membrane . Alternatively, the resistive heating element  can be patterned on the top side of the membrane  if the deposited metal is inert to or protected from the liquid or solid sample . To form a platinum resistive heating element , a 15-nm-thick layer of titanium can be deposited on the silicon nitride membrane layer  through a patterned photoresist mask having a circuitous opening therethrough, followed by deposition of a 100-nm-thick layer of platinum. Once the circuitous metal trace for the resistive heating element  has been formed, it can be annealed to relieve stress in the metal trace. If the resistive heating element  is patterned on the bottom side of the membrane , the step of forming the resistive heating element  is preferably performed after depositing the membrane film over the substrate  and before removing the substrate material to from the suspended membrane . This allows the resistive heating element  to be encapsulated in an etch-resistant material (e.g., photoresist) during the step for etching the substrate  and removing the substrate material from underneath the deposited membrane film. The resistive heating element  generally covers about 50% of the area of the suspended membrane  that forms the pyrolysis stage . An optional temperature sensor (not shown) can be located on the membrane  proximate to the resistive heating element  to aid in controlling and measuring the temperature during heating of the pyrolysis stage , with the temperature sensor generally comprising a circuitous metal trace (and in some instances being the resistive heating element itself) which forms a resistive temperature sensor or a thermocouple.","The resistive heating element(s)  can be electrically connected to a power source by a plurality of bond pads  for operation of the micropyrolyzer . The bond pads  can be formed, for example, of a 15-nanometer-thick layer of titanium and a 100-nanometer-thick overlayer of gold. Relatively low electrical input power is required for rapid heating of the pyrolysis stage , due to thermal isolation of the low-heat-capacity suspended membrane . Depending on the particulars of the resistive heating element , electrical circuitry, and the desired heating temperature profile, the typical operating voltage can be in the range of 5\u201320 volts. To provide a more uniform heating of the pyrolysis stage , an optional heat-spreading layer (e.g., comprising 0.5 \u03bcm aluminum or silicon) can be disposed over the resistive heating element  to improve heating uniformity and reduce thermal gradients of the pyrolysis stage  during heating.","The etching of the substrate  can provide a flow channel . The pyrolysis stage  can be fixtured with an attached glass lid  having a plurality of capillary tubes, including sample inlet  for admitting a liquid sample , gas inlet  for providing a carrier gas to the flow channel , and gas outlet  for removing the carrier gas and pyrolyzed sample vapor to a chemical analysis unit. The glass lid  can also have a reagent inlet (not shown) for introduction of chemical reagents to the pyrolysis stage .","The introduction of samples and reagents into the micropyrolyzer  can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including automatic deposition of liquids using microfluidic channels and pumps, front-end vapor and aerosol collection and injection, direct injection of liquid samples using a syringe or other standard inlet device, and manual placement of solid samples. Sample introduction and reagent handling functions can be either integrated into wafer-level fabrication or assembled in hybrid fashion for increased manufacturing flexibility.","For vaporization or pyrolysis applications, a rapid temperature rise of the pyrolysis stage  is preferred. The micropyrolyzer  can be repeatably temperature pulsed and has reproducible power\/temperature response over time, using associated temperature control circuits. Infrared camera measurements of the temperature of an area central to the pyrolysis stage  of the micropyrolyzer  showed reproducibility of the heating temperature with heating rate. The infrared camera measurements demonstrated a temperature ramp from 85 to 290\u00b0 C. in about 60 msec using 250 mW power. Temperature ramps of up to 70\u00b0 C.\/ms have been demonstrated with the micropyrolyzer , with larger bias voltage resulting in faster ramps. The micropyrolyzer  can achieve temperatures of up to 1000\u00b0 C. The micropyrolyzer  can withstand repeated biasing with repeatable temperature response with a 1.5 \u03bcl fatty acid sample load. In addition, a simple bias pattern can be used to combine heated chemistry followed by pyrolysis.","The method of using the micropyrolyzer  to vaporize or pyrolyze a liquid or solid sample  for analysis comprises depositing the sample  on the pyrolysis stage  of the micropyrolyzer , rapidly heating the sample  to form a vapor, and removing the vaporized product through the gas outlet  to a chemical analysis unit. For heated chemistry, a reagent chemical can be introduced to the sample prior to heating.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","100","210","220","230","250","100","150","121","260","200","100","210","220","230","240","230","200"]},"Alternatively, the pyrolysis vapor from the micropyrolyzer  can be injected directly into the chemical separator  without passing through an intervening chemical preconcentrator . This arrangement may be desirable if, for example, the rapid vaporization of the sample  in the micropyrolyzer  alone provides adequate temporal concentration of the chemical species for effective separation in the chemical separator  so that additional preconcentration of the vapor in a chemical preconcentrator  is unnecessary. Alternatively, the vapor from the micropyrolyzer  or chemical preconcentrator  can be injected directly into the chemical detector  without separation of the chemical species in an intervening chemical separator . This arrangement may be desirable if, for example, the chemical detector  can selectively detect the different chemical species in the released vapor so that separation of the chemical species in a chemical separator  is unnecessary.","A microfabricated chemical preconcentrator , suitable for sorption and release of the pyrolysis vapor, has been described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,378 to Manginell and Frye-Mason. The chemical separator  can comprise a gas chromatograph or other vapor separation or transfer unit. A gas chromatograph relies on differential migration through a capillary column to achieve separation of the chemical species in a vapor sample. A microfabricated gas chromatograph, suitable for separation of the released vapor, has been described by Matzke et al., \u201cMicrofabricated Silicon Gas Chromatographic Micro-Channels: Fabrication and Performance\u201d in Proceedings SPIE, Micromachining and Microfabrication Process Technology IV, 262 (1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,068,684 to Overton, which are incorporated herein by reference. The microfabricated gas chromatograph can comprise high-aspect-ratio microchannels etched in a silicon substrate having a stationary phase coating. The chemical detector  can comprise a miniature surface acoustic wave (SAW) detector, mass spectrometer, spectrophotometer, flame ionization detector, thermal conductivity detector, or other detection means. The SAW detector is a gravimetric sensor that responds to the mass of separated species accumulated in a sensing film fabricated on a semiconductor substrate. A miniature SAW detector, suitable for chemical detection of the separated species, has been described by Martin et al., \u201cGas Sensing with Acoustic Devices\u201d in Proc. IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, 423 (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the micropyrolyzer  can be used with a conventional, commercially available GC\/MS and other chemical separators\/detectors.","Experiments were performed to demonstrate the ability of the micropyrolyzer  to facilitate reactions of potential application in the portable analyzer  of the type shown in . Almost any type of liquid or solid sample that can form a vapor is suitable for analysis with the micropyrolyzer  of the present invention, comprising fatty esters, triglycerides, waxes or oils (natural\/synthetic), polyunsaturated fats, fatty alcohols, phenols, dipicolinic acid, other carboxylic acid-containing molecules, alkaloidal narcotics, drugs and their metabolites, and herbicides.","An example is a set of pyrolysis\/methylation reactions that are useful in the detection of bacteria using biological markers such as fatty acids. All cell membranes contain lipids that can be analyzed to create a signature to characterize biological samples and discriminate between bacteria at the class, genera, and sometimes species level. Common methods of fatty acid analysis require sample preparation that is both lengthy and labor intensive, especially for whole cell bacteria, because of their high molecular weight and low volatility. A common solution to this problem has been the use of derivatization reagents to increase the volatility of fatty acids for chemical analysis. The most widely used derivatization reaction converts the fatty acid to a more volatile fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). However, present commercial benchtop and portable analysis units still require tens of minutes for the analysis and large amounts of power for pyrolysis.","The derivatization reaction occurs in two steps and involves both chemical reactions and pyrolysis.  shows one method to create FAMEs comprising mixing the derivatizing reagent tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) with the fatty acid, followed by pyrolysis of the mixture. Other common methylation reagents suitable for use with the micropyrolyzer  include tetramethylammonium acetate, trimethylphenylammonium hydroxide, phenyl-trimethylammonium fluoride, N,N-Dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal, and (m-trifluoro-methylphenyl) trimethylammonium hydroxide. Due to the small sample size, the pyrolysis\/methylation reaction can occur much more rapidly and with lower power with the micropyrolyzer  of the present invention as compared to conventional pyrolyzers. In the micropyrolyzer , the initial chemical reaction of the fatty acid and TMAH can occur in 1\u20135 sec either at ambient or moderately elevated temperatures (50\u2013100\u00b0 C.) to yield a salt of the fatty acid and the derivatizing agent. Pyrolysis can then be achieved in less than 1 sec, typically at a temperature of about 370\u00b0 C. or higher, completing the conversion of the fatty acid to a FAME.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","100","121","110","100","121","110"],"i":["a ","a "]},"A mass spectrometer can be used to identify the separated chemical species. and show the mass spectra matching used to verify the presence and identification of FAME peaks in . shows the mass\/charge spectrum of the (C14:0) peak. shows the mass\/charge spectrum as reported for the (C14:0) methyl ester from a mass spectra library database.
