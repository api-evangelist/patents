title: Petawatt pulsed-power accelerator
abstract: A petawatt pulsed-power accelerator can be driven by various types of electrical-pulse generators, including conventional Marx generators and linear-transformer drivers. The pulsed-power accelerator can be configured to drive an electrical load from one- or two-sides. Various types of loads can be driven; for example, the accelerator can be used to drive a high-current z-pinch load. When driven by slow-pulse generators (e.g., conventional Marx generators), the accelerator comprises an oil section comprising at least one pulse-generator level having a plurality of pulse generators; a water section comprising a pulse-forming circuit for each pulse generator and a level of monolithic triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformers, that have variable impedance profiles, for each pulse-generator level; and a vacuum section comprising triplate magnetically insulated transmission lines that feed an electrical load. When driven by LTD generators or other fast-pulse generators, the need for the pulse-forming circuits in the water section can be eliminated.

DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to pulsed-power technology and, in particular, to a pulsed-power accelerator that can deliver about 10 TW to more than 1000 TW of electrical power to a load. The accelerator architecture can also be used to produce electrical powers of substantially less than 10 TW.","A number of high-current pulsed-power accelerators have been developed by the international pulsed-power community. Many of these accelerators have been optimized to drive z-pinch loads. These z-pinch accelerators have been used for a wide variety of inertial confinement fusion (ICF), radiation physics, equation-of-state, plasma physics, astrophysics, and other high-energy-density-physics (HEDP) experiments.","Presently, the z-pinch driver that operates at the highest electrical power is the Z accelerator, which is located at Sandia National Laboratories. See R. B. Spielman et al., 11IEEE Int. Pulsed Power Conf., IEEE, Piscataway, N.J., p. 709 (1997). The Z accelerator delivers 55 terawatts (TW) of electrical power to the accelerator's vacuum-insulator stack, and 19 megamperes (MA) to a 10-mm-initial-radius 10-mm-length pinch that implodes in 95 nanoseconds (ns). Such a z-pinch radiates 130 TW of x-ray power in a 10-ns pulse. See R. B. Spielman et al., 5, 2105 (1998).","Recent calculations suggest that accelerators with electrical powers in excess of 1000 TW (i.e., in excess of one petawatt) will be required to drive z-pinch implosions that radiate in excess of 1000 TW of x-ray power. Such radiated powers would enable large-diameter ICF-capsule implosion experiments and other HEDP experiments to be conducted over heretofore inaccessible parameter regimes. See W. A. Stygar et al., 72, 026404 (2005).","A number of architectures have been proposed in the literature for the design of future pulsed-power z-pinch drivers. These architectures are described in the following references: C. L. Olson, \u201cInertial confinement fusion: z-pinch\u201d, Chapter 9, -, editor-in-chief: W.

(2005).","These prior pulsed-power accelerator architectures are capable of being scaled to deliver electrical powers in excess of a petawatt. However, the new architecture described below is significantly more efficient, and hence is less expensive, than any of these prior architectures.","The present invention is directed to a pulsed-power accelerator, comprising the following cylindrically concentric sections: (i) An oil section comprising one or more stacked levels of pulse generators. Each pulse-generator level comprises a plurality of pulse generators. Each pulse generator can be, for example, a Marx generator, one or more capacitors, a linear-transformer driver (LTD), a linear inductive voltage adder (IVA), or a dielectric cavity adder. The pulse generators include the initial electrical-energy storage system of the accelerator and each pulse generator generates a forward-going power pulse. (ii) A water section comprising stacked monolithic triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformers. There is one such radial-line transformer for each of the pulse-generator levels. The water section can further comprise an intermediate pulse-forming circuit, between each pulse generator and the associated radial-line transformer, to further increase, shorten, shape or otherwise form the forward-going power pulse. The pulse-forming circuit can comprise one or more intermediate-store capacitors or a Blumlein circuit, with associated output switches, for each pulse generator. For example, the intermediate stores can be pulse charged to a high voltage by a Marx generator. After the intermediate stores are pulse charged, each intermediate store is discharged through the one or more switches to produce an electrical output pulse. The switches can be, for example, gas switches that can be triggered either electrically or by a laser. Alternatively, the switches can be self-break, liquid- or solid-dielectric, or semiconductor switches. On each level, the forward-going power pulses generated by the pulse generators or formed by the intermediate pulse-forming circuits are combined at the input to the triplate radial line. The impedance at the input of the radial line preferably maximizes the transfer of electrical power from the pulse generators or the intermediate pulse-forming circuits to the radial line. The combined pulse propagates in the radial line toward the center of the accelerator in a radially converging manner. The impedance of the radial line increases as the radius decreases. An approximately exponential impedance profile maximizes the power and energy transport efficiency of the radial line. (iii) A vacuum section located at the center of the accelerator comprising stacked triplate vacuum-transmission lines. There is one such stacked triplate vacuum-transmission line for each water-insulated triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformer for delivering the combined radially converging power pulse to an electrical load. The electrical output of each triplate radial-line transformer is connected to the input of one of the triplate vacuum-transmission lines. The impedance at the output of the radial line preferably maximizes the transfer of power from the output of the radial line to the triplate vacuum-transmission line. Each triplate vacuum-transmission line comprises two vacuum-insulators, which are electrically in parallel, and which form the water-vacuum interface, and two magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITLs) that are also electrically in parallel. The vacuum section can further comprise a post-hole vacuum convolute that adds the currents at the outputs of two or more stacked MITLs, and delivers the combined current to the electrical load. The electrical load can be a z-pinch or another electrical load located at the center of the accelerator. The pulsed-power accelerator can be single-sided, to drive the electrical load from one side, or two-sided, to drive the electrical load from two sides.","The petawatt pulsed-power accelerator of the present invention can be driven by various types of electrical-pulse generators. Described herein are specific examples of accelerators driven by conventional slow Marx generators and by fast linear-transformer drivers. The accelerator can have an intermediate pulse-forming circuit between each pulse generator and the associated radial-line transformer to further form the forward-going power pulses generated by the pulse generators before they are combined in the radial line. The pulsed-power accelerator can be used to drive an electrical load from one- or two-sides. General descriptions of these different accelerator embodiments are provided below.","A specific example is provided below of a single-sided Marx-based pulsed-power accelerator that can produce a 100-ns, 500-TW electrical power pulse, which is an order of magnitude greater than the electrical power presently achieved on the Z accelerator. Another example provided below describes a single-sided Marx-based accelerator that can produce a 250-ns, 460-TW electrical power pulse. A third example describes a two-sided Marx-based accelerator that provides two parallel output transmission lines. Such a two-sided accelerator can be used to power two z pinches in a double-pinch-driven hohlraum for ICF capsule implosions, or to power any other load that requires a two-sided drive. The two-sided example described below can produce an approximately 100-ns, 680 TW power pulse. A fourth example provided below describes an LTD-based pulsed-power accelerator that has some advantages over an accelerator driven by Marx generators.","General Description of a Single-Sided Pulsed-Power Accelerator","In  is shown a schematic illustration of an exemplary single-sided pulsed-power accelerator . Like that of many other z-pinch drivers, the pulsed-power accelerator  comprises an oil section , a water section , and a vacuum section . The water section  is located within the oil section , and the vacuum section  lies within the water section . The three sections , , and  preferably have cylindrical geometries, and can be concentric about a symmetry axis  within a cylindrical tank . An insulating oil-water interface  separates the oil section  from the water section . A vacuum-insulator stack  separates the water section  from the vacuum section .","The oil section  comprises at least one pulse-generator level  having a plurality of pulse generators . Additional levels  and  of pulse generators  can be stacked on the bottom level  to provide multiple stacked pulse-generator levels. The outer diameter of the oil section , and the number of pulse-generator levels, can be determined by the desired number of pulse generators , which depends on the desired amount of initial energy storage. The exemplary single-sided accelerator  shown in  comprises three pulse-generator levels , , and . The number of levels can be increased to increase the current delivered to the electrical load.","The pulse generators  are the initial electrical-energy-storage system of the accelerator . Typically, the pulse generator  can be a Marx generator, which comprises a plurality of capacitors that are slow-charged in parallel and discharged in series, thereby generating a high-voltage forward-going power pulse. For example, a Marx generator on the Z accelerator comprises many capacitors that are charged in parallel to about 90 kilovolts in about 90 seconds and discharged in series to provide an approximately 1 microsecond, 5 megavolt forward-going power pulse. Alternatively, the pulse generator  can be one or more capacitors, a pulse transformer, a linear IVA, a dielectric cavity adder, an LTD generator, or other type of generator capable of generating a high-voltage power pulse.","The water section  of the pulsed-power accelerator  comprises an intermediate pulse-forming circuit  for each pulse generator . The pulse-forming circuit  is pulse-charged by the pulse generator  and can increase, shorten, shape, or otherwise form the forward-going power pulse. The pulse-forming circuit  can comprise one or more water-dielectric intermediate-store capacitors  for each pulse generator  and one or more switches  for each intermediate store . The switches  can be, for example, gas switches that are triggered either electrically or by a laser. This type of pulse-forming circuit on the Z accelerator provides an approximately 200 ns forward-going output pulse. Other types of pulse-forming circuits, such as a Blumlein circuit, can also be used. The water section  further comprises one monolithic triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformer  for each pulse-generator level , , or . The water section shown in  has 3 levels of triplate intermediate-store capacitors, a single switch per intermediate store, and 3 levels of monolithic triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformers.","The variable-impedance triplate radial-transmission-line transformers of the present invention are similar to the biplate radial transformer of Petr et al. for generating a high-voltage pulse applicable to particle acceleration. See R. A. Petr et al., 59, 132 (1988), which is incorporated herein by reference. The inner conductor  of each triplate radial line  is a cathode. The outer conductors  of each triplate radial line  are anodes. The radial lines  use a water dielectric and have variable impedance profiles. Preferably, the impedance profile is approximately exponential, and can be chosen to optimize the power and energy transport efficiencies of the accelerator. The anode-cathode (AK) gaps of the triplate radial lines  are shown in  as being independent of radius. However, the actual gaps would vary with radius to provide the desired impedance profile.","In the examples described below, the variable-impedance radial-transmission-line transformers are assumed to have exponential impedance profiles; i.e, that",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["Z","r"]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":["Z","r"]}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"r"}]}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":"=","mi":"constant"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["r ","r"],"i":"J. Acoust. Soc. Am. "},"The intermediate stores are pulse charged by the pulse generators, as the pulse generators erect. When the voltage across the intermediate stores is near its peak value, the switches can be triggered, launching electrical power pulses at the input to the monolithic radial lines. A radially converging power pulse subsequently propagates in the radial line transformers toward the vacuum section, which is located at the center of the accelerator. Therefore, the radial lines combine the outputs of the plurality of pulse generators to produce a single electrical pulse at the vacuum-insulator stack.","The vacuum section  comprises a level of triplate vacuum-transmission lines for each level , , or  of pulse generators . Each triplate vacuum-transmission line comprises two vacuum insulators, which are electrically in parallel, that form the water-vacuum interface, and two MITLs that are also electrically in parallel and form a triplate MITL . Depending on the number of vacuum-transmission line levels and the type of electrical load , the triplate MITLs  can feed a post-hole vacuum convolute  that in turn feeds the load . The convolute  adds the output current of each of the triplate MITLs, and delivers the combined current to the load . The pulsed-power accelerator  can be used with a variety of electrical loads. In particular, the accelerator  can be used as a high-current z-pinch driver.","The vacuum section in the example shown in  comprises a vacuum-insulator stack, 3 triplate MITLs, a triple-post-hole vacuum convolute, and a z-pinch load. The stack and MITLs have 3 levels, to match the 3 triplate radial-line levels in the water section, and the 3 pulse-generator levels in the oil section. The currents at the outputs of the MITLs are added by the triple-post-hole vacuum convolute; the combined current is delivered by the convolute to the z-pinch load. The triple-post-hole convolute is a straightforward extension of the double-post-hole convolute. See R. B. Spielman et al., 7., IEEE, Piscataway, N.J., p. 445 (1989); and T. D. Pointon et al., 8, 4534 (2001).","Advantages of Monolithic Radial-Transmission-Line Impedance Transformers","The large-diameter monolithic radial-transmission-line impedance transformers provide many advantages over prior architectures for high-current z-pinch accelerators.

(30)]. The numerical simulations did not make this assumption, but instead included a 1D model of the transformer and calculated the actual transformer efficiency. The numerical calculations included effects due the exponential impedance profile and, in addition, the water resistivity.","As indicted in Table I, the circuit model assumes that the water resistivity is 3.0 M\u03a9-cm. This is a factor of two higher than the nominal resistivity routinely achieved on the Z accelerator. Presently, the Z accelerator water is processed using resin beds. However, the use of a reverse-osmosis electric-discharge-ionization treatment is expected to routinely provide resistivities on the order of 3.0 M\u03a9-cm, even though the water volume of the higher-power accelerators considered here would be a factor of about 20 greater than it is for Z.","When the water resistivity is 3.0 M\u03a9-cm, the numerical simulations show that the intrinsic power efficiency of the radial-line transformer described above is 82%. This is the efficiency obtained when the transformer is terminated in a matched load. When the water resistivity is assumed to be infinite, the power efficiency increases to 88%. The corresponding energy efficiencies of the transformer are 80% and 86%, respectively.","Once an optimized accelerator circuit was developed for Example A1, this circuit was used to drive two other z-pinch loads, and in this manner Examples A2 and A3 were developed. The pinch geometry for Example A2 was identical to that of A1; however the pinch mass of A2 was chosen to be that which gives a 120-ns implosion time. The pinch of Example A3 had twice the length of Example A1; the mass was chosen to achieve the same implosion time as for Example A1.","The numerical simulations predicted that for these three examples, the peak values (in time) of the power, voltage, and energy at the stack, and the peak pinch current, are as listed in Table I. In  is plotted the time-dependent stack current, pinch current, stack voltage, and stack energy for Example A1. The peak pinch current (before pinch stagnation) is 46 MA, the peak stack voltage is 14 MV, and the electromagnetic energy delivered to the stack by the time the pinch stagnates on axis is 33 MJ. The simulations made the simplifying assumption that electron-flow effects in the MITLs can be modeled according to the model of Struve et al., and that Z=0.5 ohms. See K. W.

The LTD-based architecture described herein differs from previous proposed LTD-based accelerators, since the previous designs assume that each LTD directly drives a long coaxial vacuum MITL. The long MITLs are operated in the self-limited mode, and are combined by a vacuum convolute that in turn drives a radial MITL section. Much of the flow-electron current launched in the long coaxial MITLs is lost at the vacuum convolute. Conversely, according to the present invention, each LTD directly drives a coaxial liquid-dielectric (e.g., oil or water) transmission line, which in turn drives a water-dielectric triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformer, which has an approximately exponential impedance profile. The several stacked levels of radial-line transformers offer a straightforward and efficient method of combining the outputs of several-hundred terawatt-level LTDs to produce a petawatt-level power pulse, which in turn can be used to drive a z-pinch implosion.","A pulsed-power accelerator  that does not use an intermediate pulse-forming circuit is shown in .

Preferably, the fast-pulse generator  comprises an annular LTD pulse generator (as shown), but can also be a fast Marx generator or other pulse generator capable of generating a fast high-voltage power pulse. Additional levels  and  can be stacked on the bottom level . The outer diameter of the oil section , and the number of fast-pulse generator levels , can be determined by the required number of fast-pulse generators .

A combined radially converging power pulse subsequently propagates in the radial lines  toward the vacuum section , which is located at the center of the accelerator . Importantly, the water section  of the accelerator  is completely passive, and does not use pulse-forming circuits, intermediate store-capacitors, or switches, as are used in many conventional pulsed-power accelerator designs.","The vacuum section  comprises the vacuum-insulator stack , a triplate vacuum-transmission line  for each fast-pulse-generator level , a vacuum convolute , and an electrical load  which can be a z pinch. The vacuum section  shown in  has 3 triplate MITLs, to match the 3 triplate radial lines in the water section, and the 3 fast-pulse-generator levels in the oil section. The currents at the outputs of the 3 triplate MITLs can be added by a triple-post-hole convolute; the combined current can then be delivered by the convolute to the electrical load.","The fast LTD-based architecture of the type shown in  offers several advantages over the slower Marx-based architecture of the type shown in ; the most significant are described below. Conventional slow Marx generators (\u02dc1 \u03bcs) require additional pulse-compression circuitry to achieve the fast (<<1 \u03bcs) pulses required to drive z-pinch implosions. The Marx-based architecture shown in  assumes this circuitry consists of intermediate-store capacitors (which also serve as pulse-forming transmission lines) and switches. Present laser-triggered gas switches have a failure rate that would require frequent draining of the water section to replace failed switches. The switches used within the LTDs operate at much lower voltages than the gas switches of a Marx-based accelerator, enabling much longer lifetimes. Further, the LTD switches run on dry air, and do not require sulfur hexafluoride, as do laser-triggered gas switches. Finally, since the LTD switches are electrically triggered, no UV laser-trigger systems are required for an LTD-based accelerator; hence the maintenance, repair, and alignment of these systems is avoided. Consequently, the water-section of the LTD-based accelerator can be completely passive, since it would not contain any switches, and would need to be drained only infrequently, which would facilitate keeping the water resistivity at a high level, thereby increasing the efficiency of the water-section impedance transformers.","Using existing technology, a single LTD cavity that is 3-m in diameter can produce a 100-kV 1-MA (0.1 TW) electrical-power pulse. The full-width-at-half-maximum of the power pulse is about 100 ns. Each such LTD cavity is 20-cm long. When 60 cavities are stacked in series to form a 12-m-long LTD pulse generator, which is also referred to as an LTD \u201cmodule\u201d, the module can produce a 6-TW electrical power pulse. Assuming a center-to-center spacing of LTD modules of 3.3 m, and also assuming that the outer tank diameter is 104 m, 70 LTDs can be fit in each of the 3 levels illustrated in , for a total of 210 LTDs. The total forward-going electrical power and energy launched at the input of the radial-transmission-line impedance transformers of such an LTD-based accelerator is 1260 TW and 126 MJ, respectively. Approximately 1000 TW would arrive at the vacuum insulator stack. Such a power pulse delivers about 60 MA to a 10-mm-diameter 10-mm-length z pinch that implodes in about 90 ns. Such a pinch would radiate about 17 MJ. These estimates are summarized in Table II.","Higher accelerator powers, in excess of 1000 TW, may be required to achieve z-pinch-driven ICF, with thermonuclear yields in excess of 400 MJ. These powers can be achieved by conceptually straightforward upgrades to the example Marx-based and LTD-based accelerator designs described above.","Such upgrades include the following:\n\n","Table I. Accelerator and z-pinch parameters for several Marx-based-accelerator examples. The parameters are compared to those of the present Z accelerator. For Examples A1, A2, and A3, the accelerator architecture is identical; the only difference between these is the design of the z-pinch load. For the Z accelerator and all five higher-current examples, the initial pinch radius is assumed to be 10 mm. The nominal values of the peak pinch implosion velocity and kinetic energy assume a 10:1 pinch-radius convergence ratio.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0122"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Accelerator and pinch","Present Z","Example","Example","Example","Example","Example"]},{"entry":["parameters","accelerator","A1","A2","A3","B","C"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Outer tank diameter r","33 m","104 m","104 m","104 m","104 m","104 m"]},{"entry":["Number of Marx generators","36","300","300","300","300","200"]},{"entry":["n",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Number of capacitors","60","60","60","60","60","60"]},{"entry":"per Marx n"},{"entry":["Capacitance of a single","1.34 \u03bcF","1.34 \u03bcF","1.34 \u03bcF","1.34 \u03bcF","2.68 \u03bcF","1.34 \u03bcF"]},{"entry":"Marx capacitor C"},{"entry":["Initial Marx charge","90 kV","90 kV","90 kV","90 kV","90 kV","90 kV"]},{"entry":"voltage V"},{"entry":["Initial Marx energy","12 MJ","98 MJ","98 MJ","98 MJ","195 MJ","65 MJ"]},{"entry":["E",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Water resistivity","1.5","3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0"]},{"entry":[{},"M\u03a9\/cm","M\u03a9\/cm","M\u03a9\/cm","M\u03a9\/cm","M\u03a9\/cm","M\u03a9\/cm"]},{"entry":["Peak intermediate-store","5 MV","5 MV","5 MV","5 MV","5 MV","5 MV"]},{"entry":"voltage"},{"entry":["E\u03c4","1.05 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["Number of laser-triggered","36","600","600","600","600","400"]},{"entry":["gas switches n",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Nominal charge transferred","120 mC","60 mC","60 mC","60 mC","120 mC","60 mC"]},{"entry":"per laser-triggered gas"},{"entry":"switch"},{"entry":["Number of water-section","4","6","6","6","6","4"]},{"entry":["impedance transformers n",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Insulator-stack radius r","1.7 m","2.7 m","2.7 m","2.7 m","2.7 m","2.7 m"]},{"entry":["Initial inductance of the","13 nH","23 nH","23 nH","23 nH","19 nH","21 nH"]},{"entry":["stack-MITL system L",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Peak electrical power","55 TW","500 TW","500 TW","500 TW","460 TW","340 TW"]},{"entry":["at the stack P",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Peak stack voltage V","3.1 MV","14 MV","14 MV","14 MV","8.7 MV","12 MV"]},{"entry":["E\u03c4","1.10 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10","1.13 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["Peak pinch current I","19 MA","46 MA","53 MA","39 MA","75 MA","39 MA"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Energy delivered","3.3 MJ","33 MJ","40 MJ","30 MJ","66 MJ","23 MJ"]},{"entry":["to the stack at",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":"z-pinch stagnation"},{"entry":["Length of the z-pinch load  ","10 mm","10 mm","10 mm","20 mm","10 mm","10 mm"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Z-pinch mass m","5.9 mg","34 mg","82 mg","54 mg","750 mg","25 mg"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Effective pinch implosion","95 ns","90 ns","120 ns","90 ns","260 ns","90 ns"]},{"entry":"time \u03c4"},{"entry":["Nominal peak pinch","47 cm\/\u03bcs","50 cm\/\u03bcs","37 cm\/\u03bcs","50 cm\/\u03bcs","17 cm\/\u03bcs","50 cm\/\u03bcs"]},{"entry":"implosion velocity"},{"entry":["Nominal peak pinch","0.65 MJ","4.3 MJ","5.7 MJ","5.7 MJ","11 MJ","3.1 MJ"]},{"entry":["kinetic energy",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":["Estimated total radiated","1.6 MJ","10 MJ","14 MJ","14 MJ","28 MJ","7.6 MJ"]},{"entry":["x-ray energy",{},{},{},{},{},"(per side)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Table II.
