GB 1101222.6, filed on Jan. 25, 2011 and GB 1106618.0, filed on Apr. 19, 2011, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Ser. No. 12\/846,580, filed on Jul. 29, 2010, which claims priority to United Kingdom Patent Application Nos. GB 0913258.0, filed on Jul. 29, 2009; GB 0917555.5 filed on Oct. 7, 2009; and GB 1006087.9 filed on Apr. 13, 2010, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application is also related to PCT Patent Application No. PCT\/GB2010\/001443, filed on Jul. 29, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to a sample plate, an automated apparatus, a reagent bead or microsphere dispenser, a method of dispensing reagent beads or microspheres, a kit for performing Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay procedures, a kit for performing nucleic acid probe procedures, a method of manufacturing a sample plate and a computer program executable by the control system of an automated apparatus.","An automated reagent bead or microsphere dispenser for dispensing reagent beads or microspheres into a sample plate is disclosed. The sample plate may be used to carry out diagnostic testing such as Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (\u201cELISA\u201d) procedures or other immunoassay procedures. Alternatively, the sample plate may be used to carry out testing for DNA or RNA sequences.","In one embodiment, immunoassay procedures are used to test biological products. These procedures can exploit the ability of antibodies produced by the body to recognize and combine with specific antigens which may, for example, be associated with foreign bodies such as bacteria or viruses, or with other body products such as hormones. Once a specific antigen-antibody combination has occurred it can be detected using chromogenic, fluorescent or chemiluminescent materials or less preferably by using radioactive substances. Radioactive substances are less preferred due to environmental and safety concerns regarding their handling, storage and disposal. The same principles can be used to detect or determine any materials which can form specific binding pairs, for example using lectins, rheumatoid factor, protein A or nucleic acids as one of the binding partners.","In one embodiment, ELISA is a form of immunoassay procedure used, wherein one member of the binding pair is linked to an insoluble carrier surface (\u201cthe solid phase\u201d) such as a sample vessel, and after reaction the bound pair is detected by use of a further specific binding agent conjugated to an enzyme (\u201cthe conjugate\u201d). The characteristics and choice of solid phases for capture assays, on methods and reagents for coating solid phases with capture components, on the nature and choice of labels, and on methods for labeling components is well known in the arts and may also be applied to assays for other specific binding pairs. An example of a standard textbook is \u201cELISA and Other Solid Phase Immunoassays, Theoretical and Practical Aspects\u201d, Editors D. M. Kemeny & S. J. Challacombe, published by John Wiley, 1988. Such advice.","In one embodiment of ELISA, the solid phase is coated with a member of the binding pair. An aliquot of the specimen to be examined can incubated with the solid coated solid phase and any analyte that may be present is captured onto the solid phase. After washing to remove residual specimen and any interfering materials it may contain, a second binding agent, specific for the analyte and conjugated to an enzyme can be added to the solid phase. During a second incubation any analyte captured onto the solid phase can combine with the conjugate. After a second washing to remove any unbound conjugate, a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme can be added to the solid phase. Any enzyme present can begin converting the substrate to a chromophoric product. After a specified time the amount of product formed may be measured using a spectrophotometer, either directly or after stopping the reaction.","Many variants are known in the art including fluorogenic and luminogenic substrates for ELISA, direct labeling of the second member of the binding pair with a fluorescent or luminescent molecule (in which case the procedure is not called an ELISA but the process steps are very similar) and nucleic acids or other specific pairing agents instead of antibodies as the binding agent. In some embodiments, the assays use fluid samples, e.g. blood, serum, urine, etc., which are aspirated from a sample tube and are then dispensed into a solid phase. Samples may be diluted prior to being dispensed into the solid phase or they may be dispensed into deep well microplates, diluted in situ and then the diluted analyte may be transferred to the functional solid phase.","In one embodiment, the solid phase is a standard sample vessel known as a microplate, which can be stored easily and which may be used with a variety of biological specimens. The microplate can be made from materials including, but not limited to polystyrene, PVC, Perspex or Lucite. In one embodiment, the microplate measures approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length, 3.3 inches (8.5 cm) in width, and 0.55 inches (1.4 cm) in depth. In one embodiment, the microplate is made from polystyrene wherein the polystyrene's enhanced optical clarity assists visual interpretation of the results of a reaction. The polystyrene microplate can also be compact, lightweight and easily washable. In one embodiment, the microplate is sold under the name \u201cMICROTITRE\u201d\u00ae. The microplate can comprise 96 wells (also known as \u201cmicrowells\u201d) which can be symmetrically arranged in an 8\u00d712 array. The microwells can have a maximum volume capacity of approximately 350 \u03bcl. In one embodiment, approximately 10-200 \u03bcl of fluid is dispensed into a microwell. In some arrangements of the microplate the microwells may be arranged in strips of 8 or 12 wells that can be moved and combined in a carrier to give a complete plate having conventional dimensions.","Positive and negative controls can be supplied with microplates, such as with commercial kits, and are used for quality control and to provide a relative cut-off. After reading the processed microplate, the results of the controls can be checked against the manufacturer's validated values to ensure that the analysis has operated correctly and then the value is used to distinguish positive from negative specimens and a cut off value is calculated. Standards can be provided for quantitative assays and used to build a standard curve from which the concentration of analyte in a specimen may be interpolated.","In one embodiment, the ELISA procedure can involve multiple steps including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: pipetting, incubation, washing, transferring microplates between activities, reading and data analysis. One or more of the steps (or \u201cphases\u201d) involved in the ELISA procedures such as sample distribution, dilution, incubation at specific temperatures, washing, enzyme conjugate addition, reagent addition, reaction stopping and the analysis of results, can be automated. For example, the pipette mechanism used to aspirate and dispense fluid samples uses disposable tips which are ejected after being used so as to prevent cross-contamination of patients' samples. Multiple instrumental controls can be in place to ensure that appropriate volumes, times, wavelengths and temperatures are employed, data transfer and analysis is fully validated and monitored. Automated immunoassay apparatus for carrying out ELISA procedures can be used in laboratories of e.g. pharmaceutical companies, veterinary and botanical laboratories, hospitals and universities for in-vitro diagnostic applications such as testing for diseases and infection, and for assisting in the production of new vaccines and drugs.","ELISA kits can comprise microplates having microwells which have been coated with a specific antibody (or antigen). For example, in the case of a hepatitis B antigen diagnostic kit, the kit manufacturer will dispense anti-hepatitis B antibodies which have been suspended in a fluid into the microwells of a microplate. The microplate is then incubated for a period of time, during which time the antibodies adhere to the walls of the microwells up to the fluid fill level (typically about half the maximum fluid capacity of the microwell). The microwells are then washed leaving a microplate having microwells whose walls are uniformly covered with anti-hepatitis B antibodies up to the fluid fill level.","A testing laboratory can receive a number of sample tubes containing, for example, body fluid from a number of patients. A specified amount of fluid can be aspirated out of the sample tube using a pipette mechanism and dispensed into one or more microwells of a microplate that has been previously prepared by the manufacturer, such as discussed above. If it is desired to test a patient for a number of different diseases, fluid from the patient is typically dispensed into a number of separate microplates, wherein each microplate may have been coated by its manufacturer with a different binding agent. Each microplate can then be processed separately to detect the presence of a different disease. This can lead to analysis of several different analytes with a multiplicity of microplates and transfer of aliquots of the same specimen to the different microplates, resulting in large numbers of processing steps and incubators and washing stations that can cope with many microplates virtually simultaneously. In automated systems this instruments may have multiple incubators and complex programming to avoid clashes between microplates with different requirements. For manual operation either several technicians may be needed or the throughput of specimens is slow. It is possible to combine strips of differently coated microwells into a single carrier, add aliquots of a single specimen to the different types of well and then perform the ELISA in this combined microplate. Constraints on assay development, however, can make this combination difficult to achieve and can lead to errors of assignment of result, while manufacture of microplates with several different coatings in different microwells can present difficulties of quality control.","Conventional ELISA techniques have typically concentrated upon performing the same single test upon a plurality of patient samples per microplate or in detecting the presence of one or more of a multiplicity of analytes in those patients without distinguishing which of the possible analytes is actually present. For example, it is commonplace to determine in a single microwell whether a patient has antibodies to HIV 1 or HIV 2, or HIV 1 or 2 antigens, without determining which analyte is present and similarly for HCV antibodies and antigens.","However, a new generation of assays are being developed which enable multiplexing to be performed. Multiplexing enables multiple different tests to be performed simultaneously upon the same patient sample.","In one embodiment, multiplexing provides a microplate comprising 96 sample wells wherein an array of different capture antibodies is disposed in each sample well. The array can comprise an array of 20 nL spots each having a diameter of 350 \u03bcm. The spots can be arranged with a pitch spacing of 650 \u03bcm. Each spot corresponds with a different capture antibody.","Multiplexing enables a greater number of data points and more information per assay to be obtained compared with conventional ELISA techniques wherein each sample plate tests for a single analyte of interest. The ability to be able to combine multiple separate tests into the same assay can lead to considerable time and cost savings. Multiplexing also enables the overall footprint of the automated apparatus to be reduced.","Provided herein is a sample plate and associated automated apparatus which has an improved format and which provides a greater flexibility.","In addition to ELISA procedures, a hybridization probe can be used to test for the presence of DNA or RNA sequences. A hybridization probe typically comprises a fragment of nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, which is used to detect the presence of nucleotide sequences which are complementary to the nucleic acid sequence of the probe. The hybridization probe can hybridize to single-stranded nucleic acid (e.g. DNA or RNA) whose base sequence allows pairing due to complementarity between the hybridization probe and the sample being analyzed. The hybridization probe may be tagged or labeled with a molecular marker such as a radioactive or more preferably a fluorescent molecule. The probes are inactive until hybridization at which point there is a conformational change and the molecule complex becomes active and will then fluoresce (which can be detected under UV light) DNA sequences or RNA transcripts which have a moderate to high sequence similarity to the probe are then detected by visualizing the probe under UV light.","It is desired to provide an improved sample plate for retaining reagent beads, as well as related systems and methods.","Disclosed herein are sample plates comprising one or more sample wells, wherein one or more of the sample wells comprise: (a) a base portion; and (b) one or more recesses provided in the base portion; wherein each of the one or more recesses has a dimension for a bead deposited in the well to be substantially retained or secured within the recess, and the bead forms a substantially fluid-tight circumferential seal with a wall of the base portion which defines the recess.

In some embodiments, the bottom of the bead below a press fit or interference fit line does not come into contact with sample fluid. In some embodiments, in use, a reagent bead forms a substantially fluid-tight seal with either the cylindrical or tapered section of the bore so as to substantially prevent fluid from flowing from the sample well past the reagent bead. A sample plate with inserted reagent beads, according to some embodiments, therefore resembles an empty conventional sample well.","In some embodiments, the reagent beads protrude above the bottom of the sample well. In some embodiments, the reagent beads do not form a moat region around the upper portion of the bead. In some embodiments, the reagent beads do not trap fluid.","In some embodiments, the reagent beads can be arranged so as not to protrude above the bottom of the sample well. In some embodiments, reagent beads are protected and are not susceptible to damage through handling, pipetting or washing.

In some embodiments, a reagent bead may contact the base of the bore.","In some embodiments, the reagent beads can be inserted so that they are flush with the bottom of the well and the sample plate can be used with known automated microplate processing systems requiring only minimal hardware modifications. Furthermore, the sample well according to such an embodiment is essentially a cylinder having proportions which are similar to that of a well of a conventional microplate so the fluid and other handling characteristics of the sample well are well known. Processing steps according to such an embodiment such as pipetting, mixing, washing and incubation follow the same type of fluid characteristics that conventional microplates go through.","The sample plate according can have a fluid capacity of approximately 800 \u03bcl. In some embodiments, in use, only a small fraction of the total fluid capacity of a sample well is required in order to cover all the reagent beads disposed in the base of the sample plate.","In some embodiments, fluid can be dispensed directly into the centre or central region of a sample well and the sample plate may be arranged so that no pockets, recesses or bores for securing reagent beads are arranged in the central region of the sample well. In some embodiments, reagent which coats the reagent beads is not inadvertently washed off the reagent beads by the force of the fluid jet from a wash head or pipette tip.","The sample plate according some embodiments, enables multiple tests to be carried out in a single sample well. This can be achieved by inserting different reagent beads into separate bores in the same sample well thereby enabling multiplexing to be performed. In some embodiments, reagent beads can be pressed into tapered or non-tapered holes in the base of the well as desired which results in a high degree of flexibility and the ability to use the entire sample well with a high efficiency.","In some embodiments, a sample plate can comprise one or more 12 mm diameter sample wells. Each sample well can have a cross sectional surface area of 58 mm2 and in total 54 sample wells of this size can be fitted into a conventional microplate footprint.

The pockets, recesses or bores may be arranged in a circle or two or more concentric circles or other patterns about the central region of the sample well.","According to an embodiment, a sample plate having an array of 9\u00d76 sample wells may be provided. If six pockets, recesses or bores are provided per sample well, then the sample plate can accommodate 324 reagent beads per plate. If 10 pockets, recesses or bores are provided per sample well, then the sample plate can accommodate 540 reagent beads per plate. If 21 pockets, recesses or bores are provided per sample well, then the sample plate can accommodate 1134 reagent beads per plate.","In some embodiments, the sample plate according to the present invention is relatively simple to manufacture compared with other known arrangements. The sample plate can be manufactured by moulding using an open and shut tool so that the manufacturability is high and reliable. The injection mould tool design used to form the sample plates is simple and does not require the use of undercuts or thin features to mould. As a result, the production of sample plates having different formats can be readily achieved. A tool that produces a sample well with six pockets or bores can be readily adapted to produce a sample well having a different number (e.g. 21) of pockets.","In some embodiments, validation of different well designs and formats can be achieved simply since the test protocols can remain essentially the same. In some embodiments, pipetting and incubation do not change and the washing procedure would only requires, at most, a minor alteration to the aspirate routine.","The tapered section or bore can have a taper selected from the group consisting of: (i) <0.5\u00b0; (ii) 0.5\u00b0; (iii) 0.5-1\u00b0; (iv) 1-2\u00b0; (v) 2-4\u00b0; (vi) 4-6\u00b0; (vii) 6-8\u00b0; (viii) 8-10\u00b0; and (ix) >10\u00b0.

Viral proteins, such as HIV or HCV-like particles can be assessed in an exosome, to characterize a viral condition.","The sample plate can be used to detect a biomarker that is used to detect the disease or condition. For example, the detection of a biomarker can be used to detect or provide a diagnosis, prognosis of a disease or condition. For example, the sample plate can comprise a probe for a cancer marker, and used to detect the cancer marker in a sample from an individual. The presence, absence, or level of the cancer marker in the sample can be indicative of cancer in the individual. In another embodiment, the sample plate can also be used to monitor a disease or condition. For example, an increased level of the cancer marker, as compared to a control, or compared to an earlier assay for the cancer marker from the same individual, can be indicative of progression of the cancer. In yet another embodiment, the sample plate can be used to in determine a therapy or course of action for a condition.

According to the embodiment shown in  reagent beads  are loaded into a sample plate from the underneath or rear side of the sample plate. The sample plate comprises a bore or through hole  which according to the embodiment as shown in  is tapered. However, as will be discussed below, it is also contemplated that the bore or through hole may not be tapered and may instead comprise a substantially cylindrical through hole or bore  which has a substantially constant cross-sectional diameter and\/or area and\/or profile.  shows a sample plate according to an embodiment of the present invention wherein reagent beads or microspheres are secured within a cylindrical bore or through hole . The reagent beads or microspheres may be inserted into the cylindrical bore or through hole  either from the top or from the bottom. The reagent beads or microspheres can be secured within the bore or through hole  by an interference fit and the reagent beads or microspheres make a substantially fluid-tight seal around a full circumference of, perimeter of or closed loop around the reagent bead or microsphere.","With regard to the embodiment shown in  and referring back to , bores or through holes  in a sample well may taper from a first diameter at the lowermost part or bottom of the base portion  of the sample well  to a second narrower diameter towards the uppermost part or top of the base portion . The uppermost part or top of the base portion  is that part of the base portion  which comes into contact with sample fluid in use.","At the top of the bore or through hole  immediately below the portion of the base portion  which comes into contact with sample fluid, the bore or through hole  may be shaped so as to form a tight fit with a reagent bead . The uppermost portion of the bore or through hole may comprise a part spherical profile, bulbous region, curved portion or concave region so that a reagent bead  which is inserted into the bore or through hole  from the underneath of the sample plate fits tightly within the part spherical profile, bulbous region, curved portion or concave region at the top of the bore or through hole  as shown in .","According to an embodiment at least a portion of the reagent bead  is arranged to project into the base or bottom of the sample well to form, in effect, part of the base portion of the sample well . As a result, the top portion of the reagent bead  (above the region where the bead forms a fluid-tight circumferential seal with the wall of the through hole) is arranged so as to come into contact with sample fluid in use. The reagent bead  forms a fluid tight seal around the full circumference of the bead  with the part spherical profile, bulbous region, curved portion or concave region of the bore or through hole .","According to an embodiment macro sized beads  are fitted into a sample well  of a sample plate so that only the top or upper portion of the reagent bead  is exposed to fluid. It should be noted that the luminescent reading process is a 2D operation and only takes into account signal from the visible portion of the reagent bead  facing the camera.","According to an embodiment the multiplex well together with reagent beads loaded into the through holes preferably mimics the well established microplate ELISA type of process. The multiplex well according to an embodiment is substantially similar in format to a microplate well.","One of the major factors in processing an ELISA test in a microplate is the efficiency or cleanliness of each step. Any residual fluid from the steps can have an overall effect on the performance of the test e.g. if the conjugate is not completely removed by washing, then residual conjugate will produce a false signal on the bead. This will drive down the sensitivity of the test by increasing the background signal.","One aspect of efficient processing of the test is not to have any fluid traps in the well. Any corners, pockets or undercuts may trap fluid thereby reducing the performance of the sample plate. The sample plate according to an embodiment can allow efficient washing, mixing and aspirating in a similar manner to a conventional microplate well and in some embodiments does not suffer from the problem of trapping fluid.","In some embodiments beads  can be fitted at a uniform height in a sample well  which can ensure that each bead  is treated identically. Each bead  makes a fluid tight sealed fit in the locating detail of a pocket of through hole to ensure that there is no fluid trapped under or below the bead .","The through hole  may comprise a tapered conical hole in which the bead locks into the hole as shown in  or the through hole  may comprise a cylindrical undersized hole into which a bead is mechanically pressed into as shown in . Both embodiments can achieve the goal of preventing fluid going past the bead  and becoming trapped underneath or below the bead .","If the sample plate comprises one or more tapered through holes  as shown in  then the through holes can be manufactured with a high degree of accuracy and consistency to ensure that beads are secured within the sample plate at a uniform height (since the reagent beads  can be pressed into the through holes  with a set force and not to a set height). The alternative embodiment of using undersized cylindrical through holes as shown in  may not need to be manufactured to so such a high degree of accuracy since the reagent beads  can be pressed in to the through holes to a set height and not with a set force.","In some of the embodiments described above reagent beads may be fitted into a blind pocket detail in a sample well i.e. into a closed recess. However, in some embodiments, a sample plate having through holes in the base portion may be provided as shown and described above with reference to .","The assembly of a sample plate which is loaded with reagent beads during production or manufacture can be subjected to a quality control check to ensure that all the beads are sealed to the sample plate. Beads which are loaded into blind pockets as described above can ensure that fluid will not leak out of the well. However, fluid might still leak under the bead and such a leak would be difficult to detect.","According to an embodiment, a sample plate comprising through holes as shown in  can allow a pressure check to be carried out as part of the bead to plate assembly, manufacture and quality control checks. This can ensure that the bead to plate seal is good. A defective bead or damaged hole would show up as a fail in the manufacture and not when the user runs the test.","The sample plate according to the embodiments as shown in  or optionally also in  wherein reagent beads are fitted into the bore from underneath can be particularly advantageous for a number of reasons. Firstly, contact between a press in tool and the bead  is with the bottom or underneath portion of the reagent bead  so any witness mark can also be on the bottom or underneath portion of the reagent bead  i.e. not any portion of the reagent bead  which will come into contact with sample fluid. Secondly, the top of the through hole  in the base portion  of the sample well in the example shown in  can be made to match the profile or shape of the reagent bead  so that no moat portion is formed around the portion of the bead  which protrudes into the base of the sample plate. As a result, the design can minimize or exclude any possibility of trapping fluid below the reagent bead . Thirdly, it can minimize or eliminate cross contamination between beads since the press in tool will only come into contact with the underneath or bottom portion of the reagent beads \u2014the press in tool does not come into contact with the top portion of the reagent beads  (i.e. the portion of the reagent beads  which will come into contact with sample fluid). Fourthly, in the embodiment shown in  reagent beads  can be fitted lower in the base portion without forming a moat region and in a manner which reduces the risk of crosstalk.","According to an embodiment fluid is only arranged to come into contact with the top surface of a reagent bead . According to an embodiment fluid is prevented from passing down a through hole  or recess past a reagent bead  secured within the through hole  or recess.","A sample plate according to an embodiment can be cleaned easily during the process steps without trapping fluid under the reagent beads . The beads  can be provided in a format that makes it as close to a cylindrical well as possible and which can also be easily accessed from the top.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0361","num":"0360"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0362","num":"0361"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIGS. 14A and 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0363","num":"0362"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["57","57","57","57","57"]},"According to an embodiment reagent beads or microspheres are retained or secured, in use, within the through holes and\/or recesses provided in the base portion segments so as to form a substantially fluid-tight circumferential seal with a wall of the base portion segment which defines the through hole and\/or the recess.","The base portion segments A-E may be arranged in a spiral or other staggered arrangement in a similar manner to that shown in . The base portion segments A-E can be arranged at different relative heights to each another so that once reagent beads have been inserted into the open through holes or recesses provided in the base portion segments A-E then there is no direct line of sight between adjacent reagent beads (or any line of sight between adjacent reagent beads is significantly reduced). In the embodiment shown in , base portion segment A is relatively higher than base portion segment B; base portion segment B is relatively higher than base portion segment C; base portion segment C is relatively higher than base portion segment D; and base portion segment D is relatively higher than base portion segment E. Embodiments wherein there is no (or alternatively, a reduced) direct line of sight between reagent beads inserted into through holes and\/or recesses in base portion segments provided within the same sample well (including the embodiment shown and described above with reference to ) can reduce or eliminate crosstalk between reagent beads when the reagent beads are subsequently optically analyzed to determine the intensity of a reaction. According to an embodiment the reagent beads include an indicator which during an analysis step is illuminated by a light source and the intensity of the indicator on a reagent bead is determined by a detector such as a camera to give a measure of the intensity of a reaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0366","num":"0365"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A and 18B","b":["58","59","60","59","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0367","num":"0366"},"figref":["FIGS. 19A and 19B","FIGS. 19A and 19B"],"b":["61","61","62","62"]},"While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.
