{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The inventions were made with government support under Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in inventions.","This disclosure relates generally to electrolyte systems and more particularly to using an alternating current (AC) signal to enhance the sorption and desorption rates of electrodes in the electrolyte systems.","An electrolyte system may use electrodes to remove ions from an electrolyte. The electrolyte may contain positively-charged ions and negatively-charged ions. The electrodes may be charged so that one electrode has a positive charge and another electrode has a negative charge. When the electrodes are charged, the positively-charged ions are sorbed by the negatively-charged electrode, and the negatively-charged ions are sorbed by the positively-charged electrodes. An example electrolyte system is a desalination system, which uses charged electrodes to remove salt (NaCl) from water. When the salt is in the water, the salt may dissolve into positively-charged sodium ions (Na) and negatively-charged chloride ions (Cl). When the electrodes are charged, the positively-charged sodium ions are sorbed by the negatively-charged electrode, and the negatively-charged chloride ions are sorbed by the positively-charged electrode.","The disclosure describes the application of an alternating current (AC) signal to electrodes in an electrolyte system during sorption and\/or desorption of ions from an electrolyte. The electrolyte may be disposed in between a pair of electrodes. In addition, the electrolyte may comprise positively-charged ions and\/or negatively charged ions. The AC signal may be applied to the pair of electrodes, which generates an AC voltage potential between the electrodes. In addition, a DC signal may be applied to the pair of electrodes, which generates a DC voltage potential between the electrodes. When the AC signal and the DC signal are applied to the pair of electrodes, one of the electrodes may be positively charged and the other electrode may be negatively charged. When the pair of electrodes is charged with the AC signal and the DC signal, the positively-charged ions in the electrolyte may move toward the negatively-charged electrode and be sorbed by the negatively-charged electrode. Similarly, the negatively-charged ions may move toward the positively-charged electrode and be sorbed by the positively-charged electrode. When the DC signal is removed from the pair of electrodes, the electrodes are no longer charged and the sorbed ions may be desorbed by the electrodes and diffuse into the electrolyte.","The ions may be sorbed and\/or desorbed by the electrodes without application of the AC signal to the electrodes. When the DC signal is applied to the electrodes without the AC signal being applied, one of the electrodes is positively charged and the other electrode is negatively charged. When the electrodes are charged with the DC signal, positively-charged ions in the electrolyte may diffuse from the electrolyte to the negatively-charged electrode and be sorbed by the negatively-charged electrode. Similarly, negatively-charged ions in the electrolyte may diffuse from the electrolyte to the positively-charged electrode and be sorbed by the positively-charged electrode. When application of the DC signal is removed from the electrodes, the ions may be desorbed by the electrodes and diffuse into the electrolyte.","The rate at which the ions are sorbed may be the sorption rate. The rate at which the ions are desorbed may be the desorption rate. When the AC signal is applied to the electrodes, the sorption and\/or desorption rates may be higher than when the AC signal is not applied to the electrodes. When the electrodes are charged with the DC signal, the ions may accumulate at and\/or near surfaces of the electrodes in order to counterbalance the charges of the electrodes. The electrodes may comprise a porous material and the ions may accumulate in and\/or around the pores of the electrodes. When the electrodes are charged with the AC signal, the ions are subjected to an electric field that alternates in polarity, causing the ions to move in a back and forth manner. When subjected to the alternating electric field, the ions at the surfaces of the electrodes may bounce in and\/or around the pores, causing the ions to move inside the pores faster, resulting in a higher sorption rate than if the ions were not subjected to the alternating electric field. Similarly, when application of the DC signal is removed from the electrodes, but application of the AC signal on the electrodes is maintained, the ions being desorbed by the electrodes may bounce in and\/or around the pores due to the alternating electric field and diffuse from the electrodes into the electrolyte more quickly than when the AC signal is not applied to the electrodes.","The AC signal may be applied to any device or system that includes at least a pair of electrodes for sorption and\/or desorption of ions from an electrolyte. A device that includes the porous electrodes may be a reactor. In one example, the reactor comprises a capacitive deionization reactor. Capacitive deionization may refer to a process of removing salt and\/or minerals from water by applying an electric field in between the pair of electrodes. In another example, the reactor may comprise an electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), which may also be referred to as a supercapacitor, supercondenser, pseudocapacitor, electrochemical double layer capacitor, or ultracapacitor. A DC signal and\/or an AC signal may be applied to the electrodes and generate a DC voltage and\/or an AC voltage between the electrodes. As a result, the electrodes may be positively-charged and negatively-charged. Charge is stored in the electrodes when positively-charged ions in the electrolyte become attracted and move toward the negatively-charged electrode, and negatively-charged ions in the electrolyte are attracted to and move toward the positively-charged electrode. When the electrodes become saturated or close to being saturated with the ions, application of the DC signal may be removed from the electrodes. The charge that is stored in the electrodes may be discharged from the electrodes and may be used to power an electronic device, may be dissipated as heat, or may be discharged to ground.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","102","106","108","106","108","106","110","112","108","106","108","110","112","106","108","110","112","106","108","110","112"]},"The reactor  may further include a channel  disposed in between the electrodes , . The electrolyte may be disposed in the channel . The electrolyte may comprise any substance containing free ions. The free ions may be positively-charged and\/or negatively-charged. The electrolyte may comprise an ionic solution. For example, the electrolyte may comprise an aqueous solution that contains positively-charged sodium ions (Na) and\/or negatively-charged chloride ions (Cl). Alternatively, the electrolyte may comprise a molten or solid state.","The electrolyte system  may further include a power supply  that is in electrical communication with the reactor . The power supply  may supply a DC signal and an AC signal to the reactor . Alternatively, more than one supply  may be used. For example, one power supply may be used to supply the DC signal to the reactor  and a second power supply may be used to supply the AC signal to the reactor . As shown in , a positive terminal  of the power supply  may be connected to one of the electrodes (e.g., the first electrode ), and positively charge the first electrode . In addition, a negative terminal  of the power supply  may be connected to the other electrode (e.g., the second electrode ) and negatively charge the second electrode . When the electrodes ,  are charged with the DC signal and the AC signal from the power supply , positively-charged ions in the channel  may diffuse toward and be sorbed by the negatively-charged second electrode . Similarly, when the electrodes ,  are charged with the DC signal and the AC signal from the power supply , negatively-charged ions in the channel  may diffuse toward and be sorbed by the positively-charged first electrode . By charging the electrodes ,  with the AC signal and the DC signal, the ions may be sorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  faster than if only the DC signal is used to charge the electrodes , .","The AC signal may comprise a peak voltage. In one example, the peak voltage, when combined with the voltage of the DC signal, is less than or equal to a threshold voltage of an electrochemical reaction in the electrolyte. For example, in an aqueous solution, a threshold voltage of approximately or about 1.4 volts may cause electrolysis in the aqueous solution. The combination of the voltage of the DC signal and the highest peak voltage of the AC signal may be less than or equal to the threshold voltage of 1.4 volts. In one example, the DC signal may be approximately or about 1.2 volts and the highest peak voltage of the AC signal may be approximately 100 mV. The combination of the 1.2 volts of the DC signal and the 100 mV highest peak voltage of the AC signal is 1.3 volts, which is less than or equal to the threshold voltage of 1.4 volts.","In addition, the AC signal may or may not include an offset. For example, the AC signal may not be offset, may be offset positively, or may be offset negatively. For example, the AC signal may be centered at 0 volts with equal but opposite peak voltages (e.g., +100 mV and \u2212100 mV). Alternatively, the AC signal may be offset positively. As an example, the AC signal may be offset by 50 mV, having peak voltages at 0 volts and +100 mV. Alternatively, the AC signal may be offset negatively. As an example, the AC signal may be offset by \u221250 mV, and have peak voltages at \u2212100 mV and 0 volts.","In each of the above examples, the highest peak voltage of the AC signal, when combined with the DC voltage of 1.2 volts, is less than or equal to the threshold voltage of 1.4 volts for electrolysis in the aqueous solution. The above examples are non-limiting and the DC signal and the AC signal may have other voltages. In addition, other electrochemical reactions may be caused in other electrolytes by other threshold voltages, and the values of the DC and AC voltages may depend on those threshold voltages.","In other examples, the peak voltage may be greater than the threshold voltage of the electrochemical reaction in the electrolyte. When the peak voltage exceeds the threshold voltage of the electrochemical reaction, the AC signal leads to an increase in the rate of the reaction. In one example, the DC voltage ranges from 0 to 10 volts and the AC peak voltage ranges from 0 to 5 volts. However, the DC and AC voltages may have other values. In one example, the frequency of the AC signal may be in the range from approximately 10 kHz to approximately 1 MHz. However, the AC signal may have other frequencies. In addition, the wave of the AC signal may be a sinusoidal wave, a square wave, a triangle wave, a sawtooth wave, or any other AC waveform that may be superimposed on the DC signal. In addition or alternatively, swept frequency modulation techniques may be used to generate the AC signal.","The frequency of the AC signal may vary. In general, the frequency of the AC signal is a frequency that improves the sorption rate and\/or desorption rate of the electrodes , . For example, a frequency that is too low or too high may have an insignificant or no effect on the sorption rate and\/or desorption rate of the electrodes , . The frequency may depend on many factors not limited to the size of the ions, the valence of the ions, the salinity of the fluid, and the temperature. Lower frequencies may be used for larger sized ions and higher frequencies may be used for smaller sized ions. In one example, the frequency of the AC signal may be in the range from approximately 10 kHz to approximately 1 MHz. However, the AC signal may have other frequencies. In addition, the wave of the AC signal may be a sinusoidal wave, a square wave, a triangle wave, a sawtooth wave, or any other AC waveform that may be superimposed on the DC signal.","The electrolyte system  may further include a charge drainage module . The charge drainage module  may remove charge stored in the electrodes ,  due to sorption of the ions. In one example, the charge drainage module  provides a short circuit between the first electrode  and the second electrode  and the charge from the electrodes ,  is discharged to a ground reference. In another example, the charge drainage module  comprises resistive circuitry and the charge is discharged from the electrodes ,  and dissipated as heat through the resistive circuitry. In other examples, the charge drainage module  may be connected to a different reactor other than reactor , a different electrode or electrodes other than the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode , or a cell of the reactor  or a cell of a different reactor other than a cell comprising the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  (not shown). The charge drainage module  may be configured to drain and\/or recycle charge that was stored in the reactor  or a cell of the reactor . The charge drainage module  may switch between two states or positions to remove the charge. In a first state or position (e.g., an open position) the charge drainage module  may not remove the charge from the electrodes , . In a second state or position (e.g., a closed position), the charge drainage module  may remove the charge from the electrodes , . The charge drainage module  may include a switch that switches between the first state and the second state. The switch may be an electrical switch and be controlled using an electrical control signal. Alternatively, the switch may be a mechanical switch, such as a pushbutton or a lever, and be controlled by applying an external force to the switch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","200","202","202","206","208","206","208","206","210","212","208","206","208","210","212","206","208","210","212","206","208","210","212"]},"The reactor  may further include a channel  disposed in between the electrodes , . An electrolyte may be disposed in the channel . Alternatively or in addition, the electrolyte may pass through the channel .

The spacer layer  may include a hollow portion that comprises the channel . The spacer layer may further include sides that border the hollow portion and that form the side walls of the channel . One or more of the sides may include the input port  and\/or the output port . However, other configurations may be used. For example, the input port  and\/or the output port  may be disposed above or below the sides. The spacer layer may comprise a transparent thermoplastic such as polymethyl methacrylate (i.e., Plexiglas\u00ae). Other materials may be used. In addition, a sealant  may be disposed in between the spacing layer  and the first electrode  and\/or in between the spacing layer  and the second electrode . The sealant  may prevent the electroylte from leaking out of the reactor  when the electrolyte is in the channel . In one example, the sealant  is a gasket sealant. However, other sealants may be used, such as an acrylic sealant, an epoxy sealant, an adhesive sealant, a polyurethane sealant, a rubber sealant, or a silicone sealant.","The reactor  may further include a pair of current collector plates comprising a first current collector plate  and a second current collector plate . The first current collector plate  may be in connection with the first electrode . The second current collector plate  may be in connection with the second electrode .

Similarly, the second current collector plate  may be in connection with the second electrode  at a side of the second electrode  that is opposite the inner surface  of the second electrode . Alternatively, the first current collector plate  may be connected to the first electrode  at other locations of the first electrode , such as the inner surface  or sides of the first electrode  that are adjacent to the inner surface . Likewise, the second current collector plate  may be connected to the second electrode  at other locations of the second electrode , such as the inner surface  or sides of the second electrode  that are adjacent to the inner surface .","When the first current collector plate  is connected to the first electrode , the first current collector plate  may be in electrical communication with the first electrode . Similarly, when the second current collector plate  is connected to the second electrode , the second current collector plate  may be in electrical communication with the second electrode . The first current collector plate  and\/or the second current collector plate  may receive a DC signal and\/or an AC signal and communicate the DC signal and\/or the AC signal to the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode .","The first and second current collector plates ,  may be made of an electrically conductive material or semiconductive material. In one example the first and\/or second current collector plates ,  comprise graphite. However, other materials may be used. The first current collector plate  and\/or the second current collector plate  may provide structure and support to the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode . Alternatively or in addition, the first current collector plate  and\/or the second current collector plate  may provide a better electrical connection with the source of power from which the reactor  is receiving the DC signal and\/or the AC signal than if the power supply is connected directly to the electrodes , . In an alternative capacitive deionization reactor , the first current collector plate  and\/or the second current collector plate  are not included, and the power source may be directly connected to the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode .","The capacitive deionization system  may further include a power supply  that is in electrical communication with the capacitive deionization reactor . The power supply  may supply a DC signal and an AC signal to the capacitive deionization reactor . Alternatively, more than one supply  may be used. For example, one power supply may be used to supply the DC signal to the capacitive deionization reactor  and a second power supply may be used to supply the AC signal to the capacitive deionization reactor . As shown in , a positive terminal  of the power supply  may be connected to one of the electrodes (e.g., electrode ), and positively charge the electrode . In addition, a negative terminal  of the power supply  may be connected to the other electrode (e.g., electrode ) and negatively charge the electrode . When the electrodes ,  are charged with the DC signal and the AC signal from the power supply , positively-charged ions in the channel  may diffuse toward and be sorbed by the negatively-charged electrode . Similarly, when the electrodes ,  are charged with the DC signal and the AC signal from the power supply , negatively-charged ions in the channel  may diffuse toward and be sorbed by the positively-charged electrode . By charging the electrodes ,  with the AC signal and the DC signal, the ions may be sorbed by the electrode  and\/or the electrode  faster than when only the DC signal is used.","The capacitive deionization system  may further include a pump  that is connected to the capacitive deionization reactor . The pump  may be configured to pump liquid into the capacitive deionization reactor  and\/or pump liquid out of the capacitive deionization reactor . For example, the pump  may be configured to pump an ionic solution, such as water containing positively-charged ions (e.g., (Na)), and\/or negatively-charged ions (e.g., (Cl)), into the deionization capacitive reactor . In addition or alternatively, the pump  may be configured to pump a deionized solution out of the capacitive deionization reactor . A deionized solution may be a solution that had free ions that were sorbed by the pair of electrodes , . In addition or alternatively, the pump  may be configured to pump out of the capacitive deionization reactor  a concentrated ionic solution. A concentrated ionic solution may be an ionic solution containing ions that desorbed from the pair of electrodes ,  after application of a DC voltage and\/or an AC voltage was removed from the electrodes , .","The pump  may be connected to the capacitive deionization reactor  using one or more fluid transfer members . The fluid transfer members  may be a flexible or inflexible hose, pipe, or any other tubular member that may transport an ionic solution from the pump  to the capacitive deionization reactor  or from the deionization reactor  to the pump . Fluid transport member may be connected to an output port of the pump  and the input port  and the ionic solution may flow from the pump  to the input port  and flow into the channel . Alternatively or in addition, fluid transport member may be connected to an input port of the pump  and the output port  and the ionic solution may flow out of the channel  and into the pump .","The pump  and\/or the fluid transfer members  may be in electrical communication with a control module . The control module  may determine and\/or set one or more flow rates at which liquid, such as the ionic solution and\/or the deionized solution, may be pumped into the capacitive deionization reactor  and\/or pumped out of the capacitive deionization reactor . The control module  may control the pump  to transfer the liquid at the determined flow rate. In addition, the control module  may be in electrical communication with one or more probes . The probes  may measure or sense the conductivity of the liquid flowing into and\/or out of the capacitive deionization reactor . For example, probe may measure the conductivity of the liquid flowing into the capacitive deionization reactor  and probe may measure the conductivity of the liquid flowing out of the capacitive dionization reactor . Alternatively, only one probe may be used. For example, the capacitive deionization system  may include only probe to measure the conductivity of the liquid flowing into the reactor  or include only probe to measure the conductivity of the liquid flowing out of the reactor .","The control module  may be connected to probe and\/or probe and determine the conductivity of the liquid measured at probe and\/or probe . In addition, the control module  may determine the conductivity measured at probe and\/or probe at set time-intervals and determine the conductivity over time. Based on the conductivity, the control module  may determine the amount of ions that are sorbed, desorbed, sorption rates, and\/or desorption rates. The conductivity of the liquid flowing into and\/or out of the capacitive deionization reactor  may be proportional to the amount of ions that are sorbed and\/or desorbed by the electrodes ,  and\/or the sorption rates and\/or desorption rates at which the ions are being sorbed and\/or desorbed by the electrodes , . For example, when the DC signal and\/or the AC signal is applied to the electrodes ,  and ions are being sorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode , the lower the conductivity that is measured at probe may indicate a higher amount of ions that were sorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  as the ionic solution passes through the channel . Similarly, the greater the conductivity level measured at probe decreases over a time interval, the greater the sorption rate at which the ions are being sorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode . In addition or alternatively, when the application of the DC signal is removed from the electrodes ,  and ions are being desorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  and diffusing into channel , the higher the conductivity measured at probe , the greater the amount of ions that were desorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode . Similarly, the greater the conductivity level measured at probe increases over a time interval, the greater the desorption rate at which the ions are being desorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode .","Alternatively or in addition, the control module  may determine a difference in conductivity measured between probe and probe and\/or a difference in conductivity over a time interval measured between probe and probe . Based on the difference in conductivity measured between probe and probe , the control module may determine the amount of ions that are sorbed and\/or desorbed and\/or sorption rates and\/or desorption rates. The difference in conductivity may be proportional to the sorption and\/or desorption of the ions by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  and\/or the sorption rate and\/or the desorption rate at which the ions are sorbed and\/or desorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode . For example, when the DC signal and\/or the AC signal is applied to the electrodes , , the greater the difference in measured conductivity between probe and (i.e., the lower the conductivity of the liquid flowing out of the capacitive deionization reactor  compared to the conductivity of the liquid flowing into the capacitive deionization reactor ), may indicate a greater sorption of ions by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode . Similarly, a negligible difference or no difference in measured conductivity between probe and may indicate that no electrons are being sorbed by the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  and the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  are fully saturated.","As shown in , the control module  may also be in electrical communication with the power supply . The control module  may be configured to turn off and\/or turn on the DC signal and\/or the AC signal that is generated and output by the power supply . The control module  may determine to turn off and\/or turn on the power supply based on the conductivity, the difference in conductivity, the sorption of ions, the desorption of ions, the sorption rates, and\/or the desorption rates that are determined. The control module  may determine and\/or set a threshold value that is indicative of a threshold sorption amount, a threshold desorption amount, a threshold sorption rate, and\/or a threshold desorption rate. If the determined conductivity, difference in conductivity, sorption of ions, desorption of ions, sorption rate, and\/or desorption rate meets, exceeds or falls below the threshold value, the control module  may be configured to turn on or turn off the power supply . For example, the control module  may determine and\/or set a threshold value that is indicative of a change in conductivity of water flowing out of the capacitive deionization reactor . The change in conductivity may be proportional to a sorption rate. Where the DC signal and the AC signal is applied to the electrodes , , if the conductivity measured at probe meets or exceeds the threshold value, the control module  may determine that the first electrode  and\/or the second electrode  is at a saturation level and turn off the DC signal that is being generated from the power supply . In addition, the control module  may determine to keep on the AC signal even though the DC signal is turned off. Alternatively, the control module  may turn off both the AC signal and the DC signal.","The control module  may also control the pump  based on the threshold value. For example, when the control module  determines that the conductivity measured at probe meets or exceeds the threshold value, the control module  may turn off the liquid that is being pumped out of the pump  and into the capacitive deionization reactor . Alternatively, or in addition, the control module  may determine the location to which the liquid being pumped out of the capacitive deionization reactor  is being pumped. For example, where the DC signal and\/or the AC signal is being applied to the electrodes , , the control module  may direct the deionized solution (i.e., the solution where the ions are being sorbed by the electrodes , ) to be pumped into a first chamber or reservoir in the pump . Alternatively, the first chamber may be located external to the pump  or external to the capacitive deionization system . Where application of the DC signal is removed from the electrodes , , the control module may direct the concentrated solution (i.e., the solution where the ions are desorbed by the electrons and diffused into the solution) into a second chamber or reservoir in the pump . Alternatively, the second chamber may be located external to the pump  or external to the capacitive deionization system . In addition, the control module  may determine whether all or less than all of the concentrated solution has been pumped out of the capacitive deionization reactor . The control module  may communicate with the power supply  to turn on the DC power supply after determining that all or less than all of the concentrated solution has been pumped out of the capacitive deionization reactor . Alternatively or in addition, the control module may activate the pump  to pump the ionic solution from the pump  to the capacitive deionization reactor  after determining that all or less than all of the concentrated solution has been pumped out of the capacitive deionization reactor .","The capacitive deionization system  may further include a charge drainage module . The charge drainage module  may remove charge stored in the electrodes ,  due to sorption of the ions. In one example, the charge drainage module  provides a short circuit between the first electrode  and the second electrode  and the charge from the electrodes ,  is discharged to a ground reference. In another example, the charge drainage module  comprises resistive circuitry and the charge is discharged from the electrodes ,  and dissipated as heat through the resistive circuitry. The charge drainage module  may switch between two states or positions to remove the charge. In a first state or position (e.g., an open position) the charge drainage module  may not remove the charge from the electrodes , . In a second state or position (e.g., a closed position), the charge drainage module  may remove the charge from the electrodes , . The charge drainage module  may include a switch that switches between the first state and the second state. Other configurations that remove the charge stored in the electrodes ,  may be used. To remove the charge from the electrodes , , the charge drainage module  may be in electrical communication with the pair of electrodes , . In addition, the charge drainage module  may be in electrical communication with the control module . The control module  may control operation of the charge drainage module. For example, the control module  may send a first signal to the charge drainage module  that configures the charge drainage module  in the first (e.g., open) position such that the charge may not be discharged from the electrodes , . In addition, the control module  may send a second signal to the charge drainage module  that configures the charge drainage module  in the second (e.g., closed) position such that the charge may be discharged from the electrodes , .","The control module  may send the second signal after the control module determines that a measured conductivity has met or exceeded the threshold value. For example, when the DC signal and\/or the AC signal is being applied to the electrodes , , the charge drainage module  may be in the first position and the charge may be stored in the electrodes , . After the control module  determines that a measured conductivity has met or exceeded the threshold value, the control module  may send the second signal to the charge drainage module  and the charge may be discharged from the electrodes , . The control module may send the second signal after the control module  communicates with the power supply  to turn off the DC signal. In addition or alternatively, the control module  may send the first signal to the charge drainage module  after the concentrated solution is pumped out of the capacitive deionization reactor .","Although only one control module  is described with reference to , an alternative capacitive deionization system  may include more than one control module. For example, one or more control modules may be electrical communication with the pump , one or more control modules may be in communication with the probes , one or more control modules may be in communication with the power supply , and\/or one or more control modulates may be in communication with the charge drainage module . Alternatively or in addition, the one or more control modules may include or be in electrical communication with one or more processors in communication with one or more memory devices. The one or more processors in communication with the one or more memory devices may process and\/or store information that is used or received by the one or more control modules.","The capacitive deionization system  shown in  includes a capacitive deionization reactor  that comprises a single cell, where a single cell refers to a reactor having a single pair of electrodes. In alternative capacitive deionization systems, the capacitive deionization reactor  may include a cell that has more than two electrodes. The polarities of successive electrodes may alternate when the DC signal and\/or the AC signal is applied to the electrodes. For example, if the cell of the capacitive deionization reactor includes four electrodes, the first and third electrodes comprise one polarity (e.g., a positive polarity) and the second and fourth electrodes comprise another polarity (e.g., a negative polarity). Alternatively, the capacitive deionization system may include more than one cell. The ionic solution may be pumped through several cells before being sent to an end destination. The capacitive deionization system may comprise a large-scale system, such as a desalination plant or a desalination system used on a seagoing ship or a submarine. The large-scale desalination plant or system may include at least one power source that generates one or more AC signals and supplies the AC signals to the electrodes in the desalination plant or system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","200","305"]},"At block , the pair of electrodes may be subjected to the electrolyte. The electrodes may be subjected to the electrolyte by injecting the electrolyte into a channel that is disposed in between the pair of electrodes. At block , application of the DC signal from the pair of electrodes may be removed while application of the AC signal to the pair of electrodes may be maintained if a threshold value is met. The threshold value may be indicative of an amount of ions sorbed by electrodes. Alternatively, the threshold value may be indicative of a sorption rate of the ions being sorbed by the electrodes.

Lowering the peak-to-peak voltage may diminish the improvement in sorption and\/or desorption rates. For example, decreasing the peak-to-peak voltage to \u221210 mV to +10 mV may improve the sorption rate by 33% and may improve the desorption rate by 84%.","In addition, application of the AC signal may improve the capacity of the electrodes to sorb the ions. The improved capacity may be determined by measuring the conductivity of the aqueous solution flowing out of the capacitive deionization reactor at steady state (i.e., a state in which a drop in conductivity occurs when equilibrium has been reached and the charge of the electrodes is counterbalanced by the ions). For example, when the AC signal is applied, the measured conductivity of the aqueous solution flowing out of the capacitive deionization reactor  at steady state may increase as compared to when only the DC signal is applied. In one example, when the AC signal is applied, the drop in conductivity at steady state may improve by 78%.","Various embodiments described herein can be used alone or in combination with one another.
