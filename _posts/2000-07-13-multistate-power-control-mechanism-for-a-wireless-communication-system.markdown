title: Multi-state power control mechanism for a wireless communication system
abstract: A power control mechanism having a number of states and suitable for used in a communication system in which data transmissions are not continuous (i.e., bursty in nature). In one embodiment, a power control unit includes a data processor, a state machine, and a threshold adjustment element. The data processor receives and processes an input signal to provide status of data frames received from the input signal for a particular data transmission. The state machine receives the frame status and provides a current state for the power control unit. The current state is indicative of a status of a particular communication session that includes the data transmission, and is one of a number of possible states. The threshold adjustment element receives the frame status and the current state and adjusts a power control setpoint in response thereto. The setpoint is used to control the signal quality of the input signal and is adjusted in accordance with a particular adjustment scheme (i.e., a particular set of “rules”) selected from a number of possible adjustment schemes. Each possible adjustment scheme is associated with a respective possible state and defines a particular set of rules for adjusting the setpoint.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to data communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved multi-state power control mechanism for use in a wireless communication system.","II. Description of the Related Art","A modern day communication system is required to support a variety of applications. One such communication system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system that supports voice and data communication between users over a terrestrial link. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM.\u201d Another CDMA system is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d filed Nov. 3, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, issued Jun 3, 2003 to Padovani et al., (hereinafter referred to as the HDR system). These patents and patent application are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.","CDMA systems are typically designed to conform to one or more standards. Such standards include the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95-B Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System\u201d (the IS-95 standard), the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-98 Recommended Minimum Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Mobile Station\u201d (the IS-98 standard), the standard offered by a consortium named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP) and embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), and the \u201cTR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems\u201d (the cdma2000 standard). New CDMA standards are continually proposed and adopted for use. These CDMA standards are incorporated herein by reference.","In a CDMA system, communication between users is conducted via one or more base stations. A first user on one remote terminal (e.g., a cellular phone) communicates with a second user on a second remote terminal by transmitting data on the reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and may route the data to another base station. The data is transmitted on the forward link of the same base station, or a second base station, to the second remote terminal. The forward link refers to transmission from the base station to a remote terminal and the reverse link refers to transmission from the remote terminal to a base station. In CDMA systems, the forward and reverse links are typically allocated different frequencies.","On the reverse link, each transmitting remote terminal acts as interference to other active remote terminals in the network. The reverse link capacity is thus limited by the total interference that each remote terminal experiences from other transmitting remote terminals.","To reduce interference and increase the reverse link capacity, the transmit power of each remote terminal in the IS-95 system is controlled by two power control loops. The first power control loop adjusts the transmit power of the remote terminal such that the signal quality, as measured by the energy-per-bit-to-noise-plus-interference ratio, E\/(N+I) of the signal received at the base station is maintained at a particular threshold or level. This level is referred to as the power control setpoint (or simply, the setpoint). The second power control loop adjusts the setpoint such that a desired level of performance, as measured by the frame-error-rate (FER), is maintained.","A power control mechanism for the reverse link is disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,056,109 and 5,265,119, both entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING TRANSMISSION POWER IN A CDMA CELLULAR MOBILE TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated by reference herein.","In some CDMA systems, such as the HDR system, data transmission from the remote terminal may not be continuous (i.e., bursty). In particular, the data transmission may be characterized by bursts of data transmission separated by periods of silence (i.e., no transmission). During the silence periods, no data transmission is available to adjust the setpoint. However, the operating conditions of the remote terminal may have changed (e.g., due to movement of the remote terminal). Thus, the transmit power level last used by the remote terminal may not be sufficient to achieve an error-free transmission when data transmission restarts.","As can be seen, techniques that can be used to adjust the transmit power level of a remote terminal in a communication session characterized by non-continuous data transmission are highly desirable.","The present invention provides a power control mechanism having a number of states and suitable for use in a communication system in which data transmissions are not continuous (i.e., bursty in nature). Each state is indicative of the status of a particular communication session between a remote terminal and a base station. The status may indicate, for example, whether or not the remote terminal is active, whether the remote terminal has been transmitting for a while or has just started transmitting after a period of inactivity, and so on. Each state is also associated with a particular set of \u201crules\u201d for adjusting the power control mechanism.","An embodiment of the invention provides a power control unit for use in a wireless communication system. The power control unit includes a data processor, a state machine, and a threshold adjustment element. The data processor receives and processes an input signal to provide status of received data frames. The state machine receives the frame status and provides a current state for the power control unit. The current state is indicative of a status of a particular communication session that includes the data transmission, and is one of a number of possible states for the power control unit. The threshold adjustment element receives the frame status and the current state and adjusts a power control setpoint (or simply, the setpoint) in response thereto. The setpoint is used to control the transmit power of a remote terminal and is adjusted in accordance with a particular adjustment scheme selected from a number of possible adjustment schemes. Each possible adjustment scheme is associated with a respective possible state and defines a particular set of rules for adjusting the setpoint.","In one specific implementation, the possible states include an inactive state, a no data state, a data start state, and a normal state. In this implementation, each frame status indicates a receipt of a good frame, a bad frame, or no received frame for the frame period. For this implementation, the power control unit can transition among the possible states as follows: (1) from the inactive state to the no data state upon receipt of an indication that at least one base station is involved in the communication session, (2) from the no data state to the data start state upon receipt of a good frame, (3) from either the no data state or the data start state to the normal state upon receipt of a bad frame, (4) from the normal state back to the no data state if no data frames are received for a particular time period, and (5) from any state to the inactive state upon receipt of an indication that no base stations are currently active. The next state can thus be defined based, in part, on the received frame status and the current state.","In the normal state, the setpoint can be decreased by a first delta value (\u0394D) upon receipt of a good frame and increased by a second delta value (\u0394U) upon receipt of a bad frame, with the magnitude of \u0394Ubeing greater than that of \u0394D. Successive increases in the setpoint can be performed if a particular time period has elapsed. In the no data state, the setpoint can be increased by a third delta value (\u0394U) upon receipt of a frame status indicating no received frame, with the total adjustment in the setpoint being limited to a particular maximum delta value (\u0394U). In the data start state, the setpoint can be decreased by a fourth delta value (\u0394D) upon receipt of a good frame, with the magnitude of \u0394Dbeing greater than that of \u0394D.","If a number of frames are received for a particular transmitted frame (e.g., for soft-handoff), the frame status for this transmitted frame can be declared as bad if all received frames are determined to be bad, and can be declared as good if at least one received frame is determined to be good.","The power control unit can be operated to adjust the transmit power level of a reverse link data transmission from a remote terminal to a base station in a CDMA system (e.g., the HDR system). For some CDMA systems, the communication session may be characterized by bursts of data transmission separated by periods of no transmission (i.e., a non-continuous data transmission). The setpoint can be adjusted in a manner to achieve a particular target frame error rate (FER) for the received frames.","The invention further provides methods, base station modules, and other elements that implement various aspects and features of the invention, as described in further detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","104","106","106","104","104","106","106","106","106","104","106","106","106"],"i":["a ","a","b","c","d","b ","d","e","f. "]},"In system , a system controller  couples to base stations  and may further couple to a public switched telephone network (PSTN). System controller  provides coordination and control for the various base stations coupled to it. System controller  further controls the routing of telephone calls among remote terminals , and between remote terminals  and the PSTN (e.g., conventional telephones), via base stations . For a CDMA system, system controller  is also referred to as a base station controller (BSC).","System  may be designed to support one or more CDMA standards such as the IS-95 standard, the W-CDMA standard, the cdma2000 standard, or some other standard. Alternatively or additionally, system  may be designed to conform to a particular CDMA implementation such as the HDR design described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211.","For the HDR system, the communication between a particular remote terminal and one or more base stations is typically non-continuous. The remote terminal typically only transmits data to and\/or receives data from the base station(s) for certain particular time periods. At remaining time periods, the remote terminal is \u201cinactive\u201d and may only be receiving the pilot signal(s) from the base station(s).","As noted above, on the reverse link, the transmission from each remote terminal acts as interference to other active remote terminals and thus affects the performance of these remote terminals. To improve the performance of the remote terminals and to increase system capacity, the transmit power of each remote terminal is controlled to be as low as possible to reduce the amount of interference while still maintaining a particular level of performance for the transmitting remote terminal. If the received signal quality at the base station is too poor, the likelihood of decoding the received frame correctly decreases and performance may be compromised (e.g., higher FER). On the other hand, if the received signal quality is too high, the transmit power level is also likely to too high and the amount of interference to other remote terminals increases, which can degrade the performance of the other remote terminals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","220"]},"Inner loop  is a (relatively) fast loop that attempts to maintain the signal quality received at the base station for the remote terminal as close as possible to a particular power control setpoint. As shown in , inner loop  operates between the remote terminal and base station. The power adjustment for inner loop  is typically achieved by measuring the quality of the received signal at the base station (block ), comparing the measured signal quality against the setpoint (block ), and sending a power control command to the remote terminal. The power control command directs the remote terminal to adjust its transmit power and may be implemented, for example, as either an \u201cUP\u201d command to direct an increase in the transmit power at the remote terminal or a \u201cDOWN\u201d command to direct a decrease in the transmit power. The remote terminal then adjusts its transmit power level accordingly (block ) each time it receives the power control command. For the HDR system, the power control command may be sent as often as 600 times per second for some CDMA systems, thus providing a relatively fast response time for inner loop .","Due to path loss in the communication channel (block ) that typically varies over time, especially for a mobile remote terminal, the received signal quality at the base station continually fluctuates. Inner loop  thus attempts to maintain the received signal quality at or near the setpoint in the presence of changes in the channel.","Outer loop  is a (relatively) slower loop that continually adjusts the setpoint such that a particular level of performance is achieved for the remote terminal on the reverse link. The desired level of performance is typically a particular target frame error rate (FER), which is 1% for some CDMA systems, although some other performance target can also be used.","For outer loop , the signal from the remote terminal is received and processed to recover the transmitted frames and the status of the received frames are then determined (block ). For each received frame, a determination is made whether the frame is good (i.e., received correctly) or bad (i.e., received in error). Based on the status of the received frame (either good or bad), the setpoint is adjusted accordingly (block ). Typically, if a frame is received correctly, the received signal quality from the remote terminal is likely to be higher than necessary. The setpoint is thus reduced slightly, which may cause inner loop  to reduce the remote terminal's transmit power level. Alternatively, if a frame is received in error, the received signal quality from the remote terminal is likely to be lower than necessary. The setpoint is thus increased, which may cause inner loop  to increase the remote terminal's transmit power level.","The setpoint can be adjusted for each frame period. The frame status can also be accumulated for N received frames and used to adjust the setpoint every Nframe period, where N can be any integer greater than one. Since inner loop  is typically adjusted many times each frame period, inner loop  has a faster response time than for outer loop .","By controlling the manner in which the setpoint is adjusted, different power control characteristics and system performance can be obtained. For example, the received FER can be adjusted by changing the amount of upward adjustment in the setpoint for a bad frame, the amount of downward adjustment for a good frame, the required elapsed time between successive increases in the setpoint, and so on. In an implementation, a target FER for each state can be set as (\u0394Down\/(\u0394Down+\u0394Up)).","For a system in which data transmission occurs continuously (over the time period of interest), the inner and outer loops can be continually operated in accordance with a particular design to achieve the desired results. However, when the data transmission occurs in bursts, continuous operation of the power control mechanism based on a single set of rules may not provide the desired results.","In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the power control mechanism is designed to operate with a number of states. Each state is indicative of the status of the communication session between the remote terminal and the base station (e.g., whether or not the remote terminal is active, whether the remote terminal has been transmitting for a while or has just started transmitting after a period of silence, and so on). Each state can also be associated with a particular set of \u201crules\u201d for adjusting the inner and\/or outer loop. In the specific embodiment shown in , the state of the power control mechanism is maintained by a power control state machine  that directs the operation of outer loop .

Upon registration by the remote terminal with a particular base station, the power control mechanism can transition from Inactive state  to No Data state . The power control mechanism then remains in No Data state  until a frame is received from the remote terminal. If the received frame is good, the power control mechanism transitions to Data Start state . Otherwise, if the received frame is bad, the power control mechanism transitions to Normal state .","While in the No Data state, the setpoint is increased slowly (e.g., up to 0.5 dB for each frame, up to a particular total limit). The higher setpoint provides additional margin if a remote terminal is in a region of poor coverage when it starts transmitting. Thus, in the Data Start state, it is desirable to reduce the setpoint quickly, and this is achieved by using a \u0394Din the Data Start state having a larger magnitude than that of the \u0394Din the Normal state. If a bad packet is received, the additional margin is no longer present and the power control mechanism therefore switches to the Normal state.","The power control mechanism remains in Data Start state  until a bad frame is received from the remote terminal or if no data is received within a first particular period of time. Upon receipt of a bad frame, the power control mechanism transitions from Data Start state  to Normal state . And if no data is received within a particular period of time, the power control mechanism transitions to No Data state .","The power control mechanism remains in Normal state  for the duration of the data transmission. If no data is received within a particular period of time, indicating inactivity by the remote terminal, the power control mechanism transitions to No Data state .","If the remote terminal loses or terminates its connection for any reason while in the Normal, No Data, or Data Start state, the power control mechanism transitions back to Inactive state .","As shown in , the transitions between the states are triggered by the occurrence of some defined events. Some of these events and their brief descriptions are provided below.","HandoffInfo (Sectors): A hand-off event occurs whenever the hand-off state of the remote terminal changes. Specifically, a hand-off event occurs if a base station is added or removed from the active set of the remote terminal. The parameter \u201cSectors\u201d contains information about the sectors (i.e., the base stations) with which the remote terminal is currently in communication. If the number of sectors is zero, indicating that the remote terminal is not in communication with any base station, then the power control mechanism transitions to the Inactive state.","GoodFrame: This event indicates the receipt of a good frame on the reverse traffic channel. BadFrame: This event indicates the receipt of a bad frame on the reverse traffic channel.","For CDMA systems, such as the HDR system, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) encoding is performed at the transmitting unit (e.g., the remote terminal) for each frame and the CRC bits are appended to the frame. At the receiving unit (e.g., the base station), CRC encoding can be performed on the received frame and the generated CRC bits can be compared against the received CRC bits. Typically, the frame is declared \u201cgood\u201d if the generated and received CRC bits match and \u201cbad\u201d if the CRC bits do not match.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00055","num":"00055"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the operation of the power control mechanism is dependent on the current state in which it resides. The general operation of the power control mechanism in each of the states for a specific embodiment of the invention can be briefly described as follows:","Inactive: In this state, the remote terminal is dormant and thus no power control is performed.","Normal: In this state, the remote terminal is sending data frequently enough such that the No Data state is not entered. The setpoint is adjusted based on the decoding status of the received frames. For each good frame received, the setpoint is lowered by a particular (small) decrement delta (\u0394D). If a bad frame is received, the setpoint is increased by a particular (larger) increment delta (\u0394U). The larger setpoint increases allow for adaptation to rapid deterioration in the air-link condition.","No Data: This state is entered when the remote terminal stops transmitting for a particular time period (e.g., 0.5 seconds). In this state, feedback is not available from the remote terminal to control its transmit power level. In an embodiment, the setpoint is slowly increased while the power control mechanism is in this state. This slow increase in the setpoint can compensate for possible degradation in the air-link during the period of no transmission. If the air-link degradation does occur, the higher setpoint would increase the likelihood of successfully decoding a received packet when the remote terminal starts transmitting.","Data Start: This state is entered when a good frame is received from the remote terminal while in the No Data state. In this state, the setpoint is lowered more than in the Normal state for each good frame received. This larger decrease in the setpoint allows the power control mechanism to offset (undo) the extra increase in the setpoint while in the No Data state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00061","num":"00061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sub":["1","2","30"]},"For each frame period, a frame may be received and decoded as either good (G) or bad (B), or may not be received at all (N). The status of the received frame (G, B, or N) for each frame period is provided above the horizontal axis.  shows a specific sequence of frame status, which is used to describe the operation of the power control mechanism of the invention.","In the example shown in , the power control mechanism operates in the Normal state at time indices tthrough t, the No Data state at time indices tthrough t, the Data Start state at time indices tthrough t, and the Normal state from time index tonward. At each of time indices tthrough t, the frame received from the remote terminal is determined to be good (G), and the setpoint is decreased by a particular small amount (\u0394D). At time index t, the received frame is determined to be bad (B) and the setpoint is increased by a particular large amount (\u0394U).","In a specific implementation, in the Normal state, a particular time period needs to elapse between successive increases in the setpoint. Increasing the setpoint on every bad frame may make the power control mechanism unstable and not updating it often enough may make it sluggish. In this example, two consecutive bad frames need to be received between the frames on which the setpoint is increased. Thus, although four consecutive received frames are determined to be bad at time indices tthrough t, the setpoint is only increased at time index tand three time indices later at t, but not at time indices tand t. At each of time indices tthrough t, a good frame is received and the setpoint is again decreased accordingly.","In an embodiment, the power control mechanism transitions from the Normal state to the No Data state if no frames are received within a particular time period, which is also (coincidentally) two frame periods in this example. Thus, after the second frame period in which no data is received, at time index t16, the power control mechanism transitions to the No Data state.","In an embodiment, while in the No Data state, the setpoint is increased by a particular small amount (\u0394U) after each frame period in which no data is received, up to a particular maximum aggregate amount (\u0394U). Thus, at each of time indices tthrough t, the setpoint is increased by the small amount (\u0394U). After the setpoint increase at time index t, the maximum aggregate amount (\u0394U) is reached and the setpoint is not increased any further at time indices tthrough teven though no data is received in this time period.","In an embodiment, the power control mechanism transitions from the No Data state to the Data Start state upon receiving a good frame from the remote terminal. Thus, upon receiving a good frame at time index t, the power control mechanism transitions to the Data Start state. In this state, the setpoint is decreased by a particular larger amount (\u0394D) for each received good frame. This setpoint decrease occurs at each of time indices tto t, since the received frame is determined to be good.","In an embodiment, the power control mechanism transitions from the Data Start state to the Normal state upon receiving a bad frame from the remote terminal. Upon receiving a bad frame at time index t, the power control mechanism transitions to the Normal state and the setpoint is increased by the large amount (\u0394U). The power control mechanism then continues to operate in the Normal state in the manner described above.","The power control mechanism of the invention can be implemented within one or more base stations in communication with the remote terminal, the system controller (see FIG. ), some other elements of system , or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00070","num":"00070"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["512","514","516","518","520"]},"Operating system  is the operating system for the base station and is used to provide timing signals for the power control mechanism. Operating system  can be directed to provide, for example, a periodic timer (e.g., a power control (PC) timer) that goes off every frame interval, which is used as a triggering signal by the power control mechanism to update variables and perform any required actions. Since the setpoint is typically not changed any faster than at the frame intervals, a mechanism that updates the setpoint every frame is adequate.","BSC application  performs the call processing for the base station and provides a message to the power control mechanism whenever the active set of the remote terminal changes. The active set includes a list of base stations in communication with the remote terminal at any particular moment. The active set changes as the remote terminal adds and removes base station (e.g., as it moves about the network).","Each active reverse physical layer  receives and processes frames from the remote terminal and sends them to selection layer . One or more reverse physical layers  may be assigned to receive the same frame from the remote terminal and to send them to selection layer . Reverse physical layers  belong to different base stations and are used for soft handoff.","Selection layer  further processes the frames received from the assigned reverse physical layers  and eliminates duplicate frames. Based on the outcome of the processing, selection layer  sends a frame status to the power control mechanism for each frame period indicating whether a good or bad frame was received, or that no frame was received for that frame period.","Base transceiver station  receives the reverse link transmission from the remote terminal and implements the inner loop power control. Each assigned base transceiver station  receives the signal for the reverse traffic channel, measures the received signal quality, and sends a sequence of power control commands to the remote terminal. Each power control command directs the remote terminal to adjust its transmit power either up or down such that the received signal quality at base transceiver station  is approximately equal to the setpoint. The remote terminal may be power controlled by multiple base transceiver stations .","In an embodiment, the power control mechanism operates based on the events that occur in various subsystems of the base station. BSC application  sends hand-off information for each remote terminal to the power control mechanism using the HandoffInfo (Sectors) message. This message is sent whenever BSC application  changes the hand-off state of the remote terminal. The parameter Sectors contains the information about the base stations in communication with the remote terminal. If the number of Sectors is zero, then the remote terminal is not communicating with any base station.","Reverse physical layers  receive and process frames transmitted by the remote terminal on the reverse traffic channel, and forward the processed frames to selection layer . Since multiple frames may be received from multiple reverse physical layers  for a particular transmitted frame, selection layer  ensures that duplicate frames are removed. For each non-duplicate frame, selection layer  determines whether the frame is good or bad and provides the frame status to the power control mechanism.","If the remote terminal is in hand-off with multiple (N) base transceiver stations , selection layer  can receive between 0 to N frames for each frame transmitted from the remote terminal. In some CDMA systems, such as the HDR system, the frames for a particular data transmission are identified with frame identifiers (e.g., FrameIDs). In an embodiment, selection layer  declares a BadFrame if the frames received from all base transceiver stations  with the same FrameID are bad, and a GoodFrame if at least one frame from base transceiver stations  is good.","If one or more base transceiver stations  are not able to decode a particular frame, then selection layer  receives less than N frames and waits for frames that may not be forthcoming. This possibly indefinite wait can be remedied if selection layer  only waits until a frame with a higher FrameID is received or a particular time period (e.g., one frame period) passes. Selection layer  can then declare a GoodFrame or BadFrame based on the received frames.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00080","num":"00080"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["612","614","616","614"]},"Otherwise, if the number of sectors in the received message is greater than zero, the sector information for the power control mechanism is updated, at step .

The magnitude of the setpoint deltas, and the initial, minimum, and maximum setpoints can be selected to provide the desired level of performance (e.g., 1% FER) and may be provided, for example, in fractions of dB (e.g., {fraction (1\/1024)}of a dB). For example, the minimum setpoint (MinSetPoint) and maximum setpoint (MaxSetPoint) can be selected based on simulation, empirical measurements (i.e., lab results), or a combination thereof. The parameters and some of their effects are described below.","Increasing the NormalBadFrameDelta parameter allows the power control mechanism to be more responsive to degradations in the air-link conditions. However, this also results in the setpoint being adjusted higher and can thus reduce system capacity.","Increasing the NoDataDelta or NoDataMaxIncrease parameter reduces the likelihood of receiving a frame in error when the remote terminal starts transmitting again after a period of inactivity. This may result in a reduction in system capacity.","Increasing the DataStartGoodFrameDelta parameter causes the power control mechanism to lower the setpoint faster when the remote terminal starts transmitting after a period of inactivity.","The DelayBetweenIncreases parameter is typically set based, in part, on the delay between the base station and the BSC. Also, increases in the setpoint are not performed close in time (e.g., on consecutive frames) since frame errors tend to occur in bursts and a large change in setpoint due to a burst of errors may result in the remote terminal transmitting more power than needed. If the delay between the base station and the BSC can be reduced, the DelayBetweenIncreases value may be decreased, which can improve the responsiveness of the power control mechanism.","The NumEmptyFramesForNoData parameter can be decreased to force the power control mechanism to transition to the No Data state earlier. This parameter is typically not shorter than the TCP acknowledgement time, which is typically 200 msec.","Generally, the target FER is defined as the ratio of the delta decrease in the setpoint to the delta increase in the setpoint (e.g., \u0394D\/(\u0394D+\u0394U)). Thus, by adjusting the delta increase, the delta decrease, or both, the target FER can be adjusted.","Various modifications can be made to the power control mechanism to further improve performance. Some of the modifications can be dependent on the particular CDMA system being implemented.","In the HDR system, DRC (data rate control) information is transmitted from a remote terminal to a base station at a particular rate (e.g., 600 times a second). The DRC indicates which sector is best received by the remote terminal, and thus should be used to send forward link data to the remote terminal. The DRC also indicates the rate at which the sector should be sending the data on the forward link. Unlike data packets, which may be received by any sector in the active set of the remote terminal, the DRC needs to be received by the sector serving the forward link.","The transmitted DRC information may be erased (i.e., impossible to decode correctly) due to degraded link conditions. Under normal operation, the DRC and reverse link data are both transmitted from the remote terminal to the sector determined able to best serve the remote terminal. In this case, controlling the transmit power on the data channel also provides an acceptable DRC erasure rate. However, for an unbalanced situation, the best forward link is achieved via one sector but the best reverse link is achieved via another sector. In this case, performing power control on just the data channel sent to one sector may not be sufficient to ensure that the DRC channel sent to the other sector can be properly decoded. Modification can be made to the power control mechanism to prevent excessive degradation of the DRC channel as received by the sector designated to serve the forward link.","For the HDR system, DRC information can be received every 1.66 msec from the remote terminal. In typical implementations, it is impractical to send information at this rate to the BSC for power control. Various schemes can be used to provide and apply the DRC information to modify the power control mechanism, two of which are described below. The first scheme can be used for systems having a limited backhaul capacity and the second scheme can be used for systems having less restricted backhaul capacity. In both of these schemes, the target FER (which is typically set at approximately 1%) can be adjusted to achieve the desired DRC erasure rate.","In the first scheme, which is suitable for use in systems having limited backhaul capacity, a message can be sent from the base station to the BSC when the DRC erasure rate is too high for proper operation of the system. This scheme does not generate high message traffic between the base station and the BSC, which is desirable for systems with limited backhaul capacity.","The DRC erasure rate can be used to implement an \u201couter\u201d outer power control loop (i.e., a third loop) that continuously adjusts the target FER that the outer power control loop attempts to achieve. If the DRC erasure rate is determined to be too high, the target FER can be decreased by a (relatively) large amount, which then causes the setpoint to increase. This in turn causes the transmit power level to increase, which then causes the DRC erasure rate to decrease. The target FER can then be increased by a small amount for each frame period.","As noted above, the target FER can be adjusted by changing the magnitude of the delta increase in the setpoint, the delta decrease, or both. In an embodiment, the power control mechanism is implemented to use an EffectiveBadFrameDelta, instead of the NormalBadFrameDelta, to adjust the setpoint when a bad frame is received. The EffectiveBadFrameDelta parameter can be adjusted based on the NormalBadFrameDelta parameter and the target FER, which is adjusted from the original FER based on the DRC erasure rate. The EffectiveBadFrameDelta can also be used in all states defined above including the Normal, the No Data, and the Data Start states.","If the DRC erasure rate is too high, indicating that the remote terminal is not transmitting at sufficient power level, the target FER can be adjusted lower. The lower target FER can be achieved by increasing the magnitude of the delta increase in the setpoint (i.e., increasing \u0394U), thereby increasing the setpoint. The inner power control loop then causes the transmit power level of the remote terminal to increase to match the increased setpoint.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00116","num":"00116"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["712","714","722","716","718"],"sub":["DRC","DOWN","EFF","EFF"]},"At step , a determination is then made whether a new frame period has occurred.

Otherwise, the target FER is increased by a particular amount (\u0394FER), at step , and the effective setpoint delta increase (\u0394U) is decreased based on the higher target FER. The process then returns to step .","In the second scheme, which is suitable for use in systems having higher backhaul capacity, the target FER can be continually adjusted to achieve the desired DRC erasure rate.

Also, the DRC erasure rate can be used to directly adjust the setpoint.","As noted above, the power control mechanism can be modified to achieve the desired DRC erasure rate based on a set of events. Some of these events and their brief descriptions are provided below.","DRCErasureTooHigh: This event occurs when the DRC erasure is unacceptable and the sector is unable to send data to the remote terminal.
