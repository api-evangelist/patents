title: Projectile for standoff destruction of explosive devices
abstract: A projectile for safe standoff destruction of explosive devices. The projectile's casing encloses a chamber containing combustible material located opposite a roughened surface on the chamber. The combustible material is mounted so upon the projectile impacting the explosive device, the combustible material flies onto the roughened surface, heating the material by shear forces and igniting the material. This creates pressure bursting the chamber, injecting combustion gases into the explosive fill within the device, thereby igniting the fill locally at the impact, and along cracks in the fill. This arrangement prevents a coherent detonation wavefront from forming within the fill, and a slower burn of the fill, whereby a rifleman has little chance of receiving a concussive shock, or shrapnel, from the device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention pertains to apparatus effective to remotely destroy, or otherwise render safe, explosive devices.","Projectiles are known to be a convenient way to destroy explosive devices such as a mine or an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), for example a mine buried in the ground having an earthen overburden, a submerged mine under a water overburden, or a remotely detonated roadside bomb. By shooting a projectile such as a bullet or higher caliber round into the explosive device from a safe distance, one can initiate the explosive fill within the device and be rid of it. However, to destroy a device such as a land mine or IED, one must shoot at relatively close range. This situation exposes the rifleman to harm from the ignited device. Moreover, servicemen in the field can only carry so much equipment with them, so any projectile of practical use in the field must be reliably deployed using standard infantry weapons.","Accordingly, an object of the invention is to permit safe, standoff, destruction of explosive devices, such as, mines or improvised explosive devices.","Another object is to do the foregoing by use of a projectile fireable as a bullet generally from an infantry rifle.","In accordance with these and other objects made apparent hereinafter, it is an aspect of the invention to provide a projectile with an outer casing disposed about a space interior to the casing, and an inner surface that defines the space, a portion of which is given a preselected roughness. Disposed in the space is combustible material such that, responsive to impacting of the projectile after firing, the combustible material strikes against the roughened face. This arrangement permits, as the projectile penetrates into its targeted explosive device, the combustible material to shear against the roughened surface, thereby heating and igniting the combustible material, increasing pressure within, and bursting, the chamber. This arrangement injects hot combustion gases into the explosive fill of the explosive device locally at the point of projectile entry, and along cracks in the explosive fill. As a result, this invention prevents formation of a unitary ignition wavefront in the fill, and causes the fill to undergo reduced reaction, in effect burning (albeit rapidly) rather than exploding. Consequently, this technology prevents the explosive device from producing a large concussive shock, or generating enough explosive power to throw out shrapnel or other ballistic metal.","These and other objects are further understood from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention. It is understood, however, that the invention is capable of extended application beyond the precise details of these embodiments. Changes and modifications may be made to the embodiments that do not affect the spirit of the invention, nor exceed its scope, as expressed in the appended claims. The embodiments are described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:","Each of  is a side elevational view, partly in section, of a respective exemplary embodiment of the invention.","With reference to the drawing figures, where like numbers indicate like parts throughout the several views,  shows explosive devices , , one of which () is above ground, the other of which () is below ground and covered by earthen over burden . For purposes of illustration, explosive device  is shown as an improvised explosive device, and object  as a buried land mine. Standing off a distance from explosive devices ,  is rifleman  in transport  facing the devices along lines of sight , . As illustrated in , rifleman  fires projectiles  at objects ,  with the intent of safely destroying objects  and , and by safely it is meant destroying the explosive fills in ,  without exposing rifleman  to an explosive concussion or blow back of ballistic metal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 through 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["18","18","38","32","33","38","36","18","32","31","18","33","18","32","38","36","32","30","42","36","37","30","32","30","33","37","42","18","14","16","42","30","38","37","46"]},"In operation, rifleman  shoots projectile  at either explosive device  or  to render the device harmless. Earthen over burden  is far less dense and structurally harder compared to land mine , so the effect of projectile  on either land mine  or IED  is essentially the same. Upon impact, projectile  breaches the outer casing of the explosive device and penetrates into its explosive fill. The impact simultaneously dislodges combustible material  from annular lip , freeing combustible material  to fly by inertia forcibly into roughened surface . The grooves of surface , being annularly extending transverse to direction , exert shearing on combustible material  as the material strikes surface , heating material  and igniting it. As combustible material  burns, it rapidly fills chamber  with combustion gases, which burst projectile , thereby injecting hot gas into the portion of the explosive fill of  or  adjacent projectile 's entry point, and along cracks in the explosive fill opened by projectile 's impact. This sequence ignites the explosive fill locally and irregularly, as opposed to igniting the fill along a continuous wavefront. In this manner, projectile  induces a low order detonation that will cause the explosive fill of  or  to burn, rather than to undergo a high order detonation that could injure rifleman .","Combustible material  may be any appropriate fuel-oxidizer mix, for example, Department of Transportation Hazard Class 1.3, 1.4, or 4.1, but not Hazard Class 1.1. The roughness of surface  is, in an exemplary embodiment, about a 200 to about a 300 grit surface, with a higher roughness generally for less combustible fuel-oxidizer mixes, or mixes in powdered form, which will have little internal shearing to aid surface  to heat material . The fuel in material  may be, for example, aluminum, zirconium, titanium, or hafnium. Of these, aluminum has higher energy output and hence higher gas pressure in chamber , but is susceptible to oxidation. Hafnium is less given to oxidation, but produces less combustion energy and a correspondingly lower reaction pressure. Zirconium and titanium have exothermic and field stability properties between those of aluminum and hafnium. The oxidizer in combustible material  may be any chlorate or perchlorate, such as sodium, potassium or lithium chlorate. Fluorine compounds, such as aluminum fluoride, are also effective oxidizers, but have the disadvantage of producing highly toxic fluoride\/fluorine compounds, notably the exceptionally caustic hydrogen fluoride. Generally, a .50 caliber bullet, or a 7.62 mm bullet (such as the M-14 rifle uses) will generate impact temperatures in excess of 1,500\u00b0 F., easily sufficient to ignite these fuel-oxide mixes, so in general, all else being equal, the higher the ignition temperature of material  the better. Commercial explosives that are appropriate as material  include TNT, RX, RDX, HMX, and Composition B. Of these, TNT is more shock insensitive, and hence more stable in the field, in comparison to RDX and HMX, which are relatively more shock and friction sensitive to detonation. Composition B is more sensitive to impact.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["18","32","36","50","44","45","32","36","42","32","50","18","36","18","14","18","30","24","30","30","30","44"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["50","44","42","45","44","45","30","46","37","46","32","33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["35","50","33","29","32","33","35","32","33","50","42","42","30","42","30","44","45","50","35","42","42","30","42","42","30","42","30","42","30","35","50","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["36","48","42","50","32","34","50","36","32","33","36","30","50","50","50","48","36","36","30","42","30","48","50","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["56","18","54","30","30","54","30","30","18","54","42","54","56","52","52","32","30","56","29","56","56","60","58","18","50","60","58","56","58","18","58","18","56","58","56","18","56","26","18","56","58","52","56","56","58","52","14","16","56","18","18"]},"The invention has been described in what is considered to be various exemplary embodiments. It is recognized, however, that obvious modifications to these embodiments may occur to those with skill in this art. For example, from the foregoing, one can see that parts from each of the above described embodiments may be used together advantageously with those of other embodiments; and that although the foregoing discusses projectiles in the form of rifle bullets, the invention is useful with any ordnance system that can deliver the projectile with sufficiently modest energy to ensure that the projectile will not kinetically detonate a targeted explosive fill. Finally, any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations (for example, by using the term about) that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention.
