title: Method of achieving high transduction under tension or compression
abstract: A method of using a magnetostrictive material to achieve a high magnetomechanical coupling factor comprising building an internal anisotropy energy into the magnetostrictive material and applying a tensile or compressive stress to the magnetostrictive material with the built-in internal anisotropy energy. The internal anisotropy energy is built into the magnetostrictive material by annealing the magnetostrictive material under an annealing stress or a suitable magnetic field. For a positive magnetostrictive material, when the annealing stress is compressive, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is tensile, and when the annealing stress is the tensile, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is compressive. For a negative magnetostrictive material, when the annealing stress is compressive, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is tensile, and when the annealing stress is tensile, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is compressive.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to transduction, and, more specifically, to a method of using a magnetostrictive material to achieve high transduction under compression or tension.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Magnetostriction refers to a change in dimensions, often the length, of a magnetic material with a change in its magnetic state. Often, the change in magnetic state results from the application of a magnetic field. By definition, a positive magnetic material expands in the direction of the field upon application of a magnetic field, and a negative material contracts upon application of a field. Alternatively, a change in dimensions of a magnetostrictive material can cause a change in magnetization and thus produce an emf in an adjoining coil. Therefore, a positive or negative magnetostrictive material can act as a transducer or motor, converting between electrical and mechanical energy (or work).","Magnetostrictive materials are commonly operated with a compressive load condition and can sometimes also operate under a tensile load condition. Typically, positive magnetostrictive materials are operated under compression. Likewise, negative materials work optimally under tension. Note that many of the high power active materials available today are brittle and cannot withstand any substantial amount of tensile stress.","Many of the currently available magnetostrictive materials have only nominal magnetomechanical coupling factors (k). (The square of the coupling factor (k), which is a measure of transduction, is defined as the fraction of the total energy that is transformed from the magnetic state to the mechanical state. Perfect transduction occurs when k equals 1.) For example, nickel has a coupling factor of only about 0.3, indicating only about a 10% transformation from the magnetic state to the mechanical state. Therefore, most magnetostrictive materials achieve low transduction, which affects the efficiency and performance of the transduction device.","The aforementioned problems with the current technologies are overcome by the present invention wherein high transduction is achieved in magnetostrictive materials by building an internal anisotropy energy into the magnetostrictive material and applying a tensile or compressive stress to the magnetostrictive material with the built-in internal anisotropy energy. The internal anisotropy energy is built into the magnetostrictive material by annealing the magnetostrictive material under an annealing stress or a suitable magnetic field. For a positive magnetostrictive material, when the annealing stress is compressive, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is tensile, and when the annealing stress is tensile, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is compressive. For a negative magnetostrictive material, when the annealing stress is compressive, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is tensile, and when the annealing stress is tensile, the stress applied to the annealed material under operation is compressive.","The present invention is useful for providing highly efficient transduction devices, actuators, and positioners. Possible uses include sonar projectors and sensors, stepping motors, noise cancellation devices, vibration mounts, structure realignment devices, and ultrasonic cleaners.","In a preferred embodiment, a magnetostrictive material is annealed under stress (and\/or magnetic fields) to build in an internal anisotropy energy (E), a stress is applied to the annealed material, and under operation a second magnetic field is applied to convert the internal anisotropy energy into useful work or to reconvert the external work into the original internal anisotropy energy.","The internal anisotropy energy can be built into the magnetostrictive material by annealing the material under stress and\/or annealing while applying a suitable magnetic field. When this internal energy equals the external stress energy during operation, the conversion between Eand the external work (\u03bb\u00d7\u03c3) requires only a small magnetic energy (\u03bb is the saturation magnetostriction, and \u03c3 is the externally applied stress). Thus, in a preferred embodiment, high transduction is achieved by using a magnetostriction material with E, under a stress of \u03c3\u2261E\/\u03bb. At this stress, a small triggering magnetic energy can convert the internal energy introduced by the stress anisotropy into useful work, or conversely it can reconvert the external work into the original internal stored energy. This follows from energy minimization of the simple magnetization rotation model. For simplification, the model assumes that the material is homogeneous and that there is a single value of built-in E. The equation for this model is shown in Equation 1 where k is the coupling factor, sis the compliance, Mis the magnetization, and H is the magnetic field.\n\n=[1(\u2212\u03bb\u03c3)\/18\u03bb)]\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Since s, \u03bb, and Mare not vanishing, this expression shows that for any field H (\u22600) when E=\u03bb\u00d7\u03c3, the coupling factor k equals unity, i.e., perfect magnetomechanical transduction. Obviously, all materials have some inhomogenities and impurities that lead to somewhat lower coupling factors. For example, the stress annealing process may result in a distribution of E's.","For a positive magnetostrictive material operated under compression, \u03c3 is negative; therefore, Emust be negative and built-in with a tensile load or a suitable magnetic field. Optimum operation is at a compressive stress of \u03c3=E\/\u03bb. High coupling could even occur under a very high compressive load, the limit of the load being subjected to the limit of the built-in E.","For a negative magnetostrictive material (such as nickel or a nickel alloy) operated under compression, Eis built-in by annealing under a tensile stress or a suitable magnetic field.","For a positive magnetostrictive material operated under tension, Eis built-in under compression or a suitable magnetic field.","For a negative magnetostrictive material operated under tension, Eis built-in under compression or a suitable magnetic field.","Experiment","Highly textured FeGarods 6.35 mm diameter \u00d750.8 mm long (0.25\u00d72.00 in) were annealed under (compressive) stresses of between \u2212100 and \u2212219 MPa at 600\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes using the furnace shown in . The furnace consists of an outer vacuum jacket, a stainless steel heat shield and a Nichrome heater wound on a ceramic form. Stress was applied by a hand-operated hydraulic pump via two alumina rods. Stainless steel centering rings kept the sample in place on the alumina rods. Only a moderate (\u02dc200 micron) vacuum was used. Further details can be found in M. Wun-Fogle, J. B. Restorff, Kitty Leung, and A. E. Clark, \u201cMagnetostriction of Terfenol-D Heat Treated Under Compressive Stress,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 35, 3817-3819 (1999), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The magnetostriction was measured under tensile stress using the apparatus shown in . Soft iron end-pieces, 6.35\u00d731.8 mm, were attached to the sample using \u00bc-28 threads that were machined into the samples (see inset of ). Two 4-40 stainless steel threaded rods about 25.4 mm long were used in the load path; the rods were flexible enough to allow for some small amount of misalignment. Stress was applied via a spring indicated by the tensioning device shown in . Measurements were started near 0.3 MPa and stopped when the magnetostrictions dropped to about 30 percent of their starting values which usually occurred between 40 and 50 MPa. The magnetic field was supplied by a water-cooled, temperature controlled coil which also stabilized the temperature of the samples. Strains were measured by two Vishay Micro-Measurements WK-06-500GB-350 strain gages mounted on opposite sides of the Galfenol rods; the average of the two strain gages was used. A typical measurement set is shown in . At each applied stress, the zero field value of the strain was measured and the resulting stress-strain curve was plotted. Four samples are shown in )-(). The moduli were determined by fitting the hard and soft modulus regions to a straight line. The coupling coefficient k was determined by Equation 2 where Eis the soft modulus and Eis the hard modulus.\n\n1\u2212()]\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Thirteen measurements on eleven samples were made (two were annealed twice). Table 1 shows the results of all samples. The annealing conditions, E, E, and k are also shown. Five of the thirteen measurements showed k\u22670.7. Average values of the hard and soft modulus were E=40\u00b17 and E=72\u00b17. The average value of k was 0.66\u00b10.08.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Annealing conditions, moduli and k."},{"entry":"The \u201cA\u201d after the sample number indicates"},{"entry":"annealed, and multiple \u201cA\u201ds reflect multiple anneals."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Annealing Parameters",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Stress","Temp",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Sample #","(MPa)","(\u00b0 C.)","Time (min)","E(GPa)","E(GPa)","k"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1173A","100","625","10","59.4","41.9","0.54"]},{"entry":["1174A","100","625","10","74.5","32.8","0.75"]},{"entry":["1175A","100","600","20","62.2","33.3","0.68"]},{"entry":["1176A","200","600","20","74.6","40.9","0.67"]},{"entry":["1177AA","100","635","20","73.3","33.4","0.74"]},{"entry":["1177AAA","150","635","20","75.6","40.6","0.68"]},{"entry":["1178A","100","635","100","77.1","53.0","0.56"]},{"entry":["1181A","200","600","20","78.0","42.6","0.67"]},{"entry":["1183A","200","600","20","71.1","48.6","0.56"]},{"entry":["1184AA","150","600","20","73.7","36.3","0.71"]},{"entry":["1198A","200","600","20","68.2","40.8","0.63"]},{"entry":["1199A","200","600","20","79.6","40.5","0.70"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1199AE","1199A Magnetic Field Cycled","81.2","35.9","0.75"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The above description is that of a preferred embodiment of the invention.
