title: Systems and methods for user identity verification and risk analysis using available social and personal data
abstract: A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to support user identity verification based on social and personal information of the user. Under the approach, customers/users are required to grant identity verifying party a degree of access to their social network information, including but not limited to, account data and social graph information on social networks. The identity verifying party then acquires information of a current or potential user's online presence in addition to other information of the user and utilizes such information to verify the user's identity in the real world and/or to assess the fraud risk of a specific financial transaction requested by the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/424,394, filed Dec. 17, 2010, and entitled \u201cSystems and methods for user identity verification and risk analysis using available social and personal data,\u201d and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Ecommerce sites, especially those facilitating online payments between users (peer-to-peer payments and money transmitter businesses), as well as credit card processing companies, struggle to verify the identity of their customers. Traditional methods generally include collecting basic personal identifying information from customers, including name, address, social security number and phone number, and cross referencing this data with publicly and privately available databases to ensure that customers are who they say they are. More sophisticated e-commerce businesses will generate \u201creputation scores\u201d or \u201crisk scores\u201d based on the data they have aggregated regarding particular users. Some businesses use third-parties that specialize in creating these reputation scores based on a variety of publicly and privately available data, including companies (such as Rapleaf) that use membership in certain online social networks and web services as data points.","Web-based businesses will often accumulate additional data about their customers, including machine fingerprints, usage patterns, IP address, history, etc., which they plug into a rules engine\u2014a middleware application that allows the creation and prioritization of rules to be used in managing fraud. These engines allow merchants to create rules that will help evaluate orders and transactions as they come in. The rules engine can have many different names, such as \u201cdecision software,\u201d \u201cmanagement software\u201d or \u201corder management.\u201d Most payment and order management systems will have some of the capabilities to build and apply rules.","As fraudsters become more and more sophisticated, traditional methods of protecting businesses against fraud, identity theft, terrorism and money laundering are becoming increasingly ineffective. Even robust rules engines and reputation scores based on large amounts of user data do not adequately protect businesses from the risks associated with fraud.","The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent upon a reading of the specification and a study of the drawings.","The approach is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to \u201can\u201d or \u201cone\u201d or \u201csome\u201d embodiment(s) in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.","A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to support user identity verification based on social and personal information of the user. Under the approach, customers\/users are required to grant identity verifying party a degree of access to their social network information, including but not limited to, account, data and social graph information on the social networks. The identity verifying party then acquires information of a current or potential user's online presence in addition to other identifying information of the user and utilizes such information to verify the user's identity in the real world and\/or to assess the fraud risk of a specific financial transaction requested by the user.","Although fraudsters have become better at making fraudulent transactions look valid (by stealing personal identification information and building trust\/reputation over time), the proposed new approach utilizes social network information of a user that has only recently become available. Because of its multi-party nature, this newly available social network information allows for far more effective methods of verifying identity of the user and measuring risk of a financial transaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In the example of , the system  includes on the front end a user interaction engine , which includes at least a user interface , and a display component . On the back end, the system  includes a social network information collection engine , which includes a plurality of social network interfaces , each coupled to a API or controller of a specific social networking site, such as Facebook  or Twitter ; a social network information database  coupled to the social network information collection engine ; and a user identity validation engine , which includes at least a profiling component , a transaction component , and a risk analysis component ; a user database  and a transaction database  coupled to the user identity validation engine .","As used herein, the term engine refers to software, firmware, hardware, or other component that is used to effectuate a purpose. The engine will typically include software instructions that are stored in non-volatile memory (also referred to as secondary memory). When the software instructions are executed, at least a subset of the software instructions is loaded into memory (also referred to as primary memory) by a processor. The processor then executes the software instructions in memory. The processor may be a shared processor, a dedicated processor, or a combination of shared or dedicated processors. A typical program will include calls to hardware components (such as I\/O devices), which typically requires the execution of drivers. The drivers may or may not be considered part of the engine, but the distinction is not critical.","As used herein, the term database is used broadly to include any known or convenient means for storing data, whether centralized or distributed, relational or otherwise.","In the example of , each of the engines and databases can run on one or more hosting devices (hosts). Here, a host can be a computing device, a communication device, a storage device, or any electronic device capable of running a software component. For non-limiting examples, a computing device can be but is not limited to a laptop PC, a desktop PC, a tablet PC, an iPod, an iPhone, a PDA, or a server machine. A storage device can be but is not limited to a hard disk drive, a flash memory drive, or any portable storage device. A communication device can be but is not limited to a mobile phone.","In the example of , the user interaction engine , the social network information collection engine , and the user identity validation engine  each has a communication interface (not shown), which is a software component that enables the engines to communicate with each other following certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol. The communication protocols between two devices are well known to those of skill in the art.","In the example of , the network  enables the engines to communicate and interact with each other. Here, the network  can be a communication network based on certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol. Such network can be but is not limited to, internet, intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), wireless network, Bluetooth, WiFi, and mobile communication network. The physical connections of the network and the communication protocols are well known to those of skill in the art.","In the example of , the user interaction engine  is configured to enable a user to interact with a service provider by logging in and submitting a request for service or (financial) transaction to the service provider (user identity verification engine  as discussed later) via user interface  and to present to the user status of the request and\/or processing result of the transaction by the service provider via the display component . In some embodiments, the user interaction engine  also enables the user to provide identifying information or other relevant information to the service provider in order to establish his\/her user profile for the purposes of verification of his\/her identity and assessing the risk of the transaction requested. In some embodiments, in addition to serve the user requesting a service or transaction, the user interaction engine  also enables a risk assessment agent to access the profiled and\/or risk assessment information of the user and\/or request additional information from the user via user interface  in order to determine whether the transaction requested should be granted or denied. In some embodiments, the user interface  can be a Web-based application or interface, which allows the user to access the system  remotely via the network .","In the example of , the social network information collection engine  collects social network information of the user that are publicly available from various social networks, which host a variety of data related to the user, via corresponding social network interfaces . Here, the social networks include but are not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Classmates.com, Disqus, MySpace, Blippy, Dailybooth, Bump, Bing, Quora, eBay, Yahoo!, Plaxo, Friendster, Flickr, Amazon, Digg, Pandora and Reddit. Depending on configurations of the social networks, nature of the transaction and characteristics of the user, the user may be required to authenticate him\/herself on the social networks or otherwise give permission to the social networks in order for the social network interfaces  of social network information collection engine  to have access to and capture relevant data from the social networks. The social network interfaces  then harvests the social network information of the user from these social networks via automated visits to publicly available web pages of the social networks, or via public and private APIs provided for data access to the social networks. Once the social network information of the user is captured from the social networks via social network interfaces , the social network information collection engine  stores the collected data in social network information database  in a granular way. When requested, the social network information collection engine  provides the social network information of the user to user identity validation engine  for risk analysis of the transaction requested by the user.","In the example of , the user identity validation engine  verifies the validity of a user's identity and trustworthiness and calculate a risk score for the transaction requested by the user via risk analysis component . To the end, the user identity validation engine  relies upon data from one or more of: social network information of the user from social network information database , profiling information (profile) of the user from user database , which is created and maintained by profiling component , and past transaction history of the user from transaction component . If the user's identity is verified and the transaction is approved based on the risk score, the transaction component  automatically proceeds to process the transaction. Otherwise, the risk analysis component  may request additional information from the user and\/or provide relevant information to a risk agent to review and make further decisions through the user interaction engine . The status of the transaction and\/or the processing result are also provided back to the user via the user interaction engine .","In some embodiments, the profiling component  of the user identity validation engine  creates the profile of the user based on his\/her social network information data in addition to profiling data solicited and provided by the user him\/herself via the user interaction engine . Here, the profile of the user includes at least one or more of: name, address, date of birth (age), gender, and other identifying or classifying information of the user. Specifically, the social network information used by the profiling component  for profiling may include data on the user's activities activity and connections on the social networks as discussed below. For non-limiting examples, by checking the location of a user's posts, which is provided by many social networks), and information of the user's friends (e.g., who they are and where they leave), the profiling component  can \u201cprofile\u201d the user to determine, for example, whether the user is a 13 year old or 15 year old, where the user is someone living in Europe or in US, etc. The profiling component  then matches the profile information gathered from the social network information of the user with the profiling data provided directly by the user to verify the authenticity of the user's profiling data and generate an accurate profile of the user. Once the user's profile is generated, it can be utilized by the user identity validation engine  to run traditional rick analysis in addition to the risk analysis based directly on social network information of the user as discussed below.","Certain user profiling data in real life (e.g. user's home address) has been used for traditional risk analysis (e.g., risk score based on zip codes). Until recently, however, identification of a user on the web, such as email address, username or <<screen name>>, are mostly unverified and creating new and\/or fake accounts online is trivial. As the web has become more social and more and more web applications increasingly rely upon user's canonical identities (e.g., Facebook Connect), a user's identities on the social networks have gained a higher degree of trustworthiness versus anonymous usernames and unverified email addresses.","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  of the user identity validation engine  utilizes one or more of the following three types of social network information of user for risk analysis (more specifically, risk score calculation):\n\n","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  utilizes the \u201cage\u201d of a particular identity of the user on a social network to determine its trustworthiness for risk analysis of the user. Fraudsters rarely use their \u201creal\u201d social network identity when committing fraud. Instead, they create new accounts on the social networks for an one-time use to perform a particular fraud. It has been found that most of the fraudsters' accounts are very \u201cyoung\u201d and usually are created only days if not hours before attempting the fraud. Although such behavior by the fraudsters complicates the process of using information of a known fraudulent account to identify potentially fraudulent payments, it enables a simple check of the user's identity by risk analysis component  based on the user's account \u201cage\u201d (time since the account was created)\u2014the older the age of the identity, the more trustworthiness of the identity.","User Account Activities","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  utilizes activity information of a particular identity of a user on a social network to determine its trustworthiness for risk analysis of the user. Typical user accounts in social network are created for the purpose of data sharing, such as user posts, status updates, shared links, shared photos\/videos, etc. fraudulent accounts, on the other hand, are created for the sole purpose perform a fraud and the fraudster behind these accounts are not interested in investing time and resources to share data with others. Since creating a new, trustworthy identity is extremely difficult, a fraudster may be forced to also compromise or steal a true person's online identity in addition to their financial information. Since stolen identities and financial information have a relatively short useful life, it is difficult for the fraudster to be active for a long period of time (after the account was compromised). As a result, fraudster accounts (either newly created or stolen by fraudsters from real users) have no or almost no user activities most of the time. In some embodiments, risk analysis component  may utilize information on the distribution of the user's activities over time as another indicator of identity fraud. Typical users have their activities (e.g., posts) evenly distributed along the time since the account was created, while fraudster accounts typically have big gaps in the activity.","User Connection Data","In some embodiments, the social network information of the user includes a social graph, which is a massively interconnected web of relationships of the user with respect to other users on a social network.  depicts an example of a social graph. The nodes in the social graph represent users, while edges represent friendships or other connections among the users, including but not limited to, liking, commenting, messaging or tagging. These edges pass trust among the users along the graph. For a non-limiting examples, a user with one or more connections, e.g., trusted friends, can be trusted as a non-fraudster more than a user with no trusted friends; and a user with many connections can be trusted more than one with few or no long term connections.","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  utilizes and analyzes relationships and connections among nodes in one or more social graphs of a user for enhanced identity verification and risk analysis of the user. It is likely that a user will have a similar set of relationships across multiple web presences and social networks, and a lack of overlap or absence of data among the user's social graphs on multiple social networks can be used by the risk analysis component  to recognize a fraudulent user. Additionally, connections in a social graph such as \u201cfriendships\u201d require the approval of a second party and a typical user accumulates hundreds of these connections from other individuals whom he\/she know personally. A connection to a node that is known to be trusted (because of a previous relationship with that node) can also be relied upon to trust an unknown node.","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  checks the number of connections of a user in one of his\/her social graphs for identity verification of the user. Since many fake or fraudster accounts are created for the sole purpose of committing fraud, they would typically demonstrate patterns that include but are not limited to, no connections, fragmented connections with no pattern, a large number of recent new connections with little or no past connections, or connections to other nodes that have suspicious patterns as well.","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  checks the user's connections with known fraudsters or known legit identities on one of the social graphs to determine the validity of a specific identity of the user. When a fraudster is trying to make his or her account to look \u201creal\u201d, he or she can \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d only other accounts under his\/her control. Thus, a known fraudster account casts a \u201cshadow\u201d to all the accounts it is connected to directly or indirectly. However, the risk decreases with the distance from the known fraudster account. Similarly, a known \u201cgood\u201d account in the user's social graph greatly improves the odds of this account being legitimate, and the \u201cdistance\u201d between a known legitimate account and the user also plays a big role. It may also happen that a user belongs to an extended network for one or more \u201cknown fraud\u201d users as well as one or more extended networks of \u201cknown legit\u201d users in the social graph. To determine the fraud probability in this case, risk analysis component  may determine the \u201cfraud\u201d probability based on the \u201cfraud\u201d probabilities in relation to individual known \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201clegit\u201d account based on statistical modeling and formulas.","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  checks the connections between the two parties involved in the financial transaction on the social graphs for risk analysis of the transaction. If both parties to the transaction can be found in the same social graph, risk analysis component  can then check the \u201cdistance\u201d between them and figure out if these two parties are connected in real life or not. Although a fraud payer and\/or a fraud payee might also be connected in the graph, the short \u201cdistance\u201d between the payer and payee provides and strengthens either the \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201clegit\u201d indication.","In some embodiments, risk analysis component  utilizes the \u201cage\u201d of connections of an identity of a user on a social network to determine the trustworthiness and validity of the identity of the user. Similar to the \u201cage\u201d of the user account, the age of a connection is the time when the connection is established. The older the connections, the stronger the \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201clegit\u201d bias is. Note that different social networks have different \u201cstrengths\u201d of the account connections. For non-limiting examples, connected users in Facebook most often know each other personally, while connected users in Twitter typically follow large number of users they never met. Thus, the social graph from Facebook or LinkedIn is much stronger indicator of risk than the social graph from Twitter or Google+.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In the example of , the flowchart  starts at block  where a request submitted by a user for a transaction is queued pending risk analysis.
