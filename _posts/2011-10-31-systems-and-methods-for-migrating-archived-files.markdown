{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["In the digital age, organizations may store, manage, and access ever increasing volumes of data. Different types of data may have different access requirements\u2014for example, important and\/or frequently used data may require low-latency access provided by local, costly storage devices, while less important or rarely used data may not. In order to optimize usage of storage devices, some organizations may use an archiving system. An archiving system may archive a file by moving the file to an archive storage system and leave a placeholder file (e.g., a \u201cstub\u201d file) in the place of the archived file. When the archiving system later identifies an attempt to access the archived file (i.e., the placeholder file), the archiving system may retrieve the archived file from the archive storage system.","Unfortunately, migrating from an old archiving system to a new archiving system may be cumbersome and\/or costly. Traditional archive migration techniques may entail a bulk restoration of archived files to a local primary storage system. However, the primary storage system may not have sufficient space to even temporarily hold the archived files. This scenario may be especially common given that one of the purposes of using an archiving system is to reduce local storage requirements. Furthermore, the resource overhead of restoring all of the archived files may interfere with primary applications. Additionally, these traditional techniques may result in downtime for the file system or, at minimum, temporary unavailability of the archived files. Accordingly, the instant disclosure identifies a need for additional and improved systems and methods for migrating archived files.","As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for migrating archived files by bringing a new (target) archive system online while keeping the old (source) archive system online and individually restoring each archive files from the old archive system and directly archiving the file in the new archive system. In one example, a computer-implemented method for migrating archived files may include (1) identifying a file system including a plurality of placeholder files, the placeholder files referencing corresponding archived files stored on a first archival system, (2) identifying a request to migrate the archived files from the first archival system to a second archival system, (3) making the second archival system available to the file system for archival, and, while both the first archival system and the second archival system are available to the file system, (4) locating each placeholder file within the plurality of placeholder files on the file system, and, for each located placeholder file, (5) retrieving a corresponding archived file from the first archival system, and (6) archiving the corresponding archived file on the second archival system.","The computer-implemented method may retrieve the corresponding archived file with any of a variety of steps. In some examples, retrieving the corresponding archived file may include maintaining availability to the corresponding archived file on the file system while both the first archival system and the second archival system are available. In one example, retrieving the corresponding archived file may include removing the located placeholder file. In some examples, retrieving the corresponding archived file may include attempting to access the corresponding archived file via the located placeholder file on the file system. Additionally or alternatively, retrieving the corresponding archived file may include (1) identifying an application programming interface for the first archival system, (2) requesting, via the application programming interface, the corresponding archived file from the first archival system, and (3) receiving the corresponding archived file from the first archival system in response to requesting the corresponding archived file from the first archival system.","In some embodiments, archiving the corresponding archived file on the second archival system may include adding a new placeholder file referencing the corresponding archived file on the second archival system. In some examples, the computer-implemented method may also include (1) identifying at least one additional archived file stored on the first archival system but without a referencing placeholder file on the file system and (2) transmitting the additional archived file to the second archival system. In these examples, identifying the additional archived file may include (1) identifying a list of placeholder files within a directory on the file system and (2) determining that the additional archived file lacks the referencing placeholder file on the file system by determining that the additional archived file does not appear on the list of placeholder files but does appear in a corresponding directory in the first archival system. In some examples, the computer-implemented method may also include creating a new placeholder file for the additional archived file stored on the second archival system.","In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include (1) an identification module programmed to (i) identify a file system including a plurality of placeholder files, the placeholder files referencing corresponding archived files stored on a first archival system and (ii) identify a request to migrate the archived files from the first archival system to a second archival system, (2) an availability module programmed to make the second archival system available to the file system for archival, (3) a location module programmed to, while both the first archival system and the second archival system are available to the file system, locate each placeholder file within the plurality of placeholder files on the file system, (4) a migration module programmed to, for each located placeholder file, (i) retrieve a corresponding archived file from the first archival system, and (ii) archive the corresponding archived file on the second archival system. The system may also include at least one processor configured to execute the identification module, the availability module, the location module, and the migration module.","In some examples, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a computer-readable-storage medium. For example, a computer-readable-storage medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to (1) identify a file system including a plurality of placeholder files, the placeholder files referencing corresponding archived files stored on a first archival system, (2) identify a request to migrate the archived files from the first archival system to a second archival system, (3) make the second archival system available to the file system for archival, and, while both the first archival system and the second archival system are available to the file system, (4) locate each placeholder file within the plurality of placeholder files on the file system, and, for each located placeholder file, (5) retrieve a corresponding archived file from the first archival system, and (6) archive the corresponding archived file on the second archival system.","As will be explained in greater detail below, by bringing a new archive system online while keeping the old archive system online and individually restoring each archive files from the old archive system and directly archiving the file in the new archive system, the systems and methods described herein may efficiently migrate files from one archive system to another without burdening local storage requirements and\/or causing downtime for archived files and\/or other files.","Features from any of the above-mentioned embodiments may be used in combination with one another in accordance with the general principles described herein.

For example, at step  identification module  may, as part of computing device  in , identify file system  including placeholder files ()-(n) referencing corresponding archived files ()-(n) stored on archive system .","As used herein, the phrase \u201cfile system\u201d may refer to any system for organizing and\/or storing a collection of files and\/or analogous data objects. In addition, the term \u201carchiving,\u201d as used herein, generally refers to any type of data transfer (or data storage) technique that involves migrating data (e.g., a file) from at least one computing (or storage) device to at least one additional computing (or storage) device and replacing the migrated data with a placeholder (e.g., a reference, a stub, a shortcut, etc.). Accordingly, the phrase \u201cplaceholder file\u201d as used herein may refer to any type of file and\/or analogous data object left in place of migrated data. In some examples, the placeholder file may be smaller than the archived file it replaced. Additionally or alternatively, the size of the placeholder file may fall below a predetermined threshold (e.g., one kilobyte). In some examples, the placeholder file may use the same identifier as the archived file it replaced (e.g., the same file name). In additional examples, the placeholder file may contain information relating to the location of the archived file in an archive system (e.g., the alternate volume of data). An example of an archival system may include SYMANTEC ENTERPRISE VAULT.","Identification module  may identify the file system in any suitable manner. For example, identification module  may identify the file system by executing within an operating environment that uses the file system. Additionally or alternatively, identification module  may identify the file system by reading a configuration file and\/or receiving a message identifying the file system.","Returning to , at step  one or more of the systems described herein may identify a request to migrate the archived files from the first archival system to a second archival system. For example, at step  identification module  may, as part of computing device  in , identify request  to migrate archived files ()-(n) from archive system  to archive system .","In some examples, the second archival system may be incompatible with the first archival system. For example, the second archival system may be unable to communicate with the first archival system, may use a different and incompatible format of placeholder files, and\/or may be unable to natively migrate archived files to the first archival system. In some examples, the request may specify, either explicitly or implicitly, that the second archival system is incompatible with the first archival system.","The request may include any of a variety of parameters. For example, the request may specify how much space is available within the file system for the purpose of migrating the archived files. Additionally or alternatively, the request may specify a maximum amount of resources (e.g., in terms of processing load, I\/O load, memory load, etc.) to be used for migration. In some examples, the request may specify how many archived files may be stored on the file system at any given time during migration.","Identification module  may identify the request to migrate the archived files in any suitable context. For example, identification module  may receive the request from a user interface. Additionally or alternatively, identification module  may identify a scheduled migration task.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","304","104","402"]},"Returning to , at step  one or more of the systems described herein may make the second archival system available to the file system for archival. For example, at step  availability module  may, as part of computing device  in , make archive system  available to file system  for archival.","Availability module  may perform step  in any suitable manner. For example, availability module  may configure the second archival system to operate with the file system. Additionally or alternatively, availability module  may configure the file system to operate with the second archival system (e.g., by installing and\/or configuring a file system filter driver for operating with the second archival system). In some examples, availability module  may make the second archival system available to the file system for archival without making the first archival system unavailable for archival services.","Using  as an example, availability module  may make the second archival system available to the file system at a time second archive system online . Availability module  may thereby initiate a second archive online period .","Returning to , at step  one or more of the systems described herein may, while both the first archival system and the second archival system are available to the file system, locate each placeholder file within the plurality of placeholder files on the file system. For example, at step  location module  may, as part of computing device  in , locate each of placeholder files ()-(n) on file system  while both archive system  and archive system  are available to file system .","Location module  may locate each placeholder file within the plurality of placeholder files in any of a variety of ways. For example, location module  may search the file system for placeholder files using a placeholder file format of the first archival system. In some examples, location module  may crawl through a directory tree of the file system (e.g., performing a depth-first or breadth-first search) to search for each placeholder file. Additionally or alternatively, location module  may identify a list and\/or index of placeholder files corresponding to the first archival system. In some examples, location module  may identify one or more of the placeholder files within the plurality of placeholder files by identifying an attempt to access a corresponding archived file. For example, a user may attempt to access an archived file from the first archival system (via a corresponding placeholder file). In this example, location module  may identify the placeholder file by identifying the attempt to access the corresponding archived file (e.g., by monitoring the file system and observing that the archived file is being retrieved).","Using  as an example, location module  may perform step  during an intersection of a first archive online period  (e.g., while the first archival system is online) and the second archive online period  (e.g., while the second archival system is online). As shown in , at least a portion of this intersection may include an online migration period , during which the systems and methods described herein may identify and migrate archived files.","Returning to , at step  one or more of the systems described herein may, for each located placeholder file, retrieve a corresponding archived file from the first archival system. For example, at step  migration module  may, as part of computing device  in , retrieve archived file () corresponding to placeholder file () from archive system .","Migration module  may retrieve the corresponding archived file in any of a variety of conditions. For example, migration module  may maintain availability to the corresponding archived file on the file system while both the first archival system and the second archival system are available. For example, migration module  may retrieve the corresponding archived file directly to its original location within the file system. Migration module  may thereby enable applications to access the corresponding archived file as normal during migration. In some examples, migration module  may retrieve the corresponding archived file in response to determining that there are sufficient resources for retrieving the corresponding archived file. For example, migration module  may wait to retrieve the corresponding archived file until available space within the file system increases beyond a predetermined threshold, until the number of files in migration has dropped below a predetermined threshold (for example, migration module  may only perform a certain number of migrations at a time, or only one migration at a time), until the amount of data in migration has dropped below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 5 gigabytes), until a memory load has dropped below a predetermined threshold, etc.","In some examples, migration module  may also remove the located placeholder file. For example, migration module  may replace the located placeholder file with the corresponding archived file. In some examples, migration module  may retrieve the corresponding archived file simply by attempting to access the corresponding archived file via the located placeholder file on the file system. In this manner, migration module  may trigger the first archival system to return the archived file to the file system. In some examples, migration module  may retrieve the corresponding archived file by identifying a location of the corresponding archived file and retrieving the corresponding archived file from the specified location. In one example, the placeholder file may include an Internet shortcut. In this example, migration module  may extract a uniform resource locator from the Internet shortcut and fetch the corresponding archived file from the archive using the uniform resource locator.","In some examples, migration module  may attempt to retrieve the corresponding archived file using an application programming interface. For example, migration module  may identify an application programming interface for the first archival system. Migration module  may then request, via the application programming interface, the corresponding archived file from the first archival system. Migration module  may then receive the corresponding archived file from the first archival system in response to requesting the corresponding archived file from the first archival system. In some examples, migration module  may identify the application programming interface for the first archival system by referring to a data structure associating archival systems with application programming interfaces.","Using  as an example, migration module  may retrieve the corresponding archived file from the first archival system during online migration period .","Returning to , at step  one or more of the systems described herein may archive the corresponding archived file on the second archival system. For example, at step  migration module  may, as part of computing device  in , archive previously archived file () on from archive system .","Migration module  may perform step  in any suitable manner. For example, migration module  may simply submit the corresponding archived file to the second archival system. In some examples, migration module  may also add a new placeholder file referencing the corresponding archived file on the second archival system. Additionally or alternatively, the second archival system (and\/or an agent of the second archival system) may automatically generate the new placeholder file as a part of archiving the corresponding archived file. In some examples, the new placeholder file may occupy the same location as the located placeholder file (e.g., the same file path and\/or file name).","Using  as an example, migration module  may archive the corresponding archived file on the second archival system during the online migration period .","In some examples, migration module  may also migrate archived files not corresponding to located placeholder files. For example, migration module  may identify at least one additional archived file stored on the first archival system but without a referencing placeholder file on the file system. For example, a former placeholder file of the additional archived file may have expired. Migration module  may then transmit the additional archived file to the second archival system. Migration module  may identify the additional archived file in any of a variety of ways. For example, migration module  may identify a list of placeholder files within a directory on the file system. Migration module  may then determine that the additional archived file lacks the referencing placeholder file on the file system by determining that the additional archived file does not appear on the list of placeholder files but does appear in a corresponding directory in the first archival system. In some examples, migration module  may use an application programming interface to locate the additional archived file in the first archival system. Additionally or alternatively, migration module  may use the application programming interface to identify archival metadata corresponding with the additional archived file (e.g., a retention period to set for the additional archived file on the file system). In addition to transmitting the additional archived file to the second archival system, in some examples migration module  may create a new placeholder file for the additional archived file stored on the second archival system. After step , method  may terminate.","As explained above, by bringing a new archive system online while keeping the old archive system online and individually restoring each archive files from the old archive system and directly archiving the file in the new archive system, the systems and methods described herein may efficiently migrate files from one archive system to another without burdening local storage requirements and\/or causing downtime for archived files and\/or other files.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","510","510"]},"Computing system  broadly represents any single or multi-processor computing device or system capable of executing computer-readable instructions.
