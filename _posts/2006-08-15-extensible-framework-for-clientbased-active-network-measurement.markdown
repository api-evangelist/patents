The network measurement tools provide information regarding connectivity, routing, link capacities, available bandwidth, and bottlenecks. Typically, different tools are required to gather the information utilized by the network operators to ensure compliance.","For instance, a network operator may utilize a first tool to measure capacity and a second tool to measure delay. Additionally, a third tool may be utilized to measure bandwidth. In operation, multiple tools create numerous inefficiencies in code portability, code maintenance and implementation. Each tool reimplements basic functionality such as packet scheduling, timestamping and receiving. Reimplementation of basic functionality creates implementation inefficiencies because each of the three tools executes similar lower level procedures. In a similar vein, code maintenance is inefficient because each tool is updated separately, which requires duplicative update procedures. Moreover, portability is inefficient because each tool is tied to the underlying computing platform or operating system. Additionally, the network operator would be burdened to understand three interfaces associated with the three different tools.","The present invention is defined by the claims below.

The system includes a collection of client devices having service and control components for active network measurement. Additionally, the system includes a script interface that provides commands associated with one or more active network measurement procedures.

The computing framework includes sending, receiving, analysis and output components. The sending component generates probe streams based on commands included in an active network measurement configuration file. The receiving component receives network data corresponding to the probe streams, and the analysis component utilizes the network data to estimate link properties.
