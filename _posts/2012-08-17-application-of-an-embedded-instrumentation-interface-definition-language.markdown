The managed resource instrumentation application  is written using the EI2D language. The EI2D editor  is generated by a development platform . The EI2D editor  is an Integrated Development Environment (IED) utilized by the EI2D developer  to write and translate, compile, or interpret an interface into the managed resource instrumentation application . The EI2D editor  may include parsing, compilation, and debugging capabilities associated with an IED. The development platform is a computer system.","In some example embodiments, the managed resource instrumentation application , and the components included therein, is installed in a network device . These components may include an API  and\/or a component skeleton . The XML interface may be translated, compiled or interpreted into a managed resource instrumentation application  that includes one or both of these components. Further, these components may be installed as software, firmware, or hardware components. The API  and the component skeleton  may be installed as part of an operating system such as LINUX\u2122, an Internetwork Operating System (IOS\u2122), or some other suitable operating system. Other layers included in the network device  include a kernel subsystem layer , a system call interface , and a management agent . The management agent  is a layer capable of processing network management instructions written in one of the aforementioned protocols. Additional middleware layers may also exist between the management agent  and API , and the other layers shown herein. Further, management agent  is capable of transmitting a network device response responsive to the network management instructions. As will be more fully discussed below, these various layers may be bound together and may communicate via various interfaces.","In some example embodiments, a managed resource may be a physical or logical entity that resides as part of the network device. A physical entity may be a chassis, a port, or a power supply. A logical entity may be a service entity, a network interface, or a connection. A physical or logical entity is a feature. A network device may be a router, switch, bridge, or other suitable network device capable of layer 1, 2, or 3 analyses. These layers are layers in the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) stack model or the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.","In one example embodiment, the EI2D language is utilized in the development of one or more of the API  and component skeleton . The API  interfaces with the management agent , whereas the component skeleton  interfaces with a network device component . To interface includes making functions available for calling by another component, layer, or function. Calling means to retrieve for use. The management agent  is an application that processes network management instructions written in a protocol such as a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Netconf, an Internetwork Operating System-Command Line Interface (IOS-CLI), or some other suitable network management protocol. The network device component  may be, for example, a routing engine or other suitable component utilized by the network device to access a managed resource.

The key may be unique within a scope. For example, two different scopes may be defined: unique across instances of the same type of managed resource of an instrumentation provider or unique across the instances of the same type of managed resource of an including parent managed resource. In addition, the value of a key may not change during the lifetime of the managed resource, from the moment the managed resource is created to the moment in which the key is deleted. A key may be in effect read-only or read-create. The key value may need to be assigned by the manager when an instance of the managed resource is created in instances of the managed resource type that can be created by a manager. In some example embodiments, the key value is assigned by the agent.","In some example embodiments, a <key> element, referenced above as key , is defined as part of the EI2D library and includes one or more configuration attributes that specify anon-opaque-unique ID for a particular managed resource. An \u201casNumber\u201d of a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) service may be an example of such a unique ID. Some example embodiments may include a default in the form of the scope of the key being a class (e.g., a managed resource (and its subclasses), within a managed system (possibly containing multiple instrumentation providers)). If, however, the managed resource is included under another managed resource through an inherited type relationship (e.g., \u201cis-a\u201d inheritance or \u201chas-a\u201d inheritance) or a parent-child relationship, the key can be made unique by its parent through setting the scope to the parent. The value of the key attribute is not allowed to change over the lifetime of the object; the underlying attribute must hence have a maxAccess of read-only or read-create.

A value is one or more of a value, value range, or enumeration. As a reference, a value specifies the target type or list of types that restrict the \u201ctargetIsA\u201d specification. Further, a reference specifies a value of other property used as condition. Default specifies the default value. Property without a default value implies that a value needs to be specified when its entity is being created. Size restricts the multiplicity of the attribute or reference property. In case of an attribute, the following additional distinction applies. For an attribute of multiplicity \u201cone,\u201d size 1 means a scalar, no \u201cnull\u201d value allowed. Size 0 . . . 1 means a scalar, with a null value (unspecified) allowed. For an attribute of multiplicity \u201cmany,\u201d the size indicates size of the corresponding collection, i.e., number of distinct values associated with the attribute, in examples of a reference, the following distinction applies. For a reference of multiplicity \u201cone,\u201d size 1 means a non-null valid reference, size 0 . . . 1 means a reference that can be null. For a reference of multiplicity \u201cmany,\u201d size 0 . . . * means a set of references, size 10 means a set of exactly 10 references. Strlen specifies the length or length range of a string type. Regex specifies the pattern of a string type. Max_access-specifies the constrained max_access. Is_null specifies if the value is null or unspecified.","The following table provides an example of how the size and default constraints affects the behavior of a managed resource during its creation in case of a property with multiplicity of \u201cone.\u201d Analogous behavior applies in the case of multiplicity \u201cmany.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Size",{},{}]},{"entry":["Multiplicity","constraint","Default","Run-time Behavior"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["one","size(1)","not specified","Value mandatory during MR"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"creation."]},{"entry":["one","size(1) ","specified ","Value optional and set to "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"default during MR creation."]},{"entry":["one","size(0..1)","not specified","Value optional during MR "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"creation.
