title: Method of and system for auctioning off commercial frames for on-air content and method of and system for automatically sending on-air content
abstract: A method of and system for auctioning off commercial (CM) frame for on-air content and a method of and system for automatically sending on-air content. A broadcast station presents as an auctioneer a CM frame for sale and a lowest sale price to tenderers via a communication network. On the basis of the supplied information, each tenderer sends an auction application price for the CM frame to the auctioneer via the communication network. The auctioneer determines a successful tenderer for the CM frame on the basis of the highest auction application prices presented by the tenderers. The CM frame successfully tendered by this network auction is automatically registered in a broadcast sales information system along with CM content information to be incorporated in the CM frame. A content sending system takes the registered CM content from a CM bank at a predetermined broadcast time for automatic transmission and broadcasting.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to a method of and system for auctioning off commercial (CM) frames for on-air content and a method of and system for automatically sending on-air content.","In broadcasting industry, the production department of a broadcast station produces and organizes content to be put on the air and the transmission department puts on the air the produced and organized content, thereby supplying television programs to an audience. Television programs, which are on-air content, are largely classified into \u201clive\u201d programs in which an event is broadcast in real time and \u201crecorded\u201d programs in which an event recorded in advance is reproduced later for broadcasting. Each of the television programs, live or recorded, in commercial broadcasting is composed of at least one piece of program content and one piece of CM content each of most television programs is constituted as on-air content which is a time-series set managed in sequence and time composed of plural program frames obtained by dividing one piece of program content or incorporating plural different pieces of program content and plural CM frames each incorporated with plural pieces of CM content.","Referring to , there is shown a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of on-air content to be broadcast and the related-art processes for establishing on-air content.","The production department produces various kinds of program content and CM content. In process, the production starts with the gathering of materials on site for example by use of materials gathering equipment. Materials are a collection of video and audio fragments before editing which are called primitive materials. Next, the collected materials are edited and manipulated by use of editing equipment into sources. Based on these sources, program content Ctp and CM content Ctm through Ctmn are produced. On-air content Ctoa is organized by combining these program content Ctp and CM content Ctm through Ctmn.","As shown, typical on-air content Ctoa is composed of plural program frames Frp through Frp and CM frames Frc through Frc arranged in a predetermined sequence in time. Each of program frames Frp through Frp is incorporated with one of the divisions of program content Ctp for example and each of CM frame Frc through Frc is incorporated with one of CM content Ctm through Ctmn.","Generally, CM content is of two types; one is CM content corresponding to a program provider (program sponsor) and the other is sponsor-independent, spot CM content which corresponds to a spot CM provider (spot CM sponsor). Hence, the CM content to be described below includes both types.","It should be noted that CM content Ctm through Ctmn may be supplied by program sponsors and\/or spot Cm sponsors, rather than produced by the production department of a broadcast station.","On the other hand, the sales department sets the sponsor of the organized on-air content Ctoa. To be specific, the sales department sells CM frames Frc through Frc of this on-air content Ctoa into which CM content Ctm through Ctmn can be incorporated to the sponsor. The sponsor buys desired CM frames and specifies the CM content to be incorporated in the purchased CM frames. Consequently, the CM frame Frc through Frc is sold before actually being broadcast and, when the sponsor and the CM content to be incorporated are determined, scheduling information including the content of CM frame is registered into a broadcast sales information system which manages sales information and the CM content is prepared. In the preparation of the CM content, the program content Ctp and the CM content Ctm through Ctmn are stored and managed by a program bank and a CM bank respectively arranged in each broadcast station.","When the setting of the sponsor and the CM content into each of the CM frames Frc through Frc and the registration of the scheduling information into the broadcast sales information system have been completed, the transmission department retrieves the scheduling information from the broadcast sales information system at a predetermined time and, on the basis of the retrieved information, broadcasts the time-dependently scheduled on-air content Ctoa by taking the specified program content Ctp and CM content Ctm through Ctmn from the program bank and the CM bank respectively, upon which a television program is established. In addition, a part of each televised content (or source) is archived for long-term storage in a reproducible manner.","As described above, the CM frames of on-air content are sold to sponsors. However, in the above-mentioned related-art technology, the sale of Cm frames, the registration of the CM frame content into the broadcast sales information system, and the preparation of CM content are individually and manually performed, thereby presenting a problem of requiring time and labor.","Moreover, at the sale of CM frames, the related-art technology requires the adjustment of the arrangement of the plural CM frames of a same piece of on-air content in order to prevent the setting of competitive sponsors and competitive providers of a same kind of industry, in turn requiring time and labor.","Further, if plural sponsor candidates desire the provision of a same CM frame, individual negotiations are made between persons in charge due to business custom, thereby requiring time and labor to set an optimum sale price.","In addition, in consideration of the time (overhead) involved in the above-mentioned sales and so on, CM frames are sold and the sponsor setting is made much earlier than their actual broadcasting, so that the prices of the CM frames are set in advance (for example, several days before broadcasting), thereby presenting a problem that the audience reaction during broadcasting cannot be reflected onto the price.","Consequently, even if a CM frame is inserted in a program earning a high audience rate during actual broadcasting and therefore can attain high advertisement effects, the price of such a CM frame cannot be dynamically set or reset because its price were set and fixed beforehand. Namely, it is difficult for the related-art technology to reflect the market prices of CM frames onto their sale prices.","Further, the above-mentioned related-art configuration and processing mode require labor for executing the jobs and procedures from the setting of CM frame sponsors by the sales department to the actual broadcasting by the transmission department, thereby lowering the efficiency of the system and making it difficult to cut the operational cost.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of and system for auctioning off CM frame for on-air content and a method of and system for automatically sending on-air content which are intended to improve the sales efficiency and set the prices of CM frames on the basis of the market mechanism by use of communication networks.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an on-air content automatic sending method and an on-air content automatic sending system which are capable of setting prices of CM frames on the basis of the market mechanism and minimizing the operational cost involved with broadcasting while maximizing sales profit.","In carrying out the invention and according to a first aspect thereof, there is provided an on-air content CM frame auction method of determining a provider of a CM frame of on-air content for broadcasting organized by a combination of a program frame in which program content is incorporated and the CM frame in which commercial content is incorporated, the provider of the CM frame being determined by an auction based on a communication network, the method comprising: a first step in which an auctioneer notifies an auction tenderer of an auction of the CM frame via the communication network; a second step in which, when the auction tenderer sends at least auction application information indicative of an auction application price of the CM frame to the auctioneer via the communication network, the auctioneer accepts the auction application information; a third step in which the auctioneer discloses information associated with an auction application status to the auction tenderer via the communication network; and a fourth step in which, at least on the basis of an auction application price, the auctioneer determines an auction successful tenderer of the CM frame as the provider.","According to the above-mentioned method, the auction of CM frames is executed via a communication network, so that the successful tenderer of the auction and the provider of an auctioned CM frame can be determined quickly and easily. For plural CM frames in the same on-air content, the auction tenderer checks for competitive providers including providers of the same kind of industry and adjusts the alignment of the CM frames. Consequently, the number of processes on the auctioneer side can be cut, thereby mitigating the processing load. Further, if two or more auction tenderers want a same CM frames, an optimum sale price can be quickly and easily set by the auction based on a communication network.","Preferably, the auction based on the communication network is executed by applying a Web page capability of the Internet.","According to the above-mentioned method, the application of the Web page capability of the Internet allows the simple, quick, and low cost data transfer, between the auctioneer and the entity desiring the provision (sponsor), including a notification of the invitation to auction tender from the auctioneer and the sending of auction application data.","Preferably, the auction based on the communication network is executed by applying the web page capability and electronic mail capability of the Internet.","According to the above-mentioned method, the application of the electronic mail capability allows the sending of the notice of auction invitation from the auctioneer to only selected sponsors and the application of the Web page capability of the Internet allows the simple, quick and low cost data transfer, between the auctioneer and the sponsor, including the sending of auction application data from the sponsor.","Preferably, an auction tender of the CM frame is executed even at broadcasting of the on-air content and the third step is configured to include processing for capturing information associated with a reaction of an audience during the broadcasting and immediately disclosing the captured information to the auction tenderer via the communication network.","According to the above-mentioned method, the auction of CM frames is executed even at broadcasting of on-air content and the information associated with the reaction of an audience during broadcasting is immediately disclosed to the auction tenderer, thereby setting the auction price suitable for the market mechanism with the reaction the of audience reflected.","In carrying out the invention and according to a second aspect thereof, there is provided an on-air content CM frame auction system for determining a provider of a CM frame of on-air content for broadcasting organized by a combination of a program frame in which program content is incorporated and the CM frame in which commercial content is incorporated, the provider of the commercial frame being determined by an auction based on a communication network, the system comprising: a communication network for intermediating in information transfer between an auctioneer of an auction of the CM frame and an auction tenderer who desires to provide the CM frame; first means for managing processing associated with the auction of the commercial frame to be executed via the communication network and processing for determining the provider; second means for transmitting by the auctioneer information associated with a tender of the CM frame to the auction tenderer via the communication network; and third means for, when at least auction application information indicative of an auction application price of the CM frame is transmitted from the auction tenderer who accepted the information associated with the tender to the auctioneer via the communication network, determining by the auctioneer who accepted the auction application information an auction successful tenderer of the CM frame as the provider at least on the basis of the auction application price; the second means including processing for disclosing information associated with an auction application status to the auction tenderer via the communication network.","According to the above-mentioned configuration, the auction of CM frames is executed via a communication network, thereby quickly and easily determining a successful tenderer and a sponsor of a CM frame.

In addition, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) or a mobile phone may be applied to the customer system CUj. The following describes the functional configuration of customer system CUj on a module basis by use of the customer system CU for example.","An operating system Cu is a software module for controlling the operation of this platform. CM auction application processing means Cu is a software module for executing the processing associated with the auction application of a CM auction. Input means Cu is a module for receiving signals from an inputting device such as a keyboard Kb and a mouse Ms and supplies the received signals to the CM auction application processing means Cu.

The customer system Cuj is constituted by the above-mentioned modules.","The on-air content CM frame auction system AUCS operates in any of the following operation modes:\n\n","Each of the above-mentioned modes is executed by the operation of the on-air content CM frame auction system AUCS.  are flowcharts describing the operations of the on-air content CM frame auction system AUCS. The following describes these operations with reference to these figures.","In the on-air content CM frame auction system AUCS, if a CM frame auction becomes necessary, the broadcast sales information system SIS inputs auction information ai into the network auction management means Hs of the host system HS.","The network auction management means Hs checks the broadcast sales information system SIS for the inputting of auction information ai (step S). When the auction information ai is found, the network auction management means Hs sets a CM frame and an event (step S). The network auction management means Hs sets an event for each CM frame subject to auction and opens an event file to which event-associated information is to be recorded in the data file apparatus DF.","Next, the network auction management means Hs checks if the auction is a realtime auction. If the auction is found not a realtime auction, then the procedure goes to step S. If the action is found a realtime auction, then the network auction management means Hs captures realtime on-air information (audience rate) oai from the realtime on-air information processing system ROP to make an adjustment (step S). It should be noted that when a realtime auction starts, it is assumed that on-air content is already running.","Next, the network auction management means Hs operates the presentation information creating means Hs which creates tender information tai on the basis of the content of the event file and, in the case of a realtime auction, the real-time on-air information oai (step S). The tender information tai includes the data for forming the screen  for disclosing CM frame auction information and the control data thereof and the data for the forming screen  associated with the inputting of auction application and the control data thereof shown in  respectively. When the tender information tai created by the presentation information creating means Hs is sent to the encryption\/decryption means Hs. The encryption\/decryption means Hs encodes the received information and operates the host-side information transfer means Hs to send the encoded information to all or selected customer systems CUj (step S). It should be noted that the tender information tai may be temporarily stored in the data file apparatus DF.","Then, based on the auction information ai, the network auction management means Hs checks whether a time of updating the realtime on-air information oai has been reached in the case of a real-time auction. If the update time has been reached, then the procedure returns to step S. If the update time has not yet been reached, the procedure goes to step S (step S). It should be noted that, if the auction is not a real-time auction, step S is skipped.","If, in step S, an auction application input signal is generated via the host-side information transfer means Hs by the customer system CUn which has applied to the auction, then the procedure goes to step S, in which the encryption\/decryption means Hs decrypts the auction application input signal to restore the auction application information tdrn to be sent to the network auction management means Hs and the CM auction business logic Hs. on the other hand, if no auction application input signal is found generated in step S, the procedure goes to step S.","Next, in step S, on the basis of the received auction application information tdrn, the network auction management means Hs determines whether the tender price is lower than a lowest price (this is a given condition of the auction information ai) predetermined for each event (step S). If the tender price is found lower than the lowest price, the tender is rejected (step S), the procedure returning to step S. On the other hand, if the price is higher than the lowest price, the tender is accepted and written to the event file in the data file apparatus DF, thereby triggering the CM auction business logic Hs (step S).","The triggered CM auction business logic Hs executes auction application processing on the basis of the auction application information tdrn in step S.

In the present embodiment, the CM auction business logic Blgc is classified as an CGI application.","The auction processing capability of the CM auction business logic Blgc is substantially the same as the CM auction business logic Hs described with reference to the previous embodiment. The CM auction business logic Blgc triggered by a system command with arguments from the CGI handler Cgi written in Perl script executes auction application processing, successful tender processing, and acknowledgement\/withdrawal processing (refer to ). When the results of these processing operations are returned to the CGI handler Cgi, these results are recorded to the data file apparatus DF.","For the encryption\/decryption means As, SSL (Secure Socket Layer), which is a protocol to realize socket-level encryption and authentication capabilities disclosed as a technology for protecting the security of data transferred between a Web browser and a Web server, is used for example.","The operations of the broadcast sales information server SiSV, the content sending server CsSV, and the realtime on-air information server RpSV, and the network auction management means As, the site side information transfer means As, the encryption\/decryption means As, and the presentation information creating means As of the application server WebASV are substantially the same as those of the previous embodiment and therefore their descriptions will be omitted.","On the other hand, the configuration of each of the clients WebCL through WebCLj has a client side information transfer means CI, encryption\/decryption means CI, and a browser Br in the case of client WebCL for example.

When the on-air time has been reached, the system management server SpSV manages the operation of the content sending server CsSV to automatically send the on-air content.","The following describes the management and operation, at the time of a non-realtime auction, of the network auction management means As of the CM frame auction system AUCS. In the following description, it is assumed that the broadcast station side be the auctioneer.","The network auction management means As functions as the operator of a CM frame auction Web site and, when a command for operating a non-realtime auction comes from the system management server SpSV, requests the broadcast sales information server SiSV for auction information ai. The network auction management means As sends the obtained auction information ai to the presentation information creating means As to convert tender information including on-air content overview and a lowest desired sale price of a CM frame available for sale into a Web page format (for example, a HTML file). The encryption\/decryption means As encrypts the resultant Web page. The encrypted Web page is presented to clients WebCL through WebCLj via the site side information transfer means As and the logical network system LNW. Consequently, the network auction management means As notifies the terminals of advertisement agencies and program client corporations of the start of a new CM frame auction.","On the basis of the tender information in the Web page GUI-developed by the browser Br, each of the tending advertisement agencies and program client corporations checks the content of a CM frame on sale and enters auction application information including the auction application price to be presented for a desired CM frame and the information of CM content to be broadcast into the corresponding input field of the Web page by considering the content of the program in which the desired CM frame is inserted, broadcast date, time, past audience rate, and information about competitive sponsors in adjacent frames of the program. The inputted information is encrypted to be sent to the CM frame auction Web site via the logical network system LNW as a response to the CM frame auction Web site.","If the above-mentioned input field processing is of a form format, a script associated with the triggering of the CGI handler Cgi is included in the response data. When the script being analyzed in the response is detected, the network auction management means As passes control to the operating system OS, which controls the operation of the CGI handler Cgi. In the present embodiment, because the CGI handler Cgi is of Perl script configuration, the Perl interpreter Prinp operates under the control of the operation system OS to sequentially process the script, control being passed to the CM auction business logic Blgc by a system command with arguments. A result of the execution of the auction application processing by the triggered CM auction business logic Blgc is returned to the CGI handler Cgi to be stored into the data file apparatus DF.","The network auction management means As triggers the presentation information creating means As to update the Web page to the content including the highest auction application price at that point of time, sponsor name, and product in the inputted auction application information. The updated Web page is immediately sent to clients WebCL through WebCLj to be displayed by the browser Br.","Each tending advertisement agency and program client corporation checks the highest auction application price by referencing the updated Web page. If a tenderer wants to tender with a higher price, the tenderer enters a new higher auction application price and sends the input to the CM frame auction Web site via the logical network system LNW as a response. On the basis of the received response, the processing is executed in the same manner as described above. The above-mentioned operation is repeated until a specified tender deadline. When the specified tender deadline has been reached, the acceptance of new auction application inputs are closed.","Next, the network auction management means As specifies the successful tender processing and drives the CM auction business logic Blgc via the CGI handler Cgi. From among the auction applications made during a predetermined period of time, the CM auction business logic Blgc sets successful tender candidates of that CM frame on the basis of the highest auction application price. An acknowledgement screen carrying a negotiation priority number and successful tender conditions is displayed for the successful tender candidates, starting with the candidate who presented the highest price.","If the tenderer having the highest negotiation priority number does not follow the acknowledgement procedure within a predetermined period of time, the negotiation right is shifted to the tenderer having the second negotiation priority number to request this tenderer for accomplishing the acknowledgement procedure.","If the acknowledgement procedure is not accomplished with a predetermined period of time or a withdrawal occurs, the screen is updated to push up the successful tender candidate having the second priority number to top. The resultant candidate starts the execution of the acknowledgement procedure.","In the case of a delay in accomplishment of the acknowledgement procedure or a withdrawal, a predetermined cancel fee is charged.","Successful tender information (the CM frame and the information about CM content to be incorporated) acknowledged by the success tenderer is automatically sent to the broadcast sales information server SiSV of the broadcast station as content organization information ica.","The broadcast sales information server SiSV records the supplied content organization information ica to the database apparatus DB for registration. Further, on the basis of the content organization information ica, the broadcast sales information server SiSV organizes program\/CM organization information isch containing the content of program frame and the content of CM frame (such as broadcast time and CM material number) before the actual on-air time.","The organized program\/CM organization information isch is sent from the broadcast sales information server SiSV to the content sending server CsSV at a predetermined time. In accordance with the content of the program frame specified by the program\/CM organization information isch and the CM material number, the content sending server CsSV extracts the above-mentioned CM content from the CM bank and sequentially broadcasts the extracted CM content in a time-series manner. It should be noted that the CM content prepared by each successful tenderer is assumed to have been registered in the CM bank server before putting on the air.","A CM transmission record which has been broadcast is sent from the content sending server CsSV to the broadcast sales information server SiSV, which stores the received record into the database apparatus DB and creates broadcast record\/settlement information iast to send it to the application server WebASV. The network auction management means As of the application server WebASV sends the information to only to the client WebCLn which is the provider (sponsor) via the presentation information creating means As, the encryption\/decryption means As, the site side information transfer means As, and the logical network system LNW.","Receiving the broadcast record\/settlement information iast, the client WebCLn performs settlement processing by following a predetermined procedure after a certain period of time.","Described above is the case of a non-realtime auction. In the case of a realtime auction, the following management and operation are performed.","In the case of a realtime auction, the system management server SpSV operates the content sending server CsSV at on-air date and time to start the automatic transmission of on-air content and, at the same time, drives the application server WebASB operating the CM frame auction Web site to operate the CM frame auction system AUCS, which executes a realtime auction of that CM frame immediately before its being put on the air, while reflecting the audience rate information onto the auction during the broadcasting of the on-air content. If a successful tenderer is determined several minutes for example before each CM frame is put on the air, the information about the CM content specified by that sponsor is immediately sent to the content sending server CsSV so as not to delay the broadcasting. Thus, every time a CM frame is successfully tendered, the information about CM content is supplied to the content sending server CsSV without delay, thereby controlling the automatic transmission such that the CM content can be put on the air without discontinuation or drop.","When a realtime auction operation command comes from the system management server SpSV, the network auction management means As requests the broadcast sales information server SiSV for auction information ai and sends the obtained auction information ai and the realtime on-air information (audience rate) oai inputted from the realtime on-air information server RpSV to the presentation information creating means As to convert tender information including on-air content overview, a lowest desired sale price of a CM frame available for sale, and current realtime audience rate into a Web page format. The resultant Web page is presented to clients WebCL through WebCLj via the site side information transfer means As and the logical network system LNW. Consequently, the network auction management means As notifies each advertisement agency and program client corporation of the starting of a new CM frame realtime auction.","On the basis of the tender information included in the Web page presented by the browser Br, each of the tending advertisement agencies and program client corporations checks the content of a CM frame on sale and enters auction application information including the auction application price to be presented to be broadcast for a desired CM frame and the information of CM content into the corresponding input field of the Web page by considering the content of the program in which the desired CM frame is inserted current realtime audience rate, and information about competitive sponsors in adjacent frames of the program. The inputted information is immediately sent to the CM frame auction Web site via the logical network system LNW as a response to the CM frame auction Web site.","Receiving the response, the network auction management means As causes the CM auction business logic Blgc to execute auction application processing via the CGI handler Cgi. It should be noted that the bidirectional information transfer between the CM frame auction Web site and the auction applicant via the Web page and the link with an external component are implemented by the CGI mechanism as described before. It will be apparent that this implementation may be realized by other bidirectional information transfer and link technologies than the CGI mechanism.","Next, The network auction management means As triggers the presentation information creating means As to update the Web page content including the highest auction application price at that point of time, sponsor name, and product in the inputted auction application information and update the current realtime audience rate. The updated Web page is immediately sent to clients WebCL through WebCLj to be displayed by the browser Br.","The auction application side checks the highest auction application price by the updated Web page and the most recent audience rate and, if the auction applicant desires to tender at the highest price, enters the new auction application price into the corresponding input field of the Web page, sending the Web page to the CM frame auction Web site via the logical network system LNW as a response. On the basis of the received response, the processing is executed in the same manner as described before. The above-mentioned operation is repeated until a specified tender deadline. When the specified tender deadline has been reached, the acceptance of new auction application inputs are closed.","Then, the network auction management means As specifies the successful tender processing and drives the CM auction business logic Blgc via the CGI handler Cgi, which determines the successful tenderer, namely the sponsor, of that CM frame on the basis of the highest auction application price. In the case of a realtime auction, unlike a non-realtime auction, for the content being broadcast, a CM frame which is put on the air several minutes for example after the current time is set by the auction in a feed forward manner, so that there is no temporal margin and therefore the withdrawal from successful tender (cancellation) is not permitted. The successful tender acknowledgement procedure may also be omitted.","The successful tender information (the CM frame and the material number of the CM content to be incorporated) is immediately registered in the broadcast sales information server SiSV as content organization information ica.","The CM content material number is sent from the broadcast sales information server SiSV to the content sending server CsSV immediately before the broadcasting of that CM frame. In accordance with this CM material number, the sending system extracts the corresponding CM content from the CM bank server and sends the extracted CM content at a predetermined time for broadcasting, and broadcasts the same. Thus, the auction and the CM content sending and broadcasting proceed in real time.","The storage of the sending record information by the broadcast sales information server SiSV into the database apparatus DB after broadcasting and the settlement processing by the sponsor are the same as with the above-mentioned non-realtime auction.","The following proposes another business model for a television CM frame auction based on an Internet environment.","When constructing an on-air content CM frame auction system on a Web site by use of a Web page mechanism, which is one of application forms of the Internet, an important point is how early and simply the timing of the updating of auction content by putting new tender information into a Web page is sensed by the customer side. In other words, this is a technology for capturing the attention of the customer side at a desired time. In the related-art Internet technologies, a push technology (push configuration) is proposed for this purpose. However, problems remain unsolved for the implementation of effective management of causing the customer side to sense the timing as early and easily as possible.","In addition, a requirement must be satisfied for the auctioneer side, namely the Web page management side, to disclose an auction Web page to only the selected customers for inviting them to an auction.","In order to implement the above-mentioned proposals, the present invention discloses a system based on both electronic mail and Web site mechanisms as an embodiment.","To be more specific, this system is configured so that, when electronic mail is used to capture the attention of a desired particular customer at a desired time and this customer opens the electronic mail addressed thereto when notified the incoming of the electronic mail, a clickable URL is arranged in the document of the electronic mail; clicking this URL causes the browser to automatically set up a predetermined auction Web page. This configuration is intended to made easy transition from the electronic mail mode to the Web site mode via the clickable URL, which is a known technology. This allows each customer to understand an auction without delay by received electronic mail and easily and immediately access the auction Web page.","Also, a known clickable map technology may be effectively applied top this electronic mail configuration.","Further, when arbitrary specifications are required; for example, a particular program genre highly associated with the business field of the customer side is specified or an auction in which to participate is selected by extracting a particular keyword from the title or introduction of a program, an associated auction Web page may be automatically selected by the terminology in an electronic mail document and the selected auction Web page may be automatically set up. For the applicable scripts in this case, XML for example is preferably used in addition to conventional HTML.","The above-mentioned configuration requires for the customer-side browser to have keyword extracting means, Web site selecting means for selecting a corresponding Web site, and display means for selecting any one of plural clickable URLs for display. The means may be configured as browser's inherent functionality, plugins to the browser, or helper applications.","The above-mentioned configuration allows the auctioneer by the application of the electronic mail capability, to selectively transmit tender information only to desired tenderers, can make the information immediately aware of this transmission, and can perform the information transfer between the auctioneer and the tenderer including the transmission of auction application information from the tenderers simply, quickly, and inexpensively by use of the Internet Web page capability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0253","num":"0282"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 20"]},"An on-air content automatic sending system CTAS associated with the present invention comprises a system management server SpSV for managing the operation of the entire system, a broadcast sales information server SiSV, a realtime on-air information server RpSV, CM auction business logic Blgc, a database apparatus DB, a content sending server CsSV, a Web server webSV, an application server WebASV, a LAN, and an Internet backbone WebN.","The Internet backbone WebN is connectible to plural service providers WebSPk through WebSPm and a domain name server DNS.
