title: Modified forms of exotoxin A
abstract: exotoxin A or “PE” is a 66 kD, highly potent, cytotoxic protein secreted by the bacterium . Various forms of PE have been coupled to other proteins, such as antibodies, to generate therapeutically useful cytotoxin conjugates that selectively target cells of a desired phenotype (such as tumor cells). In the present invention, peptides spanning the sequence of an approximately 38kD form of exotoxin A protein were analyzed for the presence of immunogenic CD4+ T cell epitopes. Six immunogenic T cell epitopes were identified. Residues were identified within each epitope for introduction of targeted amino acid substitutions to reduce or prevent immunogenic T-cell responses in PE molecules which may be administered to a heterologous host.

These responses include those that elicit a weak clinical effect and those that limit efficacy which can occasionally result in morbidity or even mortality in patients. In particular, serious complications can arise with the production of neutralizing antibodies, especially when they target recombinant self proteins and therefore have the potential to cross react with the patient's own endogenous protein (Lim, 2005). Problems associated with immunogenicity to biologics (i.e., therapeutic medical products; such as, antibodies and recombinant proteins\/polypeptides) have been reduced largely due to advances in molecular biology. There are, however, many recombinant protein biologics that are identical to endogenously expressed human sequences that still elicit potent neutralizing immune responses in patients (Hochuli, 1997; Schellekens et al, 1997; Namaka et al, 2006). The mechanism by which immunogenicity is triggered remains unclear although the tolerance to self proteins may be broken by a number of factors linked to both the product and the patient (reviewed in Chester et al, 2006; Baker and Jones, 2007). For the product, these include dose, frequency of administration, route, immunomodulatory capacity of the protein therapeutic, and the formulation (Jaber and Baker, 2007). For the patient, factors such as immune competence (i.e. whether the patient is receiving immunosuppressive treatment), patient's MHC haplotype and intrinsic tolerance to the protein therapeutic will influence immunogenicity. Regardless of how immunogenicity is triggered, one of the single most important factors in the development of an ensuing immune response is the presence of epitopes that are able to effectively stimulate a potent CD4+ T cell response (reviewed Baker and Jones, 2007).","T cells or T lymphocytes are a subset of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. (The abbreviation \u201cT\u201d in T cell is for \u201c\u201d since this is the primary organ responsible for T cell maturation.) T cells play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. They can be distinguished from other types of lymphocytes (such as B cells and natural killer cells (NK cells)), by the presence of cell-surface proteins called T cell receptors (TCRs). Different types of T cells have also been identified; these can be distinguished based on the differing functions they serve (e.g., CD4+ T cells (a.k.a., Tor T helper cells), CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), memory T cells, regulatory T cells (Tcells), natural killer cells (NK cells), and gamma delta T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 T cells)).","T helper (T) cells are so named because they aid other white blood cells in immunologic processes including, inter alia, assisting the maturation of B cells into plasma and B memory cells, and activation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. Tcells are also known as CD4+ T cells because they express CD4 protein on the cell-surface. CD4+ T cells are activated when peptide antigens are presented by MHC class II molecules expressed on the surface of Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). Once activated, CD4+ T cells divide rapidly and secrete chemokines that further assist in activating or regulating immune responses.","T cell epitope analysis is becoming increasingly important particularly in the pre-clinical analysis of biologics and may, in time, become a requirement for regulatory approval for clinical trials. To this end, a pre-clinical ex vivo T cell assay (EPISCREEN\u2122) has been used to provide an effective technology for predicting T cell immunogenicity by identifying linear T cell epitopes present in protein sequences. Synthetic overlapping peptides typically of about 15 amino acids in length are tested against a cohort of community blood donors carefully selected based on MHC class II haplotypes to provide a quantitative analysis of T cell epitopes present in protein sequences. This technology has been used successfully to compare protein variants for the potential to induce an immune response in vivo. By providing a high degree of sensitivity along with high reproducibility, the EPISCREEN\u2122 assay allows an accurate pre-clinical assessment of the potential for immunogenicity of biologics.

See e.g., Siegall et al., , vol. 30, pp. 7154-7159 (1991); Theuer et al., 267, no. 24, pp. 16872-16877 (1992); and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,238. PE-A domain IA (amino acids 1-252 (see e.g., SEQ ID NO:133)) is responsible for cell binding. Domain II (amino acids 253-364 (see e.g., SEQ ID NO:133)) is responsible for translocation of PE-A into the cell cytosol. Domain III, the cytotoxic domain (amino acids 400-613 (see e.g., SEQ ID NO:133)), is responsible for ADP ribosylation of Elongation Factor 2 (EF2); which thereby inactivates EF2, subsequently causing cell death. Additionally, a function for domain IB (amino acids 365-399 (SEQ ID NO:139)) has not been established. Indeed, it has been reported that amino acids 365-380 (SEQ ID NO:138) within domain IB can be deleted without producing an identifiable a loss of function. See, Siegall et al., , vol. 30, pp. 7154-7159 (1991).","It has also been reported that PE-A may comprise any one of at least three different carboxy-terminal tails (); these appear to be essential for maintaining or recycling proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. See, Theuer et al., ., vol. 267, no. 24, pp. 16872-16877 (1992); Chaudhary et al., , vol. 87, pp. 308-312 (1990); and, Seetharam et al., ., vol. 266, 17376-17381 (1991). In particular, in correspondence with the exemplary sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:133) these alternative carboxy-terminal tails comprise amino acid sequences:","609-REDLK-613 (SEQ ID NO:135);","609-REDL-612 (SEQ ID NO:136); and","609-KDEL-612 (SEQ ID NO:137).","Variants of PE-A, modified to lack the cell binding domain but coupled to heterologous cell-specific targeting molecules (e.g., antibodies), have been shown to have reduced levels of non-specific toxicity. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,827.","Various forms of PE-A (e.g., truncated\/deletion forms with molecular weights of \u02dc37 kD, 38 kD, 40 kD, et cetera) have been combined with a number of growth factors, antibodies, and other proteins to generate cytotoxins which selectively target cells of a desired phenotype. See, for example:\n\n","A significant disadvantage in using PE-A for treatment of disease, however, is that it is a foreign (non-self) protein being introduced into a heterologous host (e.g., a human). Introduction of non-self proteins into heterologous hosts commonly elicits host immune reactions, such as the generation of antibodies (\u201cneutralizing antibodies\u201d) or immune cell reactions (e.g., cytotoxic T cell responses) which are directed at eliminating the non-self protein (i.e., PE-A). Accordingly, it would be advantageous if elements of PE-A (PE-A epitopes) which are recognized and targeted as \u201cnon-self\u201d could be removed prior to use of this molecule as a therapeutic agent.","Deimmunization of PE","Some investigators have previously attempted to identify and remove immunogenic determinants from PE-A (i.e., to \u201cdeimmunize\u201d PE-A). See, for example:\n\n","Despite progress in the area of deimmunization of PE-A, there remains a need for the development of optimized, less immunogenic or non-immunogenic, biologically active forms of this useful cytotoxin. The invention described herein addresses this need.","Peptides spanning the sequence of an approximately 38 kD (predicted molecular weight) form of exotoxin A protein (SEQ ID NO:1) were analyzed for the presence of immunogenic CD4+ T cell epitopes. A total of 120 overlapping 15 mer peptides spanning this sequence (SEQ ID NO:1), but also including an amino terminal (Gly-Ser)linker sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) to produce a 359 amino acid Gly-Ser-PE38 polypeptide sequence (SEQ ID NO:2), were tested against a cohort of healthy human donors. CD4+ T cell responses against individual peptides were measured via proliferation assays. Assay data was used to compile a T cell epitope map of the PE38 sequence. Six immunogenic T cell epitopes were identified. Residues were then identified within each of these epitopes for use in targeted amino acid substitutions to reduce or prevent PE38-induced immunogenicity. Reduction or prevention of PE immunogenicity should allow for multiple therapeutic administrations of cytotoxic PE for use, for example, in the targeted destruction of cancer cells in vivo (such as when administered as an immunoconjugate or cell-surface targeted fusion protein).","I. Definitions and Descriptions","Unless specifically indicated otherwise, as used herein the term \u201cPE\u201d or \u201cPE-A\u201d is intended to indicate a polypeptide comprising a cytotoxic polypeptide sequence derived from a wild-type or naturally occurring form of exotoxin A protein. In addition to cytotoxic polypeptide sequences, PE polypeptides may comprise additional naturally occurring or heterologous polypeptide sequences. Additional naturally occurring polypeptide sequences may include sequences such as are found in full-length exotoxin A protein, for example, amino acid sequences responsible for cytosolic translocation and cell-specific targeting (as discussed further herein)). Additional heterologous polypeptide sequences may include sequences with which at least a PE cytotoxic polypeptide is fused to impart additional functions or properties. (For example, a PE cytotoxic polypeptide may be fused to antigen binding polypeptide sequences such as an scFv antibody.) Examples of sequences comprising a cytotoxic portion of PE can be found in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:4 spanning amino acid residues Phe-134 to Lys-347. Examples of sequences comprising a cytotoxic portion of PE can also be found in SEQ ID NO:133 and SEQ ID NO:134 spanning amino acid residues Phe-400 to Lys-613.","As used herein in reference to PE, unless indicated otherwise, a \u201ccytotoxic polypeptide\u201d or \u201ccytotoxic polypeptide sequence\u201d is intended to indicate a polypeptide (or portion thereof) which is capable of inactivating translation elongation factor 2 (EF-2), mediating ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, inhibiting protein synthesis, or inducing cell death. For example, it has been demonstrated that PE domain III, comprised of amino acid residues 400-613 of SEQ ID NO:133, is sufficient to mediate ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 and thereby cause cell death. See, Theuer et al., ., vol. 267, no. 24, pp. 16872-16877 (1992) and Hwang et al., , vol. 48, pp. 129-136 (1987).","Cytotoxic polypeptide sequences in the present invention may also comprise alternative carboxy-terminal sequences. See, Theuer et al., Chaudhary et al. and, Seetharam et al. In particular embodiments, examples of carboxy-terminal tails of PE38 in the present invention may comprise sequences as shown in  (SEQ ID NO:133). Hence, exemplary alternative carboxy-terminal tails may comprise amino acid sequences:\n\n","Unless specifically indicated otherwise, as used herein the term \u201cPE38\u201d is intended to indicate a exotoxin A (PE (or PE-A)) molecule comprising an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. The amino acid sequence used to generate peptide sequences referenced in the Examples is shown in SEQ ID NO:2. SEQ ID NO:2 comprises an amino terminal GGGGGSGGGGGS linker sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) fused to the PE38 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1. A variant form of PE38 is shown in SEQ ID NO:4. SEQ ID NO:4 differs from SEQ ID NO:1 by comprising a Ser-to-Asn change at position 114, a Ile-to-Val change at position 141, and a Gly-to-Ser change at position 249.","As used herein, unless specifically stated otherwise, \u201cbiological activity\u201d in reference to exotoxin A (PE-A), PE or PE38 is intended to indicate at least one of the biological activities exhibited by naturally occurring forms of the exotoxin A molecule. These activities include, for example, cell killing or cell cytotoxic activity (a.k.a., cell cytotoxicity), inactivation of translation elongation factor EF-2, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, and inhibition of protein synthesis. The biological activity of PE and PE38 polypeptides (and modified forms thereof; e.g., PE and PE38 amino acid substituted variants and fusion proteins) can be measured using assays and experiments which are well-known and routinely used by those skilled in the art. Examples of some of these assays and experiments are further described and referenced herein, without limitation, in the Examples sections included herein.","As used herein, the term \u201chaving exotoxin A (PE-A) biological activity\u201d (or \u201cPE biological activity\u201d) is intended to indicate molecules exhibiting about 5% or more of at least one biological activity compared to a corresponding wild-type, naturally occurring, or non-amino acid substituted form of PE or PE-A. In some embodiments, molecules \u201chaving exotoxin A biological activity\u201d (or \u201cPE biological activity\u201d) exhibit 5% or more, about 10% or more, 10% or more, about 15% or more, 15% or more, about 20% or more, 20% or more, about 25% or more, 25% or more, about 30% or more, 30% or more, about 35% or more, 35% or more, about 40% or more, 40% or more, about 45% or more, 45% or more, about 50% or more, 50% or more, about 60% or more, 60% or more, about 70% or more, 70% or more, about 75% or more, 75% or more, about 80% or more, 80% or more, about 85% or more, 85% or more, about 90% or more, 90% or more, about 95% or more, 95% or more, about 100%, or 100% of at least one biological activity compared to a corresponding wild-type, naturally occurring, or non-amino acid substituted forms of PE or PE-A.","As used herein, the term \u201cwild-type\u201d exotoxin A (PE-A) (or \u201cwild-type\u201d PE) biological activity is intended to indicate at least one or more biological activities exhibited by naturally occurring forms of the exotoxin A (PE-A) or PE polypeptides. These include, for example, without limitation, activities such as cell killing or cell cytotoxic activity (a.k.a., cell cytotoxicity), inactivation of translation elongation factor EF-2, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Two examples, without limitation, of polypeptide sequences representing \u201cwild-type\u201d or non-amino acid substituted forms of PE-A are shown in SEQ ID NO:133 and SEQ ID NO:134. Two examples, without limitation, of polypeptide sequences representing \u201cwild-type\u201d or non-amino acid substituted forms of PE are shown in SEQ ID NO:1 (PE38) and SEQ ID NO:4 (variant of PE38).","As used or claimed herein the term \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d in reference to the subsequent recited entity refers to one or more of that entity; for example, \u201ca PE38 antibody\u201d or \u201ca polynucleotide encoding PE38\u201d is understood to indicate one or more PE38 antibody molecules and one or more polynucleotides encoding PE38, not a single PE38 antibody molecule nor a single polynucleotide molecule encoding PE38, respectively. As such, the terms \u201ca\u201d (or \u201can\u201d), \u201cone or more,\u201d and \u201cat least one\u201d can be used interchangeably herein.","Likewise, as used herein, the term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is intended to encompass a singular \u201cpolypeptide\u201d as well as plural \u201cpolypeptides,\u201d and refers to a molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linked by amide bonds (also known as peptide bonds). The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to any chain or chains of two or more amino acids, and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides, dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides, \u201cprotein,\u201d \u201camino acid chain,\u201d or any other term used to refer to a chain or chains of two or more amino acids, are included within the definition of \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d and the term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d may be used instead of, or interchangeably with any of these terms. The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is also intended to refer to the products of post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, such as, but without limitation glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, et cetera. A \u201cpolypeptide\u201d unless specifically described otherwise herein, may be derived from a natural biological source or produced by recombinant technology, but is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It may be generated in any manner, including by chemical synthesis.","Polypeptides may have a defined three-dimensional structure, although they do not necessarily have such structure. Polypeptides with a defined three-dimensional structure may be referred to as \u201cfolded\u201d or having a \u201ctertiary\u201d structure. Polypeptides not configured into a three-dimensional structure, are referred to as unfolded. As used herein, the term glycoprotein refers to a protein coupled to at least one carbohydrate moiety attached to the protein via a covalent bond.","The term \u201cisolated\u201d is intended to indicate a biological component no longer in its naturally occurring milieu. For example, an \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d or \u201cisolated polynucleotide\u201d is intended to indicate a polypeptide or polynucleotide, respectively, which has been removed from its naturally occurring milieu and which may have been inserted within a non-naturally occurring milieu. By way of example, this would include, without limitation, a polynucleotide which has been removed from a naturally occurring location within a host genome, and subsequently inserted, for example, into an expression vector or inserted into a new host genome location or into the genome of a heterologous host organism. The \u201cisolation\u201d of a polypeptide or polynucleotide, as used herein, requires no particular level of purification. For example, recombinantly produced polypeptides expressed in host cells are considered isolated for purposes of the invention, as are native or recombinant polypeptides which have been separated, fractionated, or partially or substantially purified by any suitable technique.","Polypeptide embodiments also include fragments, derivatives, analogs, variants and fusion proteins; preferably but not necessarily wherein such embodiments retain one or more biological activities associated with a corresponding full-length or naturally occurring polypeptide. Fragments include proteolytic fragments, deletion fragments, and fragments encoded by synthetically or recombinantly produced polynucleotides. Variants may occur naturally or be non-naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants may be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques. Variant polypeptides may comprise conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions. Derivatives include, but are not limited to, polypeptides which contain one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids, non-standard amino acids, and amino acid analogs. Polypeptide embodiments may comprise amino acid sequences which are at least 60% identical, at least 70% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:1.","Unless specifically defined otherwise, the term \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d is intended to indicate nucleic acid molecules or constructs as routinely used and understood by those of skill in the art. For example, nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, molecules such as messenger RNA (mRNA), plasmid DNA (pDNA), complementary DNA (cDNA), and genomic DNA (gDNA). A polynucleotide may comprise a conventional phosphodiester bond or a non-conventional bond (e.g., an amide bond, such as found in peptide nucleic acids (PNA)). The terms \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d and \u201cnucleic acid\u201d are intended to include embodiments wherein any one or more sequences of polynucleotide or nucleic acid segments are contained, or comprised within, a larger polynucleotide or nucleic acid sequence. For example, but without limitation, and unless stated otherwise to the contrary herein, reference to a nucleic acid such as \u201ca polynucleotide encoding PE38\u201d is intended to include nucleic acids comprising \u201ca polynucleotide encoding PE38\u201d wherein such polynucleotide may also be part of a larger nucleic acid or polynucleotide, such as an expression vector or a polynucleotide\/nucleic acid encoding an PE fusion protein.","An \u201cisolated\u201d nucleic acid or polynucleotide is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or RNA, which has been removed from its native environment. For example, a recombinant polynucleotide encoding an antibody contained in a vector is considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of an isolated polynucleotide include recombinant polynucleotides maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) polynucleotides in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro synthesized RNA molecules; including synthetically produced molecules.","As used herein, a \u201ccoding region\u201d is a portion of nucleic acid containing codons which may be translated into amino acids, although \u201cstop codons\u201d (TAG, TGA, or TAA) are not translated into an amino acids, but may also be considered to be part of a coding region. Unless stated otherwise herein, promoters, ribosome binding sites, transcriptional terminators, introns, and the like, are not considered part of a coding region. Two or more coding regions of the present invention can be present in a single polynucleotide construct, e.g., on a single vector, or in separate polynucleotide constructs, e.g., on separate (different) vectors. Furthermore, any vector may contain a single coding region, or may comprise two or more coding regions, e.g., a single vector may separately encode an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region and an immunoglobulin light chain variable region. In addition, a vector, polynucleotide, or nucleic acid embodiments may encode heterologous coding regions, either fused or unfused to a nucleic acid encoding a different heterologous polypeptide. Heterologous coding regions include without limitation specialized elements or motifs, such as a secretory signal peptide or a heterologous functional domains.","In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide or nucleic acid is DNA. In the case of DNA, a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide normally may include a promoter and\/or other transcription or translation control elements operably associated with one or more coding regions. An operable association is when a coding region for a gene product, e.g., a polypeptide, is associated with one or more regulatory sequences in such a way as to place expression of the gene product under the influence or control of the regulatory sequence(s). Two DNA fragments (such as a polypeptide coding region and a promoter associated therewith) are \u201coperably associated\u201d if induction of promoter function results in the transcription of mRNA encoding the desired gene product. Thus, a promoter region would be operably associated with a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide if the promoter was capable of effecting transcription of that nucleic acid. Other transcription control elements, besides a promoter, include for example, but without limitation, enhancers, operators, repressors, and transcription termination signals, can be operably associated with the polynucleotide to direct cell-specific transcription. Suitable promoters and other transcription control regions are disclosed herein.","The terms \u201cantibody\u201d and \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d may be used interchangeably herein. An antibody or immunoglobulin comprises at least the antigen-binding elements (e.g., complementarity determining regions or CDRs) of the variable domain of a heavy chain and\/or of the variable domain of a light chain. Basic immunoglobulin structures in vertebrate systems are well understood by those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Harlow & Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1999 (ISBN 0879695447)); see also, Harlow & Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988). The term \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d or \u201cantibody\u201d comprises various broad classes of antibody molecules, such as, but without limitation, IgG, IgM, IgA IgG, and IgE classes of antibodies; as well as antibody subclasses (isotypes), such as, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, et cetera.","Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments, variants, or derivatives thereof of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized, primatized, or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, epitope-binding fragments, e.g., Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032), Fd, Fvs, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies.","As used herein, an \u201cepitope\u201d or \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d is the part of a polypeptide, antigen, or molecule that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. Epitopes of polypeptide antigens may function as conformational epitopes or linear epitopes. A conformational epitope is comprised of non-linear sections of a target molecule (such as that formed via the tertiary structure of a folded polypeptide). In contrast, amino acids that make up a linear epitope may be comprised of a continuous sequence of amino acids or may be comprised only of particular amino acid residues critical to antibody\/B cell\/T cell binding.","By \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d it is generally meant that an antibody binds to an epitope via its antigen binding domain, and that the binding entails some complementarity between the antigen binding domain and the epitope. According to this definition, an antibody is said to \u201cspecifically bind\u201d to an epitope when it binds to that epitope, via its antigen binding domain more readily than it would bind to a random, unrelated epitope. The term \u201cspecificity\u201d may be used herein to qualify the relative affinity by which a certain antibody binds to a certain epitope. For example, antibody \u201cA\u201d may be deemed to have a higher specificity for a given epitope than antibody \u201cB,\u201d or antibody \u201cA\u201d may be said to bind to epitope \u201cC\u201d with a higher specificity than it has for related epitope \u201cD.\u201d","By \u201cpreferentially binds,\u201d it is meant that the antibody specifically binds to an epitope more readily than it would bind to a related, similar, homologous, or analogous epitope. Thus, an antibody which \u201cpreferentially binds\u201d to a given epitope would more likely bind to that epitope than to a related epitope, even though such an antibody may cross-react with the related epitope.","An antibody is said to competitively inhibit binding of a reference antibody to a given epitope if it preferentially binds to that epitope to the extent that it blocks, to some degree, binding of the reference antibody to the epitope. Competitive inhibition may be determined by any method known in the art, for example, competition ELISA assays. An antibody may be said to competitively inhibit binding of the reference antibody to a given epitope by at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50%.","As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to a measure of the strength of the binding of an individual epitope with the CDR of an immunoglobulin molecule. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988) at pages 27-28. As used herein, the term \u201cavidity\u201d refers to the overall stability of the complex between a population of immunoglobulins and an antigen, that is, the functional combining strength of an immunoglobulin mixture with the antigen. See, e.g., Harlow at pages 29-34. Avidity is related to both the affinity of individual immunoglobulin molecules in the population with specific epitopes, and also the valencies of the immunoglobulins and the antigen. For example, the interaction between a bivalent monoclonal antibody and an antigen with a highly repeating epitope structure, such as a polymer, would be one of high avidity.","The term \u201ccross-reactivity\u201d refers to the ability of an antibody, specific for one antigen, to react with a second antigen; a measure of relatedness between two different antigenic substances. Thus, an antibody is cross reactive if it binds to an epitope other than the one that induced its formation. The cross reactive epitope generally contains many of the same complementary structural features as the inducing epitope, and in some cases, may actually fit better than the original.","As used herein, the terms \u201clinked,\u201d \u201cfused\u201d or \u201cfusion\u201d may be used interchangeably. These terms refer to the joining together of two more elements or components, by whatever means including chemical conjugation or recombinant means. An \u201cin-frame fusion\u201d refers to the joining of two or more polynucleotide open reading frames (ORFs) to form a continuous longer ORF, in a manner that maintains the correct translational reading frame of the original ORFs. Thus, a recombinant fusion protein is a single protein containing two ore more segments that correspond to polypeptides encoded by the original ORFs (which segments are not normally so joined in nature.) Although the reading frame is thus made continuous throughout the fused segments, the segments may be physically or spatially separated by, for example, in-frame linker sequence. For example, polynucleotides encoding the CDRs of an immunoglobulin variable region may be fused, in-frame, but be separated by a polynucleotide encoding at least one immunoglobulin framework region or additional CDR regions, as long as the \u201cfused\u201d CDRs are co-translated as part of a continuous polypeptide.","In the context of polypeptides, a \u201clinear sequence\u201d or a \u201csequence\u201d is an order of amino acids in a polypeptide in an amino to carboxyl terminal direction in which residues that neighbor each other in the sequence are contiguous in the primary structure of the polypeptide.","A \u201cvariant\u201d of a polypeptide or protein refers to any analogue, fragment, derivative, or mutant which is derived from a polypeptide or protein and which retains at least one biological property of the polypeptide or protein. Different variants of the polypeptide or protein may exist in nature or may be generated artificially (e.g., via synthetic or genetic engineering). Variants may be allelic variations characterized by differences in the nucleotide sequences of the structural gene coding for the protein, or may involve differential splicing or post-translational modification. The skilled artisan can produce variants having single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or replacements. Variants may include, inter alia: (a) variants in which one or more amino acid residues are substituted with, for example, conservative amino acids, non-conservative amino acids, or amino acid analogs (b) variants in which one or more amino acids are added to the polypeptide or protein, (c) variants in which one or more of the amino acids includes a substituent group, and (d) variants in which the polypeptide or protein is fused with another polypeptide such as serum albumin. The techniques for obtaining these variants, including genetic (suppressions, deletions, mutations, etc.), chemical, and enzymatic techniques, are known to those of skill in the art.","The term \u201cexpression\u201d as used herein refers to a process by which a gene produces a biochemical, for example, an RNA or polypeptide. It includes without limitation transcription of the gene into RNA molecules such as, for example, messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or any other RNA product, and the translation of mRNA into polypeptide(s).","Expression of a gene produces a \u201cgene product.\u201d As used herein, a gene product can be either a nucleic acid, e.g., a messenger RNA produced by transcription of a gene, or a polypeptide which is translated from a transcript.

Accordingly, a chimeric gene may comprise regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from different sources, or regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived from the same source, but arranged in a manner different than that found in nature. A chimeric gene may comprise coding sequences derived from different sources and\/or regulatory sequences derived from different sources. \u201cEndogenous gene\u201d refers to a native gene in its natural location in the genome of an organism.

When the RNA transcript is a perfect complementary copy of the DNA sequence, it is referred to as the primary transcript or it may be a RNA sequence derived from post-transcriptional processing of the primary transcript and is referred to as the mature RNA. \u201cMessenger RNA (mRNA)\u201d refers to the RNA that is without introns and that can be translated into protein by the cell. \u201ccDNA\u201d refers to a double-stranded DNA that is complementary to and derived from mRNA. \u201cSense\u201d RNA refers to RNA transcript that includes the mRNA and so can be translated into protein by the cell. \u201cAntisense RNA\u201d refers to a RNA transcript that is complementary to all or part of a target primary transcript or mRNA and that blocks the expression of a target gene. The complementarity of an antisense RNA may be with any part of the specific gene transcript, i.e., at the 5\u2032 non-coding sequence, 3\u2032 non-coding sequence, or the coding sequence.","A \u201cvector\u201d refers to any vehicle for the cloning of and\/or transfer of a nucleic acid into a host cell. A vector may be a replicon to which another DNA segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. A \u201creplicon\u201d refers to any genetic element (e.g., plasmid, phage, cosmid, chromosome, virus) that functions as an autonomous unit of DNA replication in vivo, i.e., capable of replication under its own control. The term \u201cvector\u201d includes both viral and nonviral vehicles for introducing the nucleic acid into a cell in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. A large number of vectors known in the art may be used to manipulate nucleic acids, incorporate coding sequences into genes, et cetera. Possible vectors include, for example, plasmids or modified viruses including, for example bacteriophages such as lambda derivatives, or plasmids such as pBR322 or pUC plasmid derivatives, or the Bluescript vector. Another example of vectors that are useful in the present invention is the Ultra Vector\u2122 Production System (Intrexon Corp., Blacksburg, Va.) as described in WO 2007\/038276, incorporated by reference herein. For example, the insertion of the DNA fragments corresponding to response elements and promoters into a suitable vector for in vitro and\/or in vivo expression of modified forms of PE (and fragments therof) as described herein (including fusion proteins, conjugates, and otherwise linked forms) can be accomplished by ligating the appropriate DNA fragments into a chosen vector that has complementary cohesive termini. Alternatively, the ends of the DNA molecules may be enzymatically modified or any site may be produced by ligating nucleotide sequences (linkers) into the DNA termini. Such vectors may be engineered to contain selectable marker genes that provide for the selection of cells that have incorporated the marker into the cellular genome. Such markers allow identification and\/or selection of host cells that incorporate and express the proteins encoded by the marker.","Viral vectors, and particularly retroviral vectors, have been used in a wide variety of gene delivery applications in cells, as well as living animal subjects. Viral vectors that can be used to express embodiments of the invention described herein include, but are not limited to, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, pox, baculovirus, vaccinia, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, adenovirus, geminivirus, and caulimovirus vectors.

In addition to a nucleic acid, a vector may also comprise one or more regulatory regions, and\/or selectable markers useful in selecting, measuring, and monitoring nucleic acid transfer results (e.g., monitoring transfer to target or non-target tissues, duration of expression, et cetera).","The term \u201cplasmid\u201d refers to an extra-chromosomal element often carrying a gene that is not part of the central metabolism of the cell, and usually in the form of circular double-stranded DNA molecules. Such elements may be autonomously replicating sequences, genome integrating sequences, phage or nucleotide sequences, linear, circular, or supercoiled, of a single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA, derived from any source, in which a number of nucleotide sequences have been joined or recombined into a unique construction which is capable of introducing a promoter fragment and DNA sequence for a selected gene product along with appropriate 3\u2032 untranslated sequence into a cell.","A \u201ccloning vector\u201d refers to a \u201creplicon,\u201d which is a unit length of a nucleic acid, preferably DNA, that replicates sequentially and which comprises an origin of replication, such as a plasmid, phage or cosmid, to which another nucleic acid segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. Cloning vectors may be capable of replication in one cell type and expression in another (\u201cshuttle vector\u201d).

The term \u201cexpression vector\u201d refers to a vector, plasmid or vehicle designed to enable the expression of an inserted nucleic acid sequence following transformation into the host. The cloned gene, i.e., the inserted nucleic acid sequence, is usually placed under the control of control elements such as a promoter, a minimal promoter, an enhancer, or the like. Initiation control regions or promoters, which are useful to drive expression of a nucleic acid in the desired host cell are numerous and familiar to those skilled in the art. Virtually any promoter capable of driving expression of these genes can be used in an expression vector, including but not limited to, viral promoters, bacterial promoters, animal promoters, mammalian promoters, synthetic promoters, constitutive promoters, tissue specific promoters, pathogenesis or disease related promoters, developmental specific promoters, inducible promoters, light regulated promoters; CYCl, HIS3, GALl, GAL4, GALlO, ADHl, PGK, PH05, GAPDH, ADCl, TRPl, URA3, LEU2, ENO, TPI, alkaline phosphatase promoters (useful for expression in ); AOXl promoter (useful for expression in ); \u03b2-lactamase, lac, ara, tet, trp, IP, IP, T7, tac, and trc promoters (useful for expression in ); light regulated-, seed specific-, pollen specific-, ovary specific-, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S, CMV 35S minimal, cassava vein mosaic virus (CsVMV), chlorophyll a\/b binding protein, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, shoot-specific, root specific, chitinase, stress inducible, rice tungro bacilliform virus, plant super-promoter, potato leucine aminopeptidase, nitrate reductase, mannopine synthase, nopaline synthase, ubiquitin, zein protein, and anthocyanin promoters (useful for expression in plant cells); animal and mammalian promoters known in the art including, but are not limited to, the SV40 early (SV40e) promoter region, the promoter contained in the 3\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR) of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the promoters of the E1A or major late promoter (MLP) genes of adenoviruses (Ad), the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, a baculovirus IE1 promoter, an elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1) promoter, a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, a ubiquitin (Ubc) promoter, an albumin promoter, the regulatory sequences of the mouse metallothionein-L promoter and transcriptional control regions, the ubiquitous promoters (HPRT, vimentin, \u03b1-actin, tubulin and the like), the promoters of the intermediate filaments (desmin, neurofilaments, keratin, GFAP, and the like), the promoters of therapeutic genes (of the MDR, CFTR or factor VIII type, and the like), pathogenesis or disease related-promoters, and promoters that exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals, such as the elastase I gene control region which is active in pancreatic acinar cells; insulin gene control region active in pancreatic beta cells, immunoglobulin gene control region active in lymphoid cells, mouse mammary tumor virus control region active in testicular, breast, lymphoid and mast cells; albumin gene, Apo AI and Apo A11 control regions active in liver, alpha-fetoprotein gene control region active in liver, alpha 1-antitrypsin gene control region active in the liver, beta-globin gene control region active in myeloid cells, myelin basic protein gene control region active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain, myosin light chain-2 gene control region active in skeletal muscle, and gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region active in the hypothalamus, pyruvate kinase promoter, villin promoter, promoter of the fatty acid binding intestinal protein, promoter of the smooth muscle cell \u03b1-actin, and the like.

For example, via use of liposomes for encapsulation and transfection of nucleic acids in vitro. Synthetic cationic lipids designed to limit the difficulties encountered with liposome-mediated transfection can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Feigner et al, USA. 84:7413 (1987); Mackey et al, USA 85:8027 (1988); and Ulmer et al, 259:1745 (1993)). Use of cationic lipids may promote encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids, and also promote fusion with negatively charged cell membranes (Feigner et al, 337:387 (1989)). Particularly useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic acids are described in WO95\/18863, WO96\/17823 and U.S. Pat.

Selectable marker genes may also be considered reporter genes.","\u201cPromoter and \u201cpromoter sequence\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to a DNA sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is located 3\u2032 to a promoter sequence. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic DNA segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental or physiological conditions. Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as \u201cconstitutive promoters.\u201d Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed in a specific cell type are commonly referred to as \u201ccell-specific promoters\u201d or \u201ctissue-specific promoters.\u201d Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed at a specific stage of development or cell differentiation are commonly referred to as \u201cdevelopmentally-specific promoters\u201d or \u201ccell differentiation-specific promoters.\u201d Promoters that are induced and cause a gene to be expressed following exposure or treatment of the cell with an agent, biological molecule, chemical, ligand, light, or the like that induces the promoter are commonly referred to as \u201cinducible promoters\u201d or \u201cregulatable promoters.\u201d It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, DNA fragments of different lengths may have identical promoter activity.","The promoter sequence is typically bounded at its 3\u2032 terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5\u2032 direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. Within the promoter sequence will be found a transcription initiation site (conveniently defined for example, by mapping with nuclease S1), as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase.","A coding sequence is \u201cunder the control\u201d of transcriptional and translational control sequences in a cell when RNA polymerase transcribes the coding sequence into mRNA, which is then trans-RNA spliced (if the coding sequence contains nitrons) and translated into the protein encoded by the coding sequence.","\u201cTranscriptional and translational control sequences\u201d refer to DNA regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, terminators, and the like, that provide for the expression of a coding sequence in a host cell.

The half sites can be similar or identical and arranged as either direct or inverted repeats or as a single half site or multimers of adjacent half sites in tandem. The response element may comprise a minimal promoter isolated from different organisms depending upon the nature of the cell or organism into which the response element will be incorporated. The DNA binding domain of the transcription factor binds, in the presence or absence of a ligand, to the DNA sequence of a response element to initiate or suppress transcription of downstream gene(s) under the regulation of this response element.

For example, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence (i.e., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation.","The terms \u201ccassette,\u201d \u201cexpression cassette\u201d and \u201cgene expression cassette\u201d refer to a segment of DNA that can be inserted into a nucleic acid or polynucleotide at specific restriction sites or by homologous recombination.

In the methods disclosed herein, an activating ligand binds to a ligand binding domain, e.g., an ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain, that is part of a ligand-dependent transcriptional activation complex that regulates the expression of a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a gene of interest. Hence, the expression of the gene of interest is regulated in a ligand-dependent fashion.","The term \u201cecdysone receptor-based,\u201d with respect to a gene switch, refers to a gene switch comprising at least a functional part of a naturally occurring or synthetic ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain and which regulates gene expression in response to a ligand that binds to the ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain.","The terms \u201cmodulate\u201d and \u201cmodulates\u201d mean to induce, reduce or inhibit nucleic acid or gene expression, resulting in the respective induction, reduction or inhibition of protein or polypeptide production.","Polynucleotides or vectors comprising sequences encoding polypeptides of the present invention may further comprise at least one promoter suitable for driving expression of a gene in a modified cell.","Enhancers that may be used in embodiments of the invention include but are not limited to: an SV40 enhancer, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer, an elongation factor 1 (EF1) enhancer, yeast enhancers, viral gene enhancers, et cetera.","\u201cRegulatory region\u201d refers to a nucleic acid sequence that regulates the expression of a second nucleic acid sequence. A regulatory region may include sequences which are naturally responsible for expressing a particular nucleic acid (a homologous region) or may include sequences of a different origin that are responsible for expressing different proteins or even synthetic proteins (a heterologous region). In particular, the sequences can be sequences of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, or viral genes or derived sequences that stimulate or repress transcription of a gene in a specific or non-specific manner and in an inducible or non-inducible manner. Regulatory regions include origins of replication, RNA splice sites, promoters, enhancers, transcriptional termination sequences, and signal sequences which direct the polypeptide into the secretory pathways of the target cell.","The term \u201cexogenous gene\u201d or \u201cheterologous gene\u201d means a gene foreign to the subject or organism, that is, a gene which is introduced into the subject through a transformation process, an unmutated version of an endogenous mutated gene or a mutated version of an endogenous unmutated gene. The method of transformation is not critical to this invention and may be any method suitable for the subject known to those in the art. Exogenous genes can be either natural or synthetic genes which are introduced into the subject in the form of DNA or RNA which may function through a DNA intermediate such as by reverse transcriptase.

Additional members of the nuclear receptor family of proteins, known as transcriptional factors (such as DHR38, betaFTZ-1 or other insect homologs), may also be ligand dependent or independent partners for EcR and\/or USP. A LDTFC such as an EcR complex can also be a heterodimer of EcR protein and the vertebrate homolog of ultraspiracle protein, retinoic acid-X-receptor (\u201cRXR\u201d) protein or a chimera of USP and RXR.

The AD may be present as a fusion with a \u201cheterodimerization partner\u201d or \u201cHP.\u201d A fusion protein comprising an AD and HP of the invention is referred to herein as a \u201ccoactivation protein\u201d or \u201cCAP.\u201d The DBD and LBD may be expressed as a fusion protein, referred to herein as a \u201cligand-inducible transcription factor (\u201cLTF\u201d). The fusion partners may be separated by a linker, e.g., a hinge region. Some members of the LTF family may also have another transactivation domain on the carboxy-terminal side of the LBD. The DBD is characterized by the presence of two cysteine zinc fingers between which are two amino acid motifs, the P-box and the D-box, which confer specificity for ecdysone response elements. These domains may be either native, modified, or chimeras of different domains of heterologous receptor proteins.","EcR ligands, when used with a LDTFC, e.g., an EcR complex, which in turn is bound to the response element linked to an exogenous gene (e.g., a reporter gene), provide the means for external temporal regulation of expression of the exogenous gene. The order in which the various components bind to each other, that is, ligand to receptor complex and receptor complex to response element, is not critical. Typically, modulation of expression of the exogenous gene is in response to the binding of a LDTFC, e.g., an EcR complex, to a specific control, or regulatory, DNA element. The EcR protein, like other members of the nuclear receptor family, possesses at least three domains, an AD, a DBD, and a LBD. This receptor, like a subset of the nuclear receptor family, also possesses less well-defined regions responsible for heterodimerization properties (referred to herein as a \u201cheterodimerization partner\u201d or \u201cHP\u201d). Binding of the ligand to the ligand binding domain of a LTF, e.g., an EcR protein, after heterodimerization with a CAP including, e.g., an AD and\/or an HP, e.g., a USP or RXR protein, enables the DNA binding domains of the heterodimeric proteins to bind to the response element in an activated form, thus resulting in expression or suppression of the exogenous gene. This mechanism does not exclude the potential for ligand binding to individual subunits, e.g., LTF or CAP, e.g., an EcR or USP, and the resulting formation of active homodimer complexes (e.g. EcR+EcR or USP+USP). In one embodiment, one or more of the receptor domains can be varied producing a chimeric gene switch. Typically, one or more of the three domains may be chosen from a source different than the source of the other domains so that the chimeric receptor is optimized in the chosen host cell or organism for transactivating activity, complementary binding of the ligand, and recognition of a specific response element. In addition, the response element itself can be modified or substituted with response elements for other DNA binding protein domains such as the GAL-4 protein from yeast (see Sadowski et al., 335:563 (1988) or LexA protein from (see Brent et al., 43:729-736 (1985)) to accommodate chimeric LDTFCs, e.g., EcR complexes. Another advantage of chimeric systems is that they allow choice of a promoter used to drive the exogenous gene according to a desired end result. Such double control can be particularly important in areas of gene therapy, especially when cytotoxic proteins are produced, because both the timing of expression as well as the cells wherein expression occurs can be controlled. When exogenous genes, operatively linked to a suitable promoter, are introduced into the cells of the subject, expression of the exogenous genes is controlled by the presence of the ligand of this invention. Promoters may be constitutively or inducibly regulated or may be tissue-specific (that is, expressed only in a particular type of cell) or specific to certain developmental stages of the organism.","For in vivo use, the ligands described herein may be taken up in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as, for example, solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, ointments, elixirs, and injectable compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may contain from 0.01% to 99% by weight of the ligand. Compositions may be either in single or multiple dose forms. The amount of ligand in any particular pharmaceutical composition will depend upon the effective dose, that is, the dose required to elicit the desired gene expression or suppression.","Suitable routes of administering the pharmaceutical preparations include oral, rectal, topical (including dermal, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural) and by naso-gastric tube. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the preferred route of administration will depend upon the condition being treated and may vary with factors such as the condition of the recipient.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat\u201d or \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development, progression or spread (i.e., metastasis) of cancer.

Use of a wide variety of expression vectors are well-known and routinely used by those skilled in the art. A few examples of the types of expression vectors which may be used include, but are not limited to: derivatives of human or animal viruses (such as retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, pox, baculovirus, vaccinia, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, adenovirus, geminivirus, and caulimovirus vectors) and insect viruses (such as baculovirus); yeast vectors; bacteriophage vectors (e.g., bacteriophage lambda); plasmids; cosmids; artificial chromosomes; liposomes; electrically charged lipids (cytofectins); DNA-protein complexes, and biopolymers.","Gene Delivery and Expression Systems","A wide variety of methods (i.e., gene delivery systems) are available and well-known to those of skill in the art; any of such methods may be used for introducing nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE into a cell, tissue, or organism for in vitro, in vivo, in situ, or ex vivo expression. The methods referenced below represent examples of ways in which nucleic acid(s) encoding modified forms of PE may be introduced into a cell. These examples are in no way intended to limit the scope of that may be used for gene delivery and expression of modified forms of PE in cells, tissues, or organisms; these examples are presented to illustrate the many available methods.","\u2014Viral-Based Delivery of Target Nucleic Acids\u2014","Gene therapy based methods can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). As one example, polynucleotides operably encoding the target nucleic acid can be delivered to a tissue or organism either as \u201cnaked nucleic acid\u201d or as part of an expression vector. The term vector includes for example, but is not limited to, vectors such as plasmid vectors, cosmid vectors, artificial chromosome vectors, and viral vectors. Some examples of viral vectors include adenovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), alphavirus, simian virus 40, picomavirus, vaccinia virus, retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus. Vectors encoding modified forms of PE may be capable of replication in a cell in which it is introduced, or it may be preferred that the vector is not capable of replication. Vectors encoding modified forms of PE may be capable of integration into the genomic DNA of a cell (and subsequent expression therefrom), or it may be preferred that the vector is not capable of integrating into the host genome. An example of a vector that can integrate into the genomic DNA of a cell is a retroviral vector, in which an integrase enzyme mediates integration of the retroviral vector sequences. A vector may also contain transposon sequences that facilitate integration of the coding region into the genomic DNA of a host cell. Liposomes represent another manner in which target DNA may be delivered to a subject.","Selection of a vector depends upon a variety of desired characteristics in the resulting construct, such as a selection marker, vector replication rate, type of target host cell, species of host organism, desired duration of protein expression. An expression vector optionally includes expression control sequences operably linked to the coding sequence such that the coding region is expressed in the cell. The invention is not limited by the use of any particular promoter, and a wide variety is known. Promoters act as regulatory signals that bind RNA polymerase in a cell to initiate transcription of a downstream (3\u2032 direction) operably linked coding sequence. The promoter used in the invention may be a constitutive or an inducible promoter. It can be, but need not be, heterologous with respect to the cell to which it is introduced.","In certain embodiments, adenovirus expression vectors can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). The terms \u201cadenovirus expression vector\u201d is meant to include those constructs containing nucleic acid sequences sufficient to (a) support packaging of the construct and (b) to ultimately express a recombinant gene construct that has been inserted therein. In contrast to retroviruses, use of adenovirus vectors does not result in chromosomal integration because adenovirus DNA replicates in an episomal manner. Moreover, adenoviruses are considered to be structurally stable with no genome rearrangement occurring even after extensive virus reproduction and amplification. Methods of constructing and using adenovirus vectors as gene delivery systems are well-known to those of skill in the art.","In certain embodiments, adeno-associated virus (AAV) expression vectors can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). AAV may be desirable for a number or reasons; for example, because AAV vectors exhibit a high frequency of integration, can infect nondividing cells, and have a broad host range. AAV is a dependent parvovirus in that it requires coinfection with another virus (either adenovirus or a member of the herpes virus family) to undergo a productive infection in cultured cells. In the absence of coinfection with helper virus, the wild-type AAV genome integrates through its ends into a human chromosome where it resides as a latent provirus. When a cell containing latent AAV provirus is superinfected with a helper virus, the AAV genome is \u201crescued\u201d from the chromosome and a normal productive infection is established. Methods of constructing and using AAV vectors as gene delivery systems are well-known to those of skill in the art.","In certain embodiments, retrovirus expression vectors can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). Retroviruses are a group of single-stranded RNA viruses characterized by the ability to convert their genomic RNA to double-stranded DNA in infected cells through a reverse-transcription process. The resulting DNA stably integrates into cellular chromosomes as a provirus and directs synthesis of viral proteins. Retroviral integration results in the retention of viral gene sequences in the recipient cell and in its descendants. Retroviral vectors are able to infect a broad variety of cell types. Methods of constructing and using retroviruses as gene delivery systems are well-known to those of skill in the art.","Many other expression vectors can also be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). For example, vectors derived from viruses such as vaccinia viruses, herpesviruses, equine encephalitis viruses, hepatitis viruses and lentiviruses can be used. Methods of constructing and using viral expression vectors as gene delivery systems are well-known to those of skill in the art. The examples of such vectors referenced herein are not intended to be limiting with respect to the means by which modified forms of PE may be delivered and expressed in various host cells, tissues, or organisms.","\u2014Non-Viral Delivery of Modified Target Nucleic Acids\u2014","In addition to viral delivery of modified target nucleic acid, the following are additional methods of recombinant gene delivery can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). Methods of constructing and using non-viral gene delivery systems are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Al-Dosari et al., \u201cNonviral gene delivery: principle, limitations, and recent progress,\u201d 11(4):671-681 (2009); and references cited therein.","In certain embodiments, electroporation can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). Methods of using electroporation are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, Bodles-Brakhop et al., \u201cElectroporation for the delivery of DNA-based vaccines and immunotherapeutics: current clinical developments,\u201d 17(4):585-592 (2009); and references cited therein. See also, Golzio et al., \u201cObservations of the mechanisms of electromediated DNA uptake\u2014from vesicles to tissues,\u201d 10(4):256-266 (2010); and references cited therein.

See also, Wells, \u201cElectroporation and ultrasound enhanced non-viral gene delivery in vitro and in vivo,\u201d 26(1):21-28 (2010); and references cited therein.","In certain embodiments, particle bombardment can be used to deliver (into a host cell, tissue or organism) target nucleic acids encoding modified forms of PE (and other polynucleotides, as needed, to allow expression of the same). This method depends on the ability to accelerate nucleic acid-coated microprojectiles to a sufficient velocity to allow them to pierce cell membranes, thereby delivering nucleic acid \u201cpayloads,\u201d without killing them.

Stated otherwise, a \u201cgene switch\u201d refers to a peptide, protein or polypeptide complex that functions to (a) bind an activating ligand, and (b) regulate the transcription of a gene of interest in a ligand-dependent fashion.","In one embodiment, the polynucleotide encoding a gene switch is a recombinant polynucleotide, i.e., a polynucleotide, that has been engineered, by molecular biological manipulation, to encode the gene switch. In another embodiment, the recombinant polynucleotide is a synthetic polynucleotide.","As used herein with respect to gene switch regulation systems, the term \u201cdimerizes with the ligand binding domain that binds an activating ligand\u201d refers to a selective protein-protein interaction that is induced by the presence of activating ligand.","As used herein, the term \u201cligand binding domain that binds an activating ligand\u201d refers to an amino acid sequence that selectively binds an activating ligand. In the methods disclosed herein, an activating ligand binds to a ligand binding domain, e.g., an ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain, that is part of a ligand-dependent transcriptional activation complex that regulates the expression of a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a gene of interest. Hence, the expression of the gene of interest is regulated in a ligand-dependent fashion.","The term \u201cecdysone receptor-based,\u201d with respect to a gene switch, refers to a gene switch comprising at least a functional part of a naturally occurring or synthetic ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain and which regulates gene expression in response to a ligand that binds to the ecdysone receptor ligand binding domain.","As used herein, \u201cselective binding\u201d of an activating ligand to a ligand binding domain in a gene switch means that the ligand has an EC50 of about 700 nanomolar (nM), 650 nM, 600 nM, 550 nM, 500 nM, 450 nM, 400 nM, 350 nM, 300 nM, 250 nM, 225 nM, 200 nM, 175 nM, 150 nM, 125 nM, 100 nM, 95 nM, 90 nM, 85 nM, 80 nM, 75 nM 70 nM, 65 nM, 60 nM, 55 nM, 50 nM, 45 nM, 40 nM, 35 nM, 30 nM, 25 nM, 20 nM, 15 nM, 10 nM, 9 nM, 8 nM, 7 nM, 6 nM, 5 nM, 4 nM, 3 nM, 2 nM or 1 nM, or less, in a gene switch assay.","As used herein, \u201cEC50\u201d is the \u201chalf maximal effective concentration,\u201d which refers to the concentration of an activating ligand that induces a gene switch-regulated change in expression of a polynucleotide encoding an gene of interest (e.g., modified forms of PE, including fusions, conjugates, et cetera), that is halfway between the baseline level of expression and the maximum level of expression after a specified exposure time.

Typically, 15 mer peptides with 12 amino acid overlaps spanning a protein sequence are analyzed in a large number of replicate cultures for in vitro CD4+ T cell stimulation by 3H TdR incorporation. CD4+ T cell stimulation is often detected in two or three adjacent and overlapping peptides since the core 9 mer that binds the MHC class II binding groove will be present in more than one peptide sequence. Following identification of peptides that stimulate CD4+ T cells in vitro, in silico technology can be used to design epitope-depleted (deimmunized) variants by determining the precise location of core 9 mer sequences and the location of key MHC class II anchor residues.","A total of 120 overlapping 15 mer peptides spanning the entire Pub 38 sequence (SEQ ID NO:2), including 4 peptides covering a null mutation and 4 peptides spanning an N-terminal linker sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) were tested against a cohort of 52 healthy donors. CD4+ T cell responses against individual peptides were measured using proliferation assays (3H-thymidine incorporation).

Cells were revived in room temperature AIM V\u00ae culture medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) before adjusting the cell density to 2-3\u00d710PBMC\/ml (proliferation cell stock). Peptides were synthesized on a 1-3 mg scale with free N-terminal amine and C-terminal carboxylic acid. Peptides were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM and peptide culture stocks prepared by diluting into AIM V\u00ae culture medium to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM in the well. For each peptide and each donor, sextuplicate cultures were established in a flat bottomed 96 well plate. Both positive and negative control cultures were also tested in sextuplicate. For each donor, three control antigen\/peptides (KLH protein and peptides derived from Influenza A and Epstein Barr viruses) were also included.","Cultures were incubated for a total of 6 days before adding 0.75 \u03bcCi 3[H]-thymidine (PERKIN ELMER\u00ae, Beaconsfield, UK) to each well. Cultures were incubated for a further 18 hours before harvesting onto filter mats using a TOMTEC MACH\u00ae III cell harvester (TOMTEC\u00ae, Hamden, Conn., USA). Counts per minute (cpm) for each well were determined by Meltilex\u2122 (PERKIN ELMER\u00ae) scintillation counting on a Microplate Beta Counter (PERKIN ELMER\u00ae) in paralux, low background counting mode.","EPISCREEN\u2122 Data Analysis","For proliferation assays, an empirical threshold of a stimulation index (SI) equal to or greater than 2 (SI\u22672.00) has been previously established whereby samples inducing proliferative responses above this threshold are deemed positive (where included, borderline SI\u22671.90 are highlighted). Extensive assay development and previous studies have shown that this is the minimum signal to noise threshold allowing maximum sensitivity without detecting large numbers of false positive responses. Positive responses are defined by the following statistical and empirical thresholds:\n\n","In addition, intra-assay variation was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variance and standard deviation (SD) of the raw data from replicate cultures.","Proliferation assays were set up in sextuplicate cultures (\u201cnon-adjusted data\u201d). To ensure that intra-assay variability was low, the data was also analyzed after removing the maximum and minimum cpm values (\u201cadjusted data\u201d) and the SI of donor responses was compared using both data sets.","T cell epitopes were identified by calculating the average frequency of positive responses (defined above) to all peptides in the study plus standard deviation (SD) to give a background response threshold. Any peptide that induced a frequency of positive proliferation responses above this threshold in both the adjusted and non-adjusted data was considered to contain an immunogenic T cell epitope (and, thus, potentially represents an immunogenicity inducing epitope which could give rise to immunogenic responses in vivo).","In Silico Analysis of Peptides","The sequences of peptides that were positive in the proliferation assay were analyzed using Antitope's predictive iTOPE\u2122 software (Perry et al. 2008). This software predicts favorable interactions between amino acid side chains of the peptide and specific binding pockets within the MHC class II binding groove. Analysis of the peptide sequences using iTOPE\u2122 was performed with overlapping 9 mers spanning the peptides which were tested against each of the 34 MHC class II alleles. Each 9 mer was scored based on the potential \u2018fit\u2019 and interactions with the MHC class II molecules. 9 mers that produced a high mean binding score were identified and, from the T cell proliferation data, 9 mers which were considered as critical to T cell responses (\u201ccore 9 mers\u201d) were highlighted. iTOPE\u2122 analysis was then repeated with a range of amino acid changes in the core 9 mers in order to determine preferred amino acid substitutions for use in deimmunization.","Results and Discussion","A total of 120 peptides were synthesized spanning the entire PE38 sequence. The peptides were designed as 15 mers to span the sequence in overlapping increments of 12 amino acids. These peptides were then tested for the presence of CD4+ T cell epitopes by EPISCREEN\u2122 T cell epitope mapping analysis. Positive T cell responses were defined by donors that produced a significant (p<0.05) response with a SI\u22672.00 to any given peptide (SI\u22672.00, p<0.05). T cell epitopes were identified by calculating the average frequency of the positive responses to all peptides in the study plus SD (termed \u2018background response threshold\u2019). This was calculated to be 10.8% in the raw \u2018non-adjusted\u2019 data and 10.7% in the adjusted data (where maximum and minimum values were removed and the mean cpm calculated on the remaining four wells). Thus, peptides containing a T cell epitope induced positive T cell proliferation responses (SI>2.00, p<0.05) in \u22676 donors in the non-adjusted and adjusted data sets. Inter-assay variability was assessed using KLH as a reproducibility control where the frequency of positive T cell responses against KLH were compared in two separate EPISCREEN\u2122 assays (Table 7). The results show that inter-assay variability is within the acceptable range and consistent with previous studies (\u226610%). The frequency of T cell responses against the two control peptides C3 (EBNA derived epitope) and C32 (Influenza derived epitope) ranged between 23-31% (non-adjusted) and between 21-29% (adjusted) for the two peptides, respectively (). This is within the typical range observed for these two peptides in T cell epitope mapping studies.","The output from non-adjusted and adjusted data analysis was examined to ensure that intra-assay variability was low and that positive responses were not the result of spurious proliferation in individual wells. The results from each analysis showed, in most cases, only small differences between the methods and donor responses for both non-adjusted and adjusted analysis. Table 10 provides a summary of individual donor responses to each of the peptides. The proliferation assay data showing the frequency of positive donor responses to each peptide is shown in . For all peptides that induced a high frequency of positive (SI\u22672.00, p<0.05, including borderline responses) T cell proliferation responses above the background response threshold, additional in silico analysis was performed to aid in the identification of the precise location of MHC class II core 9 mer binding registers (using iTOPE\u2122), and to identify peptides that are homologous to sequences containing T cell epitopes that have been tested in previous EPISCREEN\u2122 T cell epitope mapping assays (using TCED\u2122).","Table 8.

Peptide 50 showed the highest number of positive responses with 15.38% donors responding in the non-adjusted dataset, and 15.38% in the adjusted data set, (SI\u22672.00, p<0.05). From in silico analysis, the proposed core 9 mer in this region is ISFSTRGTQ (SEQ ID NO:5). Peptides 52 and 53 induced lower frequencies of response with 11.54% and 13.46% positive donor responses in the non-adjusted dataset, and 13.46% and 11.54% in the adjusted datasets, respectively. A core 9 mer was identified in peptide 50 but was only partially present in peptides 52 and 53 suggesting that these peptides must contain a different T cell epitope. In silico analysis of peptides 52 and 53 did not identify any core HLA-DR restricted 9 mers so it is likely that the positive T cell responses seen are due to a HLA-DQ restricted T cell epitope.","The magnitude of T cell proliferation responses can provide an indication as to the T cell precursor frequency. In general, peptides that induce high frequency (of positive responses in the study cohort) and high magnitude T cell proliferation responses are a characteristic of \u2018recall-like\u2019 T cell responses in which the T cell pre-cursor frequency is high. In contrast, naive T cell responses are generally characterized by low magnitude T cell proliferation responses (with low T cell precursor frequencies). Peptides 52 and 53 induced moderately high magnitude T cell proliferation responses where the mean SI for positive (SI\u22672.00, p<0.05) T cell responses in the non-adjusted and adjusted data sets were 3.09-2.89 (peptide 52) and 2.51-2.55 (peptide 53) (Table 9). Thus these peptides may induce T cell responses in clones that are present in high frequencies in healthy individuals and may be indicative of a memory T cell response. Peptide 50 induced lower magnitude T cell proliferation responses where the mean SI were 2.23 and 2.28 in the non-adjusted and adjusted datasets respectively suggesting that this peptide may induce a na\u00efve T cell response (Table 9).","Epitopes 3 and 4","A cluster of T cell responses were observed around peptides 65-68 and the subsequent analysis revealed the presence of two T cell epitopes in this region. Peptide 65 stimulated positive T cell proliferation responses in 15.38% of the study cohort for both non-adjusted and adjusted datasets (Table 8 and ) (SI\u22672.00, p<0.05). The positive responses were high magnitude (mean SI of positive responses ranged from 3.04-2.89 in the non-adjusted and adjusted data sets) suggesting that the T cell precursor frequency in healthy donors against this epitope is high (Table 9). In silico analysis revealed a potential core 9 mer comprising IVFGGVRAR (; SEQ ID NO:7). Peptides 67 and 68 induced frequencies of response with 15.38% and 13.46% positive donor responses in the non-adjusted dataset, and 13.46% and 15.38% in the adjusted datasets, respectively. In silico analysis of these peptides did not identify any core HLA-DR 9 mers so it is likely that the positive T cell responses seen are due to a HLA-DQ restricted T cell epitope.","Epitope 5","Peptides 81 and 82 stimulated a number of T cell responses in the study cohort (Table 8 and ).

For peptide 82, the frequency of positive response was 17.31% and 15.38% in the non-adjusted and adjusted data sets respectively. The positive responses were relatively low in magnitude (mean SI of positive responses ranged from 2.12 to 2.22 in the non-adjusted and adjusted data sets) suggesting that the T cell precursor frequency in healthy donors against this epitope is relatively low (Table 9).

In silico analysis was used to identify potential core 9 mers for MHC binding and, together with structural analysis, was used as a basis for design of changes for re-engineering and deimmunizing PE38 in particular, and PE molecules in general.","The immunogenicity of amino acid substituted forms of PE can be assessed using the same procedures as described in Example 1. Accordingly, EPISCREEN\u2122 T cell epitope mapping analysis (Antipope Ltd, Cambridge, UK) analysis permits identification of amino acid substituted epitopes in PE polypeptides, wherein the introduced amino acid changes result in reduced or undetectable immunogenicity (i.e., for generating deimmunized forms of PE) as compared to epitopes in corresponding forms of non-amino acid substituted PE polypeptides.","EPISCREEN\u2122 is a proprietary technology commercially available through Antipope Ltd, Cambridge, UK, to map T cell epitopes within a protein sequence to determine potential for immunogenicity (based on the number and potency of T cell epitopes within a sequence). EPISCREEN\u2122 T cell epitope mapping typically uses CD8+ T cell depleted PBMCs from a minimum of 50 HLA-typed donors (selected to represent the human population of interest). Typically, 15 mer peptides with 12 amino acid overlaps spanning a protein sequence are analyzed in a large number of replicate cultures for in vitro CD4+ T cell stimulation by 3H TdR incorporation. CD4+ T cell stimulation is often detected in two or three adjacent and overlapping peptides since the core 9 mer that binds the MHC class II binding groove will be present in more than one peptide sequence. Following identification of peptides that stimulate CD4+ T cells in vitro, in silico technology can be used to design epitope-depleted (deimmunized) variants by determining the precise location of core 9 mer sequences and the location of key MHC class II anchor residues.","In this case, amino acid substituted PE peptides are analyzed for the presence of immunogenic CD4+ T cell epitopes using EPISCREEN\u2122 T cell epitope mapping analysis. For example, amino acid substituted 15 mer peptides (compared to non-substituted 15 mer peptides corresponding to a non-amino acid substituted form of PE) are tested against a cohort of healthy donors. CD4+ T cell responses against individual peptides are measured using proliferation assays (3H-thymidine incorporation). Proliferation assay data is used to compile a T cell epitope map of varying responses to amino acid substituted forms of PE to determine those amino acid changes producing reduced or abrogated immunogenic responses.","EPISCREEN\u2122 Donor Assessments","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated from healthy donor buffy coats (e.g., from blood drawn within 24 hours). For example, PBMC are isolated from buffy coats using density gradient centrifugation using LYMPHOPREP\u2122 (Axis-Shield UK, Dundee, Scotland) or a similar density gradient centrifugation media for the isolation of human mononuclear cells from blood (such methods, media and products are well known and routinely used by those skilled in the art). See e.g., Axis-Shield, package insert for LYMPHOPREP\u2122 density gradient media No. 619. March 03. Div.-1114740.) To remove CD8+ cells from the isolated mononuclear cells, CD8+ T cells are depleted using CD8+ROSETTESEP\u2122 kit (STEMCELL\u2122 Technologies Inc, Manchester, UK) or similar CD8+ selection methods and techniques (such methods, media and products are well known and routinely used by those skilled in the art). See e.g., StemCell Technologies Inc., ROSETTESEP\u2122 procedure for Human CD8+ T Cell Enrichment Cocktail (Catalog #15023\/15063; Procedure version 1.3.0, \u201c#28572 (May 2011)).","Donors HLA-DR haplotypes are determined using methods or kits well-known and routinely used by those skilled in the art. For example, Donors HLA-DR haplotypes are determined using a Biotest HLA SSP-PCR tissue-typing kit (Biotest, Solihull, UK, catalogue number 826215). T cell responses to a reproducibility control antigen are measured using, for example neo-antigen, using Imject maricutlure keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) (Pierce (Perbio Science UK, Ltd), Cramlington, UK, catalogue number 77600), or other similar control antigen (such antigens and methods are well known and routinely used by those skilled in the art). PBMC are frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until ready for use in to measuring immunogenicity of amino acid substituted forms of PE.","A cohort of donors are selected to best represent the number and frequency of HLA-DR allotypes expressed in the world population. It is desirable that allotypes expressed in the cohort represent a coverage of >80% of all major HLA-DR alleles in the world population (i.e., individual allotypes with a frequency >5% expressed in the world population are well represented). Records of individual donor haplotypes and comparison of the frequency of MHC class II haplotypes expressed in the world population and the sample population are recorded and assessed.","Donor responses (SI) to a control antigen (such as KLH) are assessed by comparing two independent proliferation assays. Test-1 is performed using the control antigen (such as KLH) on freshly isolated PBMC and Test-2 is the control antigen re-test performed on PBMC recovered from liquid nitrogen storage, the latter of which are used in assessing immunogenicity of amino acid substituted epitopes in PE. Responses that do not produce the same result in these two tests (i.e. positive including borderline SI>1.90 p<0.05 or negative) in both tests are disregarded.","EPISCREEN\u2122 Analysis: Proliferation Assay","PBMC from each donor are thawed, counted and viability is assessed. Cells are revived in room temperature AIM V\u00ae Culture Medium (INVITROGEN\u2122, Paisley, UK) before adjusting cell density to 2-3\u00d710PBMC\/ml (proliferation cell stock). Peptides are synthesized on a 1-3 mg scale with free N-terminal amine and C-terminal carboxylic acid. Peptides are dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM and peptide culture stocks are prepared by diluting into AIM V\u00ae Culture Medium to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM per well. For each peptide and each donor, sextuplicate cultures are established in a flat bottomed 96 well plate. Both positive and negative control cultures are tested in sextuplicate. For each donor, three control antigen\/peptides (KLH protein and peptides derived from Influenza A and Epstein Barr viruses) are also included.","Cultures are incubated for 6 days before adding 0.75 \u03bcCi 3[H]-thymidine (PERKIN ELMER\u00ae, Beaconsfield, UK) to each well. Cultures are incubated a further 18 hours before harvesting onto filter mats using a TOMTEC MACH\u00ae III cell harvester (TOMTEC\u00ae, Hamden, Conn., USA). Counts per minute (cpm) for each well are determined by MELTILEX\u2122 (PERKIN ELMER\u00ae) scintillation counting on a Microplate Beta Counter (PERKIN ELMER\u00ae) in paralux, low background counting mode.","EPISCREEN\u2122 Data Analysis","In proliferation assays, an empirical threshold of stimulation index (SI) equal to or greater than 2 (SI\u22672.00) is considered to represent an induced proliferative response; samples registering values above this threshold are deemed positive (values of SI<2.00 but \u22671.90 are considered borderline). Extensive assay development and previous studies have shown that this is the minimum signal to noise threshold allowing maximum sensitivity without detecting large numbers of false positive responses. Positive responses are defined by the following statistical and empirical thresholds:\n\n","In addition, intra-assay variation is assessed by calculating the coefficient of variance and standard deviation (SD) of raw data from replicate cultures.","Proliferation assays are set up in sextuplicate cultures from which \u201cnon-adjusted data\u201d is gathered. To ensure intra-assay variability is low, data is also analyzed after removing maximum and minimum cpm values (to produce \u201cadjusted data\u201d) and the SI of donor responses is compared using both data sets.","Reactive T cell epitopes are identified by calculating the average frequency of positive responses (defined above) to all peptides in the study plus standard deviation (SD) to give a background response threshold. Any peptide inducing a frequency of positive proliferation responses above the threshold in both adjusted and non-adjusted data is considered to contain an immunogenic T cell epitope (and, thus, potentially represents an immunogenicity inducing epitope which could give rise to immunogenic responses in vivo). Output from non-adjusted and adjusted data is examined to ensure that intra-assay variability is low and that positive responses are not the result of spurious proliferation in individual wells. An example of this type of analysis is provided in Example 1.","A comparison of corresponding forms of non-amino acid substituted PE immunogenic epitope responses versus responses obtained with amino acid substituted PE peptides is used to assess and predict the effects of various amino acid substitutions in reducing or eliminating the immunogenicity of PE polypeptides (i.e., for making deimmunized forms of PE).","Assays for measuring and testing the immunogenicity of amino acid substituted forms of PE may also be done as described and exemplified in Example 1 (i.e., via proliferation assays quantitating CD4+ T cell responses) wherein amino acid substituted forms of PE (i.e., \u201cdeimmunized PE\u201d or \u201cDI-PE\u201d), and\/or DI-PE conjugates and fusion proteins (e.g., fusions of DI-PE to antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof) are tested and measured for the presence and potency of immunogenic responses compared to responses induced by corresponding forms of non-amino acid substituted PE peptides, polypeptides, and fusion or conjugation constructs.","Assays for measuring immunogenicity of amino acid substituted forms of PE specifically (as indicated above), or PE molecules, generally, may also be done according to methods routinely used and well-known to those of skill in the art. For example, immunogenicity of amino acid substituted forms of PE, in particular, or PE molecules, in general, (as indicated above) may be measured in vivo in non-human primates and\/or in transgenic mouse model systems.","Assays for measuring the biological activity of amino acid substituted\/deimmunized forms of PE, may be done according to methods routinely used and well-known to those of skill in the art. Measured biological activities of deimmunized (\u201cDI\u201d) forms of PE (\u201cDI-PE\u201d), in particular, or PE molecules, in general, may include, for example, assays to measure:\n\n","Assays for Biological Activity: Inhibition of Protein Synthesis","In one example, measurement of inhibition of protein synthesis may be done via use of in vitro transcription\/translation assays (which are routinely used and well-known to those of skill in the art). For example, a cell-free assay may be used to measure DI-PE induced inhibition of in vitro transcription\/translation of a target plasmid (such as, but not limited to, T7-luc). In the case of using a T7-luc transcription\/translation assay, the biological activity readout would be chemiluminescent measurement of luciferase activity wherein amino acid substituted forms of PE are compared to corresponding non-amino acid substituted forms of PE for ability\/inability to inhibit translation of the luciferase enzyme in vitro. In such assays, the PE polypeptides being assayed can be introduced via expression from template DNA (e.g., a PCR product) encoding the toxin-conjugate gene, or by directly introducing quantified amounts of PE proteins. Such assays may be used to assess IC50 values* of the various forms of PE tested (*IC50=concentration at which 50% of protein synthesis is inhibited versus standardized control samples lacking PE).","Some examples of kits and reagents available for in vitro transcription\/translation assays include, but are not limited to:\n\n","Full protocols for use of such kits are provided by the manufacturer with each kit. A brief example of a typical experimental procedure may include:\n\n","Comparative protein synthesis inhibition values may show that various forms of DI-PE exhibit 100% or about 100% of biological activity (inhibition of protein synthesis) compared to corresponding forms of non-amino acid substituted PE. Comparative protein synthesis inhibition values may also show that various forms of DI-PE exhibit at least 95%, or at least about 95%, at least 90%, at least about 90%, at least 85%, at least about 85%, at least 80%, at least about 80%, at least 75%, at least about 75%, at least 70%, at least about 70%, at least 60%, at least about 60%, at least 50%, or at least about 50% of biological activity compared to corresponding forms of non-amino acid substituted PE.","Assays for Biological Activity: Cell Cytotoxic Activity","In one example, measurement of cell cytotoxic activity may be done via use of in vitro cell based assays wherein deimmunized PE (DI-PE)-antibody conjugates are assayed in comparison to non-amino acid substituted PE-antibody conjugates. The antibody portion of such conjugates would be antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, which specifically bind antigens expressed on the cell-surface of cell types used in such in vitro assays. Cell cytotoxicity may be quantitated, for example, by measuring cell lysis wherein the biological readout is represented by measurement of, for example, based on chemiluminescent (LUMI), fluorometric (FL), and colorimetric (COL) outputs; such as can be practiced using commercially available kits routinely used and well-known to those of skill in the art.","Some examples of kits available for measurement and comparison of DI-PE versus non-amino acid substituted PE cell cytotoxicity include, without limitation:\n\n","Full protocols for use of such kits are provided by the manufacturer with each kit.

(Madison, Wis., USA). See, PROMEGA\u00ae Technical Bulletin #TB 126 (Revised December 2010) which is incorporated by reference herein.","A preliminary experiment was performed to compare the ability of a PE-IL2 fusion protein to inhibit protein synthesis in an in vitro transcription\/translation assay when a commercially available PE-IL fusion protein is translated in vitro following transcription from either a circular plasmid expression vector or a linearized plasmid expression vector.

The aim of this experiment was to determine if circular or linearized plasmids produced significantly different quantities of PE-IL protein in the PROMEGA\u00ae Corp. TNT\u00ae Quick Coupled Transcription\/Translation Systems assay. A commercially available T7 Promoter\/Luciferase expression vector (PROMEGA\u00ae Corp.; hereinafter \u201cT7-Luc DNA\u201d) was used to measure the ability of PE-IL2 to inhibit protein synthesis in vitro.","Based on a pilot IVTT experiment, it was determined that 0.2 \u03bcg T7-Luc DNA provided optimal RLU (Relative Light Units) in a 90 minute IVTT reaction. In this experiment, VVN-52431 was linearized using the restriction enzyme Fsp-I. Linearized and circular VVN-52431 DNA were used as templates in the IVTT reactions. Reactions were done in triplicate, using 0.5, 1 and 2 \u03bcg of DNA. The T7 control reaction was performed using 1 \u03bcg DNA.

For example, the therapeutically beneficial cytotoxic effects of amino acid substituted PE-Mesothelin fusions may be assessed by monitoring and measuring reduction or elimination of tumor or cancer cells or tissues (in vitro or in vivo) in response to administration of amino acid substituted forms of PE-Mesothelin versus wild-type PE-Mesothelin fusion.","Organisms in which amino acid substituted forms of PE may be administered (alone or as fusion proteins) include, for example, without limitation: mice (including transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes), rats, rabbits, dogs, goats, sheep, horses, cows (and other bovine species), non-human primates, and humans.","Examples 9-13: Oligonucleotides referenced in the following examples are listed in Table 12.","The Kozak sequence in vector pET14b (EMD Millipore catalog #69660, Darmstadt, Germany) was modified by introducing a linker made up of annealed oligonucleotides 5\u2032-CATGGTGGCTCTCCTTCTTAAAGTTAAACAAAATTATTT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:239)(OL2216 in Table 12) and","5\u2032-CTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGAGCCAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:240)(OL2217 in Table 12) (underlined letters indicate nucleotides changed in the Kozak sequence*) via NcoI and XbaI restriction sites into vector pET14b resulting in a modified Kozak sequence (SEQ ID NO:176) by mutation of three nucleotides at positions 587 to 589.

User's Manual provided in the kit. See, PROMEGA\u00ae, Technical Bulletin #TB126, Revised December 10, pp. 1-28 (2010) which is incorporated by reference herein.","WT PE in plasmid pET14b-K was used as standard on every plate and tested at concentrations ranging from 0.08 ng to 10 ng in a 12.5 microliter final volume reaction. All test samples were run in triplicate. DNAs encoding WT or amino acid substituted PE in plasmid pET14b-K were added to the IVTT reaction mix supplemented with NAD+ (final concentration 0.15 mM; Fisher Scientific catalog #BPE9746-212) and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. for 15 min. Following a subsequent cooling step at 4\u00b0 C. for 5 min, 250 ng of T7 Luciferase plasmid (Luciferase T7 control DNA supplied in the TnT\u00ae T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System) was added to each reaction and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. for 90 min.

See, PROMEGA\u00ae, Technical Bulletin #TM051, revised September 11, pp. 1-23 (2011) which is incorporated by reference herein. Luminescence was measured in a FLUOstar OPTIMA plate reader (BMG Labtech Ltd., Aylesbury, UK)","A representative result is shown in  which shows the results expressed in CPS (counts per second as read from the FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence plate reader) for luciferase activity from IVTT assays of genes encoding either WT PE (pIEX02-001 (SEQ ID NO:1)) or encoding amino acid substituted PE (pIEX02-228 (SEQ ID NO:177), pIEX02-244 (SEQ ID NO:178), pIEX02-246 (SEQ ID NO:179)); which were expressed as fusion proteins comprising a histidine polymer and a linker sequence preceding a sequence of WT PE or amino acid substituted PE; see, pIEX02-001 PE WT (SEQ ID NO:189 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:190 (AA)), pIEX02-228 amino acid substituted PE (SEQ ID NO:193 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:194 (AA)), pIEX02-244 amino acid substituted PE (SEQ ID NO:197 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:198 (AA)), pIEX02-246 amino acid substituted PE (SEQ ID NO:201 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:202 (AA)). See also, Table 13.","For the analysis of various amino acid substituted PEs, the potency of each mutated PE in inhibiting IVTT was expressed as relative inhibition exhibited via expression from 2.5 nanograms of DNA encoding amino acid substituted PE compared to expression from 2.5 nanograms WT PE DNA as shown in Table 13 (data expressed as % inhibition of IVTT for the DNA encoding amino acid substituted PE compared to wild-type PE). In order to identify \u201cinhibitory\u201d amino acid substituted PE polypeptides (i.e., genes encoding amino acid substituted forms of PE which inhibit IVTT), selected mutations in each T cell epitope as identified in Table 11 were initially tested using various combinations of epitope 5 mutations (e.g., corresponding to S241N, S241K, S241P and S241T in SEQ ID NO:1) along with mutations in either: epitope 4; epitopes 4 and 3; epitopes 4 and 1; epitopes 4 and 2; or, epitopes 4 and 6 (see, Table 13). For all combinations except those including amino acid substitutions in epitope 3 at I184 (SEQ ID NO:1; or, I196 in SEQ ID NO:2) (which produced 0% inhibition), one or more inhibitory PE polypeptides were identified (Table 13). (Note: \u201cInhibitory PE polypeptides\u201d indicates amino acid substituted forms of PE which exhibit PE biological activity in the inhibition of IVTT). From structural analysis of PE, it was noted that residue I184 (SEQ ID NO:1; or, I196 in SEQ ID NO:2) (anchor residue 1, Table 11) was located within the active enzymatic site of PE. In view of this result, alternative mutations distal to the active site were sought at anchor residues 6 and 9 (V189 and R192 in SEQ ID NO:1; or, V201 and R204 in SEQ ID NO:2). Alternative epitope 3 mutations at V189 and R192 in SEQ ID NO:1 were tested in combination with other epitope mutations. These mutations confirmed that inhibitory PE polypeptides with epitope 3 mutations could also be generated (Table 13, pIEX02-173 to -248). A range of combinations of DNAs encoding multiple amino acid substituted forms of PE were tested progressively leading to a final analysis of mutations in four of six, five of six, and six of six identified immunogenic epitopes. See, Table 13, \u201cQuadruplicates\u201d, \u201cQuintuplicates\u201d and \u201cSextuplicates\u201d. In this regard, quadruplicate epitope mutations were identified which exhibited IVTT inhibitory activity ranging from 0% to about 70%. Quintuplicate mutations were identified that exhibited IVTT inhibitory activity ranging from about 5% to about 35%. Sextuplicate mutations were identified that exhibited IVTT inhibitory activity ranging from about 5% to about 20%. It is also noted that multiple single, double, and triple epitope mutations also resulted in amino acid substituted forms of PE exhibiting PE biological activity in the inhibition of IVTT such that the percent (%) inhibitory activity ranged from 0% to 100% (or about 100%); see Table 13.","Three different \u201ccandidates\u201d (i.e., amino acid substituted forms of PE or DNA constructs encoding the same) were selected for use as examples in performing subsequent experiments described further herein. In particular, additional experiments were performed using the sextuplicate AA substituted candidate pIEX02-244 (SEQ ID NO:178; see also, Table 13); which retained approximately 20% of the WT PE inhibitory activity. Likewise, additional experiments were also performed using the sextuplicate AA substituted candidate pIEX02-246 (SEQ ID NO:179; see also, Table 13) which retained approximately 8% of the WT PE inhibitory activity; and using the quintuplicate AA substituted candidate pIEX02-228 (SEQ ID NO:177; see also, Table 13) which retained approximately 36% of the WT PE inhibitory activity. These were expressed as fusion proteins comprising a histidine polymer and a linker sequence preceding a sequence of WT PE or amino acid substituted PE; see, pIEX02-001 PE WT (SEQ ID NO:189 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:190 (AA)), pIEX02-228 amino acid substituted PE (SEQ ID NO:193 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:194 (AA)), pIEX02-244 amino acid substituted PE (SEQ ID NO:197 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:198 (AA)), pIEX02-246 amino acid substituted PE (SEQ ID NO:201 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:202 (AA)). These AA substituted PE polypeptides, and DNA constructs encoding, them may be referenced herein as \u201c228\u201d, \u201c244\u201d or \u201c246\u201d using simply these three numbers, or using these numbers and a prefix or suffix included therewith.","Moreover, it is noted that in view of the highly cytotoxic nature of wild-type PE, IVTT inhibition activity (i.e., cytotoxicity) as low as about 5% (or higher) of WT (e.g., 8%, 20%, and 36%) in amino acid substituted forms of PE may provide a therapeutically effective polypeptide.

In order to avoid direct cytotoxicity to cells used in the assay, \u201cnull mutants\u201d were generated for the three candidates and WT PE by overlapping PCR as in Example 9 using primers OL2162 and 2163 (Table 12) to introduce an amino acid substitution of E287D in the three candidates and WT PE (to give SEQ ID NOs: 180 to 183). (Note: \u201cNull mutants\u201d is intended to indicate mutated forms of PE which lack cell cytotoxic biological activity; the amino acid substitution used to generate null mutants corresponds to a change of E287D in SEQ ID NO:1 or E299 in SEQ ID NO:2.) The E287D (SEQ ID NOs: 180 to 183) encoding genes were cloned into pET14b-K as in Example 9. WT PE sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:180; pIEX02-228 sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:181; pIEX02-244 sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:182; and, pIEX02-246 sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:183. These were expressed as fusion proteins comprising a histidine polymer and a linker sequence preceding a \u201cnull mutant\u201d sequence of WT PE or amino acid substituted PE; see, pIEX02-001 PE WT null mutant (SEQ ID NO:191 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:192 (AA)), pIEX02-228 null mutant (SEQ ID NO:195 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:196 (AA)), pIEX02-244 null mutant (SEQ ID NO:199 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:200 (AA)), pIEX02-246 null mutant (SEQ ID NO:203 (DNA) and SEQ ID NO:204 (AA)).","The host cell for expression of the PE E287D genes was an BL21 derivative strain called SHuffle\u2122 T7 Express (NEB catalog #C3029H, New England Biolabs UK Ltd., Knowl Piece, UK) which was altered to overexpress the chaperonins GroEL\/ES by amplification of the GroEL\/ES operon, including its promoter\/regulatory sites, from DH5alpha\u2122 (Invitrogen catalog #18265-017, Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, UK) using OL2097 (introducing EagI site) and OL2098, introducing HindIII site (Table 12). The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into pACYC184 (NEB catalog #E4152S) which was then transformed into SHuffle\u2122 T7 with selection for chloramphenicol resistance. The PE E287D (SEQ ID NOs: 180 to 183) genes in pET14b-K were transformed into the SHuffle\u2122 T7\/GroEL\/ES strain with selection for ampicillin resistance. Single colonies were grown in 2\u00d7YT medium (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #Y2627-1KG) and protein expression was induced at OD1.0 by adding isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thio-galactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Cultures were then grown at 16 degrees C. for 17 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 35 ml of binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete protease inhibitor tablets, Roche catalog #11873580001, Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Burgess Hill, UK (mixture of several protease inhibitors for inhibition of serine and cysteine proteases)). Cells were lysed by sonication (SONICATOR\u00ae, Misonix catalog #XL2020, Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, N.Y.), and cell debris and insoluble material removed by centrifugation. Proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by nickel chelate affinity chromatography using HISTRAP\u00ae FF Crude columns (GE Healthcare catalog #11-004-58, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). After loading, the columns were washed with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole and bound protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole. Following buffer exchange to 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) using Zeba Spin desalting columns (7K MWCO, Pierce catalog #89893), a negative purification step was employed using anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (1 ml, HISTRAP\u00ae Q FF column (GE Healthcare catalog #17-5053-01) with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and an NaCl gradient form 0 M to 1.5 M. For each protein, the column flow through was concentrated using an AMICON\u00ae Ultra centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore catalog #UFC 800 396, EMD Millipore, Feltham, UK) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (120 ml, HiLoad 16\/60 SUPERDEX\u00ae 75 pg (GE Healthcare catalog #28-9893-33)) using 1\u00d7PBS pH 7.4 (PAA catalog #H15-002, PAA Laboratories Ltd, Yeovil, UK).

Endotoxins were reduced to a value below 5 endotoxin units (EU)\/mg by repeatedly performing a phase separation using TritonX-114, (Aida Y. and Pabst M. J., 132 (1990) 191-195). Triton X-114 was removed using PIERCE\u00ae Detergent Removal Spin Columns according to the manufacturer's provided protocol (PIERCE\u00ae catalog #87779; Thermo Fisher Scientific\/PIERCE\u00ae Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.; see, Thermo Scientific Instructions manual #2164.3). Protein concentration was quantified by absorbance at 280 nm using a BIOMATE\u2122 3 UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a conversion factor of OD1.0=1.15 mg\/ml derived from the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 6\u00d7His PE (Pace C. N. et al. Protein Science 1995 4:2411-2423).","Ex vivo human T cell assays (EPISCREEN\u00ae) were performed using PBMC isolated from healthy community donor buffy coats as in Example 2. A cohort of 20 donors was selected to best represent the number and frequency of HLA-DR allotypes expressed in the world population. The haplotypes of the 20 donors in the assay is shown in Table 14. PBMCs from each donor were thawed, counted and viability assessed. Cells were revived in room temperature AIM-V\u00ae culture medium (INVITROGEN\u00ae, Paisley, UK), washed and resuspended in AIM-V\u00ae to 4-6\u00d710PBMC\/ml.

The results demonstrate a significantly reduced level of T cell responses from the amino acid substituted PE molecules: pIEX02-228 (SEQ ID NO:181) 5% donor responses; pIEX02-244 (SEQ ID NO:182) 10% donor responses; and, pIEX02-246 (SEQ ID NO:183) 20% donor responses, compared to WT PE (SEQ ID NO:180) which induced T cell responses in 70% of donors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0444","num":"1331"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 15"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Relative T-cell Stimullated Proliferative Responses to"},{"entry":"Amino Acid Substituted variants of PE compared to Wild-Type (WT) PE."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"pIEX02-","pIEX02-","pIEX02-",{}]},{"entry":[{},"WT PE","228","244","246","Hu A33"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Donor 1","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 2","P*",{},{},{},"P"]},{"entry":["Donor 3","P*",{},"P","P","P"]},{"entry":["Donor 4",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 5",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 6","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 7",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 8","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 9","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 10","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 11","P",{},{},"P","P"]},{"entry":["Donor 12","P",{},{},{},"P"]},{"entry":["Donor 13","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 14","P","P",{},"P",{}]},{"entry":["Donor 15","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 16","P",{},{},{},"P"]},{"entry":["Donor 17","P",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 18",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Donor 19",{},{},"P","P","P"]},{"entry":["Donor 20",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["% Donor","70","5","10","20","30"]},{"entry":"Proliferation"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Positive T cell responses for proliferation (SI \u2267 2.00, significant p < 0.05) during the entire time course days 5-8 (\u201cP\u201d) are shown."},{"entry":"**Borderline responses (significant p < 0.05 with SI \u2267 1.90) are shown (*)."}]}}]}}},"In addition to the proliferation assay, additional analysis of the cytokines IL-2 and IL-6 was performed using aliquots of culture supernatant taken on day 6. The analysis was performed using the BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Enhanced Sensitivity Flex Set Systems for IL-2 and IL-6 (BD Bioscience, Oxford, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The enhanced sensitivity standards from the CBA kit were reconstituted and serially diluted before adding 50 microliters of supernatant or standard to 20 microliters of mixed capture beads in 96 well filter plates (Millipore, Watford, UK) and incubating for 2 hours. Mixed human detection reagent (20 microliters) was then added to each well and incubated for a further 2 hours. Plates were washed twice and enhanced detection (100 microliters) reagent added to each well for a final 1 hour incubation. Plates were washed before reading on an Accuri C6 instrument (BD Biosciences).","Data was analysed using FCAP v3.0 software (BD Biosciences). For each individual donor, data was expressed as pg\/ml of cytokine for each donor and plotted on a log scale with a median of cytokine levels depicted as a line. The results are shown in  which shows a significantly reduced level of the cytokines IL-2 and IL-6 from the amino acid substituted PE molecules pIEX02-228 (SEQ ID NO:181), pIEX02-244 (SEQ ID NO:182) and pIEX02-246 (SEQ ID NO:183) compared to WT PE (SEQ ID NO:180).","The proliferation and cytokine results both independently demonstrate that the amino acid substitutions in PE result in greatly reduced level of T cell responses when using amino acid substituted forms of PE. These results considered and expected to correlate with low or reduced PE immunogenicity in human subjects.","Amino acid substituted forms of PE and WT PE may be generated as in Example 11. For a dendritic cell cytotoxicity assay, PBMC are isolated from healthy community donor buffy coats (preferably from blood drawn within 24 hours), for example, by Lymphoprep (Axis-shield, Dundee, UK) density centrifugation. To prepare monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), CD14+ cells (monocytes) may be isolated from donor PBMC preparations using Miltenyi Monocyte Isolation Kit II (human) and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotech GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog #130-091-153). Monocytes are resuspended in an appropriate culture medium, such as AIM-V\u00ae cell culture medium supplemented with 1000 IU\/ml IL-4 and 1000 IU\/ml GM-CSF (\u201cDC culture medium\u201d) to 4-6\u00d710cells\/ml and then distributed in 24 well plates (e.g., 2 ml final culture volume). Cells are fed on day 2 by half volume DC culture medium change. On day 3, amino acid substituted PE and WT PE proteins are added to semi-mature DC to selected final concentrations, such as 1 micrograms\/ml or 10 micrograms\/ml. Semi-mature DC are incubated for a period of time, such as 24-72 hours, after which cells are assessed for cytotoxicity by viability, such as via use of Trypan Blue (Sigma, Dorset, UK) dye exclusion and by propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V staining (Invitrogen, Paisley UK) followed by FACS analysis.","WT PE and amino acid substituted PE encoded by pIEX02-244 (SEQ ID NO: 178) are fused to an anti-CD22 single-chain Fv (scFv). The VH and VL (V) regions of RFB4 (Campana D. et al., 134:1524-1530 (1985); Mansfield, E., et al., 90:2020-2026 (1997) are synthesized. RFB4 VH is amplified using oligonucleotides: OL2043 and OL2044 (Table 12). RFB4 and VL (Vk) is amplified using oligonucleotides OL2045 and OL2046 (Table 12). The RFB4 scFv is obtained using a pull-through PCR reaction using oligonucleotides OL2047 introducing a NcoI site and OL2048 introducing a XhoI site. The resultant PCR product is subcloned into pET14b-K via NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes (Fermentas catalog #FD0573 and FD0695, respectively).","The gene encoding RFB4 scFv is fused to genes encoding either WT PE or amino acid substituted PE encoded by pIEX02-244 (SEQ ID NO: 178) having a C-terminal 8\u00d7His-tag followed by the sorting signal EDLK to give fusion sequences SEQ ID NO:184 and SEQ ID NO:186, respectively, which are cloned into the expression vector pET 14b-K by fusion PCR. To create these RFB4-PE fusions a fusion PCR is carried out. The RFB4 scFv gene is amplified from pET14b-RFB4 using oligonucleotides OL2318 introducing a NcoI site and OL2320 (Table 12). The WT PE or the lead amino acid substituted PE genes are amplified from pET14b-K-WT PE or pET14b-K-244 PE, respectively, using oligonucleotides OL2321 and OL2322 introducing a N-terminal 8\u00d7His-EDLK and a XhoI site (Table 12). Both scFv and PE genes are fused by performing a PCR with oligonucleotides OL2318 and OL2322 (Table 12). The resulting full-length fragments are subcloned into pET14b-K using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes. Plasmids are transformed into BL21(DE3) (EMD Millipore, Feltham, UK) and clones are inoculated into 2TY+Amp and grown overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Two ml of overnight culture is inoculated into 350 ml 2TY+Amp media in a 1 L flask and grown to OD=1 before addition of IPTG (Sigma) to 1 mM (final concentration). Cultures are grown overnight at 30 degrees C. overnight and centrifuged at 10000 rpm. Bacterial pellets are frozen at \u221280 until ready to use.","Pellets are defrosted on ice, extracted with 10 ml B-PER\u00ae Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (PIERCE\u00ae Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.; Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) containing Lysozyme and DNaseI (both Thermo Scientific), and rotated for 1 hour at room temperature. Samples are then centrifuged at 10000 rpm and supernatants are discarded. Each pellet is resuspended in 5 ml B-PER containing Lysozyme and DNaseI as above and extracted for an additional 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, pellets are pooled and washed successively with Wash Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M urea and 1.0% Triton X-100), Wash Buffer B (Buffer A but without urea), and twice with Wash Buffer C (Buffer A but without urea or Triton X-100). After final wash, insoluble pellets are stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. cOmplete\u00ae mini-EDTA protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.) are included at each step.","Pellets are resuspended in 10 ml Solubilisation Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 8 M Urea and 1 mM DTT). ODis determined and the samples are diluted to approximately 1 mg\/ml in Solubilisation Buffer. Protein samples are allowed to denature for 4 hours at room temperature and centrifuged at 10000 rpm to remove insoluble debris. 10 ml of each solubilised protein samples is injected into a pre-soaked 12 ml, 3K MWCO cut-off SLIDE-A-LYSER\u00ae Dialysis Cassette dialysis device (Thermo Scientific; PIERCE\u00ae Biotechnology, Inc., IL, USA), and dialyzed by placement overnight in a beaker containing 2.5 L Refolding Buffer A (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 1 mM oxidised glutathione, 0.1 M arginine, 4 M urea). Dialysis buffer is replaced with, in order, 2.5 L Refolding Buffer B (Buffer A with 2 M urea), 2.5 L Refolding Buffer C (Buffer A with 1 M urea) and 5 L Refolding Buffer D (Buffer A without urea or arginine) for a minimum of 4 hours at each step.","Each sample is recovered from the dialysis cassette, buffer exchanged into 50 mM 2-N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 6.2 using PD10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and loaded onto a 1 ml SP FF Anion Exchange column (GE Healthcare). Each column is washed with 50 mM MES pH 6.2 before eluting using a linear 0M to 1M NaCl gradient in 50 mM MES pH6.2. Protein-containing fractions are pooled and run through a pre-equilibrated 16\/60 Size Exclusion column (GE Healthcare) using 1\u00d7PBS as running buffer. Fractions containing the main protein peaks are collected, pooled and concentrated to approximately 1 ml, filter sterilized and quantified.","For cytotoxicity analysis, Raji cells (ATCC, CCL-86) are propagated in growth medium (RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1% Pen\/Strep) and harvested during mid-log growth phase. Cells are diluted to 1\u00d710cells\/ml in growth medium and 50 microliter aliquots are dispensed per well in white walled, clear bottom 96 well plates (CORNING\u00ae catalogue #3610, FISHER SCIENTIFIC\u00ae, Loughborough, UK). Each protein concentration (8\u00d74-fold dilutions from 500 nanograms\/ml) is tested in triplicate wells, and controls containing cells or growth medium only are also included. Test protein is diluted to 2\u00d7 desired concentration in growth medium. 50 microliters of the test protein dilutions or controls are added to the Raji cells and plates are incubated 72 hrs in a humidified cell culture incubator (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO). After incubation, plates are equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min. CELLTITER-GLO\u00ae (PROMEGA\u00ae catalogue #G7571) is prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and 100 microliters is added per well. Plates are incubated for 10 min before reading via a FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech Ltd., Aylesbury, UK)(also known as a fluorometer).","References\n\n"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"Pseudomonas "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A & 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
