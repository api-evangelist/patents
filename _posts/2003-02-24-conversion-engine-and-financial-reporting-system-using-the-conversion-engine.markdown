The contents of Application No. 60\/171,097 are incorporated herein in their entirety.","This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10\/177,764, filed Jun. 24, 2002 now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/976,289, filed Oct. 15, 2001 now abandoned, which is continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/775,801, filed Feb. 5, 2001 now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/563,913, filed May 4, 2000 now abandoned. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein in their entirety.","The present invention generally relates to a financial reporting system and method and, more particularly, to a financial reporting system and method that generates financial statements for different reporting standards.","A financial reporting system for a business is generally composed of different applications. In the case of a bank, these applications may include a general ledger application and a loan-processing application. These applications generate financial statements that are in accordance with relevant generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP). GAAP refers to the set of rules, convention, standards, and procedures for reporting financial information. US GAAP, for example, are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Differences generally exist between the GAAP of different countries. In view of the multinational environment in which many businesses operate, it would be desirable to provide a financial reporting system and method that accommodates differences between the GAAP of different countries.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a management system includes a computer-implemented routine for accessing journal entries stored in a computer-readable memory and a computer-implemented journal entry generating routine for automatically venerating journal entries for a first set-of-books and for a second set-of-books based on the accessed journal entries. The journal entries for the first set-of-books are in accordance with a first reporting standard and the journal entries for the second set-of-books are in accordance with a second, different reporting standard.","The management system and method described herein provides a single workflow that may be applied to converting a book of original entries in one accounting system to another reporting book in a different accounting system. The system and method allow a user, for example, to set up the accounting method of various items according to any country's GAAP. By way of example, the management system and method described herein provide an automated conversion engine for loan transactions. The conversion engine processes transactions from a lending application and applies a series of rules that automatically generates journal entries that accommodate the differences between US GAAP and Japanese (JP) GAAP. For example, under US GAAP, non-refundable fees associated with a term loan agreement are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan. Under JP GAAP, such fees are treated as immediate income. When a transaction for an up-front fee payment is entered into a commercial lending application for US GAAP, the commercial lending application generates the entries to defer the fee and amortize it. When the conversion engine of the present invention detects these transactions, it reverses the deferral and treats the fee as income for JP GAAP. The conversion engine also reverses any subsequent amortization because the fee has already been recognized.","The conversion engine is configured to perform similar conversions based on other differences between the US and JP GAAP.","The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate various features of the present invention and, together with the general description given above and the detailed description provided below, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12"]},"Conversion engine  selectively processes these data records in accordance with rules contained in a rules database . The processing is selective in the sense that conversion engine examines a certain one or more of the fields in the data record to determine whether a rule for \u201cconverting\u201d the data record exists in rules database . The rules in rules database  are used to \u201cconvert\u201d the data records to take into account different treatments of the data contained in the data records by different regulatory authorities, different taxing authorities, different statutory accounting requirements, different generally accepted accounting principles, and the like.","For example, under US GAAP, non-refundable fees associated with a term loan agreement are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan. Under JP GAAP, such fees are treated as immediate income. A commercial lending application used by a US-based financial institution typically generates a data record for such a loan agreement in which the non-refundable fees are deferred and amortized. A data record for an up-front fee payment is supplied to conversion engine . This data record in which the non-refundable fees are deferred and amortized is sent to a US Set of Books (SoB) - via conversion engine . Conversion engine  replicates this data record for a JP SoB - and determines whether any rules in rules database  are applicable to the data record. In this case, as mentioned above, under JP GAAP, a non-refundable fee associated with a term loan agreement is treated as immediate income. Thus, a rule exists in rules database  for reversing the deferral reflected in the corresponding data record in US SoB - so that the fee is treated as income for purposes of JP GAAP. Conversion engine  also reverses any subsequent amortization because the fee has already been recognized. Thus, the data record written to JP SoB - is in accordance with JP GAAP.","Conversion engine  may also be configured to generate data records for an Adjustment SoB - that reflect the adjustments made by conversion engine . Adjustment SoB - is used to retain an audit trail and to summarize the cumulative adjustments for subsequent review by controllers, auditors, examiners, etc. Together US SoB -, JP SoB -, and adjustment SoB - serve as the basis for financial reporting.","Conversion engine  may be used without limitation to generate data records for other SoBs as suggested in .","As mentioned above, conversion system  may be used in connection with a commercial lending system, a deposit system, a treasury system, a trade finance system, an accounts payable system, an inventory system, or an accounts receivable system. In what follows, a detailed description is provided of a conversion engine used in connection with a commercial lending system. This detailed description is provided by way of illustration, not limitation.","The conversion engine described below is typically provided as one component of a management system for a particular business such as a bank. This management system may include various commercially available software applications and the conversion engine described herein interfaces with (perhaps using \u201cmiddleware\u201d), and uses data generated and output by, these other applications. The description below is given with reference to certain software applications for performing certain functions (e.g., commercial lending, general ledger). These software applications are identified by way of illustration, not limitation. Thus, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the conversion engine of the present invention may be effectively utilized with many different software applications that together make up a management system for a particular business.","In particular, the conversion engine described herein is utilized with a commercial lending application known as LS2\u2122 (\u201cLS2\u201d), also known as Loan IQ\u2122 or LIQ\u2122, that was jointly developed by International Business Machines and Bankers Trust; a general ledger application known as Oracle General Ledger\u2122 (\u201cOracle GL\u201d); and a middleware application MQSI from Neon.","The general architecture of a management system  including a conversion engine in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to . A commercially available commercial lending application  (such as the above-mentioned LS2 commercial lending application) generates journal entries based on the transactions initiated by its users. Commercial lending application  may have its own chart of accounts and populates the journal entries to a table such as an Oracle GL-Out Table. For US-based institutions, these journal entries frill typically conform to US GAAP. The journal entries, accumulated in detail by account, transaction and customer in the table, are sent through a middleware application  (such as the above-mentioned NEON MQSI software) to an interface table  of a general ledger application (such as the above-mentioned Oracle GL software). In the particular case of using the LS2 commercial lending application and the Oracle GL general to ledger software, for example, there is no conversion of the data in the journal entries by middleware application  other than perhaps converting from LS2 GL account to Oracle GL account numbers.","Each journal entry has an Accounting Flex Field (AFF) and a Descriptive Flex Field (DFF). In one particular implementation, the AFF is made up of a combination of a Branch (Facility) Number, a Department identifier, a GL Account Number, and a Control Branch Number. Every journal entry has an AFF composed of these elements. The DFF is context-sensitive, i.e., the elements thereof depend on the type of journal entry. While every journal entry has a descriptive flex field, the elements thereof vary based on the type of journal entry. Examples of elements that may be included in the DFF for a particular type of journal entry include Risk Type. Customer Number, Security IDs, Product and Portfolio. As will be explained below, Portfolio plays a role in the conversion processing.","When the batch entry of journal entries into interface table  is complete, an automatic import procedure imports the journal entries into US SoB . The imported journal entries may be grouped together using a journal entry header. The journal entries under a journal entry header share a common Business Transaction Code, Accounting (Effective Date), Currency and Risk Type. Upon the successful creation of a journal entry header in the US SoB , the entry is replicated from US SoB  to JP SoB . Conversion engine  then does an analysis based on, for example, the Business Transaction Code and\/or Portfolio, to determine if any rules affect the replicated entry.","Conversion engine  is provided with the following logic functionality:","1. Selective Conversion\u2014Conversion engine  is configured to sift through journal entries and select those that are affected by the business rules to be described below based on criteria such as risk type, portfolio type and\/or account. \u201cSelective conversion\u201d as used herein includes the capability to effect adjustments to only part of a journal entry.","2. Minimum\/Maximum Logic\u2014Conversion engine  is provided with logic to determine the minimum or maximum value of an array. This logic is employed for calculating the gain or loss on the sale of loans with premiums or discounts.","3. Cross-Referencing\u2014Conversion engine  is configured to reference tables outside the conversion program to look up values. This is employed for determining general ledger accounts that may have been changed to the recalculation of a gain or loss due to GAAP differences.","As mentioned above, after the US GAAP-based journal entries are replicated in JP SoB , conversion engine  determines whether any rules in a rules database associated with conversion engine  are applicable to the replicated journal entries. In one implementation, these rules are organized into two database tables: an exclusion rules table and a reclassification rules table. The exclusion rules in the exclusion rule table reverse journal entries or exclude them from the target set of books and the reclassification rules in the reclassification rules table change or substitute items in the AFF (e.g., the GL Account). If there are rules in the rules database applicable to the replicated journal entries, conversion engine  apples these rules so that the journal entries in JP SoB  are in accordance with JP GAAP. Conversion engine  also makes appropriate journal entries to an adjustment SoB . Adjustment SoB  is used to retain an audit trail and to summarize the cumulative adjustments for subsequent review by controllers, auditors, examiners, etc. Adjustment SoB  is further supported by comprehensive audit trail conversion reports that document the transactions affected by expenses code, portfolio, risk type, transaction reference number, the pre- and post-conversion balances and the purpose of the adjustment (e.g., to reverse the deferral of upfront fees). Together US SoB , adjustment SoB , JP SoB , and the audit trail report serve as the basis for financial reporting.","Certain manual journal entries may be passed to adjustment SoB  and JP SoB  to accommodate those transactions not covered by the conversion rules in the rules database associated with conversion engine . Manual journal entries are implemented by constructing an interface that permits a user to selectively pass entries to a specified SoB.","Thus, conversion engine  is a rules-based engine that selectively applies conversion logic and automates the generation of journal entries for a plurality of different SoBs. The conversion engine is a single flow process in that it is operative as a data record is being processed, i.e., whenever conversion engine detects a data record having a particular characteristic, it applies the appropriate rules from the rules database.","Conversion engine  may be implemented using Oracle Workflow\u2122. Oracle Workflow permits users to define and automate business processes, each business process consisting of a series of activities and inter-activity dependencies. Oracle Workflow Builder is a tool that permits users to create, view and\/or modify a business process with mouse operations. The Oracle Workflow Engine monitors workflow states and coordinates the routing of activities for a process. An \u201cactivity\u201d in a process definition can be an automated function defined by a PL\/SQL stored procedure, a notification to a user (that may optionally request a response), or a sub-flow that itself decomposes to a more granular set of activities. A workflow process is initiated when an application calls a set of Oracle Workflow Engine APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The Oracle Workflow Engine divides the relevant work item defined by the application, through a specific workflow process definition. According to the workflow process definition, the Workflow Engine performs automated steps and invokes appropriate agents when external processing is required. The detailed description below will enable those skilled in the art to generate (e.g., using Oracle Workflow Builder) business processes for implementing a conversion engine in accordance with the present invention.","The LS2 commercial lending application may run on an IBM 3272.","Oracle Financial Statement Generator\u2122 is a report-writing tool that allows users to develop various reports without programming. This tool may sit on an Oracle database (e.g., Version 8.05) running on an IBM RS600\/SP with an AIX operating system. This tool can be used, for example, to present financial information by reclassifying and grouping applicable accounts and is usable to handle GAAP conversion items that do not require computation, such as the presentation of certain balance-sheet items.","Finally, NEON\u2122 MQSI software may be used as a middleware tool to provide a data interface between various applications. The NEON software may sit on an Oracle database (e.g., Version 8.05) running on an IBM RS6000\/SP with an AIX operating system. For purposes of the GAAP conversion, this middleware ensures the completeness of data necessary for conversion and translates certain LS2-specific data values to Oracle GL values. The middleware application comprises an important part of data reconciliation during daily data posting and GAAP conversion processes. The objective of reconciliation using the middleware tool is twofold: (1) LS2-to-US GAAP, which requires no data manipulation (the primary purpose is to ascertain the completeness and accuracy of data), and (2) LS2-to-JP GAAP, which executes the applicable conversion procedures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["108","120","104","106","122","124","110","112","114","106"]},"If a new journal header is created in the US SoB , an alert is triggered at . This alert triggers a PL\/SQL package that constitutes conversion engine  and results in processing () that replicates entries in US SoB  for JP SoB .","The Oracle tables used in conversion engine  are:","GL_INTERFACES\u2014This table is an interface table to Oracle GL, loaded with different data, i.e., different SoBs, Debit and Credit amounts, GL accounts, specific journal entry line information and source.","GL_JE_BATCHES","GL_JE_HEADERS","GL_JE_LINES","GL_JE_CATEGORIES","GL_JE_SOURCES","GL_JE_BATCHES, GL_JE_HEADERS, GL_JE_LINES, GL_JE_CATEGORIES, and GL_JE_SOURCES are used to get the batch\/header\/line\/source\/category details of the batch.","Conversion engine  then evaluates () whether the replicated entries are treated differently under US and IP GAAP by reference to a custom table  (SUMI_RULE_ADJUSTMENTS). Table  stores adjustment names, rule type and other segment values. Conversion engine  uses the data in this table to check whether the journal entry category is treated differently under US and JP GAAP. If the journal entry category exists in table , there is a different treatment between US GAAP and JP GAAP. Conversion engine  determines whether this different treatment is based on an exclusion rule at  or a reclassification rule at  and prepares the appropriate conversion entry.","SUMI_RULE_EXCLUSIONS table  contains those journal entry categories that are excluded or need to be reversed under JP GAAP. This table stores the exclusion rule numbers, the exclusion rules names and the exclusion flags. Using the data in table , the replicated journal entry in JP SoB  is adjusted at  for JP GAAP and an appropriate journal entry is made in Adjustment SoB .","SUMI_RULE_RECLASS table  contains those journal entry categories that require a reclassification between GL accounts. This table contains the rule numbers, reclassification codes, reversal flags, and other segments. Table  also contains flags for adjustments to be omitted based on a journal entry category using an exclusion flag. This table is used with a table  called SUMI_NAT_ACCT. SUMI_NAT_ACCT table  is used in conjunction with SUMI_RULE_RECLASS table  and contains accounts to be substituted by the reclass rule. The table contains the \u2018source\u2019 Natural Account Segment and the \u2018target\u2019 (adjustment) Natural Account Segment, HO CODE segment, and BRANCH CODE segments.","If the journal entry category of the replicated journal entry exists in SUMI_RULE_RECLASS, there is a different treatment in US and JP GAAP. If the journal entry category is found, conversion engine  evaluates the SUMI_NAT_ACCT table  for the corresponding adjustment account and an adjustment is made at . Together, these tables are used to re-map the GL accounts used in the original entry into a different account in JP SoB .","The packages used are WF_ENGINE, WF_CORE, FND_GLOBAL, and FND_REQUEST. WF_ENGINE uses the WF_ENGINE. Get_Item_Attribute_Number to get the relevant Batch attributes of the batch being processed and other procedures in the package to get the Batch properties. WF_CORE is used for context details, FND_GLOBAL is used to initialize the import program parameters, and FND_REQUEST is used to submit the import program from the operating system (OS) level.","The charts of accounts of Oracle GL are comprised of two components: account captions (horizontal) and key segments (vertical). These key segments in Oracle's applications are referred to as \u201cFlexFields\u201d. As mentioned above, there are two types of FlexFields: Accounting (required) and Descriptive (optional). Defining the format of the FlexFields before implementation is a minimum requirement. Since neither Accounting nor Descriptive FlexFields are generally easily modifiable after implementation, it is very important to design them with sufficient care and consideration for future needs. Identification of each of the Accounting and Descriptive FlexFields follow with reference to . Unless otherwise specified, all fields are alphanumeric. Any relationships suggested in  are by way of example, not limitation.","Accounting FlexField","A. IBF\/DBF Facility","In the US, this field serves to specify the domestic or international banking facility. The default value specifies domestic. In other countries, the segment may be reserved to denote different market jurisdictions under the applicable requirements. A predetermined character string (e.g. 00) may be used to indicate N\/A (not applicable).","B. Department","This is also known as the cost\/profit center code. Each lower-level department has a department code assigned. The first character denotes a department group and the remaining two characters denote a unique department code.","C. GL Account","D. Control Branch","This field describes the branch claiming the ownership of a balance or transaction recorded in Oracle GL.","Descriptive FlexField","E. Product Code","This field is useful for GAAP conversion purposes and producing reports such as profitability. Accounts are grouped by product type and a value is assigned for each of the accounts.","F. Portfolio Code","This field, like the Product Code, is used for GAAP conversion purposes and for producing reports such as profitability.","G. Customer Number","H. Transaction Reference Number","I.

These stored procedures may be implemented in any suitable computing environment such as an environment that runs Oracle\u00ae Workflow\u2122.  illustrates a computer system  suitable for use in connection with the conversion engine. Computer system  includes a processing unit  and a system memory . A system bus  couples various system components including system memory  to processing unit . System bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. System memory  includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within personal computer system , such as during start-up, is stored in the ROM . Computer system  further includes various drives and associated computer-readable media A hard disk drive  reads from and writes to a (typically fixed) magnetic hard disk ; a magnetic disk drive  reads from and writes to a removable \u201cfloppy\u201d or other magnetic disk ; and an optical disk drive  reads from and, in some configurations, writes to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable instructions, SQL-based procedures, data structures, program modules, and other data for computer system . In other configurations, other types of computer-readable media that can store data that is accessible by a computer (e.g., magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs) and the like) may also be used.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk , removable magnetic disk , optical disk  and\/or the ROM  and\/or the RAM  of system memory . Such program modules may include an operating system providing graphics and sound APIs, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. A user may enter commands and information into computer system  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices may include a microphone, joystick, game controller, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected co processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to system bus , but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port interface or a universal serial bus (USB).

Upfront Loan Fees","US GAAP","Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Loans (\u201cSFAS No. 91\u201d), establishes the accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with lending, committing to lend, or purchasing a loan or group of loans. Such nonrefundable (upfront) loan fees, including commitment fees and syndication fees, among others, should be deferred and recognized over the contractual life of the loan or facility as interest or fee income. Whereas the interest method is the preferred method under SFAS No. 91, the straight-line method is also appropriate because of immateriality.","JP GAAP","Upfront loan fees are recognized as fee income when related services are provided (normally when received). No deferral or amortization of these fees as an adjustment of yield is recorded.","There are two types of fees-related transactions that affect the GAAP conversion approach: loans originated or purchased at (1) par or (2) discount or premium. For purposes of loan processing GAAP conversion, only type (1) loans (issued at par) are subject to adjustment. Accounting for amortization of discount or premium on loans is substantially the same under both US GAAP and JP GAAP and requires no further computation or reclassification.","A code may be used to differentiate loans issued at par from those at discounts or premiums. For example, if the LS2 loan processing application is used, the \u201cPortfolio Code\u201d may be used for differentiation. \u201cLOANPAR\u201d may be used for loans issued at par, \u201cDISCPREM\u201d for loans issued at a discount or premium.","A1. Issue 1","The LS2 commercial lending application computes amortization of upfront loan fees based on the straight-line method.","A2. Solution\/Conversion 1","The straight-line method is used as the amortization method because the difference from the interest rate method is immaterial.","B1. Issue 2","The LS2 commercial lending application allows its users to defer and amortize upfront fees as an adjustment to yield or fee income in accordance with FASB Statement No. 91. Therefore, for JP GAAP reporting purposes, the deferral and amortization should be reversed and adjusted to fee income when received.","In addition, the LS2 commercial lending application defers and amortizes as income the \u201cprice difference\u201d of the loan (the difference between principal amount and actual price for the loan origination or purchase) as position discount or position premium together with deferred upfront fee income. This accounting treatment is consistent with US GAAP. Even under JP GAAP, the price difference should be deferred and amortized as interest over the life of the loan.","Under the normal practices, the relationship of upfront fees and the loan origination and purchase price are as follows:\n\n","In cases (1) and (2), Position Discount or Premium Position account calculated by the LS2 commercial lending application represents \u201cUpfront Fees\u201d that should be recognized as income immediately under JP GAAP. On the other hand, in cases (3) and (4), Position Discount or Position Premium account calculated by the LS2 commercial lending application represents the price difference that should be deferred and amortized as income under JP GAAP as well as US GAAP.","B2. Solution\/Conversion 2","Loan transactions are categorized into first and second transaction types. These two transaction types are created as two different \u201cPortfolios\u201d in the LS2 commercial lending application and a user selects one or the other based on transaction information. In Oracle GL Interface Table , the \u201cPortfolio\u201d of the LS2 commercial lending application is captured as \u201cPortfolio Type\u201d in the Descriptive FlexField. The first transaction type is Loans Originated\/Purchased at Par=(Regular Loan Origination and Regular Loan Purchase)=Portfolio Code \u201cLOANPAR\u201d. The second transaction type is Loans Purchased at Discount or Premium=(Distressed Loan and Private Placement Bond)=Portfolio Code \u201cDISCPREM\u201d. The accounting for the second transaction type (portfolio) is consistent under JP and US GAAP.

When the General Ledger system receives journal entries regarding loans, the system distinguishes \u201cLoan on Notes\u201d and \u201cLoan on Certificate\u201d based on the MIS Code and assigns appropriate GL account codes.","IX. Non-Performing Loans","US GAAP","No quantitative GAAP criteria for non-accrual status exist (FASB Statements No. 114 and 118). Federal Reserve Bank prefers suspension of interest accrual on 90-days past due or principal past due or critical events.","JP GAAP","Accrual of interest income on impaired loans is suspended in accordance with the criteria stipulated in the Japanese tax regulations. Generally, accrual is suspended on loans the principal of which are past due or the interest is past due more than six months or critical credit events.","A. Issue","The LS2 commercial lending application has separate accounts for accrual status facility\/loan and non accrual status facility\/loan with respect to Commitment Balance, Loan Principal Amount, and Position Discount and Position Premium Account and will reclassify corresponding balances from accrual status accounts to non-accrual status accounts if certain credit events occur. The LS2 commercial lending application also reverses all the outstanding accrued interest receivable on non-accrual loans and post memorandum entries for accrued interest on the non-accrual status loans. In addition, if the facility is non-accrual status, the amortization of Position Discount\/Premium will be suspended and all the outstanding accrued fee receivable will be also reversed (no memorandum entries for accrued fee will be recorded on non-accrual loans and facilities).","Users in US branches should account for non-accrual loans in accordance with US Regulatory Accounting and the transfer to non-accrual status will occur upon 90 days past due or principal past due loans or critical credit events. However, a Japanese office may select the timing of transfer to non-accrual status in accordance with JP GAAP even or US GAAP reporting purposes. Accordingly, in official US SoB , the non-accrual loans will be accounted for using the above LS2 functionality although the timing of transfer is in accordance with JP GAAP.","Under JP GAAP, timing to transfer to non-accrual status is less conservative than US GAAP because it is in accordance with Japanese tax rules. In addition the timing, accounting treatment of outstanding accrued interest (recorded in prior year and before credit event) is different from US GAAP\/Regulatory accounting. Normally, the following accrued interest will not be recorded:","i) After the principal's due date, the accrued interest income will not be recorded However, the accrued interest income up to principal due date should be recorded unless it should not be recognized due to other criteria below.","ii) At each fiscal year end, if collection of interest has not occurred at all as to interest receivable that became due more than 6 months before, the accrued interest income during the fiscal year for the loan will not be recognized However, for the loan, if the accrued interest receivable which was recorded at the last fiscal year end is still outstanding, the amount should not be reversed unless the receivable meets the criteria to write-off (outstanding for 2 years or more).","iii) If the collection of :he accrued interest receivable (whether recorded or unrecorded) at past fiscal year is very small (less than 5%), the accrued interest income for this fiscal year and will not be recorded. However, the past years' outstanding accrued interest receivable will not be reversed unless the receivable meets the criteria to write-off (outstanding for 2 years or more).","B. Solution\/Conversion","(1) US Regulatory Adjustment","As explained above, the timing of transfer to non-accrual status will be consistent between the US and JP SoBs. However, in US branches, for US Regulatory Reporting purposes, manual additional reversal of accrued interest on 90 days past due loans should be made outside the LS2 commercial Lending application, e.g. using Excel spread sheet.","On the other hand, for JP GAAP reporting purposes, additional accrual on non-accrual loan, which does not meet charge-off criteria, should be recorded. This entry will be input into conversion engine  as Conversion journal entries and fed to both of the Adjustment SoB  and JP SoB . At each fiscal year end, the detailed information regarding non-accrual loans and related accrued interest receivable may be reviewed (e.g., by a Controller Department). Based on that review, the Controller Department will calculate additional accrued interest receivable that should be accrued under JP GAAP. These Conversion journal entries will be input manually through the Manual GL entry function of the conversion engine.","Other interface information for US SoB, e.g. \u201cDate of Creation\u201d, \u201cAccounting Date\u201d, \u201cProduct Code\u201d, \u201cCustomer Code\u201d etc. is submitted to Adjustment SoB  without modification except for \u201cGroup ID\u201d. \u201cGroup ID\u201d for \u201cUS SoB\u201d is \u201cUS GAAP\u201d, however, this will be replaced with \u201cJP GAAP\u201d for JP SoB .","X. Direct Loan Origination Costs","US GAAP","Direct loan origination costs will be deferred and recognized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield using the interest method in accordance with FASB Statement No. 91.","JP GAAP","Fees and commissions earned for loan origination are recognized when related services are provided (normally when received). Loan origination costs including direct and indirect costs should be charged to income when incurred. No deferral and amortization of these fees and costs as an adjustment of yield is recorded.","A. Issue 1","Many users of the LS2 commercial lending application do not use LS2 for deferral and amortization of direct loan cost. Instead, total direct costs incurred for all the loan origination activities for the period may be allocated among each deal (e.g., by a Controller Department or a Loan Back Office Department).
