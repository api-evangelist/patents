The instances of the connector finger  are configured to be snap fitted into the groove assembly  (in a secure fashion as depicted in ).","Referring to , the body-connector assembly  (two instances are depicted) are configured to span across and to align two adjoining instances of the body assembly . In this manner, the wall edge  of the body assembly  may remain substantially aligned along a relatively long distance. This is done in such a way that there are no distractions from any disjointed look or steps in the instances of the body assembly  (positioned edge-to-edge) once the instances of the body assembly  are connected by the instances of the body-connector assembly . The connected instances of the body assembly  then form the finished-edge portion  as an uninterrupted continuous line (a line without interruptions from one end to the other end). This arrangement provides an aesthetically pleasing effect for occupants of the room in which the apparatus  is installed. There is formed a consistent (uniform) spacing between the baseboard edge  of the baseboard  () and the finished-edge portion .
