{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/201,598 filed Dec. 12, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention is directed towards automated identification of devices. More particularly, the present invention provides theft detection of portable devices using radio frequency identification.","Portable devices are being widely used for storing, manipulating, and exchanging data. A portable device can be an intelligent or unintelligent device based on the presence or absence of data processing capability in the device. Examples of an intelligent portable device includes, but are not limited to, portable audio player, portable video player, smartphone, mobile phone, laptop, and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). Further, examples of unintelligent portable device include, but are not limited to, document, wallet, bag, id-card. The portable devices may be expensive in nature and may carry confidential and important data and are therefore prone to theft.","Several technologies exist to detect occurrence of theft of portable devices using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). For example, in large retail stores, shelf-based anti-theft systems are implemented, where portable products are coupled with RFID tags, whereas RFID readers are placed in doorways and windows of the store. When one or more products are stolen from the store, an RFID reader sends an alert to the Emergency Alert System (EAS) system of the store. However, the shelf-based antitheft system is limited to theft detection of portable devices present in an RFID enabled location. The existing RFID systems do not provide a mechanism of real time theft detection of a portable device carried by a mobile user in a location which is not secured by an RFID system.","Further, technologies exist to detect occurrence of theft of portable devices without using RFID. One such technology is use of anti-theft cables and locks. The security cables and locks provide theft detection for portable devices such as iPods. Another technology includes pairing a wireless device with a mobile phone. When the mobile phone disassociates from the wireless device, the wireless device prompts a user to enter an authentication code, thereby alarming the user regarding separation of the mobile phone. However, the above-mentioned technologies are limited to theft detection of specific devices. These technologies are not applicable to a wide range of intelligent and unintelligent portable devices.","In light of the abovementioned disadvantages, there is a need for a system and method that facilitates real time theft detection of a wide range of portable devices carried by a user. The system and method should act as a deterrent to theft of portable devices and alert a mobile user within fraction of seconds, in case of theft. Further, the method and system should use efficient and low power techniques for real time theft detection and should be applicable to wide variety of intelligent and unintelligent portable devices.","A method for tracking one or more portable devices in real time to detect theft of the one or more portable devices is provided. The method comprises, firstly, interrogating a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag via a RFID reader during successive sweep intervals. The sweep interval represents active state of the RFID reader. Secondly, the method comprises receiving one or more pairing information from the RFID tag. Further, the method comprises comparing the one or more pairing information with corresponding one or more pairing information stored in the RFID reader. Finally, the method comprises generating an alert signal via the wearable-band or the one or more portable devices when the one or more pairing information does not match with the corresponding one or more pairing information stored in the RFID reader. The RFID tag and the RFID reader reside in a wearable-band adapted to be worn by a user and the one or more portable devices respectively or vice versa.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises establishing a sleep interval between the successive sweep intervals. The sleep interval represents inactive state of the RFID reader. In another embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises generating an alert signal via the wearable-band or the one or more portable devices when the RFID tag fails to respond to the RFID reader. In another embodiment of the present invention, receiving the one or more pairing information from the RFID tag comprises, firstly, fetching a unique identifier. The unique identifier corresponds to vendor specific information associated with the RFID reader and the wearable-band. Secondly, the method comprises fetching a unique number allocated to each pair of the one or more portable devices and the wearable-band.","In an embodiment of the present invention, comparing the one or more pairing information with corresponding one or more pairing information stored in the RFID reader comprises, firstly, comparing the unique identifier with the unique identifier stored in the RFID reader. Secondly, the method comprises comparing the unique number associated with the RFID tag with the unique number associated with the RFID reader.","In an embodiment of the present invention, generating an alert signal via the wearable-band or the one or more portable devices further comprises measuring a first time value at the start of the sweep interval. Secondly, the method comprises measuring a second time value when the one or more pairing information does not match with the one or more pairing information stored in the RFID reader. Further, the method comprises calculating a difference between the second time value and the first time value to obtain a third time value. Furthermore, the method comprises comparing the third time value with a predetermined false alarm threshold value. Finally, the method comprises generating an alert signal when the third time value exceeds the predetermined false alarm threshold value.","In an embodiment of the present invention, generating an alert signal via the wearable-band and the RFID reader when any one of the pairing information do not match with the corresponding pairing information stored in the RFID reader comprises at least one of: triggering an alarm system and triggering a visual display system. In another embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises performing selective error correction using hamming code on the pairing information received from the RFID tag. In another embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises mapping information related to multiple portable devices with information stored in a lookup table in the wearable-band. The wearable-band comprises multiple RFID tags.","A system for tracking one or more portable devices in real time to detect theft of the one or more portable devices is provided. The system comprises one or more portable devices with processing capability, one or more portable devices without processing capability and a wearable-band adapted to be worn by a user. The one or more portable devices with processing capability comprises a Radio frequency Identification (RFID) reader configured to interrogate a RFID tag residing in the wearable-band during successive sweep intervals. The sweep interval represents active state of the RFID reader. Further, the one or more portable devices without processing capability comprise the RFID tag which is interrogated by the RFID reader residing in the wearable-band during successive sweep intervals.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the one or more portable devices with processing capability comprises any one of: mobile phones, personal digital assistants, laptops, smart phones, digital watch, digital camera, portable audio player, portable video player and any other intelligent device capable of processing. In another embodiment of the present invention, the one or more portable devices without processing capability comprises any one of: wallets, document holders, keys handbags and any other personal item of the user without processing capability.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the one or more portable devices with processing capabilities comprises software modules such as programmable time service, a user interface and a portable device feature control application programming interface to at least facilitate generating an alert to the user. In another embodiment of the present invention, the one or more portable devices with processing capabilities comprises hardware modules such as system bus, memory mapped registers, interrupt line and circuit space on the printed circuit board of the one or more portable devices.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the wearable-band paired with the one or more portable devices with processing capabilities comprises hardware modules such as battery operated alarm circuit integrated with the RFID tag.

In an example, UID containing additional vendor specific information combined with requirement of fetching data from particular memory location can be used as deterrence against such attacks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":"700","br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["TM","E,T",",T",",M"],"sub":["C","A","C","A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800","sub":["start","start"]},"Q={q, q. . . q}","\u03a3={e, e. . . e}","F={ }","The transition function description is given in tabular form as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"16"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"14","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"15","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"16","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"16","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["[State, Input]","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"16","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["q","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q","q","\u00d8"]},{"entry":["q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","q"]},{"entry":["q","q","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8","\u00d8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"16","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Input alphabet set contains events, each of which is set.

In various embodiments of the present invention, the RFID tag is interrogated by a RFID reader. The RFID reader is configured to interrogate the RFID tag for a short preset time period i.e. sweep interval. The RFID reader interrogates the RFID tag to fetch information related to the one or more portable devices and corresponding wearable-band pair. The wearable-band is adapted to be worn by user of the portable devices.","At step , one or more pairing information is received. In various embodiments of the present invention, one or more pairing information are allocated to each pair of the one or more portable devices and wearable-band to uniquely identify a portable device with a wearable-band and vice versa. In an embodiment of the present invention, the one or more pairing information may include a unique identifier e.g. a User Identification (UID) which corresponds to vendor specific information associated with RFID reader and the wearable-band. In another embodiment of the present invention, the one or more pairing information may include a unique number that is allocated to each portable device wearable-band pair. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the unique number allocated to the RFID reader may be referred as Reader Portable Artifact and Wearable-Band number (R-PAWN). In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the unique number allocated to the RFID tag may be referred as Tag Portable Artifact and Wearable Band number (T-PAWN).","At step , a check is performed to determine if the pairing information matches with pairing information stored in the RFID reader. In an embodiment of the present invention, the UID received from the RFID tag is compared with UID stored in the RFID reader. In another embodiment of the present invention, the T-PAWN received from the RFID tag is compared with the R-PAWN stored in the RFID reader.","At step , if it is determined that the one or more pairing information does not match to the one or more corresponding information, an alert signal is generated. In various embodiments of the present invention, if the UID received from the RFID tag matches with the UID stored in the RFID reader, the T-PAWN is fetched from the RFID tag. The T-PAWN is then compared with the R-PAWN stored in the RFID reader. In case the T-PAWN does not match with the R-PAWN an alert signal is generated. In an embodiment of the present invention, alert signal is generated by triggering an alarm system in the wearable-band or by displaying theft information in a display unit provided in the wearable-band or provided in a portable device with processing capability.","In another embodiment of the present invention, an alert signal is generated via the wearable-band or the one or more portable devices when the RFID tag fails to respond to the RFID reader. In a further embodiment of the present invention, a check is performed to ensure that a false alarm is not triggered. When the RFID tag fails to respond to the interrogation signal emitted by the RFID receiver, a first time value is measured at the start of the sweep interval. Further, when the one or more pairing information does not match with the one or more pairing information stored in the RFID reader, a second time interval is measured. A difference is then calculated between the second time value and the first time value to obtain a third time value. The third time value is compared with a predetermined false alarm threshold value. If the third value exceeds the predetermined false alarm threshold, an alert signal is generated.","If it is determined that the one or more pairing information matches with the one or more corresponding information, then, at step , the RFID reader enters into a sleep interval. In various embodiments of the present invention, a sleep interval is established between successive sweep intervals. The sleep interval represents inactive state of the RFID reader.
