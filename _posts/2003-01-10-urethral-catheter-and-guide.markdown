title: Urethral catheter and guide
abstract: An indwelling catheter for insertion into a patient's urinary tract is provided that includes first and second tubular members that enable drainage of physiological fluids. An inflatable balloon is attached to the second tubular member. The first and second tubular members are interconnected by a connecting tube forming a gap between the first and second tubular members. The connecting tube is in fluid communication with the balloon to enable the balloon to be inflated via the connecting tube. When the balloon is anchored within the urinary bladder the second tubular member is located within the prostatic urethra with one end in close proximity to the sphincter and the other end protruding into the urinary bladder. The first tubular member is located within the penile urethra with one end in close proximity to the sphincter so that the connecting tube traverses the sphincter permitting voluntary control of the sphincter.

No. 09\/239,312, filed Jan. 29, 1999, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/018,664, filed Feb. 4, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,195, the contents of each being hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as if recited in full herein.","This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/018,664, filed Feb. 4, 1998, the specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to an internal catheter for insertion into the urethra of a patient and to a catheter guide for effecting such insertion, More particularly, the present invention relates to an indwelling catheter specifically adapted for treating obstruction of the prostatic urethra and to a catheter guide, for flushing the patient's urinary tract and for the insertion and positioning of the catheter therewithin. The invention further relates to a method of inserting and positioning an indwelling catheter in the urinary tract of a patient using the guide of the present invention.","Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition wherein enlargement of the prostate gland constricts and blocks the portion of the urethra traversing the prostate (i.e., the prostatic urethra) and leads to difficulties in normal urination.","BPH is typically treated by using surgical procedures such as trans urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or preferably by non-surgical procedures, such as thermal ablation of the prostate, a procedure which typically employs a catheter supplemented with a balloon head positioned within the prosthetic urethra, in which balloon heated water is recirculated.","Following a thermal ablation procedure, temporary blockage of the prostatic urethra is usually experienced due to extensive swelling and edema formation. Proper healing of the prostatic tissue and long-term urination of the patient requires the removal of the ablation balloon catheter and the subsequent insertion of a drainage catheter into the prostatic urethra.","Several types of drainage catheters are known. One type includes tubing leading from the bladder through the entire length of the urinary tract to the outside. Such catheters, beside being highly uncomfortable, suffer from two major limitations. First, such catheters do not allow voluntary urination. Second, upon prolonged installation, they frequently cause urinary tract infections.","Another type includes indwelling catheters which are typically used when long catheterizing periods are required, such as following BPH elimination treatment, during the healing of the tissues damaged by the treatment. During this time period the healing and scarring of the prostate tissue around the catheter ensures that the prostatic urethra remains dilated after the catheter is removed.","Presently, there exist various indwelling catheters for insertion into the patient's urinary tract for enabling effective drainage of fluids and tissue particles following a prostate unblocking procedure.","Examples of such indwelling catheters are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,811,450; 5,176,626; and 5,514,178.","An indwelling catheter employed in treating and unblocking of a prostatic urethra must meet several requirements. The catheter must have a portion which traverses the blocked prostatic urethra. The catheter must allow the patient control over urination, either biologically (voluntary sphincter control) or mechanically (e.g., a mechanical valve). In addition, an indwelling catheter must be appropriately positioned and anchored, such that no permanent movement of the device is experienced during service.","To meet the above requirements, presently employed indwelling catheters have incorporated several configurations of inflatable balloons, for anchoring and appropriately positioning the catheter within the patient's urinary tract. Such configurations typically include balloons, such as in Folley catheters, in which a positioning and anchoring balloon is positioned within the patient's bladder and is anchored against the inner-wall of the bladder opening, or ring type balloons which are inflated against the prostatic urethra and serve to both unblock the prostatic urethra and establish a tract for urination. Furthermore, balloons which are carried on the catheter itself, or alternatively on a catheter guide used for its insertion and positioning, serve for appropriately inserting and positioning the catheter by functioning as \u201cinsertion halters\u201d and as \u201cposition reference\u201d when halted by the patient's sphincter.","Other anchoring methods, as demonstrated by the transurethral bridge feature of the catheter produced by Boston Scientific (known as TRESTLE), a schematic depiction of which is shown in , also exist.","In this configuration, the placement of two tubes, interconnected by a wire, on opposite sides of the sphincter anchors the catheter against longitudinal displacement, and also allows patient voluntary control over urination.","Limitations are inherent to the catheters of the above mentioned designs. For example, some catheters are constructed such that they traverse the sphincter region of the urethra, not allowing for sphincter closure and thus necessitating the use of a valved line for urination control. These catheters are further limited in such that the urination line which leads from the bladder to the outside environment is often the cause of urinary tract infections, which necessitate the removal of the catheter, followed by antibiotic treatment and repositioning of a new catheter, causing great discomfort to the patient. On the other hand, catheters employing transurethral bridges often tend to proximally displace within the urethra when the patient urinates, due to a relief in the anchoring of the catheter upon sphincter dilation.","Additionally, positioning of a catheter via a sphincter balloon can often be difficult and time consuming, whereas positioning of a catheter via a bladder balloon often necessitates a more complex guide and catheter system.","There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, an indwelling urethral catheter devoid of the above limitations. The catheter according to the present invention can be used for drainage of fluids and tissue particles through the patient's prostatic urethra following a non-surgical medical procedure such as thermal ablation of the prostate, wherein a long-term indwelling catheter is needed, while allowing voluntary control over urination.","According to one aspect of the invention described below, there is provided an indwelling catheter for insertion into a patient's urinary tract, the tract including a urinary bladder, a prostatic urethra, a sphincter and a penile urethra, the indwelling catheter comprising (a) a first tubular member having a distal end and a proximal end; (b) a second tubular member having a length, a distal end and a proximal end, the first and second tubular members having such a diameter for enabling drainage of physiological fluids therethrough; (c) a first inflatable balloon being inflatably attached at a portion of the second tubular member; and (d) a first connecting tube of substantially smaller diameter interconnecting the first and second tubular members to form a gap of a known maximal length between the first and second tubular members, the first connecting tube being in fluid communication with the first inflatable balloon, so as to enable inflating the first inflatable balloon via the first connecting tube; wherein the length of the second tubular member, the known maximal length of the gap and a location of the portion of the second tubular member to which the first inflatable balloon is inflatably attached are selected such that, when positioned in the urinary tract, the balloon is anchored within the urinary bladder, so as to position the second tubular member within the prostatic urethra with its proximal end positioned distally, and in close proximity, to the sphincter, and with its distal end protruding into the urinary bladder, and further so as to position the first tubular member within the penile urethra with its distal end positioned proximally, and close proximity, to the sphincter, while the first connecting tube traverses the sphincter, thereby permitting voluntary control of the sphincter.","According to one embodiments of the invention described below the catheter further comprises a second inflatable balloon inflatably connected to a second portion of the second tubular member and proximally to the first inflatable balloon.","According to still further features in the described preferred embodiments the second inflatable balloon of the catheter is adapted to contain a heated fluid and is therefore usable for thermal treatment (e.g., ablation) procedures.","According to still further features in the described preferred embodiments the first inflatable balloon and the second inflatable balloon of the catheter form a single notched balloon.","According to still further features in the described preferred embodiments the second inflatable balloon of the catheter is in fluid communication with the first connecting tube and thereby inflatable via the first connecting tube.","According to still further features in the described preferred embodiments the second inflatable balloon of the catheter is in fluid communication with a second connecting tube, the second connecting tube interconnecting the first and second tubular members parallely to the first connecting tube, such that inflation of the second inflatable balloon is effected independently of the inflation of the first inflatable balloon.","According to further features in the described preferred embodiments of the present invention the catheter further comprises a detachable guiding element, the guiding element including an elongated tubular member, an elongated inflatable balloon being attached to at- least a portion of the length of the elongated tubular member, and a first mechanism for inflating the elongated inflatable balloon.

The present invention is further of a catheter guiding element and catheter insertion and positioning methods to be used along with the catheter of the present invention.","The principles and operation of an indwelling urethral catheter, guiding element and methods according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.","Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.","As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, and in relation to the urinary tract positioning of the catheter or guiding element according to the present invention, the terms \u201cdistal\u201d and \u201cdistally\u201d denote towards the urinary bladder and the terms \u201cproximal\u201d and \u201cproximally\u201d denote towards the penile urethra.","Referring now to the drawings, and  illustrate an indwelling urethral catheter according to some preferred embodiments of the present invention, which is referred to hereinunder as catheter . As further detailed hereinunder, catheter  is designed for insertion into a patient's urinary tract and serves primarily for urinating the patient.","Catheter  includes a first tubular member  having an inner lumen . Member  has a distal open end  and a proximal open end . When catheter  is implanted in the patient's urinary tract, member  is designed to engage the distal portion of the patient's penile urethra, just proximally to the sphincter.","Catheter  further includes a second tubular member  having an inner lumen . Member  has a distal end  and an open proximal end . Distal end  is either open or formed with at least one opening . A distal portion of tubular member , which includes end  and opening , can feature any one of a variety of patterns known in the art and which serve for facilitating guidance of, and\/or urination through, catheter , such as, but not limited to, Tiemann pattern (see , at ), Couvelaire pattern, Dufour pattern, Mercier pattern, a whistle tip pattern and a cylindrical pattern. These patterns are further described in an endouroloay catalog by RUSCH Incorporated of 2450 Meadowbrook Parkway Duluth, Ga. 30136, and in http:\/\/www.ruesch.de, the web site thereof.","When catheter  is implanted, member  engages the prostatic urethra, having its proximal end  positioned just distally to the distal end of the sphincter and its distal end , as well as opening , within the bladder of the patient.","Thus, members  and  serve for draining the bladder under the voluntary control of the sphincter, which is not engaged or traversed by neither member  nor member . To this end, fluids from the bladder are directed via member  to the sphincter, and when the sphincter muscle is contracted, and as a result the sphincter is dilated, these fluids pass therethrough to member  and then discarded through the proximal end of the penile urethra.","Second tubular member  is preferably designed with several lengths, preferably between 2 and 14 centimeters, more preferably, between 3 and 12 centimeters, most preferably between 4 and 10 centimeters, so as to fit prostatic urethras of different patients preferably between 2 and 6 cm in length. While restrictions are imposed on the length of member , which should engage the entire length of the prostatic urethra and protrude into the bladder, no such length restrictions are imposed on member , which is shown in the drawings to be shorter than member , yet in reality can be substantially longer. The length of member  can range from about one centimeter or less to about 8-10 centimeters or more.","The inner diameter of members  and  is selected wide enough so as to enable free passage of body fluids therethrough. Inner diameters above about 5 millimeters are preferred. The outer diameter of members  and  is preferably about 6-9 millimeters. Members  and  are typically made of a resilient and hypoallergenic polymeric material, such as, but not limited to, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and silicon.","First  and second  tubular members are interconnected therebetween by a connecting tube . Tube  typically serves three functions, one of which is to form a gap  of a known (limited) maximal length between members  and . The other functions of tube  are further addressed hereinunder. When catheter  is positioned within the urinary tract of the patient, tube  traverses the sphincter. The length of gap  is selected so as to enable the sphincter to be free of any portions of members  and . Tube  is of a substantially smaller diameter as compared with the diameters of members  and  (both internal and external). Tube's  external diameter is selected such that it does not interfere with the hermetic closure of the sphincter, and as such, allows the patient voluntary control over urination via the sphincter. Furthermore, retaining catheter  in position is generally achieved by the sphincter which prevents the longitudinal dislocation of members  and  when closed.","Connecting tube  extends through member  and has sufficient length so as to extend the length of the urethra, through the penis and have its proximal end outside the body of the patient. According to a preferred embodiment, the portion of connecting tube  that traverses member  is engaged within the wall of member . In fact, according to one embodiment, that portion of tube  is directly formed by a channel present in the wall of member .","The above described configuration is common to all of the embodiments of catheter  according to the present invention as further detailed hereinunder.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, catheter  further includes an inflatable balloon , which is shown inflated in the drawings. Inflatable balloon  is attached at a portion  of second tubular member  and is positioned proximally to distal end  and opening .","Balloon  serves for positioning catheter  in the patient's urinary tract. To this end, inflatable balloon  is inserted in its deflated form into the patients bladder. It is thereafter inflated so as to anchor catheter  in place. To this end, when inflated, balloon  is of substantial girth, such that it forms a steepled donut shape, substantially perpendicular to, and surrounding, second tubular member . When inflated, inflatable balloon  is larger in diameter than the opening of the patient's bladder, such that subsequent pulling of catheter  in a proximal direction via, for example, proximal end  of connecting tube , anchors balloon  against the bladder's inner wall and positions first  and second  tubular members and connecting tube  as described hereinabove to allow voluntary control over urination.","Retaining catheter  in position is generally achieved by the sphincter which prevents the longitudinal dislocation of members  and  when closed. However, a possibility exists, in which, members  and  will dislocate while the sphincter is dilated (i.e., during voluntary urination). To prevent such undesired dislocation, balloon  is preferably retained in its inflated form also during service.","It will be appreciated that the prior art catheter of Boston Scientific, which is described in the Background section hereinabove and is shown in , can dislocate when the patient urinates, due to dilation of the sphincter during urination.","Thus, catheter  of the present invention provides a second and effective means, unaffected by urination of the patient, for retaining catheter  appropriately positioned in the urinary tract.","An additional function attributed to connecting tube  involves the inflation\/deflation of balloon . To this end, connecting tube  traverses a distal portion of member . The portion of connecting tube that traverses the distal portion of member  is preferably engaged within the wall of member . In fact, according to one embodiment, that portion of tube  is formed by a channel  present in the wall of member . Thus, tube  can be formed by tubular portions in part, and channels in part.","According to the present invention, tube  is in fluid communication with inflatable balloon . The fluid communication between tube  and balloon  is formed either by directly connecting a tubular portion of tube  to balloon , or preferably by an opening  formed in the wall of member  forming a fluid communication between channel  and balloon . Thus, a direct fluid passage exists between tube  and balloon .","An adapter  is preferably connected at proximal end  of tube , to enable the connection of an inflation device, such as, but not limited to, a syringe or a pump, thereto, so as to enable inflation and\/or deflation of inflatable balloon . Deflation of balloon  can also be performed passively. Preferably inflation and\/or deflation of balloon  is achieved with air but other fluids, such as water, can also be used, as well as other gasses, such as nitrogen.","According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, and as specifically shown in and catheter  further or alternatively includes an additional inflatable balloon , which is shown inflated in the drawings. Balloon  is inflatably connected to a second portion  of second tubular member  and proximally to balloon , in cases the latter is present.","When catheter  is appropriately positioned within the urinary tract of the patient, balloon  is designed to engage the prostatic urethra. Balloon  can serve several functions, as further delineated in detail below, including anchorage of catheter , facilitated removal of catheter , dilation of the prostatic urethra, ablation of the prostatic urethra and\/or drug delivery thereto. To this end, when inflated, balloon  is more elongated, and narrower as is compared to balloon .","Thus, typically, balloon  is inflated following the positioning of catheter  and is utilized for the dilation of the prostatic urethra following a non surgical prostatic procedure such as, but not limited to, thermal ablation thereof. Inflated balloon  is retained in its inflated form until the prostatic urethra retains a dilated diameter due to scarring of tissue surrounding inflated balloon , at which time, and prior to the removal of catheter , balloon  is deflated.","It will be appreciated that, balloon  of catheter  can be used for thermal ablation of a prostatic urethra. In this case, catheter  serves both as a thermal ablation catheter and then also as a drainage catheter, without the need of catheter replacement. To this end, balloon  and additional components of catheter  are constructed from heat resistant materials, such that a heated fluid can be conducted therethrough. Preferred materials will withstand temperatures of between 55\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C., examples include, but not limited to, PVC, silicon and polyurethane.","Following the thermal ablation procedure, balloon  is maintained inflated for dilation of the prostatic urethra as further described hereinabove. Thus, the present invention makes possible the use of a single device for both the thermal ablation and urination of the patient. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,257,977; 5,549,559; and 5,492,529, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, provide further details relating to ablation catheters directed at ablating a prosthetic urethra.","Yet, it will be appreciated that balloon  of catheter  can also serve for the diffusional release of a medicament such as, but not limited to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs typically used in post thermal ablation treatments. In this embodiment of the present invention balloon  is manufactured permeable to the medicament or medicaments of choice, such that a liquid carrying the medicament(s), dissolved or in suspension, can be conducted to balloon  and delivered to the body of the patient therethrough. Balloon  can be inflated with the medicament containing fluid such that it contacts the ablated prostatic urethral, and thus diffusional drug transfer is facilitated. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,282,785; and 5,800,392, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, provide further details relating to balloon catheter based drug delivery.","According to one configuration of the present invention, each of balloons  and  is independently inflated (). To this end an additional connecting tube , which substantially parallels connecting tube , is employed, and is provided in fluid communication with balloon . Connecting tube  establishes fluid communication with an adapter , provided at a proximal end  thereof and which is located outside the patient's body, through channel  formed in tubular member . Channel  is in fluid communication with balloon  through at least one opening . Inflation and deflation of balloon  is achieved, according to this configuration, via an inflating\/deflating device, such as, but not limited to, a syringe or a pump connectable to adapter .","However, according to another configuration of the present invention, balloons  and  are co-inflatable. This is achieved either by forming a fluid communication between balloon  and tube  () and\/or by integrating balloons  and  into preferably a single notched balloon (), although other non-isometric shapes are also envisaged for such a balloon. In each of these cases, the degree to which each of balloons  and\/or  inflates under predetermined pressure, is dictated by its specific characteristics. Typically balloon  is selected the first to substantially inflate, so as to serve in the process positioning catheter  as described above.","Guiding and positioning catheter  as herein described is effected according to preferred embodiments of the present invention via a guiding element, which is shown in and at .","Guiding element  includes an elongated tubular member  which includes a lumen , and which is formed with a closed () or opened (and ) distal end  and an preferably an open proximal end . Guiding element  further includes an elongated inflatable balloon  inflatably attached to member . Balloon  is inflatable either via openings  formed in the wall of member  connecting lumen  thereof with balloon  (), or by a dedicated channel  (and ) formed in the wall of member  and opens to balloon . A double headed adapter  is preferably provided in fluid communication with either lumen  and\/or channel  and is used for connecting an inflating device for inflating\/deflating balloon  and\/or connecting a perfusing device for perfusing liquids in an out of the body of the patient.","The diameter of guiding element  is selected so as to enable its insertion through members  and  of catheter  when balloon  is deflated. Inflating balloon  ensures fixation of element  and catheter , such that via element , which is constructed of sufficient length and rigidity, catheter  is guided to its appropriate position within the urinary tract of the patient, as further detailed hereinabove.","As shown in according to one embodiment of the present invention, guiding element  further includes an additional or alternative balloon , located distally to balloon , if the latter is present. Balloon  is shaped and functions similarly to balloon  of catheter . This configuration of element  is directed at insertion and positioning of catheters lacking a bladder positioning balloon (e.g., balloon ). Such catheters include the configuration of catheter  according to the present invention in which only balloon  is employed, or prior art configurations in which no balloons are employed altogether, such as shown in the prior art catheter of , in which two tubular members  and  are interconnected by a connecting element, such as a thread .","Balloon  is in fluid communication with an adapter  through a channel  formed in the wall of member  and which opens to balloon  at opening , such that balloon  is inflated independently of balloon  (when the latter is present) via adapter . Like balloon  of catheter , balloon  serves for positioning catheter  within the patient's urinary tract.","To this end, an indwelling catheter, e.g., catheter , an example of which is shown in , or catheter  according to the present invention, is attached to guiding element  by first inserting guiding element  therethrough and then inflating balloon  thereof. Then, guiding element  is guided through the urinary tract of the patient, until balloon  is within the bladder of the patient. Thereafter, balloon  is inflated and thereby anchors element  within the body of the patient. Subsequent pulling of element  such that balloon  is in contact with the wall of the bladder of the patient ensures accurate positioning of catheter  or  within the urinary tract thereof. Deflating both balloons  and , enables to retrieve element , while catheter  or  is retained in place.","Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["c ","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["d ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["e ","d; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["b ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["b ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["c ","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["d ","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["b ","a; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
