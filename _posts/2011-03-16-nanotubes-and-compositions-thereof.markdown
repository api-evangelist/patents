The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to the field of implants, and more particularly to the modification of the surface of implants using polypeptide-functionalized nanotubes. The present invention further relates to the modification of the surface of an implant device using certain polypeptide-functionalized nanotubes to selectively promote adhesion of certain cells to the surface of the implant device. According to one aspect, the surface of an implant modified to include polypeptide-functionalized nanotubes promotes the adhesion of osteoblasts to the implant. The present invention also relates to methods, compositions and composites including nanotubes for tissue repair and regeneration.","The use of GC motifs to self-assemble into helical rosette nanotubes is known. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,565, Fenniri et al, 2001, 123, 3854-3855 and Moralez et al., 2005, 127, 8307-8309. It is desirable to modify the surface of implants so as to increase the ability of cells to adhere to the implant surface and form tissue thereon. It is also desirable to provide compositions useful in making implants which promote the growth of tissue on and into the implant.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to create functionalized modules that can assemble into substructures, which themselves can assemble into more complex structures on a nanometer scale, such as a nanotube. It is a further object of the present invention to create functionalized modules which can self-assemble into ring structures for use in creating nanotubes that can be used as a coating for implants. It is a still further object to functionalize the modules with one or more moieties that enhance or improve the adhesion of selected cells to the implant. It is also an object of the present invention to modify the surface of an implant with nanotubes having moieties that increase the adhesion of cells to the surface of the implant. It is a still additional object of the present invention to tailor the polypeptides on the nanotubes to selectively promote adhesion of certain cells that are desirable to the formation of tissue on the implant. It is a further still additional object of the present invention to provide compositions or composites including nanotubes, nanoparticles and matrix materials for tissue repair and regeneration which can placed at a site within the body and on or into which growth of tissue can be promoted. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention or certain embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following disclosure and description of exemplary embodiments.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods of altering the surface of a substrate to improve cell adhesion, proliferation and\/or differentiation on the surface of the substrate. Substrates within the scope of the present invention include implant surfaces where cell adhesion is desired and\/or cellular growth and\/or cellular differentiation on the substrate itself or at the location of the implant within the body. Examples of such implants are those associated with orthopedic applications. According to this aspect of the invention, the surface of the implant is modified to include a nanostructured outer surface. An implant with such a surface according to the present invention provides greater cell adhesion as compared to an implant without the nanostructured outer surface.","Certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to coatings on the surface of implants that selectively promote adhesion of certain cell types to the surface of the implant. According to certain aspects, the coatings provide a desirable surface chemistry or condition which promotes selective cell adhesion, proliferation and\/or differentiation. According to certain other aspects, the coating is biomimetic. Coatings according to certain embodiments of the present invention include nanometer scale molecular architectures, such as nanotubes, that include moieties or sidechains that selectively promote adhesion of certain cell types to the surface of the implant. Further embodiments allow for the selective adhesion of certain cell types compared to other certain cell types. The nanometer scale molecular architectures can be used alone or in combination with components suitable for creating a coating on the surface of a substrate and for proliferating and\/or differentiating cells. According to certain other embodiments, the coatings that include the nanometer scale molecular architectures promote the adhesion of selected cells and growth of tissue on the surface of the implant. According to still other embodiments, the coatings that include the nanometer scale molecular architectures are osteogenic insofar as they promote the adhesion of osteoblasts and the growth of the osteoblasts into bone tissue.","Certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to a composition or composite for tissue repair and regeneration. The terms composition and composite can be used interchangeably herein. The compositions can be in the form of injectable liquids, moldable putties or hardened structures. The hardened structures may be rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible. The hardened structures may be porous or nonporous. According to one aspect, the injectable liquids and moldable putties may harden when placed within the environment of the body. For example, composites within the present disclosure can be injected as a liquid and solidify in situ simply through exposure to body temperatures. It is to be understood that the injectable liquids, moldable putties or hardened structures can be referred to as implants.","According to one embodiment, the composition includes the nanometer scale molecular architectures, a compound providing mechanical strength and a matrix material. The composition can be placed at a site within the body where structural support is desired. The composition can be placed within the body where tissue growth or regeneration is desired. The composition can be placed within the body where a combination of structural support and tissue growth or regeneration is desired. The composition can be permanent or biodegradable or bioresorbable. The composition can also be fashioned into various implant shapes to occupy a site where tissue has been removed such as a bone chip or fracture. The composition can also be fashioned into devices useful in rebuilding damaged tissue sites such as plates, rods, screws, cages, scaffolds, films, and coatings. The size, shape and manufacture of such devices including the compositions described herein and their use is well known to those of skill in the art and will be readily apparent based on the present disclosure.","The composition or composite selectively promotes the adhesion of certain cell types to the surface of the composition or composite. According to certain aspects, the composition provides a desirable surface chemistry or nanometer scale surface geometry or condition which promotes selective cell adhesion, proliferation and\/or differentiation. According to certain other aspects, the composition is biomimetic. The composition of the present disclosure includes nanometer scale molecular architectures, such as nanotubes, that in some embodiments include moieties or sidechains that selectively promote adhesion of certain cell types to the surface of the implant. Further embodiments include nanoparticles in addition to the nanotubes to provide a nanometer scale surface geometry intended to promote cell adhesion, proliferation and\/or differentiation. Further embodiments allow for the selective adhesion of certain cell types compared to other certain cell types.","Embodiments of the present invention are also directed to modules, including functionalized modules that self-assemble into more complex structures on a nanometer scale, such as a nanotube. The functionalized modules include one or more moieties that promote the adhesion of cells when present in a coating on the surface of a substrate, such as the surface of an implant. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the nanometer scale structure can include several different moieties, i.e. two or more moieties or a plurality of moieties, that selectively promote adhesion of certain cell types. According to certain other embodiments, the certain cell types include those useful in promoting the expansion and growth of cells into tissue. According to a particular embodiment, the certain cell types include osteoblasts, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, cardiac myocytes, chondrocytes, synoviocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem cells, islet cells, hepatocytes, smooth muscle cells, urothelial cells, neurons, Schwann cells and the like.","Embodiments of the present invention are also directed to methods of selectively tailoring cell adhesion to the surface of an implant. According to this aspect of the present invention, a moiety is selected that will promote the adhesion of a particular cell type. The adhesion can be in vitro, i.e. before the implant is implanted, or in vivo, i.e. after the implant is implanted. The moiety is included into a module which is then assembled into a substructure. The substructure is then assembled into a nanometer scale molecular architecture, such as a nanotube. According to one embodiment, the assembly is a self-assembly insofar as the modules are placed into an aqueous medium where they self assemble into a substructure such as a ring structure, such as a rosette, and the ring structures then self-assemble by stacking one on top of another to form a tubular structure, commonly referred to as a nanotube. Such modules, substructures and nanometer scale molecular structures and their self-assembly is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,565, Fenniri et al, 2001, 123, 3854-3855, Moralez et al., 2005, 127, 8307-8309, and Fine et al., 2009:4 91-97 each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes.","According to certain aspects of the present invention, one example of a nanometer scale molecular architecture is a nanotube having nanometer scale dimensions. The nanotubes range in lengths between about 1 nm and about 999 microns, 10 nm and about 10,000 nm, 1 nm to about 500 nm, about 10 nm to about 300 nm, or about 20 nm to about 100 nm. The nanotubes range in diameters between about 1 angstrom and about 100 nm or about 3 nm to about 20 nm. The openings through the nanotubes range in diameters between about 1 angstrom and about 100 nm or about 3 nm to about 20 nm. According to particular embodiments, the nanotubes are monodispersed in diameter for a given functionality attached to a nanotube. By varying the functionalities attached to the nanotube, the diameter can vary between about 1 nm to about 30 nm, or from about 3 nm to about 15 nm. The opening through the nanotube can range in diameter between about 1 nm to about 30 nm, or from about 3 nm to about 15 nm. According to certain embodiments, the opening through the nanotube has a diameter of about 1 nm.","According to one aspect of the present invention, if different cell types are useful in promoting the growth of particular tissue, then a moiety can be selected and included into a substructure for each cell type desired to be adhered to the surface of an implant. In this aspect of the present invention, the nanometer scale molecular architecture can include two or more moieties each selective for a different cell type. The nanometer scale molecular architecture can then be coated on the surface of an implant whether partly or entirely or fashioned into an implant, whether in liquid, putty or solid form. The implant can then be implanted at the desired site within a patient, human or animal, in need of such an implant. Desired cells adhere to the surface of the implant and the desired tissue will grow. In the alternative, the desired cells can be applied and adhered to the surface of the implant before implantation. Such embodiments are useful to promote the growth of tissue on the implant or at the site of implantation. According to aspects of the present invention, the terms adhesion and adherence are used interchangeably and refer to the ability of the cells to remain on the surface of a substrate when subjected to rinsing with saline as known in the art.","Embodiments of the present invention are still further directed to compositions including nanometer scale molecular architectures having functional moieties attached thereto. The functional moieties can have therapeutic or diagnostic applications. The nanometer scale molecular architectures can be used as vehicles for the delivery of functional moieties to a particular site for therapeutic or diagnostic application. According to certain embodiments, the functionalized nanometer scale molecular architectures are mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or delivery vehicle and then delivered to the desired location. The nanometer scale molecular architectures of the present invention, such as nanotubes, can mimic the mechanical properties of cartilage when mixed with ceramics and can self-assemble into a material that can mimic the properties of bone. According to one aspect, the nanometer scale molecular architectures are nonfunctionalized or functionalized with moieties useful in orthopedic, cartilage, vascular and wound healing applications, in addition to therapeutic and diagnostic applications.","According to another aspect, modules as described herein which are nonfunctionalized or functionalized for a particular purpose are delivered to a desired site within the body, such as by injection or physical placement as with a putty, where conditions within the body such as temperature and aqueous environment cause the modules to self-assemble into nanotubular structures, preferably solidify, and promote the growth of tissue in the particular environment. According to one aspect, the modules are a component of a composition including a strengthening compound for providing mechanical strength and a matrix material. The composition is placed within the body where conditions within the body such as temperature and aqueous environment causes the modules to self-assemble into nanotubular structures and the composition to cure or polymerize or otherwise solidify into a hardened implant. In one embodiment, the modules are already self-assembled into nanotube structures before delivery to a site within the body. For example, the modules or self-assembled nanotube structures are injected into a fractured bone, cartilage, vascular tissue, heart tissue, nervous system tissue, etc. where the self-assembled nanotubes promote the growth of useful tissue. In addition, the self-assembled nanotubes can be applied to the surface of skin to serve as a wound healing device.","According to certain aspects, methods and compositions are provided for promoting osteoblast differentiation and proliferation, for example at the site of a bone injury or defect or surgical site, including providing an implant with a composition including nanotubes formed from modules according to formula I and\/or formula II described herein, nanoparticles, such as nanoparticles of a calcium phosphate and a matrix material, and placing the implant within the body at a site where osteoblast differentiation and proliferation is desired. According to this aspect of the disclosure, the nanometer scale surface geometry of the composition resulting from the nanotubes and the nanoparticles within the matrix promotes the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts and the growth of bone tissue.","According to certain aspects, methods and compositions are provided for promoting osteoblast differentiation and proliferation while inhibiting fibroblast proliferation including providing an implant with a composition including nanotubes formed from modules according to formula I and\/or formula II described herein, nanoparticles, such as nanoparticles of a calcium phosphate and a matrix material, and placing the implant within the body at a site where osteoblast differentiation and proliferation is desired. According to this aspect of the disclosure, the nanometer scale surface geometry of the composition resulting from the nanotubes and the nanoparticles within the matrix promotes the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts and inhibits fibroblast proliferation.","According to certain aspects, methods and compositions are provided for treating bone defects providing an implant with a composition including nanotubes formed from modules according to formula I and\/or formula II described herein, nanoparticles, such as nanoparticles of a calcium phosphate and a matrix material, and placing the implant within the body at a site of a bone defect, such as a fracture, or where bone is missing. According to this aspect of the disclosure, the hardened composition with nanometer scale surface geometries resulting from the nanotubes and the nanoparticles within the matrix provides sufficient mechanical support and promotes the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts and the deposition of calcium to treat the bone defect. According to certain aspects, the hardened composition with nanometer scale surface geometries resulting from the nanotubes and the nanoparticles within the matrix provides sufficient mechanical support and promotes the differentiation of stem cells into osteoblasts and further promotes proliferation of the osteoblasts and the deposition of calcium to treat the bone defect. According to one aspect, the composition can be in the form of an injectable liquid or shapeable putty and can include stem cells or osteoblasts. Alternatively, stem cells or osteoblasts can be applied to a tissue defect site before application of the composition to the tissue defect site or simultaneously along with the composition to the tissue defect site.","Embodiments of the present invention are based on the discovery that implant surfaces may be tailored to enhance or promote the adhesion of selective cell types using nanometer scale architectures or structures that can preferably be biomimetic, namely having structural similarity to structures found in nature. The nanometer scale structures are formed from modules that preferably self-assemble into substructures, which themselves self-assemble into the nanometer scale architectures or structures, when placed in an aqueous environment such as body fluids. Embodiments of the present invention are further directed to compositions including the nanometer scale structures, such as self assembled nanotubes, a strengthening compound providing mechanical strength, an optional nanoparticle and a matrix material. The compositions can be flowable or moldable such that they can be placed in or occupy or form-fit into a desired site, space or location with the body, such as by syringe, trocar or by hand, and then cured into a hardened structure to provide a nanometer scale surface geometry, to mechanical strength and\/or to promote tissue growth or regeneration.","In some embodiments, the viscosity of the composition can be altered to between a flowable liquid and a less flowable putty. As a composition becomes more viscous, it may be more putty-like. Similarly, as a composition becomes less viscous, it may be described as a flowable or liquid material. However, as a person of ordinary skill in the art would be aware, the states of being \u201cflowable\u201d or \u201cputty-like\u201d exist along a continuum.","Modules according to the present invention include compounds of Formula I below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"29.97mm","wi":"33.87mm","file":"US08795691-20140805-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["2 ","1 ","2 ","2","n","1 ","1 ","1 ","10 ","1 ","5 ","1 ","3 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"29.97mm","wi":"33.87mm","file":"US08795691-20140805-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Alternative linker groups Rcan join the Y group to the carbon of the (CH)group or the N atom either by the amino group or the carboxyl group of the amino acid or polypeptide.","Alternative Linker moieties within the scope of the invention include NH and the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"137.41mm","wi":"68.58mm","file":"US08795691-20140805-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Compounds of Formula I can be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Pat.

However, it is to be understood that the two double ring structures need not be identical insofar as they may have different X and Rgroups.","Amino acids according to the present invention include the commonly known amino acids such as glycine (Gly, G), alanine (Ala, A), valine (Val, V), leucine (Leu, L), isoleucine (Ile, I), proline (Pro, P), hydroxyproline, phenylalanine (Phe, F), tyrosine (Tyr, Y), tryptophan (Trp, W) cysteine (Cys, C), methionine (Met, M) serine (Ser, S), o-phosphoserine, threonine (Thr, T), lysine (Lys, K), arginine (Arg, R), histidine (His, H), aspartate (Asp, D), glutamate (Glu, E), \u03b3-carboxyglutamate, asparagine (Asn, N), glutamine (Gln, Q) and the like. Amino acids also include stereoisomers thereof and compounds structurally similar to the amino acids or modifications or derivatives thereof. Exemplary amino acids within the scope of the present invention include those that improve adhesion of cells to the surface of a substrate. Accordingly, these amino acids are referred to as cell adhesion promoting amino acids. Specific cell adhesion promoting amino acids include lysine, arginine, serine, glycine, aspartate and the like.","Polypeptides according to the present invention include two or more amino acids covalently linked together. According to one aspect, the two or more amino acids are covalently linked together at least in part by one or more peptide bonds. Exemplary polypeptides within the scope of the present invention include those that improve adhesion of cells to the surface of a substrate. Accordingly, these polypeptides are referred to as cell adhesion promoting polypeptides. Specific cell adhesion promoting polypeptides include lysine-arginine-serine-argine (KRSR), arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD), isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV), tyrosine-isoleucine-glycine-serine-arginine (YIGSR) and the like. It is to be understood that other polypeptides having cell adhesion promoting characteristics are within the scope of the present invention which will be recognized by those of skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. Without wishing to be bound by scientific theory, adhesion between osteoblasts and the KRSR polypeptide is believed to operate via heparin sulphate proteoglycan mediated mechanisms. See Dee et al., 1998; 40:371-377 incorporated herein by reference.","According to aspects of the present invention, modules (compounds) according to Formula I and Formula II self-assemble into substructures also called supermacrocycles which themselves will self-assemble into nanometer scale architectures or structures such as discrete nanotubular assemblies in water or aqueous solutions. Supermacrocycles are defined herein as being a number of organic molecules covalently or noncovalently bound together so as to form a ring structure. For example, compounds of Formula I will self-assemble into a 6-mer ring structure, sometimes referred to as a rosette. The process of forming nanotubes with the modules of the present invention is hierarchical. In particular, the modules of the present invention first self-assemble into supermacrocycles, and then the supermacrocycles self-assembly into nanotubes. Such self-assembly is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,565. For the compounds of Formula II which include twin base linkers, the compounds will also assemble into a 6-mer ring structure. However, a single supermacrocycle formed will include two base layers owing to the presence of the two bases in each of the compound of Formula II.","According to preferred aspects of the present invention, the compounds of Formula I and Formula II include low molecular weight synthetic DNA base analogues referred to by the nomenclature CG. See Fenniri et al, 2001, 123, 3854-3855. The CG moiety, referred to as a single CG motif, possess the Watson-Crick donor-donor-acceptor of guanine and the acceptor-acceptor-donor of cytosine and undergoes a self-assembly process, fueled by an array of hydrogen bonds, to produce a six-membered supermacrocycle or rosette. Stacking of these rosettes produced a nanotube of very high aspect ratio. Compounds within the scope of the present invention include a twin G^C motif denoted as (CG). Like the single CG motif, the twin CG motif (CG)also possesses the Watson-Crick donor-donor-acceptor of guanine and the acceptor-acceptor-donor of cytosine and undergoes a self assembly process, fueled by an array of hydrogen bonds, to produce a six-membered supermacrocycle or ring structure (rosette) of twin configuration. Stacking of these twin rosettes produces a nanotube of very high aspect ratio and higher stability.","It should be understood that the above described Formula I and Formula II demonstrate that electrostatic, stacking and hydrophobic interactions can be effectively orchestrated by hydrogen bonds to direct the hierarchical assembly and organization of helical nanotubular architectures in an aqueous milieu. Helical nanotubular architectures within the scope of the present invention include those formed entirely from compounds of Formula I. Helical nanotubular architectures within the scope of the present invention include those formed entirely from compounds of Formula II. Further, helical nanotubular architectures within the scope of the present invention include those formed from one or more of the compounds of Formula I and one or more of the compounds of Formula II. For example, a supermacrocycle ring substructure having particular amino acid or polypeptide side chains formed from the compounds of Formula I can be stacked with a supermacrocycle ring substructure having particular amino acid or polypeptide side chains formed from compounds of Formula II. The rosette substructures formed from the compounds of Formula I and Formula II can be stacked in any desired sequence to form nanotubular structures of the present invention. In this manner, the nanotubular structures possess the amino acids or polypeptides that promote adhesion of selected cells to the nanotubular structures. Utilizing this aspect of the present invention, a wide variety of structurally different modules (i.e. molecules) specific to promote adhesion of certain cells can be synthesized and self-assembled into supermacrocycles and then nanotubular structures according to methods of the present invention.","According to certain preferred aspects of the present invention, a nanotube is prepared that includes K, RGD and KRSR sidechains. The nanotube can be formed from single base ring structures and twin base ring structures in any desired order. The nanotube can have one or more single base ring structures and one or more twin base ring structures. Likewise, a nanotube within the scope of the present invention can include a plurality of single base ring structures formed from compounds of Formula I and a plurality of twin base ring structures formed from compounds of Formula II stacked together, i.e. one next to the other via hydrogen bonding, to form the nanotube.","According to certain aspects, implant surfaces are modified to include the nanotubular structures according to the present invention. Implants within the scope of the present invention have particular uses and applications with orthopedics, cartilage, vascular, neural, skin, bladder, cardiovascular, and the like. Implants according to the present invention can be fashioned from one or more materials known to those skilled in the art including metals, ceramics, polymers and copolymers, Specific implant materials include titanium, stainless steel, Co\u2014Cr\u2014Mo, Ti6Al4V, nitinol, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid, poly glycolic acid, poly lactic acid, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, silicone, poly vinyl chloride, alumina, titania, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphates, zirconia, zinc oxide, silver oxide, and the like.","According to certain aspects, the nanotubular structures are directly applied to the surface of an implant as a coating. The coating can include the nanotubular structures themselves and may further include components known to those skilled in the art to form coatings, such as hydrogels (such as poly-HEMA), hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphates, alumina, titania, polymers (such as poly-lactic, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, silicone, poly vinyl chloride) and the like. The coating may also include cell growth promoting components such as proteins (vitronectin, fibronectin, herparin, etc.) and growth factor\/cytokines (TGF-\u03b2, IGF, NGF, VEGF, BMPs, etc.). The coating may also include therapeutically beneficial ingredients such a drugs, hormones, and antibiotics such as penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, dexamethasone, estrogen, bisphosphanates, etc. and the like. The coating may be applied to the implant surface using methods known to those of skill in the art such as direct application, dipping, spraying, painting, electrospinning, cast-mold, heat or thermal processes, spin coating and the like. According to one aspect, the coating is dried to retain the coating on the surface prior to application of cells. In other respects, coatings within the scope of the present invention may be curable onto the surface of an implant using coating compositions and methods known to those of skill in the art.","According to certain aspects, a composition for repair or regeneration of tissue, such as bone tissue, includes one or more nanotubes formed from a plurality of single base ring structures formed from compounds of Formula I. It is to be understood that the compound of formula I need not include a linker or an amino acid or polypeptide and so nanotubes formed from formula I according to the present disclosure need not include a linker or amino acid or a polypeptide. According to an additional embodiment, a composition according to certain aspects can include one or more nanotubes formed from a plurality of twin base ring structures formed from compounds of Formula II. It is to be understood that the compound of formula II need not include a linker or an amino acid or polypeptide and so nanotubes formed from formula II according to the present disclosure need not include a linker or amino acid or a polypeptide. According to a still further embodiment, a composition according to certain aspects can include one or more nanotubes formed from a plurality of single base ring structures formed from compounds of Formula I and a plurality of twin base ring structures formed from compounds of Formula II stacked together, i.e. one next to the other via hydrogen bonding, to form the nanotube.

Reagent grade dichloromethane, methanol and ether were purified on an MBraun solvent purification system. Modules of twin base pairs functionalized with the polypeptide KRSR, i.e. KRSR-(CG)and modules of twin base pairs functionalized with aminobutane, i.e. AB-(CG)are shown in  and were synthesized according to the procedures illustrated in  and , respectively.  depicts twin base RNTs TB-KRSR (E); TBL (F); the self-assembly process of twin CG bases into a rosette nanotube (G).","Standard Fmoc [see Carpino et al., 1972; 37(22):3404-3409 and Atherton et al., 1978:537-539 each hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties] solid-phase peptide synthesis was used to prepare the Wang resin-supported KRSR peptide. SPPS [see Merrifield, 1963; 85(14):2149-2154 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety] is a simple procedure, which allows rapid synthesis of peptides in good yields. This method eliminates solubility, purification and racemization issues, common with solution phase peptide synthesis. In general, the carboxyl groups of the protected amino acid Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH was first coupled to the hydroxyl groups on the Wang resin. The Fmoc group of the lysine anchored to the resin was removed under basis conditions, after which it was reacted with the second amino acid Fmoc-Arg(PBf)-OH. The same procedure was repeated for subsequent amino acid couplings with Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(PBf)-OH and Fmoc-\u03b3-Abu-OH. The terminal Fmoc group on the Wang resin-supported peptide was removed and the resulting free amine was reductively coupled to CG aldehyde. The desired motif KRSR-(CG)was obtained upon deprotection and cleavage from the resin under strongly acidic conditions.","More specifically and with reference to , to anchor the first amino acid to the resin, Fmoc-amino acid (4 eq), p-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (1 eq) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 8 mL) were poured into a disposable plastic syringe containing the Wang resin (1 eq). After activating the resin for 20 min, N,N\u2032-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC, 4 eq) was added to the vessel and the reaction mixture was shaken for 6 hours (hr). The resin was then filtered under vacuum, washed with 10 mL each of CHCl, MeOH, DMF and then treated with 50:50 acetic anhydride\/pyridine (5 mL, 1\u00d710 min and 2\u00d720 min) to cap the unreactive hydroxyl groups. The resin was then filtered and washed with (3\u00d710 mL) with DMF, CHCl, and MeOH and dried under vacuum. The substitution degree (0.52 mmol\/g) was determined by spectroscopic quantification of the fulvene-piperidine adduct at 301 nm on a resin sample.","Subsequent amino acids were coupled as follows: the Fmoc protecting group was removed by incubation of the resin in 20% piperidine\/DMF (5 mL, 1\u00d75 min, 1\u00d730 min). The resulting peptidyl resin was washed with 10 mL each of CHCl, MeOH, DMF. N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropan-2-amine (DIEA, 8 eq) was added to a mixture of amino acid (4 eq relative to resin loading) and 2-(1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 4 eq) in DMF solution, and the mixture was activated by shaking for 3 minutes (min). The resulting mixture was then added to the peptidyl resin and was shaken for 3 hours (h). The peptidyl resin was then drained and washed with 10 mL of each of CHCl, MeOH and DMF. The absence of free amino groups was confirmed with the Kaiser test [see Kaiser et al., Anal. Biochem, 1970, 24, 595-598 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety]. The Fmoc protecting group was removed by incubation of the resin in 20% piperidine\/DMF (5 mL, 1\u00d75 min, 1\u00d730 min). The resulting peptidyl resin was washed with 10 mL each of CHCl, MeOH, and DMF.","To prepare KRSR-(CG), the Wang resin-supported KRSR peptide was coupled to the CG aldehyde 1 (). The CG aldehyde 1 (4 eq relative to resign loading) was added to the peptidyl resin in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE, 5 mL), and the mixture was shaken for 4 h. NaBH(OAc)(2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq) were then added and the mixture was shaken for 36 h, after which another 2 eq NaBH(OAc)and 4 eq of DIEA were added and shaken for an additional 36 h. The resin was drained and the resulting peptidyl-resin was washed CHCl, MeOH and DMF (4\u00d710 mL each), and dried under vacuum. Cleavage from the resin and deprotection was achieved by treating the resin with 95% TFA\/water for 2 h. The beads were filtered over celite and the resulting filtrate was concentrated to a viscous liquid (rotavap). Cold EtO was then added to precipitate crude KRSR-(CG), which was isolated by centrifugation. The supernatant liquid was removed by decantation. The residual solid was resuspended in EtO (2\u00d715 mL), sonicated, and centrifuged. The precipitate was dried to yield the desired KRSR-(CG)as an off-white powder.","The synthetic scheme () was carried out for preparation of module AB-(CG)from the CG aldehyde and t-butyl 4-aminobutylcarbamate via two consecutive reductive amination reactions followed by removal all protecting groups. Specifically, to prepare AB-(CG), commercially available amine 2 (1.00 g, 1.57 mmol) was added to a solution of CG aldehyde 1 (0.148 g, 0.784 mmol) in 1,2 DCE (10 mL) at room temperature under Nand stirred for 30 min. NaBH(OAc)(0.395 g, 1.88 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for an additional 15 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with CHCl(50 mL) and then washed with water (10 mL), brine (15 mL), dried over NaSOand concentrated (rotavap) Compound 3 (1.36 g, 93%) was obtained as a white foam after silica gel flash chromatography (0-10% MeOH\/EtOAc). CG aldehyde 1 (0.100 g, 0.155 mmol) was then added to a solution of monomer 3 (0.126 g, 0.155 mmol) in 1,2 DCE (10 mL) at room temperature under Nand stirred for 30 min. NaBH(OAc)(0.039 g, 0.186 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for an additional 15 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with CHCl(50 mL) and washed with water (10 mL), brine (15 mL), dried over NaSOand concentrated. Compound 4 (0.204 g, 91%) was obtained as a white foam after silica gel flash chromatography (0-50% EtOAc\/Hexanes). Compound 4 (0.106 g, 0.074 mmol) was stirred in 95% TFA\/thioanisole (10 mL) for 72 h. EtO (60 mL) was then added to the reaction mixture and the precipitate formed, was centrifuged down. The residual solid was resuspended in EtO, sonicated and centrifuged down. This process was repeated until no UV-active product could be detected in the EtO wash (by spotting on a silica plate). The resulting TFA salt of AB-(CG)was dried and then dissolved in 1M hydrochloric acid (10 mL), followed by removal of the solvent under reduced pressure. This process was repeated twice before the solid was dried under vacuum for 72 h to give the HCl salt of AB-(CG)as an off-white powder in quantitative yield.","Stock solutions (1 mg\/mL) of RNTs assembled from functionalized twin bases AB-(CG)and KRSR-(CG)(referred as AB-RNTand KRSR-RNTrespectively) were prepared by dissolving the corresponding motifs (AB-(CG)isolated either as a TFA or HCl salt) in deionized water (dHO). The stock solutions were then diluted to 0.1 mg\/mL and 0.01 mg\/mL solutions for comparison purposes. RGD-CG and K-CG were prepared as previously reported [see Fenniri et al., 2001; 123:3854-3855 and Zhang et al., 2009; 30(7):1309-1320 each hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety].

As previously described [see Zhang et al., 1972; 37(22):3404-3409 hereby incorporated by reference herein], carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids (EM Sciences, PA) were floated on a dHO droplet of each RNT (0.1 mg\/mL or 0.01 mg\/mL) for 2 min to adsorb the RNTs. The grids were then placed onto a droplet of dHO for 20 s to remove excess non-adherent RNTs before they were placed on a second droplet of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 20 s to negatively stain the RNTs. The grids were then dried with filter paper and imaged on a Philips EM410 under an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. The KRSR peptide (not coupled to CG base) was also imaged as a control experiment.","Irrespective of the side chains on the CG motif, all the resulting RNTs showed nanostructures of high aspect ratio (). TEM images revealed a larger diameter (4.4\u00b10.2 nm) for KRSR-RNT() as compared to AB-RNT(3.5\u00b10.2 nm) () due to the bulkier KRSR moiety attached on the periphery of the twin base. K-RNTand K\/RGD-RNT() featured a diameter of 3.4\u00b10.3 nm. As expected the control sample with KRSR peptide did not show any 1D morphologies ().","For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, twin bases (0.5 mg\/mL) were dissolved in dHO by sonication at room temperature for \u02dc2 min, The solutions were filtered on 0.25 \u03bcm Whatmann filter membrane, heated to boiling (to promote self-assembly), and aged for 1 day. The solutions were diluted to 0.025 mg\/mL with dHO prior to imaging. SEM samples were prepared by floating a carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grid on a droplet of the diluted RNT solution for 10 s. The grid was blotted and floated onto a drop of 2% uranyl acetate for 10 s. The RNT-coated grid was then air-dried and heated on a hot-plate (100\u00b0 C.) for 15 min before imaging on a high resolution Hitachi S-4800 SEM.","For atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, one drop of the diluted RNT solution (0.05 mg\/mL) was deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica substrate (1 cm) for 10 s and excess solution was blotted using filter paper. The sample surface was imaged using a Digital Instruments\/Veeco Instruments MultiMode Nanoscope IV AFM equipped with an E scanner in tapping mode. Silicon cantilevers (MikroMasch USA, Inc.) with low spring constants of 4.5 N\/m, a scan rate of 0.5-1 Hz and amplitude setpoint of 1 V were used.","SEM and AFM images revealed dense nanotubular networks for both KRSR-RNTand AB-RNT(). The average length of KRSR-RNTwas less than that of AB-RNT, suggesting that the peptide bulkiness influences the degree of stacking and hence the length of the RNTs.","Titanium (Ti) (1 cm\u00d71 cm\u00d70.05 cm) (Alfa Aesar Ti foil) and glass coverslips were soaked in acetone for 15 min, sonicated for 15 min in acetone, and rinsed with dHO. They were then soaked and sonicated in 70% ethanol and rinsed with dHO. Lastly, they were soaked and sonicated in dHO for another 15 min and rinsed. The glass was then etched in 1 M NaOH for 1 h and thoroughly rinsed in dHO. All of the Ti and glass coverslips were oven-dried overnight and autoclaved for sterilization. The day before cell seeding, the cleaned Ti substrates were coated with the various RNTs (0.01 mg\/mL) and KRSR peptide (0.01 mg\/mL) solutions for 45 min at room temperature. They were then removed from the solutions and air-dried overnight.","A human fetal osteoblast cell line (ATCC, CRL-11372, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen Corporation) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, UT) and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin (P\/S, Hyclone, UT) under standard cell culture conditions (37\u00b0 C., humidified, 5% COin air). Cells were used up to population numbers of 8-11 in the experiments without further characterization.","A rat skin fibroblast cell line (FR, ATCC, CRL-1213) was cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC 30-2003) supplemented with 10% FBS under standard cell culture conditions. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC, VEC Technologies) were cultured in MCDB-131 complete medium (VEC Technologies) under standard cell culture conditions. The fibroblasts were used at population numbers 6-9 and the endothelial cells were used at population numbers 6-11 during culture. The cell medium was replaced every other day.","Osteoblasts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells were seeded onto the substrates at a density of 3500 cells\/cmand were incubated in the cell culture medium (specifically, DMEM supplemented with FBS and P\/S for osteoblasts, EMEM supplemented with FBS for fibroblasts and MCDB-131 complete medium for endothelial cells) for 4 h. Then, the substrates were rinsed three times with a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove non-adherent cells. The remaining cells were fixed using 10% normal buffered formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 10 min and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) for 5 min. Cells were then stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (staining F-actin filaments, Molecular Probes) to examine cell spreading and were further stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). The cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss) and five different areas of each sample were imaged. The cell density was then determined by counting cells using Image Pro Analyzer. All cellular experiments were run in triplicate and repeated three times for each substrate.","Data are presented as the mean value\u00b1the standard error of the mean and were analyzed with a student's t-test to make pair-wise comparisons. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.1.","All of the RNTs coated on Ti significantly enhanced osteoblast adhesion compared to uncoated Ti after 4 h (p<0.01) (). The nanotube KRSR-RNTgreatly improved osteoblast adhesion relative to K-RNT, AB-RNT, and uncoated Ti. Compared to uncoated Ti, the 0.01 mg\/mL KRSR-RNTand K\/RGD-RNTcoated Ti improved osteoblast adhesion by 122% and 124% respectively. In fact, KRSR-RNTand K\/RGD-RNTpromoted the greatest osteoblast densities on Ti. In addition, the KRSR peptide alone on Ti promoted more osteoblast cell adhesion relative to uncoated Ti. There was no statistically significant difference among AB-RNT, K\/RGD-RNT, and K-RNT.","In addition, more osteoblasts adhered to Ti when the latter was coated with KRSR-RNTversus KRSR. Specifically, osteoblast adhesion on Ti coated with KRSR-RNTwas 84.4% higher than Ti coated with the peptide KRSR alone. Additionally, osteoblasts were better spread with more extended filopodia on RNT-coated Ti than on uncoated Ti ().","Compared to uncoated Ti, KRSR-RNT, K\/RGD-RNT, K-RNT, and AB-RNTdid not alter fibroblast adhesion after 4 h (). AB-RNTwas assembled from the HCl and TFA salts of AB-(CG). The differences in fibroblast attachment with these two types of RNTs may be associated with their different counter ions. In contrast with its effect on osteoblast adhesion, the KRSR peptide did not enhance fibroblast adhesion on Ti. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a nanotube incorporating KRSR provides for cell selectivity and utility in orthopedic applications. Finally, many small filopodia extensions from rounded fibroblasts were visible on all substrates, indicating that fibroblasts spread regardless of the Ti coatings ().","As shown in , a significantly higher endothelial density on the Ti coated with RNTs (except for KRSR-RNT) was achieved as compared to uncoated Ti after 4 h. In addition, AB-RNT(HCl) coated Ti promoted the greatest endothelial cell adhesion compared to all other substrates. Furthermore, more endothelial cells attached on Ti coated with K-RNTand AB-RNT(HCl) than on Ti coated with KRSR-RNT. KRSR-RNTand KRSR peptide coated Ti did not enhance endothelial cell adhesion. According to one aspect of the present invention, the nanotubes incorporating KRSR selectively promote osteoblast adhesion. Endothelial cell spreading morphologies were shown in .  shows excellent cytocompatibility properties of K-RNTand RGD-RNTfor endothelial cell adhesion and the selectivity of KRSR-RNTonly for osteoblast adhesion. Accordingly, a thin film of nanostructured RNT coatings with numerous K or RGD side chains alters the surface chemistry and surface roughness of conventional Ti to provide a favorable environment for enhancing endothelial cell adhesion. According to one aspect of the present invention, a nanotube is formed including K or RDG side chains that promote adhesion of endothelial cells and the growth of new blood vessels in bone formed around an orthopedic implant. The nanotube may also include KRSR side chains that promote the adhesion of osteoblasts. A nanotube with a combination of K, RDG and KRSR side chains promotes the selective adhesion of osteoblasts and endothelial cells leading to the formation of new bone tissue useful in orthopedic applications.","Hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles were synthesized by stirring (NH)HPOand Ca(NO)in a NHOH solution (pH>10), following the equation below.\n\n10Ca(NH)+6(NH)HPO+8NHOH=Ca(PO)(OH)+6HO+20NHNO\n","For a narrow size distribution, the reaction was carried at 4\u00b0 C.

Then, the surface characterization and pore sizes of composites were studied by SEM (LEO 1530-VP) at a scale of 200 nm and 100 \u03bcm.","As shown in , with increasing HA ratios in the composites, more HA nanoparticles clustered on the surface, therefore generating greater nano-roughness. Since the surface topography is related with protein and cellular adhesion, cell movement, orientation, morphology, and even gene expression, the nanoroughness provided by the HA nanoparticles promotes the osteointegration between the bone and implants.","As shown in , the composites exhibit porosity which promote the growth of tissue into and through the implanted composites. Pore sizes can be between about 1 angstrom and about 999 microns in diameter. Pore density can be between about 0.0001% and about 99.9999%.","Compressive and tensile properties were tested following the ASTM standards D695-10 Standard Test Method for Compressive Properties of Rigid Plastics and D638-10 Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Solidified composite samples were prepared following the above method. The Instron 5882 mechanical testing system was used to test the compressive curve of cylinder samples (12.7 mm in diameter and 25.4 in height) at the speed of 1.3 mm\/min.","As shown in , the mechanical properties of composites including the nanotubes formed from TBLs of Example 11 were tunable with the HA component, and the compressive strength increased with the weight ratio of HA. The 20% HA composites had the highest strength 42.7 MPa, which is suitable for orthopedic load bearing applications. According to certain aspects, composites have compressive strengths of between about 0.001 MPa to about 1000 GPa. Using TEM imaging, the average pore size of composites is 90.1 \u03bcm.","For bacterial tests, PMMA and pure pHEMA were established as the control groups, and three types of bacterial strains (, and ) were incubated on the sample surfaces in a 96-well plate for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COincubator. After the incubation, the samples were rinsed by deionized water, following the bacterial proliferation assay for 3 h.","As shown in , in the bacterial study, compared to PMMA and pure pHEMA samples, the addition of TBL nanotubes formed from the TBLs of Example 11 and HA nanoparticles did not alter bacteria adhesion. Also, there is no discernable difference among pHEMA, TBL, HA or PMMA groups.","100% of the HEMA solution with 3 mg\/mL AIBN, TBLs from Example 11 (none, 0.01 mg\/mL) and HA nanoparticles (2%, 20%) were prepared as above. The weights of dry solidified samples were recorded first. Then, 4 samples in each group were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes with deionized water in a 37\u00b0 C. incubator for 7, 30 and 60 days. After the prescribed time period, samples were dried and measured again, and the weight loss was calculated.","As shown in , degradation tests of 7 and 30 days indicated small percentages of weight loss for all samples. After 30 days, the samples containing 2% HA with nanotubes of TBL molecules of Example 11 had the largest weight loss.","A human fetal osteoblast cell line (ATCC, CRL-11372, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen Corporation) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, UT) and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin (P\/S, Hyclone, UT) under standard cell culture conditions (37\u00b0 C., humidified, 5% CO\/95% air). Cells were used up to population numbers of 3 in experiments without further characterization.","For standard toxicity studies, a rat skin fibroblast cell line (FR, ATCC, CRL-1213) was cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC, 30-2003) supplemented with 10% FBS under standard cell culture conditions. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC, VEC Technologies) were cultured in MCDB-131 complete medium (VEC Technologies) under standard cell culture conditions. The fibroblasts were used at population numbers 6-9. Fibroblast and endothelial cell toxicity was not affected at the concentrations used which demonstrated that the compositions were not toxic at various concentrations.","Osteoblasts and fibroblasts were separately seeded onto the substrates at a density of 3500 cells\/cmand were incubated in the cell culture medium (specifically, DMEM supplemented with FBS and P\/S for osteoblasts and EMEM supplemented with FBS for fibroblasts) for 4 h. Then, the substrates formulated above were rinsed three times with a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove non-adherent cells. The remaining cells were fixed using 10% normal buffered formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 10 min and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) for 5 min. Cells were then stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (staining F-actin filaments, Molecular Probes) to examine cell spreading and further stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). The cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss) and five different areas of each sample were imaged.
