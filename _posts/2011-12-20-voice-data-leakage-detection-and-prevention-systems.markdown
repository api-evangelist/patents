No. 13\/331,710 entitled: \u201cVOICE DATA LEAKAGE DETECTION AND PREVENTION\u201d concurrently filed herewith and also assigned to Go Daddy Operating Company, LLC.","The present inventions generally relate to network security and, more particularly, systems and methods for detecting and preventing voice data leakage.","An example embodiment of a system for detecting and preventing voice data leakage may comprise one or more servers communicatively coupled to a network running a packet payload converter module, a transcript generator module, and a detection logic module. The packet payload converter module may be configured to receive a plurality of VoIP packets, convert the VoIP packets to a digital audio file, and write the digital audio file to a media database running on the one or more servers. The transcript generator module may be configured to read the digital audio file from the media database, convert the digital audio file to a text file, and write the text file to a transcript database running on the one or more servers. The detection logic module may be configured to read the text file from the transcript database, parse the text file into a plurality of keywords, determine whether the plurality of keywords contain one or more target keyword, and, if so, transmit a report to an events database running on the one or more server.","An example embodiment of a method of detecting and preventing voice data leakage may comprise the steps of receiving a plurality of VoIP packets, converting the VoIP packets to a digital audio file, converting the digital audio file to a text file, parsing the text file into a plurality of keywords, determining whether the plurality of keywords contains one or more target keywords, and, if so, generating a censored plurality of VoIP packets representing the conversation that excludes the one or more target keywords and transmitting the censored VoIP packets to a recipient.","The above features and advantages of the present inventions will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The present inventions will now be discussed in detail with regard to the attached drawing figures, which were briefly described above. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth illustrating the Applicant's best mode for practicing the inventions and enabling one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the inventions. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that the present inventions may be practiced without many of these specific details. In other instances, well-known machines, structures, and method steps have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present inventions. Unless otherwise indicated, like parts and method steps are referred to with like reference numerals.","Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is the practice identifying and tracking sensitive data in a network, ensuring that only authorized network users have access to such sensitive data, and minimizing the probability that such sensitive data is leaked beyond such authorized network users. As a non-limiting example, sensitive data may comprise any information that an organization should maintain securely, perhaps by obligation of law or policy. Examples of sensitive data may include personally-identifiable information, financial information, or medical records.","Presently-existing DLP systems and methods focus on identifying, monitoring, and protecting data as it is electronically stored (e.g., storage or \u201cdata at rest\u201d DLP), transmitted (e.g., network or \u201cdata in motion\u201d DLP), or processed (e.g., endpoint or \u201cdata in use\u201d DLP). Such methodologies identify data leaks through content inspection and\/or contextual analysis.","Applicant has determined, however, that presently-existing DLP systems and methods may be bypassed simply by transmitting sensitive information via telephone, thereby bypassing the electronic storage, transmission, and processing systems monitored by DLP methods. Presently-existing systems and methods therefore do not provide optimal means for detecting and preventing voice data leakage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","110","140","170"]},"Servers  (and\/or any other server described herein) may comprise any computer or program that provides services to other computers, programs, or users either in the same computer or over a computer network . As non-limiting examples, the one of more server  could be application, communication, mail, database, proxy, fax, file, media, web, peer-to-peer, standalone, software, or hardware servers (i.e., server computers) and may use any server format known in the art or developed in the future (possibly a shared hosting server, a virtual dedicated hosting server, a dedicated hosting server, or any combination thereof).","Servers  may comprise a computer-readable storage media storing instructions that, when executed by a microprocessor, cause the server  to perform the steps for which it is configured. The computer-readable media may comprise any data storage medium capable of storing instructions for execution by a computing device. It may comprise, as non-limiting examples, magnetic, optical, semiconductor, paper, or any other data storage media, a database or other network storage device, hard disk drives, portable disks, CD-ROM, DVD, RAM, ROM, flash memory, and\/or holographic data storage. The instructions may, as non-limiting examples, comprise software and\/or scripts stored in the computer-readable media that may be stored locally in the server or, alternatively, in a highly-distributed format in a plurality of computer-readable media accessible via the network , perhaps via a grid or cloud-computing environment.","The example embodiments illustrated herein place no limitation on network  configuration or connectivity. The network  may comprise any collection of links and nodes (e.g., multiple computers and\/or other devices connected together) arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. Thus, as non-limiting examples, the network  could comprise the Internet, the public switched telephone network, the global Telex network, computer networks (e.g., an intranet, an extranet, a local-area network, or a wide-area network), wired networks, wireless networks, or any combination thereof.","System components may be communicatively coupled to the network  via any method of network connection known in the art or developed in the future including, but not limited to wired, wireless, modem, dial-up, satellite, cable modem, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Asymmetric Digital Subscribers Line (ASDL), Virtual Private Network (VPN), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), X.25, Ethernet, token ring, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), IP over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), wireless, WAN technologies (T1, Frame Relay), Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), and\/or any combination thereof.","The packet payload converter module  may comprise software and\/or scripts that may be stored in the memory of\u2014and run on\u2014at least one server computer  and may contain instructions that, when executed by the server computer's  microprocessor, cause the microprocessor to receive a plurality of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) packets, convert the VoIP packets to a digital audio file , and write the digital audio file  to a media database  running on the one or more server .","The VoIP packets may comprise any Internet telephony format or type, perhaps (as illustrated in ) one representing a conversation between Caller A and Caller B. The illustrated embodiments place no limitation on the type of VoIP-related communication that may be processed by the systems and methods illustrated herein. For example, any audio, video, and\/or instant messaging communications transmitted in (or convertible to) packet format may be processed.","As a specific, non-limiting example, the VoIP packets may comprise the digital output of a VoIP Private Branch Exchange (PBX) within an organization, perhaps communicatively coupled to the network  or running on the server . The VoIP PBX may receive an incoming call (e.g., from Caller B), perhaps from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The PBX may convert the incoming call to Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) format (or any other format supported by VoIP or other Internet telephony protocols), which may comprise a standardized packet format for delivering audio over IP networks. Thus, the PBX may convert an incoming call into a plurality of data packets, perhaps in RTP format, that comprise a digital representation of a conversation between, for example, Caller A and Caller B. Each packet may comprise a header (e.g., source and destination IP address information) and a payload (e.g., digital audio data representing parts of the conversation).","The packet payload converter module  may receive the packets, perhaps directly from the PBX in real time, and convert them into a digital audio file . As a non-limiting example, the packet payload converter module  may extract a plurality of digital audio data from the payloads of the RTP packets and reconstruct the conversation by writing the digital audio data extracted from numerous packets to one or more digital audio file , which may comprise an digital reconstruction of the entire (or part of) the telephone conversation. The illustrated embodiments place no limitations on audio file types that may be used including, but not limited to those using uncompressed audio formats e.g., (WAV, AIFF, or AU), those using lossless compression (e.g., MPEG-4, M4A, or FLAC), and\/or those using lossy compression (e.g., MP3).","The audio file  then may be written to a media database , perhaps running on the server . The media database  may store numerous digital audio files , perhaps received from the packet payload converter module . It (and\/or any other database described herein) may comprise a local database, online database, desktop database, server-side database, relational database, hierarchical database, network database, object database, object-relational database, associative database, concept-oriented database, entity-attribute-value database, multi-dimensional database, semi-structured database, star schema database, XML database, file, collection of files, spreadsheet, or other means of data storage located on a computer, client, server, or any other storage device known in the art or developed in the future.","The transcript generator module  may be configured (e.g., programmed) to read the digital audio file  from the media database , convert the digital audio file  to a text file , and write the text file  to a transcript database  running on the one or more server . The audio file  may be converted to a text file  by any known speech-to-text system or methodology including, but not limited to those provided by WAV to Text or DRAGON DICTATION (e.g., DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING). The transcript generator module  may generate the text file  itself or, alternatively, receive the text file , from a web service responsive to transmitting the digital audio file  for conversion to the text file . The transcript generator module  then may write the text file  to the transcript database .","The detection logic module  may be configured (e.g., programmed) to read the text file  from the transcript database  and parse the text file  into a plurality of keywords. Parsing is the process of analyzing a sequence of tokens to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar. Parsing transforms input text into a data structure, such as the keywords used here. As a non-limiting example, if a text file  contains the following sentence: \u201cJohn Doe's social security number is 123-45-6789,\u201d the detection logic module may parse the sentence into, among others, the keywords \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d \u201csocial security number,\u201d and\/or \u201c123-45-6789.\u201d","The text file  may be parsed using any parsing methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, top-down parsing and\/or bottom-up parsing. The parsing process also may include glyph or character substitution (i.e., identifying typographically improper characters and substituting characters that result in potentially-meaningful keywords). For example, the parsing process may replace the phrase \u201cone one two\u201d in a social security or credit card number to \u201c112,\u201d resulting in more effective keyword parsing because \u201c112\u201d is more legible and\/or understandable in the social security or credit card number context than \u201cone one two.\u201d","The detection logic module  also may be configured (e.g., programmed) to determine whether the text file contains one or more target keyword . As non-limiting examples, target keywords  may comprise any word, term, phrase, sentence, number, and\/or set of characters. For example, the target keywords  may comprise a personally-identifiable information, a credit card number, a social security number, a bank account number, a customer information, a name, an address, a phone number, an organizational secret, a curse word, a trade secret, an illegal activity, an improper activity, a medical information, a financial, or an accounting information.","In one example embodiment, target keywords  may be received from a system administrator , who may comprise an individual within an organization responsible for its DLP. As a non-limiting example, a system administrator  may access the illustrated system, perhaps via a client computer, and log into a control panel configured to allow the system administrator  to enter target keywords  that the illustrated system should search for.","If the detection logic module  locates a target keyword  in the text file , it may transmit a report to an events database , perhaps running on the one or more server . As a non-limiting example, the report may comprise any data associated with the identified target keyword  including, but not limited to a source phone number, a destination phone number, an internet protocol address, a time, a keyword, an audio file, or the complete text file associated with said conversation from which the text file was generated.","In one example embodiment, a system administrator  may access the report stored in the events database , perhaps via a client computer, and review its contents (that may include time or date information, the phone numbers of Callers A and B, the IP addresses of their telephones, and\/or the located target keyword ), listen to an audio clip of the portion of the conversation containing the target keyword , and\/or read the text file.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"a ","b":["210","175","175"]},"For example, when the packet payload converter module  converts the incoming VoIP packets to a digital audio file , it may retain in storage the original VoIP packets representing the conversation. The digital audio file  may include data (e.g., packet start and end markers for associated payload data) enabling the system to identify the packets associated with various sections of the digital audio file . When the detection logic module  locates target keywords  in the text file , the corresponding packets may be located and perhaps deleted. Alternatively, the censored communication generation module  may substitute \u201csilent packets\u201d (e.g., properly-addressed packets with no audio payload) for the packets corresponding to the target keywords  located in said text file. In such an embodiment, the recipient (e.g., Caller A or B) may receive an audio signal wherein the target keywords  are not represented (i.e., not heard by the recipient). The system may transmit the censored plurality of VoIP packets (e.g., without the packets corresponding to the located target keywords ) to a recipient, such as Caller A or B. This process may occur in real time, enabling live censoring of ongoing conversations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a ","b":["200","100","200","200","190","180","175","150","200","190","175","200","190","175"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b ","b":["100","101","101","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","100","100","100","100"]},"As a non-limiting example, the method illustrated in  may be performed by (at least) any central processing unit (CPU) in one or more computing devices or systems, such as a microprocessor running on a server  communicatively coupled to a network  (e.g., the Internet) and executing instructions stored (perhaps as scripts and\/or software) in computer-readable media accessible to the CPU, such as a hard disk drive or solid-state memory on a server .

As a non-limiting example, steps , , , and  may be accomplished by a censored communication generation module  configured (e.g., programmed) to generate a censored plurality of VoIP packets that excludes one or more VoIP packets corresponding to said one or more target keywords . This may be accomplished by identifying those packets that carried data associated with the target keyword  and deleting those packets from the plurality of VoIP packets received by the packet payload converter module .","For example, when the packet payload converter module  converts the incoming VoIP packets to a digital audio file  (Step ), it may retain in storage the original VoIP packets representing the conversation. The digital audio file  may include data (e.g., packet start and end markers for associated payload data) enabling the system to identify the packets associated with various sections of the digital audio file . When the detection logic module  locates target keywords  in the text file  (Step ), the corresponding packets may be located and perhaps deleted (Steps  and ). The system then may transmit the censored plurality of VoIP packets (e.g., without the packets corresponding to the located target keywords ) to a recipient (Step ), such as Caller A or B. This process may occur in real time, enabling live censoring of ongoing conversations.","Alternatively, the censored communication generation module  may substitute \u201csilent packets\u201d (e.g., properly-addressed packets with no audio payload) for the packets corresponding to the target keywords  located in said text file. In such an embodiment the recipient (e.g., Caller A or B) may receive an audio signal wherein the target keywords  are not represented (i.e., not heard by the recipient).","The method illustrated in  may further comprises the step of (if target keyord(s)  are located in the text file ) transmitting a report to an event database . As described above, the report may comprise any data associated with the identified target keyword  including, but not limited to a source phone number, a destination phone number, an internet protocol address, a time, a keyword, an audio file, or the complete text file associated with said conversation from which the text file was generated.","In one example embodiment, a system administrator  may access the report stored in the events database , perhaps via an event display portal  via his client computer, and review report contents (that may include time or date information, the phone numbers of Callers A and B, the IP addresses of their telephones, and\/or the located target keyword ), listen to an audio clip of the portion of the conversation containing the target keyword , and\/or read the text file.","In one example use of the methods and systems described herein, a system administrator  (perhaps a call center MIS manager) may log into an embodiment of the above-described Voice Data Leakage Detection and Prevention System via a password-protected web-based event display portal  website running on his organization's server  accessible via the Internet. After the system administrator  is properly authenticated, the event display portal  may display data fields on a webpage in which the system administrator  may enter target keywords  that he would like monitored. For example, the system administrator  may want to be alerted when call center employees discuss customer credit card or social security numbers. In such an example, the system administrator  may enter the target keywords \u201ccredit card\u201d and \u201csocial security\u201d in the event display portal's  data fields. The event display portal  may also allow the system administrator  to enter a time frame before and\/or after any target keywords  he would like to have censored from the conversation (e.g., 2 seconds) to ensure any information related to a located target keyword is flagged or censored from the conversation.","A call center employee (e.g., caller A in ) may subsequently receive a telephone call from a personal friend (e.g., caller B) who is not an employee of the organization, perhaps with the malicious intent of obtaining customer credit card and social security data to steal a customer's identity. As per known Internet telephony, caller B's incoming telephone phone call may be received by the organization's PBX device and converted to a stream of VoIP packets for transmission to caller A's telephone.","In this example, however, the packet payload converter module  of Voice Data Leakage Detection and Prevention System also receives the stream of VoIP packets from the PBX (Step ). As the conversation between callers A and B continues, the digital audio data from the incoming VoIP packet payloads may be extracted (Step ) and written to one or more digital audio files  (Step ) stored in the media database  (Step ). Packet header information (e.g., time, date, source and destination IP addresses and phone numbers) may also be stored, perhaps in correlation with the packet payload to allow for speedy reconstruction of the conversation in VoIP format.","The transcript generator module  may read the digital audio file (Step ) from the media database  (Step ) and generate a transcript of the conversation (e.g., one or more text files ) (Step ), which may be stored in the transcript database  (Step ). The detection logic module  then may read the transcript from the transcript database  and determine whether the terms \u201ccredit card\u201d or \u201csocial security\u201d (i.e., the target keywords  set by the system administrator ) are present in the transcript (Steps  and ).","If those target keywords are located (e.g., caller A says: \u201ccustomer John Doe would be a good identity to steal, his credit card number is 1234 56789 1234 and his social security number is 123-45-6789\u201d), the system may automatically censor the located target keywords  from the conversation by deleting the packets corresponding to the identified target keywords  from the stream of VoIP packets, or alternatively, substituting \u201csilent\u201d packets (having no audio data in their payload) for the deleted packets. Thus, continuing with the above example, caller B would hear the following sentence on his telephone: \u201ccustomer John Doe would be a good identity to steal, his social security number is .\u201d","Additionally, a report may be generated (Step ) and transmitted to the events database  (Step ). As described above, the report may comprise any data associated with the identified target keyword  including, but not limited to a source phone number, a destination phone number, an internet protocol address, a time, a keyword, an audio file, or the complete text file associated with said conversation from which the text file was generated. Such a report may be accessed by the system administrator  logging back into the event display portal  and perhaps clicking on a \u201creports\u201d webpage.","In this example use, the systems and methods described herein prevented sensitive information from being leaked outside the organization and also allowed the system administrator  to identify the offending party to take any necessary corrective action.","Other embodiments and uses of the above inventions will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the specification and practice of the inventions disclosed herein.
