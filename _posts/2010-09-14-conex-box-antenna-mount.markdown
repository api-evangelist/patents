title: Conex box antenna mount
abstract: An antenna mount is provided for securing an antenna at a conex enclosure. The mount includes a box bracket having a plurality of flanges, a base plate disposable beneath the box bracket, and a tensioner plate disposable beneath the base plate. The box bracket has a top surface with an orifice to receive the antenna. The base plate is securable to the flanges by a first plurality of fasteners. The tensioner plate is securable to the base plate by a second plurality of fasteners. The box bracket forms a sheet metal plate folded to form a box with fore, aft, lateral and top sides.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to mounting structures for a conex enclosure. In particular, the invention relates to a mounting device for a radio antenna with a modular conex box.","A conex enclosure is defined as a water-tight metal storage container that protects military equipment from the elements. The United States Armed Forces use a standard military radio antenna for electromagnetic communication. There are no known commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mounting devices that achieve secure mounting of a standard military radio antenna in this manner to a standard conex enclosure for communications use.","Conventional antenna mounts yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an antenna mount for securing an antenna at a conex enclosure. The mount includes a box bracket having a plurality of flanges, said box bracket having a top surface with an orifice to receive the antenna; a base plate disposable beneath said box bracket, said base plate being securable to said flanges by a first plurality of fasteners; and a tensioner plate disposable beneath said base plate, said tensioner plate being securable to said base plate by a second plurality of fasteners. The box bracket forms a sheet metal plate folded to form a box with a fore, aft, lateral and top sides.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","The Conex Box Antenna Mount (CBAM) is a mounting bracket designed to effectively attach standard military radio antennas to a standard conex enclose for communications use.  shows an isometric exploded view  of CBAM components. A standard antenna mount bracket , with one face exposed as a window, represents a sheet-metal cover folded to produce an enclosure with a top horizontal surface . The sheet metal can be steel or aluminum. Upon installation, the exposed window faces a conex enclosure corner. At opposite ends, the bracket  includes horizontal flanges  with flange holes . The top surface  includes a center through-hole  surrounded by four mount holes .","A base plate  with peripheral holes  and in-line holes  is disposed below the bracket . A tensioner plate  with counterpart holes  aligned with the in-line holes  is disposed below the plate . The plates ,  can be composed of steel. Five sets of \u215c\u2033 fasteners  are disposed through the flange holes  to the peripheral holes  to attach the bracket  to the base plate . Each set of fasteners  includes a \u215c-16\u00d7\u00bd-inch hex bolt , a \u215c lock washer , and a \u215c flat washer (or shim) .","Two sets of \u00bd\u2033 fasteners  are disposed through the in-line holes  and the counterpart holes  from above the base plate . Each set of fasteners  includes a \u00bd-13\u00d72\u00bd-inch hex bolt  and a \u00bd flat washer . Two corresponding sets of \u00bd\u2033 ends  below the tensioner plate  secure the base and tensioner plates ,  together. Each set of ends  includes a \u00bd flat washer  and a \u00bd-13 nylon lock nut .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","110","182","194","140","160","110","170","120","140","110","115","220","230","240","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","210","310","110","120","170","140","310","320","115","330","340","320","350","130","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","210","310","140","310","410","160","180","190"]},"A standard military radio antenna  mounts to an antenna bracket  through the hole  in the top surface  utilizing the existing four-hole bolt pattern of the antenna mounting base  secured by fasteners . The antenna mount  is fixed at the base  to the CBAM  using a five-hole bolt pattern on its flange .","The CBAM  secures itself to one of any lift corners of a conex enclosure. The CBAM  operates by using two mount segments as plates ,  attached with bolts that tighten in compression and pinch the material of the conex enclosure lift corner. This process enables easy and universal mounting of the CBAM  to any standard conex enclosure. The CBAM  can be repeatedly mounted and removed as often as the operator requires.","By this device, United States military personnel can universally and conveniently attach present military radio antennas to a standard military conex box for communications use in any desired environment where a conex enclosure is present.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
