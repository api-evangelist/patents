title: System and method for personalized TV
abstract: A Personal TV System receives a plurality of video segments constituting a TV program and information describing each segment, and controls the display of the segments to a viewer in accordance with preferences of the viewer and with the description of each segment. Segments may be omitted or replaced with substitute segments. The viewer may review his preferences and edit or replace them. In a multi-viewer household, the system may prompt a viewer to confirm her preferences. A TV program may contain interactive segments, and when the viewer chooses to interact with a particular segment, the system automatically stores all subsequently received segments for later viewing while the viewer interacts with the selected segment. The system may present TV program choices to the viewer selected and arranged in accordance with her preferences.

No. 09\/893,192 filed on Jun. 27, 2001, and further claims the priority of provisional patent application Ser. Nos. 60\/247,352 filed Nov. 10, 2000 and 60\/235,234 filed Sep. 25, 2000.","Currently, recording of television programs by individuals for viewing at a later time, is generally performed using commercially available Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs). Typically, a VCR may be either manually placed into a record mode or may be programmed to record a selected program at a later time. To program the VCR, the user either enters a date, time and channel of the program desired to be recorded, or enters an identification code of the desired program.","Viewers of television programming increasingly have more choices as to which programs to view. For example, cable television provides a dramatic increase in the number of channels available to a viewer in comparison to the channels available by way of a conventional television antenna. Digital satellite systems provide even more viewing choices. Digital broadcast of programs over cable television systems is expected to further increase the number of channels available to viewers.","One effect of the increase in the number of viewing choices is increased difficulty in deciding which programs to watch. People, particularly those with busy schedules, may not have the time to select and view programs to determine which programs they may or may not like. Programs that may otherwise be desirable to a viewer may never be watched if the program is broadcast at a time that is inconvenient for the viewer. Users may select certain programs for viewing to determine if they like the program. However, with several hundred program selections each week, this task can take a considerable amount of time and is likely to cause certain desirable programs to be overlooked.","There are companies who sample television-viewing habits of the population by monitoring the programs watched by a very small set of TV viewers. These companies collect other demographic information also about the people they monitor for the generation of the sample. These samples give valuable information about the television viewing habits of the population covered by the sample. By analyzing these samples periodically a general mathematical model can be formed which explains the behavioral patterns of the population in television viewing. Each individual viewer would have a very personal liking for television programs which may vary considerably from a model derived from the sample behaviors of general population. At the same time a mathematical model derived by monitoring the behavior of a single user may be inaccurate because of the limited amount of information which can be gathered by watching only a single user for a short period of time. Sending the entire sample of behavioral pattern of the sample population to every viewer device to aid computation of the mathematical model is counter-productive because of the high cost of bandwidth required to transmit this information to each device and the processing power and memory requirement for the viewer device to process this information. Sending personal viewing habits of every user to a server to compute the mathematical model for the individual user would raise privacy concerns for the viewer and also requires a return channel from the viewer device to the server.","With a mechanism to automatically determine personal preferences of a viewer accurately, a very personal TV viewing environment can be presented to the viewer. In case of households with multiple members, by correctly identifying individual members and their preferences, an apparatus can provide an entertainment experience which is most pleasurable to the individual viewer.","Methods have been developed for providing text data to viewers. A closed captioned encoding technique transmits text data in synchronization with its associated video data by inserting the closed captioned text data into a vertical blanking interval of the video signal. However, the closed captioned text data must be inserted into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal by the producer of the video programming. As a result, the vertical blanking interval of the video signal cannot be used by the head end operator to insert other text data such as sports, weather, stock market, news, advertising and other data.","Electronic program guides (hereafter \u201cEPG\u201d) provides viewers with on-screen listings of upcoming television programs on cable television channels. The EPG is provided by an EPG data service. EPG data is converted into a video signal at the cable head. The EPG data is converted into a video signal at the cable head and transmitted to the viewer's television by a dedicated cable television channel. After tuning to the dedicated cable television channel, the viewer then wait for the programming for the desired time period is displayed. Often, when EPG data is used, the cable head end operator must dedicate a separate cable television channel to the EPG data and create video signals from the EPG data that are provided by the EPG service providers.","The introduction of digital cable promises to further expand the range of TV services well beyond current offerings. Interactive TV (IT) is expected to offer a hybrid incorporating the ease-of-use of conventional television combined with the interactivity and added functionality of the Internet. In addition to purchasing viewing content, viewers will likely be able to purchase goods and services, and offer feedback regarding various topics including viewing content (e.g. rate a movie or show), items offered for purchase, political candidates engaged in a debate, contestants in a talent show, etc. Conventional content such as educational programs and advertisements may also benefit from IT. For instance, advertisements may provide viewers different choices, such as model type or color, among which the viewers would be prompted to make a particular selection. Depending upon the viewers selection, the advertisement could run along different paths, showing different scenes and presenting additional choices. Further, the viewer may also be able to request additional information, and may be presented with special offers and\/or coupons, or be alerted to special sales going on at near-by dealers and distributors.","It is therefore likely that IT will impact the delivery of content to the viewer such that conventional scheduling will no longer be appropriate. For instance, in conventional television systems, content is broadcast in a linear manner, interspersed with advertisements at regularly scheduled intervals. However, within an IT system, a viewer may or may not choose to interact with a certain program or advertisement, or may interact only to a certain level, thus actively changing the length of the video segment (be it program or advertisement) being viewed. This will in turn impact the delivery of subsequent advertisements and programs, and the IT system should be able to adjust delivery accordingly.","If the IT system cannot delay or advance the delivery of content so as to accommodate the viewers interaction with certain viewing segments, viewers may be reluctant or unwilling to use such interactive features. For instance, if interacting with an advertisement would force the viewer to miss the first minute or two of the program she is currently watching, it is very unlikely that the viewer would choose to interact at all. Similarly, if interaction with one advertisement would partially or completely bypass the presentation of the following advertisement being broadcast, the advertiser paying for the broadcast of the second, obscured advertisement would be negatively impacted and billing the advertiser would have to be somehow adjusted.","Thus, a potential problem with IT can be summarized as consisting of lost content, whereby interaction with a video segment may cause the viewer to bypass, or miss, viewing one or more other video segments.","A possible solution to the problem is to disallow the switch to the interactive environment unless the viewer first engages a Pause function. Such a Pause function may be provided by a Personal Video Recorder (PVR) integrated with the IT system. An essential feature of PVRs is high capacity program storage, such as may be provided by a hard drive or other equivalent, high-capacity information storage system or device. Typically, PVRs continuously record all programs being watched, and thus allow the programs to be paused while the viewer needs to pay attention to other tasks and then replayed and viewed later via the storage.","Thus, engaging the Pause function causes further program video information being delivered to the TV set to be cached and the viewed programming frozen. The viewer could then launch the interactive environment for use. Once the viewer has finished interacting with the particular interactive video segment, she may close the interactive environment and toggle the PVR Pause to continue watching the TV programming from where she left off. However, this solution involves many control functions that must be engaged by the viewer, and can thus be inconvenient to the viewer.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for displaying a TV program to a viewer comprising allowing the viewer to select one of a plurality of available TV programs for viewing; receiving a plurality of video segments constituting the selected TV program; receiving information describing each received video segment; and controlling the display of one or more of the received video segments in accordance with the segment information and with previously determined viewing preferences of the viewer.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method for displaying an interactive TV program to a viewer comprising receiving a plurality of video segments comprising the TV program; displaying the received video segments sequentially; allowing the viewer to select a received video segment to interact therewith; and storing subsequently received video segments while the viewer is interacting with the selected video segment.","In still another aspect, the invention provides a method for delivering customized video programming to each of a plurality of individual viewers comprising processing information indicative of preferences of each of the plurality of viewers to develop a viewer characteristics information profile for each of the viewers; analyzing viewing selections made by an individual viewer; selecting the viewer profile most indicative of the viewing selections; and prompting the individual viewer to confirm that the selected profile corresponds to the individual viewer.","In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for displaying a TV program to a viewer comprising processing information indicative of preferences of the viewer to develop a viewer characteristics information profile for the viewer; presenting the viewer with a list of TV programs available for viewing, the programs selected in accordance with the viewer profile; receiving input from the viewer requesting different selections; and presenting the viewer with a list of alternative TV programs available for viewing, the alternative programs selected in accordance with an alternative profile.","In a still further aspect, the invention provides a method for presenting available TV programs to a viewer comprising processing information indicative of preferences of the viewer to develop a viewer characteristics information profile for the viewer; selecting a predetermined number of TV programs from a plurality of TV programs available for viewing, the programs selected in accordance with the viewer profile; and presenting the viewer with a list of the selected programs, the list arranged in accordance with the viewer profile.","Referring to , television control system  operates in accordance with the principles of the present invention to cause recordation of television programs in response to user inputs  and television signals . Television control system  transmits signals to television monitor  for viewing by the user. Preferably, in digital embodiments, programs that are recorded by system  are presented to the user in the form of additional channels. Thus, the user can rapidly determine, by changing channels, the stored programs that are available for viewing. The user can also change channels between stored programs or between stored programs and currently broadcast programs. If the user changes channels from a recorded program to another program, playback of the recorded program is preferably paused. Alternatively, whether the playback of the recorded program is paused or continued, is a user selectable option. As described further herein, the user may specify programs for recordation by specification of a particular program, or by specification of particular attributes of the program such as comedy\/drama, actor(s). When manually specifying programs for recordation, the user may specify that the program is to be recorded once or repeatedly, such as weekly, when broadcast.","Signals  include a first component  which contains the information necessary to display video and audio components of a television program on television monitor . Signals  preferably also include a second component  termed herein \u201cattribute information.\u201d An example of such attribute information  is the information available by way of the DVB-SI and ATSC-SI formats and various proprietary formats such as StarSight EPG Data and TVData available from StarSight Telecast, Inc., Fremont, Calif., and TVData, Glen Falls, N.Y., respectively.","Attribute information  for any particular program varies depending on the program type, but typically includes a plurality of categories such as start time for the program, duration of the program, the title of the program and other, attributes (categories) of the program, together with an associated value corresponding to each of the categories.","Recording manager  operates to cause recordation and storage of television programs  and attribute information  in accordance with information generated by preference agent  and stored in preference database . Recording manager  also responds to user requests to record particular programs and to user requests to record programs having specified category-value pairs.","The signals transmitted to the monitor  preferably take a conventional analog form. Alternatively the signals transmitted to the monitor  maybe digitally encoded. The exact form of the signals transmitted to the monitor is not critical and may take a form as required by a particular monitor. The television signals  received by the television control system  may take one of a variety of signal formats including analog encoded signals that are encoded in accordance with the well known NTSC or PAL standards. Alternatively, the signals  may be digitally encoded in a manner as transmitted by commercially available digital satellite systems (DSS) or in accordance with the MPEG-2 (Motion Picture Expert Group-2) standard. In any given embodiment of television control system  the signal  may take a variety of the aforementioned forms. For example, television control system  may be coupled to receive inputs from a digital satellite system, the inputs being digitally encoded. The television control system  may also be coupled to receive inputs from a Community Antenna Television System (CATV) in which the signals are either encoded in analog or digital form. The television control system  may also be coupled to receive analog or digital signals from a conventional home antenna.","The attribute information  may be transmitted to the television control system  contemporaneously with the television program  in a variety of ways including industry standards, such as DVB-SI (Digital Video Broadcasting-Service Information) as defined by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETS), or the ATSC digital television standard as defined by the Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC). By way of example, in the DVB-SI protocol, programming for the next six hours is transmitted every eight seconds for each channel. As a further example, program information for the next seven days is available from the interactive on-screen TV program guide available from StarSight Telecast, Inc. Programming information further into the future, such as for the next seven days, may also be obtained in other ways. For example, by receiving the information in a time-multiplexed manner over a particular channel. Such information can easily be transmitted when the user is performing an action that does not require a moving video image on the screen, such as when the user has a control menu displayed on the screen.","Alternatively, television control system  can download the attribute information  separately from the television program  by way of a separate communication session via a modem or the Vertical Blanking Intervals (VBI) contained in television signals. Such separate communication sessions include data download mechanisms supported by the MPEG-2, DVB-SI and DSS protocols.","The attribute information  can take a form under the DVB-SI protocol as shown below:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0078"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Short Event Descriptor:"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"event_name-length"]},{"entry":[{},"event_name,"]},{"entry":[{},"event_description-length"]},{"entry":[{},"event_description"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"Extended-even"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ITEM1"]},{"entry":[{},"ITEM2"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"ITEMn."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"content descriptor:"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"CONTENT1,"]},{"entry":[{},"CONTENT2,"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"CONTENTn."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0079"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"{"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"item_description_length,"]},{"entry":[{},"item_description,"]},{"entry":[{},"item_value length,"]},{"entry":[{},"item_value"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"An example of item descriptions can be \u201cDirector\u201d and item value can be \u201cMartin Scorsese\u201d.

This prediction is based on, (i) analysis of the individual users viewing habits, (ii) analysis of the viewing habits of a representative sample of users and (iii) EPG data for the television programs available during the period of the collected sample.","One method for creating a preference determination is through the use of a Bayesian network that is used to predict user behavior, and hence a preference agent, is a knowledge based approach. In this method a knowledge engineer interviews an expert about the Field of expertise of the expert. The expert and the knowledge engineer determine the distinction of the worlds that are important for decision making in the field of the expert. The knowledge engineer and the expert next determine the dependencies among the variables and the probability distributions that quantify the strengths of the dependencies.","A second method is Bayesian network is a data based approach. In this second method the knowledge engineer and the expert first determine the variables of the domain. Data is then accumulated for those variables, and an algorithm applied that creates a belief network for those variable data accumulated for those variables, and an algorithm is applied that creates a the belief network to predict user behaviors from this data. The accumulated data comes from real world instances of the domain. This second approach exists for domains containing only discrete variables.","Bayesian methods can be performed by utilizing an algorithm known as the \u201cEM\u201d algorithm, which, as recognized by those skilled in the art, calculates the maximum a posteriori values (\u201cMAP values\u201d) for the parameters of the model to predict user behavior. The EM algorithm is described in Dempster. Maximum Likelihood From Incomplete Data Via The EM Algorithm, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, Volume 39 (1977), incorporated herein by reference.","After calculating the probability for each variable, each variable within the belief network is then scored for goodness in predicting the preferences of the user by rendering a subscore. As recognized by those skilled in the art, the subscores are generated by using the marginal likelihood of the expected data at the maximum a posteriori values.","One skilled in the art will recognize that any standard model to predict user behavior inference algorithm can be used to perform this step, such as the one described in Jensen, Lauritzen and Olesen, Bayesian Updating in Recursive Graphical Models by Local Computations, Technical Report R-89-15, Institute of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark, incorporated herein by reference.","Television viewing habits of the population are sampled to generate representative samples of viewer behaviors, . This task is typically performed by companies such as Nielsen Media Research, who collects user behavioral samples to conduct market research. The results of the sampling is stored in a viewer behavior database. The format of the viewer behavior database is proprietary to the company conducting the sampling. Viewer behavior database contains demographic information about the people in households participating in the sampling. This information includes but is not limited to race, age, annual income and gender. Viewer behavior database also contains information about all the television programs each viewer watched during the period of sampling.","Program Information and the schedule of television programs is available in the EPG database, . Program Information for a television program contains information about various attributes of the program which includes but not limited to the title, program type and program category of the television program, arid also the actors acting in the television program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["124","125"]},"Viewer behavioral database is analyzed  to identify traits of TV programs and determine how such identified traits influence viewing habits in the representative sample of users. These traits and their influence amongst the viewing population are then used in aiding the process of predicting an individual user's choice in TV programs. , , lists some examples of such traits. Some of these traits are derived from program information, . Some of these traits are derived by looking for users liking for association of multiple traits or association of traits with other viewing parameters which includes but is not limited to time, day of the week, holiday, working day and weather season. Some of these traits are derived by data analysis of Viewer behavioral database. Any given program would exhibit varying degrees of the above identified traits. This is expressed as the trait-ness of the trait in the program, e.g. trait-ness of comedy in Seinfeld may be 1.2 and trait-ness of comedy in Mad About You may be 0.79. The trait-ness of a trait in a program is computed as a part of the data analysis, .","The present invention also provides for a methodology for determining viewer preferences. In one embodiment, an individual viewer picks one show to watch out of the collection of available program by evaluating a stochastic liking function for each program and choosing the program with the highest score. The liking function is modeled as an aggregate of liking for a specific trait and the degree to which that trait is exhibited by that program. The liking function can be computed as:\n\n1()=\u03a3()*\n\nWhere\n\n","When a viewer watches television, it is assumed that the viewer chooses a program for which the value of 1(p) is the highest. For any given viewer, the better the values of \u03a3(tn) represent its actual liking, the more the accuracy in determining its preference for TV programs. Thus for any given user if all the relevant traits are known along with the exact liking of each of those traits, the above Liking Function would always accurately predict the liking of any given program.","However, identification of all the relevant traits and the determination of the exact liking of each viewer is a non trivial task and arrived at iteratively by a process of regression analysis.","While a majority of the traits relevant to a specific user may be derived directly from the EPG information itself, some of the traits are discovered by analyzing the user's viewing habits over time. Traits that are suitable for discovery by a process of regression analysis are generally hidden or associated traits.","Hidden traits are those which influence a user's viewing habits but which can not be derived from the EPG information. For example, sitcoms featuring a specific ethnic background would resonate more with viewers of that ethnic background. Another example of the effect of a hidden trait could be the strong liking of the sitcom \u201cFrasier\u201d amongst the set of users who have a strong liking for the sitcom \u201cCheers.\u201d Assuming that the names of actors performing in a sitcom are not be available in the EPG data, this affinity towards both the sitcoms by the same set of people may be explained by the presence of some trait commonly exhibited by both the sitcoms, namely the presence of one of the central characters in both the sitcoms. Such hidden preference criteria would have to be captured by adding the hidden traits in the computation of the Liking Function.","Associated traits\u2014Traits which have a different influence on a user's viewing habits when combined with other traits. For example a user would have a certain liking for any given Seinfeld episode, and a certain liking for any premiere sitcom being aired for the first time. However, its liking for a premiere episode of Seinfeld may be sufficiently large enough to require an additional trait, \u201cnew Seinfeld\u201d, to fully explain its liking for a premiere episode of Seinfeld.","The liking of each trait for a given user has to be similarly refined from initial approximations by regression analysis. Examples of traits and the associated liking for a sample user include but are not limited to those listed in . The trait \u201cNBC <=> NEWS\u201d is an example of an associated trait where the traits being associated are \u201cChannel NBC\u201d & \u201cProgram Type News.\u201d Users liking for NEWS programs may be 1 & the preference for the \u201cNBC Channel\u201d may be 2 whereas its preference for NEWS on NBC may be 13, i.e., this user does not always watch news programs or programs in general on the NBC channel, however he has a strong preference for NEWS programs on the NBC channel. If only its liking for the \u201cChannel NBC\u201d & \u201cProgram Type News\u201d are considered, its preference for \u201cNews on NBC\u201d would be unexplainable.","This procedure to identify traits is first carried out using the viewing habits of the representative sample along with the determination of the distribution of likings of each trait within the representative sample.","Some of the outputs of the analysis , of the viewing habits of a representative sample are a set of preference determination parameters viz. (i) the traits which are exhibited by recurring program and the degree to which such a trait is exhibited, and (ii) a distribution list of the likings amongst the viewing population of each of the above trait.","One methodology to derive these parameters is outlined in ) and (). Different phases of the flow chart are explained further in the following sections. An initial set of liking values are computed for each user, . This initial liking value may be arrived at in various ways. One of the ways could be to base it on the amount of time for which a given trait was watched as opposed to the amount of time it was available during the user's viewing period.","Using these initial liking values for the traits the Liking Function 1(p) is computed for all the programs that were available during the times the user watched a given program. These programs are then arranged in descending order, , of liking value for a time period during which the viewer watched a program, . The actual program the user watched at a given time is highlighted, . If all the highlighted programs in  had the highest score, the Liking Function correctly identified the user's preference. If the program watched by the user ranks below some other competing program available at that time the liking values used do not correctly reflect the user preference. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, if there are N programs ranked above the program actually watched, the error in the Liking Function for this program may be called N, . Such values of N are determined for each program watched by the user by comparing it with the Liking Function of the other competing programs. In the example illustrated in  values of N are computed for the times when the user watched TV between the hours of 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30. Using regression analysis, the liking values of each of the traits are adjusted incrementally to reduce the average value of N. The set of liking values which yield the lowest value of the average of N are considered the best set of liking values for that user.","One methodology of the regression process is illustrated in . At the beginning of the process liking values for traits a, b, c, are \u03a3a1, \u03a3b1, \u03a3c1, . . . (, ). \u03a3a1 represents the liking of trait \u201ca,\u201d \u03a3b1 represents the liking of trait \u201cb\u201d and so on. The Liking Function of all the relevant programs are computed using this initial set of liking values. The liking value \u03a3a1 of the first trait \u201ca\u201d is changed incrementally to determine the average value of N. The value \u03a3a2, , which yields the lowest average value of N, is taken as the new liking value for the trait \u201ca.\u201d This new value liking value \u03a3a2, , now replaces the old value and is now used to determine the remaining \u03a3 values. The above set of liking values computed would predict the users preferences with a high degree of accuracy if set of the traits considered in the Liking Function includes all the traits that are relevant to a user. The average value of N not converging (to 0 or some other acceptable value) would indicate that not all traits that are relevant to the user have been considered in the computation of the Liking Function. Introduction of additional traits, either associated or hidden, is used to improve the determination of the user's preference.","A determination of associated traits is achieved by a variety of different methods. One method is through the application of heuristic rules of thumb where the associative value of a number of traits is not reflected in the program information obtained from an EPG but is relevant to human viewing habits. For example, a user who has a liking for Seinfeld would most probably have a much higher preference for a premiere or new episode of Seinfeld. Such heuristic rules of thumb regarding the associative value of a number of traits may be passed to each set top box via the Head End. Another method of determining associated traits is with an algorithmic search which looks for common traits in programs and introduces new associated traits to try to improve the Liking Function for a user.","Determination of hidden traits in different programs can be achieved in a number of ways. One of these methods is illustrated in . The possibility of the presence of a hidden traits exists whenever there exists a strong co-relation between any two traits present in different programs. The y-axis represents an increasing liking value for higher values of y. Every point on the x-axis in  represents a user arranged such that the liking value of the trait \u201ctn\u201d increases with higher values of x. If for the same values on the x-axis the liking values of a strongly co-related trait \u201ctm\u201d are also plotted, it will exhibit a relation to the liking graph of the trait \u201ctn\u201d. The co-relation between any two traits may be explained by he presence of a common hidden trait. Thus traits \u201ctm\u201d and \u201ctn\u201d may be expressed mathematically as\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere C is some constant indicating the amount of co-relation between traits \u201ctm\u201d & \u201ctn\u201d.\n","Hidden traits can also identified by applying rules of thumb or some other appropriate manner.","While ail programs of a specific genre exhibit some common traits, the degree to which these traits are exhibited vary from program to program. This degree of traitness for recurring programs can be quantified such that it best explains the viewing choice of watching or not watching that program in the representative sample. For example consider a user who has a certain liking \u03a3 for comedy. The users' decision to watch a comedy program would be influenced by whether the amount of comediness exhibited by that program crosses some threshold of comediness that is determined by its liking for comedy.","One method to determine the traitness of a trait T in a given program N is illustrated in )-(). The highlighted program represents the programs actually watched  by a user. All available programs are arranged in decreasing order of rank  as computed by the Liking Function. In the case of User   the Program N  which was watched by him appears third in rank whereas the Liking Function should have actually ranked Program N at the top. In this case the margin of error  in the traitness of trait T is 3. In the case of User  the program N watched by the user was ranked the highest. The margin of error in the traitness of trait T is 0. In the case of user  where he did not watch Program N, it was ranked the highest. The margin of error in this case can be considered to be a constant K. A suggested value of K may be the number of programs available to the user at that time. Similarly for user , the margin of error may be considered K\u22121. Such margins of error are computed for all users who watched the Program N and the average margin of error is computed.","Using regression analysis, the traitness value of the trait T is adjusted incrementally to reduce the average value of the margin of error. The value of traitness which yields the lowest value of the average of the margin of errors is considered the best value of the traitness of the trait T exhibited by the program N.","Traitness values may also be assigned by rules of thumb or some other appropriate manner.","One of the outputs of analyzing the viewing habits of a representative sample is a distribution list of the likings amongst the viewing population of each trait. This information is presented schematically in the  and is made available to every individual user Set Top Box along with the broadcast TV programs and program information. \u201cNumber of traits\u201d, , represents the total number of traits that have been identified after analyzing the viewing habits of the representative sample. The distribution of liking of each trait is provided in a \u201cTrait Record\u201d, . Information included in a trait record include the name of the trait, , the type of the trait, , (whether hidden, associate, etc), the liking distribution of the trait , and the distribution parameters, , of the trait. Examples of various possible values in a trait record are provided in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13"],"b":["173","174","177"]},"Referring again to , the program content and the program information (in the form of an EPG) are transmitted from a Broadcast Head End along with preference determination parameters, . Examples of preference determination parameters include but are not limited to (i) the traits which are exhibited by each program and the degree to which such a trait is exhibited and (ii) a distribution list of the liking values amongst the viewing population of each trait.","This information is received in each household by a program selection device , that include a preference Determination Module, a personal preference database, , a storage device and a display device . The personal preference database , is used to store the results of the analysis of the individual user's viewing habits. The storage device stores programs as per the user's specific requests or programs recommended by the preference determination module.","Program Selection Device  monitors each user's viewing actions and selection of TV programs being watched. This is stored in a storage device or in memory in the form of selection history data  (see ). The schematic representation of selection history data is given in . The \u201cNumber of selection records\u201d,  represents the number of user selection choices stored in the selection history data. Each selection record , contains the information on the actual programs watched  along with information on the competing programs available at that time . Storing program information is required as the EPG may not be able to provide information on past programs. Information on these program may be obtained directly from the EPG data when the information is obtained while the program is still current. The time  and duration  for which a program was watched also form a part of the selection record. As illustrated in , a uses selection history  is derived from each choice  made by the user along with program information from the EPG .","One process of learning the user preferences of a specific individual is illustrated in . The liking distribution in the representative sample for traits identified by data analysis, , are used by the Liking Function to minimize the effect of error introduced because of lack of sufficient sampling in the computation of the liking of the identified traits by an individual. An individual user's response to setup question  may also be factored in determining initial values of liking for that individual .","A user selection history  is maintained for a fixed number of hours. The number of hours for which the user selection history is maintained can be preferably changed to have an increased rate of learning during initial days of a new user using the device. Average Error is computed N , in a similar manner as for users; in the representative sample, as previously described in . If the average error is greater than a tolerable limit , new liking values are computed . Entries in the user selection history are moved to the Past selection history. If the Average error remains under a tolerable limit the liking values are computed only after a predefined number of hours .","Another embodiment of the selection record stores a program ID instead of the entire program information. In this embodiment, the actual program information is broadcast at predetermined times from the Head End where each program is identified by the same program ID stored in the selection record. In this embodiment, the computing  of liking values for traits are performed only at this predetermined time.","Referring now to ), after each computation of liking values, entries in the user selection history is moved to the Past selection history. Selection history is partitioned as user selection history  and Past selection history  to optimally store the section history records. Selection history contains information about all selections made by the user between two computations of Liking values. Past selection history maintains the most relevant information about the most relevant selections made by the user in past. The number of records in the Past selection history can be advantageously conFIG.d to suite the memory available for storage of such records. Relevancy in this context is the importance of the record in computing the liking values and is dependent on many parameter including but not limited to the age of the record , the repetition rate  of traits contained in programs  in the selection record. The relationship between relevancy and age  of the record is shown in ). The most relevant records are the most recent records. The relationship between relevancy and the repetition rate of traits contained in programs in the section record is shown in ). As the repetition rate decreases, the relevancy increase , till certain limit after which the relevancy decreases . A good example to illustrate the reasoning behind this relationship would be relevancy of keeping records on user selection when Seinfeld a weekly program is available and the relevancy of keeping records on user selection when Olympics a 4 yearly program is available. While it is important to keep records about Seinfeld to compute likings of various traits contained in Seinfeld, it is pointless to keep records about viewer's liking for the last Olympics. Consider a user who does not have a liking for movies except on Fridays. To accurately determine the user likings of trait of \u201cFriday night-ness\u201d of a movie, the selection records pertaining to its viewing actions on a Friday have to be maintained for at least a number of weeks. However if the repetitive nature is too far apart in time, the relevancy decreases sharply. The \u201cRelevancy versus Repetitive Rate of a Trait\u201d graph in ) measures increasing values of relevancy for higher values on the y-axis. The x-axis measure decreasing rates of repetitiveness of a trait in a program. As shown in ), beyond a certain threshold of repetitive rate, the relevance decreases sharply.","The process of updating of past history is shown in ) and (). The processing is done for every record in the user selection history. If there is enough memory to store the new record in the past selection history , the record is removed from the user selection history and added to the past selection history . If there is not enough space in the past selection history , the records in the past selection history are sorted based on relevancy , and: he least relevant record is deleted  to make space to add the new entry .","In another embodiment of the present invention, the number of available programs  stored in the past selection history can be limited to an optimal number to make best use of the memory available (see ). In this embodiment only the programs with higher values of liking, representing the traits which have significant liking values, are stored in past selection history record.","Computing of Liking values for different traits performed by the Program selection device  is shown in . This process is performed  during the learning process as explained by . Regression analysis is performed to minimize error in prediction of viewer behavior stored in user selection history and past selection history by using current liking values as the starting point. The regression analysis process  is the same as the one performed in representative sample . If there are any selection record for which the error is more than a predefined threshold , the selection record is examined for the presence of possible associated traits . The rules which defines the presence of possible associated traits may be rules of thumb. Possible association of traits can also be discovered by looking up the list of associated traits which were discovered from the representative sample. Liking for possible associated traits are computed by regression analysis . If the computed liking is a significant value , the liking for trait is entered  into the preference database . Other parameters like the repetition rate for the trait also is entered into the database . The repetition rate is computed by looking at the repetition rate of the trait in user history and past history. If there are no previous selection record with this trait, then the repetition rate is assumed as a predefined value. As new selection records are created, the repetition rate is updated. At the end of the process (illustrated in ) of computing the liking values, a weighted average of the current liking values and the old liking values is computed. This forms the new set of liking values. Learning rate can be increased or decreased by changing the weight of the current liking values.","A flow chart of computing scores for programs for future prediction is illustrated in . As described earlier Liking  for a program  is computed by evaluating the function 1(p)=\u03a3\u03a3 (tn)*tn. \u03bb(tn) is computed as a weighted average of liking for the trait tn for the user  and the liking for the trait tn for the general population .","In another embodiment of the present invention which is suited to function on program selection devices operating on households with multiple users, the viewer is asked to input the number of viewers in a household during the initial setup process. Each viewer can answer a set of setup questions which would capture their liking for representative traits. An initial set of possible liking values are created for each viewer. Learning process updates each viewer's preference database separately after identifying each viewer session correctly. Viewer identification is done either by explicit input from the viewer identifying the viewer or automatically by identifying the viewer by monitoring the television viewing behavior of the viewer. To identify a viewer automatically, the error value between predicted and actual is computed for all viewers. The viewer with liking value which yields the least error value is chosen as the possible viewer. The certainty of this decision is expressed as a probability which is computed as a function of the differences between error values for different viewers in this household.","The objective of the present invention is to determine demographic characteristics of a user by analyzing the users viewing habits in juxtaposition with viewing habits of a representative sample of users whose demographic characteristics are known. These demographic characteristics of a user collectively constitute a demographic profile. Upon successful creation of an accurate demographic profile for a user, the present invention can receive a collection of possible ads and show individual users only those which are targeted to a matching profile.","Some example of demographic characteristics include, but are not limited to, a users gender, race, age and income. The output of the analysis of viewing habits of the representative sample provides a basis for determining demographic characteristics of the individual user.","The TV programs chosen in the analysis of viewing habits, of the representative sample, plays an important role in determination of a demographic characteristic. Different TV programs might be required to determine demographic characteristics. Typically TV programs where a majority of its viewing audience share a common demographic characteristic, in a proportion which is different from what is observed in the general population, are best suited in the discovery demographic characteristics. For example to determine the \u201cincome\u201d demographic characteristic consider graph (i) in . The x-axis represents the annual salary in increasing order of x. For any point in the x-axis, the y-axis represents the probability of finding an annual salary of x in the representative sample (which is the same in the general population). Now consider graph (ii), where the dotted curve plots the same income distribution represented in the graph (i), the first solid curve (the leftmost curve) shows the income probability distribution of the viewing audience for program P in the representative sample and the second solid curve represents the income probability distribution of the viewing audience for program P in the representative sample. Analysis of the viewing habits of an individual user for the above programs P & P could be used to determine his most probable annual income. Using Bayesian inference this probability may be expressed by the following mathematical formula\n\n(1)=(1|)()\/(1)\n\nwhere\n\n","Thus for a user who watches program p1, the probability of his income being within a certain range can be determined.","Programs whose viewing audience display a demographic characteristic in the same proportion as is observed in the representative sample (which is the same in the general population) do not contribute significantly in determining demographic characteristics. Consider the graphs in . Graph (i) shows a bar graph which represents the probability of a person in the representative sample being male or female. The graph (ii) shows the probability of person being male or female within the viewing audience of program P which is very similar to what is observed in the general population. If Bayesian inference is used to determine the gender of a person who has watched program P, the probability of the person being a male or a female would be the very close to the probability of person being a male or a female in the general population (which is already a known value). Nothing significant is gained by analyzing the viewing habits of the individual for the program P. On the basis of the graph (iii) on the other hand, analyzing viewing habits for program P would yield additional certainty in determining the gender of a person than what is already known about the gender distribution in the general population.","The determination of which programs yield high probability values in determining a demographic characteristic of a user may be done by applying rules of thumb through an algorithm which chooses the program on the basis of how much a demographic trait in it viewing audience differs from what is observed in the general population by some other means.","Depending on the program content and the demographic characteristics of its viewing audience, the same television program maybe used to determine one or more traits. It is also possible that a completely different set of programs are required to study different demographic characteristics.","While it is possible from Bayesian inference to ascribe a certain preference for a specific show based on a users demographic characteristics, it may not be the only factor which explains the users choice of a particular show. For example, consider the graph (ii) in . It might be possible for a user, U, having income less than \u00d71 having a strong preference for program P for unknown reasons. So just using Bayesian inference to arrive at U's most probable annual income based on his viewing habits of only a single program P would not yield the most meaningful result. To strengthen the belief of a Bayesian inference, the users viewing habits have to be analyzed for a set of programs where the viewing audience of each program from that set displays a similar demographic characteristics. The programs of the set are so chosen that degree of co-relation of traits exhibited by the programs in the set are minimal. Each program that the user views from this set of programs adds towards strengthening the belief of the Bayesian probability of the user possessing that demographic characteristic.","To explain the need for minimal co-relation consider the previous example. If another program P which is very similar to P in content and has the same demographic traits in its viewing audience as P is available to user U, he would have a similar liking for P as P. In this scenario strengthening the belief of the Bayesian probability by the user U watching program P is not a positive contribution. However if program P were very different in contents and the traits that it exhibits, the probability of U choosing P is greatly diminished and keeps the belief in the Bayesian probability from erroneously rising. In this situation the probability of a user who actually possessed the demographic characteristic of watching both programs P &: P would be quite high and the strengthening of the belief would be a positive contribution.","Thus a Belief Function for the Bayesian probability for a demographic characteristic dc1 may be computed in many ways which includes but is not limited to\n\n(1)=MAX((1),(2) . . . , ())*1+MAX((),(1) . . . , ())*2+ . . . +MAX((), (1) . . . , ())*\n\nwhere\n\n","The Belief Function for any demographic characteristic is illustrated by the S curve in . The x-axis represents increasing values of the Belief Function for a demographic characteristic for increasing values of x. The y-axis represents increasing values of the probability of a user displaying that demographic characteristic for increasing values of y. As shown in FIG., the probability does not increasing any further for higher value of the Belief Function.","Some of the output of the analysis of viewing habits of the representative sample are schematically illustrated in ","Display of advertisements by a program selection devices done when a users computed demographic profile matches the target profile of the advertisements.

In general, storage devices  are understood to encompass a variety of storage devices. The exact form of the storage devices  is not critical so long as the storage devices have the capacity and speed to store the necessary information. Storage devices  may also comprise a conventional video cassette recorder (VCR) which operates under control of system  to store television programs  and attribute information  on conventional magnetic tape.","For the purposes of the present description, the television control system  is presumed to be integrated into, or coupled to, a system including a tuner and other functions necessary to receive television signals and to extract the attribute information  from the television signal and to perform other functions typically associated with the receipt and viewing of television signals. In certain embodiments, television control system  may operate in conjunction with a database agent that facilitates interaction with preference database  by causing storage and retrieval of information to or from the database in an optimal manner. The preference database  may be implemented by a commercially available database product such as the Oracle Light database product available from Oracle Corporation which also incorporates the functionality to implement the data base agent described above.","Recording manager  causes recording of programs  by periodically initiating a sequence of steps shown in . At , recording manager  sends a request to preference agent  for ratings of all programs at a particular time (X), or alternatively, for ratings of all programs within a particular time period (X). By way of example, the steps shown in  may be performed every six hours. In certain embodiments, the frequency with which the steps in  are performed may be changeable by the user. Preference agent  responds at step  by providing ratings, from preference database , for each program received from recording manager . Recording manager  then causes recordation of the programs at time X, or within time period X in accordance with the ratings received from preference agent . Specifically, programs having the highest rating are given highest preference for recordation and programs having the lowest rating are given lowest preference to recordation. The recordation is subject to storage capacity constraints. For example, if the highest rated program is one-hour long, and only thirty minutes of recording space is available on storage devices , then the one-hour program is skipped and the highest rated thirty-minute program is recorded.","Highest priority for recording of programs is given to programs specifically requested by the user. For example, if the user identifies a particular program for recording, such as by specifying the date, time and channel, or by specifying an identification code for the program, recordation of that program is given priority over programs rated by the preference agent. Next highest priority is given to programs matching particular category-value pairs specified by the user. For example, if the user does not identify a particular program, but specifies that one-hour long documentaries pertaining to travel should be recorded, then recordation of programs matching such category-value pairs is given priority over programs rated by the preference agent . In alternative embodiments, relative priority between user-specified programs, user-specified category-value pairs and programs rated by the preference agent  is changeable by the user.","Recording manager  manages storage capacity on storage devices  by causing deletion of television programs  in accordance with ratings of such programs generated by preference agent .

At step , recording manager  requests ratings from preference agent  of all programs stored on storage devices . At step , preference agent  responds by providing the requested deletion ratings. At step , recording manager  responds by causing deletion, when needed, of programs in accordance with the deletion ratings received from the preference agent . Specifically, when additional space on storage devices  is required to record one or more additional programs, recording manager  causes deletion, or overwriting of programs having the lowest rating first. Thus, stored television programs which are determined by preference agent  to be least preferable, in relation to other stored television programs, are deleted or replaced first, and those determined to be most preferable are deleted or replaced last. Deletion of programs occurs only when required. Advantageously, this results in storage device  typically being filled to maximum capacity, thus providing the user with as wide a variety of programs as possible.

Preferably, the control data from HEC  can include text channel definition transactions as well as EPG definition transactions for instructing the set top box at which frequency to tune for the EPG data and the like. The control data may also include software for downloading into the viewer's set top box for reprogramming the viewer's set top box as necessary. The control data from HEC  can be inserted into the vertical blanking interval of the selected cable television signal by daisy-chained scramblers ,  and  using known in-band techniques, although the control data from HEC  may also be modulated on an out-of-band carrier or an in-band audio carrier for transmission as. Preferably, scramblers - are daisy-chained so that the scramblers may be addressed individually or globally.","Similarly, EPG data and text channel data from ISP  are provided to the viewer's television set top box via an RS-485 output port of ISP . EPG data and text channel data are similarly inserted into the vertical blanking intervals of selected cable television signals by EPG scrambler  and text channel scramblers  and , respectively. Scramblers - may insert the control data, EPG data, and text channel data into other portions of the video signals such as the horizontal blanking intervals or else replace the video entirely. Typically, the number of scramblers depends on the number of premium channels for which scrambling is used. Preferably, EPG scrambler  and text channel scramblers  and  are identical to control data scramblers - and are similarly daisy-chained for individual or global addressing. As shown in , scramblers - receive a single serial data channel which carries the combined EPG data and text data and display control transactions, as described in more detail with respect to ) for all data streams in use. Each scrambler is also equipped with memory for storing a predetermined amount of this data in an internal memory so as to minimize the number of database accesses. Preferably, scramblers - have internal memory sufficient to store a significant number of transactions. For example, scrambler  may have enough internal memory to score a day's sports scores for display on a sports text channel. The data received and stored in scramblers - is preferably in RS-485 format, and the protocol in a preferred embodiment is SDLC. All data transactions to scramblers - are sent on individual data streams specifying the target scrambler (station addresses in SDLC protocol), and the control data is sent on a global data stream which is filtered in the scramblers - based on the address of the scrambler so that the data streams can be conFIG.d by a transaction from ISP . The individual EPG data and text data streams are preferably generic in the scramblers so that they can be allocated as desired. Preferably, scramblers - have baud rates of at least 9600.","Preferably, the subscriber's set top box is a set top box  which comprises an EPG memory  for storing the EPG data from ISP . For example, EPG memory  may store one or two weeks of EPG data for selective access by the viewer via a menu of the set top box . This menu preferably allows the viewer to scroll through the EPG data stored in EPG memory  using the key pads of the viewer's television remote control device. Set top box  may also comprise a nonvolatile template memory  for storing the template in which the EPG data is to be inserted for display to the viewer on the viewer's television . In this manner, a video signal containing the template display data need not be continuously retransmitted to the set top box , thereby saving more bandwidth. Instead, the EPG data only needs to be updated every 30 minutes or when there is a program change. Of course, different set top boxes  may have varied amounts of memory and processing capabilities for such purposes in accordance with the acceptable memory costs during manufacture of the set top box .","As shown in , set top box  may also comprise a text data memory  for storing a page of text data for presentation to the screen. Thus, while one page of text data is displayed to the subscriber, the next page of text data may be loaded into the text data memory .","ISP  manages the flow of text data and EPG data from the data service provider to the viewer's set top box . ISP  manages this data by accepting data only from one or more authorized text data and\/or EPG data sources, processing the text data and EPG data in its internal database manager, and formatting the processed data into a common data transaction format for output to the scramblers for transmission to the set top box . Provision of EPG data and text data to the subscribers is controlled by the head end controller  via the control link.","One example of a suitable ISP  is an IBM PS model 7546 personal computer with a plurality of RS-232 serial input ports for EPG data and\/or text data inputs and at least one RS-485 HDLC serial link at its output of the type used by HEC . As shown in , the control link can be a single RS-232 serial port. The hardware and software components of ISP  are then conFIG.d as illustrated in .","One embodiment of ISP  is illustrated in  as a plurality of RS-232 ports which provide a common interface for the EPG data and text channel data asynchronously provided by the EPG supplier(s)  and text channel suppliers . The EPG data and text channel data is transmitted to ISP  via a satellite link (when the interface is operated in simplex mode) or by modem (when the interface is operated in half duplex mode). Preferably, the data is transmitted at a baud rate of at least 1200.","ISP  functions as a \u201cgate keeper\u201d which only allows access by authorized data sources. Accordingly, when ISP  receives a message from an EPG supplier  or a text channel supplier0, it first checks the data for authorization. If that supplier is not authorized, the data is ignored. When the supplier is authorized to access ISP , ISP  performs the requested action and returns a command response message. If the communications link is simplex, the response is ignored. In this manner, access to ISP  can be limited by authorization codes, but as will be described below, access is also limited by whether the data provider provides EPG data or text data in the transmission protocol expected by ISP .","Messages sent between an EPG supplier  or a text channel supplier  and ISP  can be formatted to include a start of text byte, a data block of ASCII characters, checksum bytes and an ASCII carriage return. This format is used in commands sent to ISP  from the data suppliers as well as in responses sent to the data suppliers. The checksum can be a two byte CRC of all bytes in the message field beginning with the first character following the start of text character up to but not including the checksum field. The checksum is transmitted in the message as the hexadecimal ASCII representation (four bytes) of the CRC computation. The data blocks can be conFIG.d differently depending upon whether the input data is EPG data or text data.","EPG data from the EPG supplier  can be formatted in accordance with an EPG command set including, for example, a Define Program Command which is used to identify all data relating to a single program, a Define Category Command which is used to establish a category for identifying different types of programs, and a Delete Category Command which is used to delete an unused category to make room in the database of ISP  for new programming categories. The EPG data may be formatted on a per program basis by these commands.","Delimiter characters can be used for variable length fields such as the title and program description blocks to identify the length of the field. For example, a NUL (0 hexadecimal) means the field is null, SOH (I hexadecimal) means the field is valid, and ETX (31 hexadecimal) means the end of the current record.","Once data transmitted with a Define Program Command is stored in an EPG database of ISP , the EPG data is formatted into transactions for transmission to the set top box . This command may also be used to update a program definition since it will overwrite a corresponding entry in the EPG database of ISP .","ISP  may respond to such commands from the EPG supplier  by sending an appropriate response such as: no error (normal response), service provider not found (not authorized), type of service not found (not authorized), category ID riot found, unrecognized command, checksum error, insufficient disk space, and the like. Other EPG commands and command responses may be provided as desired.","The text channel data can originate from many different text channel suppliers  and arrive at the ISP  through different communications links such as satellite, dial up modem, direct connect modem or with a direct connect to the system manager .","ISP  can include a plurality of databases and database managers. As shown in , there may be two types of databases maintained in ISP \u2014one type for EPG data and one for text channel data. The EPG database is designed to collect data from each EPG supplier and to sort each EPG program record by channel and time of day. A separate database is created for each text channel for collecting text data from the associated text channel supplier  and formatting the received text data for transmission on individual text channels using the techniques to be described below. Each database that is created is identified by the service provider and type of service codes listed in the Define Program Command for use in the control link commands provided to ISP  from HEC .","As shown in , a received command is checked for its command code, the service provider, type of service and authorization code, as appropriate, by router and formatter . If the command is from an unauthorized data source, the subsequent data is ignored. However, if the received data is from an authorized supplier, router and formatter  routes the data to the appropriate database within ISP . For example, if EPG data is received, it is routed via EPG database manager  to EPG database .","In one embodiment, EPG database manager  sorts the received EPG data by channel and time of day and stores the received EPG data in the appropriate location in EPG database  for later recall. EPG database manager  may also perform garbage collection on the EPG database  as records are deleted. EPG database manager  may also call a data compression software routine such as the Huffman Compression Algorithm which, as known to those skilled in the art, maps more frequently used characters to fewer bits than the usual eight bits used in normal ASCII, while giving the less frequently used characters more bits. The number of bits used for a character is based on its probability of appearing in the data stream. Huffman encoding is described in detail in an article entitled \u201cLossless Data Compression\u201d, Byte, March, 1991, pp. 309-314, incorporated herein by reference. Such a routine is desired to maximize storage efficiency at EPG database . Similarly, each text database manager can store the text information in the associated text database and performs data compression.","Router and formatter  and database managers ,  and  are all controlled by configurator , which is, in turn, responsive to control data from HEC . Configurator  responds to control commands from HEC  to provide updated authorization information to router and formatter  for comparison with the incoming data and for adding\/subtracting database managers and databases and the like as EPG suppliers  and text channel suppliers  are added and subtracted from the system.","Access to ISP  is can be carefully controlled through the use of authorization codes. In addition, ISP  can maintain control over the information services provided to the viewer by storing the EPG data and text data in a particular format in the appropriate database within ISP .","Referring now to , the EPG database key can be a combination of the date and time field and the channel number from the EPG data. Following these fields are the duration field, the repeat field, the program rating field, the program category field, the critique field, the attributes flag field, the program traits flag field, the text data compressed flag and lastly the text data. The text data field may further consist of several optional subfields with a delimiter between each field.","EPG database manager  can access the EPG database  through shared library routines such as add a record, delete a record, read a record, and the like. As the EPG database  is used. it can be fragmented as records are added and deleted, and as a result, EPG database manager  may further include garbage collection routines for periodically performing the garbage collection function on the EPG database . The text databases are similarly conFIG.d except that garbage collection is not necessary.","In one embodiment, EPG transaction formatter  reads the database records of EPG database  and formats them to program-based transactions having a predetermined number of bytes which are transmitted to the EPG scrambler  for insertion into the vertical blanking interval of a video signal and transmission to the set top box . These transactions are then sent via a transaction arbitrator  to the EPG scrambler  shown in  for insertion into the appropriate video channel.","The transactions from transaction arbitrator  can be output to a single RS-485 output port of ISP  which is connected to multiple scramblers of the type used to scramble premium cable channels. The transactions are segmented into EPG data and text data streams for transmission to the EPG scrambler  (if the transaction includes EPG data) or to the text channel scramblers  and  (if the transaction includes text data).","In one embodiment, the EPG transactions generated by EPG a transaction formatter  are formatted into SDLC frames as noted above. A sample SDLC format for the EPG transaction data is shown in . In , the beginning flag delineates the beginning of the SDLC frame, the station address delineates the scrambler to be addressed, the control byte is a command code that defines what is to be processed, the information field contains the EPG data formatted as in , the frame check contains the CRC for all data between the beginning and ending flags, and the ending flag delineates the end of the SDLC frame. A transmission from EPG transaction formatter  will address a specific data stream and a response from the EPG scrambler  will identify its data stream in the station address location. As noted above, such transmissions may or may not require a response from the EPG scrambler .","The EPG transactions typically include an Add EPG Block command including a byte specifying that the following data is from the EPG data stream, a control code byte specifying, for example, whether a reply from the scrambler is expected, two bytes setting forth the EPG data block number, a flag setting forth whether the EPG data is Short Term or Long Term data, the number of transactions which make up the EPG data block, and the actual transactions. EPG transaction formatter  may also generate a Delete EPG Block command which specifies that the data is to be deleted from the EPG data stream, the control code byte, and the EPG block number to be deleted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0202"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["58","500","63","502","28","504","506","46","508","58","510","28","28","512","58","514","502","60","62","60","62"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0181","num":"0203"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["60","62","600","50","54","602","604","30","32","606","608","60","62","12","30","32","604","50","54","30","32"]},"Text data can be passed to the screen by sending a separate character for each display location of a page. In other words, if a text screen comprises 16 lines and 4 characters per line, a text screen is represented by sending 384 (24XI6) characters, one for each display location for that display screen. A blank space character is sent to indicate that no character is present in a particular text screen location.","In one embodiment, the text data is transmitted to the screen along with appropriate commands for controlling the display of the text data. For example, a first display command in a sequence identifies the following data as text data and instructs the set top box  to fill the television screen with a blue background or some other background or template over which the text will be displayed. The text data is then converted into a series of commands which together identify the separate screens of text. As noted above, the text data is grouped on a per screen basis, which allows the appropriate delay mechanism to be incorporated into the display commands to provide the necessary delay between the presentation of respective text screens.","For this purpose, transaction formatters;  and  can include software for scanning the text data for actual characters, skipping extra spaces in the text data, and grouping the actual text for transmission in transactions of a designated size which will fit in the vertical blanking interval of a field of a video signal. Since spaces are eliminated, the display commands include a coordinate specifying the row and column address of the first display character on the screen and a number of contiguous characters follow that character in the same transaction until the transaction is filled or a number of successive spaces are encountered.","Attribute information such as underline, blinking, or luminance inversion associated with the characters may also be transmitted using these display commands. These display commands are used to read the text data for a text screen from the appropriate database, and at the end of the text data for a text screen, a display command is transmitted to indicate that all data for that text screen has been transmitted. The transaction formatter ,  also includes a wait loop or \u201ctimeout\u201d command at the end of the transmission which builds in a delay (on the order of 7 seconds) which gives the viewer sufficient time to view a text screen before the text data for the next text screen is displayed, thereby providing auto-pagination of the text screen.","Auto-pagination permits the viewer to automatically advance from one text screen to the next without any intervention by the viewer. In accordance with the auto-pagination scheme of the invention, the cable operator can specify the time duration between screens and forward this information to the transaction formatters; , . Then, during operation. when the viewer selects a text channel, the current page of text data is displayed by extracting the selected text channel data from the vertical blanking interval of the video signal in which it is inserted and mapping that text data to a channel of the viewer's television which is designated for display of that text channel. The next screen of text data will be displayed after a predetermined delay which gives the viewer sufficient time to read the displayed text data for the current screen (approximately 7 seconds). This technique could replace the commonly used \u201cbarker\u201d channel which uses a computer to generate text data which is then transmitted as a complete video channel over the cable television system.","Configurator  can respond to control commands from HEC  to provide updated authorization information to router and formatter  for comparison with the incoming data and to add\/subtract database managers and databases and the like as EPG suppliers  and text channel suppliers  are added and subtracted  from the system.

The user interactions may include but are not limited to channel change requests, requests to view more information, configuration of device parameters, requests to performs recording or deletion of programs from a storage device. All actions due to user interactions are recorded in a history database that stores history of viewer actions. Data records in the history database describing viewer action can be of different formats. shows one of the possible formats for the data record. Data records may contain information about the action, time at which the action occurred, and some parameters that further describes the action. In one embodiment of the invention, only actions matching certain criteria are recorded in the history database. For example, all user action about watching channels can be ignored if the duration of watching is less than a configurable threshold, or all user action about watching a particular channel like preview channel can be ignored. In the default usage of the device, the user will not be identifying himself or herself during each usage session. A usage session in this context can be the period during which there are user activities between two periods of inactivity, or the period during which the device is used between two periods during which the device is not in use. It will be left to the device to determine who the actual user is, in order to provide a very personalized environment to the user. In such a scenario the user action records will not contain any information about who the user is. In one embodiment of the current invention, the user can identify himself or herself explicitly for all or some of the usage sessions by using some mechanism provided by the system. These mechanisms may include pressing a sequence of keys, or choosing a user name from a menu and logging-in as that user. In this embodiment of the invention the user can identify himself or herself during certain sessions and may choose not to identify himself or herself during some other sessions. In the case where the user identifies himself or herself certain user action records can have the user name or some other identification data as a parameter which specifies that a user was togged-in for the session from which the user action record was generated.","By analyzing the user action history database that was generated for a period of time, the current invention provides a mechanism to create multiple profiles automatically. Each of these profiles may correspond to the entire preference of a single user, a group of related preferences of a single user, a group of related preferences of a group of users or the entire set preferences of a group of users. The mechanism for creating multiple profiles is described in .","Sets of consecutive user action records are grouped together to form usage pattern records. Usage pattern records can be in the form of arrays of user action records. Only user actions that occur contiguously are grouped together in a single usage pattern record. The usage pattern records can be formed using many methods, some of which are:\n\n","Each usage pattern record is mapped to a point in an N-dimensional space, each axis of this N-dimensional space representing a parameter that is of significance in identifying multiple profiles. The N-dimensions for this space are called cluster-dimensions. The parameters for this N-dimensional space are chosen either manually by people skilled at identifying the most significant parameters in identifying multiple profiles, or automatically by identifying the aspects of profiles that differs significantly between profiles. In one embodiment of the current invention a set of these parameters are identified and conFIG.d as the apparatus is conFIG.d during initialization, and a new set is added periodically by looking at aspects which differ in the multiple profiles that are stored in a device. A wide variety of combinations of initial parameters may be used. In one embodiment these initial parameters are the channel names in a channel line up and viewing times. In the embodiment, these initial parameters are possible values of program description fields of television programs. In one embodiment the rate of channel change is also one of the parameters. The mapping of the usage pattern record to a point in the space defined by cluster-dimensions can be done by many methods. One method determines the quantity of a particular characteristic which is defined by a clustering parameter, exhibited in a usage pattern record, e.g. number of channel changes in a usage pattern, and uses this as the value of the axis for the corresponding dimension. One method determines the rate of consumption of a particular characteristics in a usage pattern record, e.g. rate of consumption for \u201cNBC\u201d in a usage pattern record is 0.5 which indicates that programs on \u201cNBC\u201d were watched 50% of times during the period of this usage pattern record.","All the points in the space defined by cluster dimension are clustered into a number of clusters using standard clustering algorithms. Any clustering algorithm can be used to perform the clustering. In one embodiment EM clustering is applied to group the points in the cluster-dimension space into a predetermined number of clusters. The number of profiles being created decides the number of clusters formed. Anyone skilled in the art of artificial intelligence and clustering, especially EM clustering, will be familiar with these clustering techniques. Each cluster formed as a resulting of the clustering represents a single profile. The clustering process also provides the mixture weights for each of the clusters as one of the outputs. The mixture weight for a cluster can be used to compute the percentage of time the profile was active, of the total amount of time for which the device was used.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the clustering is performed periodically using the user actions records accumulated in the history database. In one embodiment, user action records are periodically removed from the history database based on certain criteria such as the age of the record, size of the record, relevancy of the record etc.","The current invention also provides a mechanism to predict profile that is active at any given time.  illustrates the method for identifying the profile currently active on the device. Current user actions are monitored and user action records are created. The most recent user action records are used to create a usage pattern record. The usage pattern record is mapped to a point in the cluster dimension. Using the Information about clusters representing multiple profiles, the, probability of each of the clusters being active given the usage pattern is computed. This is computed by using Bayesian Probability theory that can be used to compute the posterior probability using the prior probability and mixture weights. The probability of a cluster being active is computed using the probability of the usage-pattern record given the profile (P\/usage_pattern profile), the probability of the profile being active and the probability of the usage record occurring. The mathematical representation for the Bayesian Probability theory in the current context is given below\n\n(profile\/usage_pattern)=(usage_pattern,profile)*(profile))(usage_pattern)\n","In this equation probability of usage pattern record occurring given profile (P(usage-pattern, profile)) can be computed by knowing the probability distributions governing the clusters. In one embodiment, the cluster probability distribution can be assumed to be the Gaussian probability distribution, so that the P(usage_pattern profile) can be computed using the cluster center and cluster variation. Cluster center and the cluster variation are the output generated by the clustering process performed for generating multiple profiles.","In one embodiment, switching the device on can be one of the user actions recorded and \u201ctime of usage\u201d one of the clustering dimension. In this embodiment, as soon as a user switches the device on, the probability for any cluster being active can be determined, even with out any further user actions. As the user performs more user actions, the current usage pattern record is refined to include more user action records and the probability of profiles which may be active is refined with the addition of each new user action record. As more user action records are added to the current usage pattern, a set of the oldest user action records may be removed from the current usage pattern record. This process ensures that the effect of individual user actions in the identification of active profiles decreases as time passes.","In one embodiment of the current invention, the clusters generated by the clustering procedures are used to create multiple profiles using a method described in . In this embodiment, the clusters are used to compute the probability of each clusters being active during the period of each usage pattern record. User preferences for each profile are created using processes described previously using the user actions weighted by the probability of the corresponding cluster being active.","Targeted Advertisement Delivery","With reference now to , in a preferred embodiment of the present invention used to deliver advertising content to specifically targeted viewers based upon their individual viewer profile, the broadcast network amasses content from the many different content providers and combines it at a network broadcast head end  into a broadcast signal that is transmitted to, and received by, the television control system  of the present invention. The control system  sorts through the content received from the broadcast network based upon the profiles of the different viewers in the particular household, compiles lists of preferred programs available to each user, records and stores programs of interest, and makes the programs available for viewing when required. Equally important, the control system  receives and sorts through various advertising content and stores the content most relevant to the viewers in the house hold based upon their demographic profiles and the target audience of the advertising content.","With greater particularity, and as shown in , content providers include EPG suppliers , text channel suppliers , conventional programming suppliers , and alternative content suppliers . As described below, alternative content refers to highly targeted programming that may be delivered through the use of a control system  as described herein. Conventional programming encompasses all types of programming currently available and including, but not limited to, movies, news, sport events, educational programs, pay-per-view shows, and shopping channels. Advertising content suppliers  provide promotional material such as short video clips or graphical and text information to programming suppliers  for inclusion in their conventional programming content, in a manner familiar to TV viewers worldwide. However, in a novel method of delivering advertising content uniquely available through the use of the present invention, advertising content may be supplied to alternative content suppliers (see discussion below) and may also be profiled through a profiler  to develop meta data descriptive of each individual advertising message. As discussed elsewhere in the specification, the meta data refers to demographic characteristics that describe the viewers to whom each advertisement is specifically targeted.","The profiler  may be a software based system or may rely upon human intervention to watch and analyze each advertising message and develop meta data descriptive of the advertisement. Alternatively, the advertising content suppliers  may provide this information along with the advertisement. The meta data is developed based upon the parameters of interest to the clients for whom the ads are developed, and will typically include the age, gender, ethnic background, education, profession, and other demographic information related to the viewer. The meta data will thus describe the viewers to which each advertising message is targeted in terms of the viewers' demographic information as defined by the parameters mentioned previously. The meta data thus generated is then appended to each advertisement and the thus-tagged advertisements are provided to the broadcast network for inclusion in the broadcast signal.","The tagged advertisements will preferably be provided in a plurality of channels, wherein each channel may carry a specific type of advertisement in terms of the target audience. Thus, each channel may be defined according to one demographic parameter or an often recurring combination, e.g. a channel with ads for men, a channel with ads for women, a channel with ads for male sports fans, etc. Alternatively, each channel may carry a stream of all types of ads, wherein each type of ad is present in a ratio dependent upon the demographic parameters to which it is targeted. Thus, ads targeted to male sports fans on weekend afternoons will be more numerous than ads targeted to young children, because of the large number of sports events broadcast at such time and the high probability that young children will be playing outside rather than watching TV indoors at such times. Although providing tagged advertising content via a plurality of channels is not a requirement of the invention, it is believed that the sheer amount of advertising content available will require multiple channels as a practical matter. Furthermore, providing channels in a pre-sorted manner may reduce the amount and complexity of the sorting carried out by the control system  (as more fully described below).","Also as shown in , the signal broadcast by the network may further include information provided by the administrator of the service provided by the invention, e.g. Metabyte Inc., the assignee of this application. As described in more detail elsewhere in the application, this information may include updates of the software of the control system .","With continued reference to , the network broadcast signal is transmitted to, and received by, the control system . The broadcast signal may be analog or digitally encoded, and may be transmitted via cable, satellite, telephone line, or any other practicable manner. In view of the large number of channels typically available and the state of the art, practical considerations will most likely dictate that the network signal be broadcast in digital form, in which case both the network head end  and the control system  will need to incorporate ADC and DAC circuitry, in a manner very well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is understood that the control system  will need to incorporate channel tuning circuitry that, although not shown in the FIG., will be necessary to separate the numerous signals multiplexed in the broadcast signal and select any one of these signals (i.e. channels) as necessary.","Once received by the control system , the broadcast signal is supplied to various components of the system. The program switch  responds to the viewers input as provided via a remote control or similar unit to select the desired channel and direct the channel signal to the TV monitor . As described previously, the preference agent  monitors the viewing selection of the various viewers using the control system  and creates viewing profiles of each viewer that are stored in the preference database . Based upon these profiles, the preference agent  sorts through the incoming programming content as described in the EPG information to compile lists such as \u201cTop 10\u201d lists of viewing choices available at any given time to each viewer, and directs the recording manager  to record the top-ranked program being broadcast at any given time (including any programs selected by the viewers for recording) and store it in the stored programs memory device .","The preference agent further contains software that allows it to create a demographic profile for each viewer, based upon the viewing profile of the viewer and certain algorithms or associative rules. These algorithms may be adjusted over time as the model employed by the system administrator  is enhanced and its accuracy improves. To this end, the system update information channel included in the broadcast signal may include periodic software updates, including new preference database parameters that may need to be included at the request of the advertising suppliers . Thus, in one embodiment the control system  of the invention may be remotely upgraded to meet any new demands that may arise as advertising content providers become familiar with the system and the process of custom tailoring narrowly focused, targeted advertisements. The demographic profile created for each viewer is stored in the demographic database , which resides in the control system  and thus ensures the viewers privacy.","The preference agent  also sorts through the advertising content streaming in through multiple advertising channels contained within the broadcast signal and, based upon the demographic profiles of the viewers and the meta data contained in each advertisement to describe the target audience for the particular advertisement, stores and\/or causes the display of particular advertisements. The control system  may utilize any of a variety of methods to manipulate the advertising content, as described below.","In one embodiment of the invention, the advertising channels each carry the same type of advertising. The preference agent determines which viewer is watching TV at any given time and stores in stored ads memory device  those tagged advertisements that are targeted to the particular viewer. At appropriate times during the program that is being watched by the viewer, such as during the commercial breaks typically inserted in most TV programs, the preference agent directs the program source switch  to access the stored ads and play a selected advertisement on the TV monitor . If the program being watched by the viewer contains information regarding the length of the commercial break, the preference agent may select stored ads of appropriate length to insert in the allotted time slot. The preference agent may further keep track of the ads that have been previously played to ensure that all stored ads are displayed equally. Alternatively, tagged ads may contain the desired number of times that the advertisement provider wants the ad to be aired during any given day, or perhaps the specific times at which the ad should be shown. Thus, after a number of ads having been stored, e.g. sufficient for a 24 hour period, the preference agent may review all of the stored ads meta data and develop a strategy for showing these ads to the viewer including when and how often.","Alternatively, the preference agent may cause a certain number of ads to be displayed and direct the recording manager  to record the selected program if the stored ads being displayed run longer than the allotted time slot for the commercial break. The control system  of the present invention can therefore manipulate the broadcast schedule of a program to a certain extent by modifying the amount of advertising content that the viewer is subjected to.","In another embodiment, the advertising channels may be operational for only a limited time during the day, typically at off-peak hours (e.g. 2 a.m.), during which all advertisements for the coming day may be downloaded and stored. Thus, an advertising channel may be turned on at a certain time and stream all advertisements to the control system during the space of an hour or two. Alternatively, a regular programming channel may suspend programming for an hour or two at a convenient time and supply the advertisements for the following day. In yet another alternative, a dedicated connection such as a phone line or an internet connection may be used for periodic downloads of advertisements.","In an alternative embodiment, multiple advertising channels carry a mixture of advertisements such that at any given time the preference agent has the option of selecting at least one advertisement targeted to the viewer from one of these channels. In this embodiment the control system need only to store one advertisement at any given time to ensure continuity between the program being watched and the advertisements. Thus, by way of example, the commercial break in the program may occur at a time that does not correspond to the beginning of an advertisement on any of the advertising channels. In this case, the advertisement stored by the control system is directed through the program source switch to the TV monitor while another targeted advertisement is concurrently stored for subsequent display. If the commercial break happens to coincide with the start of a targeted advertisement on any of the advertising channels, the preference agent can simply cause the program source switch to direct the particular channel to the TV monitor while another advertisement from another advertising channel is being stored.","In another embodiment, each regular programming channel can carry multiple, multiplexed versions of an advertisement. When a commercial break occurs, the preference agent selects the most appropriate version of the advertisement and directs it to the program source switch. This embodiment would require additional circuitry to de-multiplex the various versions of each add and apply the particular version selected by the preference agent to the program source switch.","The novel method of delivering targeted advertising that is provided by the invention is extremely advantageous to the advertising community. In one aspect, the invention allows greater freedom in producing advertisements because they no longer need to be appealing to as wide and varied an audience. Furthermore, because the alternative advertisements are delivered in real time, all viewers are reached by individualized advertisements at the same time, thus providing significant time savings in comparison with the prior art, wherein five different advertisements would require five different time slots during which to be broadcast. The cost savings thereby realized, especially during very popular events such as the Super Bowl, can be significant.","As mentioned above, preference agent  may sort through available channels to select the ten (or any other number) programs currently playing that most closely match the viewer's viewing profile. In addition, the preference agent may also build customized listings of future programs based upon the viewer's profile as well as any additional criteria specified by the user. In a preferred embodiment the user will have the ability to fully customize his viewing profile, including the values assigned to the different parameters that make up his or her viewing profile. In an alternative embodiment the user may even be allowed to specify what kind of advertising he prefers. Such a configuration would likely generate an alternative billing arrangement, whereby the user agrees to watch advertisements in exchange for the ability to specify the types of advertising he wishes to be subjected to and perhaps some sort of financial incentive.","Another novel possibility engendered by the present invention is the creation of a \u2018personal channel\u2019 that is always showing the most interesting program being broadcast at any given time and\/or previously recorded and stored programs that were very close matches to the viewer's profile. Thus, turning on to the personal channel will always guarantee the viewer the most individualized, interesting viewing experience available based upon the programs broadcast during a certain preceding time period that the viewer may specify. The personal channel may thus show a collage of movies, news segments, sports events, and any other programming content that was broadcast during the preceding 24 hours and that matched the viewer's profile to within a specified degree.","An additional element of control system  that may be incorporated only in selected control systems is a privacy filter  that deletes any personal information from the demographic database and transmits this anonymous information to the system administrator  for purposes of maintaining and updating the model used to generate the demographic database. Such models of the control system will require a feedback line for transmitting the demographic information to the system administrator, and in a preferred embodiment is a telephone line or a dedicated internet line such as DSL, cable, etc. The system administrator may offer financial or other incentives to users to convince them to supply this type of information. By carefully selecting users across a wide demographic cross section, the system administrator can use the information thus gathered to enhance the model used to develop a viewer's demographic profile based upon his or her viewer profile by comparing these users' actual demographic data with the demographic profile developed by the preference agent.","Due to the narrowly focused nature of the advertising delivered by the invention, the targeted advertising developed for delivery by the control system of the invention may include novel elements such as coupons or highly targeted descriptions. Thus, targeted advertising developed for distribution via the present invention may include specific information, couched in specific language, that is intended to be especially appealing to the target audience.","The invention further allows the creation of highly targeted content other than advertisements that can be delivered only to a very specific audience. Thus, movies, shows, religious programs, video magazines, infomercials, etc., may be developed to reach a very specific audience without the restrictions typically imposed on the content developers when the program will reach, or at least be accessible to, a very wide audience. This embodiment will require that such specific content be supplied via dedicated channels that cannot be tuned to directly by a conventional TV tuner, and thus may only be accessed through the control system . Such highly targeted content may be provided by alternative content suppliers  or even be developed for alternative distribution by conventional programming suppliers . Thus, use of the present invention may create a new distribution medium that will allow the content providers to not only reach a very specific audience but also to remotely, automatically exclude certain segments of the audience from accessing this material. Such alternative content could be broadcast exclusively on a viewer's personal channel, as described previously.","The popularity and acceptance of the system of the present invention will depend largely upon the cost to the end users, i.e. the viewers. As such, in one preferred financial arrangement, the user pays a set price for the control system, i.e. the hardware, connects the control system to his TV and incoming cable or satellite dish line, and enjoys the personalized services provided by the control system at no further cost. The system administrator will provide tagged advertisements for broadcast by the broadcast network and charge a fee to the advertisement client. The actual advertisements may be provided by an advertising content supplier or the advertising client itself (e.g. a truck manufacturer), to which the system administrator tags the meta data. The fee may be based upon the total number of control systems installed and\/or the target audience that the advertising client wishes to reach. Thus, if a client wishes to air advertisements that are tagged to reach a relatively wide audience of viewers who have purchased and presumably installed the control system of the invention, the fee charged will be proportionally higher than the fee charged for a more narrowly focused advertisement.","Preference Determination System","The following portion of the disclosure discusses one preferred embodiment of a system according to the present invention, referred to as the MbTV system, and provides practical working details regarding the hardware and software implementation of such a system.","Technology Overview","With reference to , MbTV is a set of software libraries that can be integrated with a resident host application, known as the Controlling Application (CApp) on a Set-Top Box (STB). The resident host application manages the overall control in the STB and interfaces with the MbTV libraries to invoke MbTV functionality. The core services provided by MbTV include automatic viewer preference determination and automatic content-based storage management. Depending on application requirements, MbTV customer libraries can be extended to include such capabilities as automatic recognition of multiple viewers on STBs, targeted advertisements, ad management, content aggregation and presentation, statistical audience measurement and targeted product catalogs. The exact configurations of services included are determined by the customer's implementation requirements.","Data or information that any MbTV services generate can remain at the STB, which does not require remote storage or a back channel mechanism to be functional. Privacy is inherently built into the MbTV architecture.","Some of the services MbTV technologies provide require operational server-side MbTV components. MbTV libraries also assume the availability of some basic services in the STBs. These services are typically available in some form in all STB configurations and include access to Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data mechanisms to control the TV tuner, a DVCR library, and User Interface (UI) management by the Controlling Application.","Technology Applications","Customers can use MbTV technology to build a variety of applications for a STB environment, depending upon consumers' requirements. For instance, a customer could design applications that personalize EPGs, personalize video recorders, and provide video on demand (VOD) systems.","System Architecture","The main control of the MbTV enabled system resides in a Controlling Application (CApp), which interfaces with various modules (including the MbTV modules) of the system to manage the aggregate functionality. The Controlling Application manages the control flow and the User Interface (UI) for the system, and calls the appropriate modules to execute user requests.","The two main components of the MbTV system, controlled by the CApp, are the Preference Determination Module, or PDM, and the Storage and DVCR Manager, or SDM. The Controlling Application notifies the PDM, also sometimes called the Preference Engine, of a viewer's TV viewing behaviors and choices. It invokes the various services the Preference Engine provides, such as generating ratings and personalizing theme searches. It assumes the availability of an external EPG library for its internal processing.","All viewer requests that require access to local storage, such as list creation, DVCR instruction, and filter management are routed through the SDM. The Storage Manager passes user requests to underlying modules for actual execution. All other functions of the system, such as a tuner control, conditional access, and UI management, are handled by the Controlling Application directly.","The actual implementation of this architecture may vary, depending on the customer's system configuration and application requirements.  is a graphical representation of the architecture of a system integrated with MbTV software modules.","System Configurations","The system of the present invention as embodied by the MbTV system described herein provides a scalable technology that customers can adapt to the resources are available in a specific configuration. The present specification includes examples of methods to tailor the MbTV technology to suit varying configurations. The services available to these various configurations are also discussed.","Systems Without Local Storage","MbTV technology can easily be adapted to systems with only local storage. Customers can tune MbTV to scale down its persistent memory requirements to fit low-end systems with small amounts of persistent storage (between 4 Kb and 16 Kb). Such configurations do not include the Storage Manager (SDM) or program recording services. While basic program rating functionality is unaffected in these configurations, some of the more sophisticated personalization services, such as targeted ads, would be suitably scaled down to meet memory requirements.","Personal Video Recorder Systems","Systems with DVR capabilities are the most typical configurations supporting MbTV functionality. On the customer side the system is integrated with the Preference Determination Module and the Storage Manager. All recording requests are forwarded to the DVR library (or DVCR) through the Storage Manager. The Storage Manager controls the storage, retrieval and deletion of all content on the local storage.","Video on Demand and ADSL-Based Server-Switch System","The head end, where the Preference Engine and the Storage Manager reside, controls these configurations, transporting viewer requests through a back channel to the head-end for processing. The system stores all recorded content at the head-end and presents it at the viewer's TV set upon request. Such systems support all MbTV functions with no loss in functionality.","Design Aspects","The MbTV technology disclosed herein is designed to function according to customer requirements, represented by consumer electronics environments. Ease of use and reliability were given high priority in designing MbTV software modules, and were thus developed to be independent of platforms and operating systems by employing modular architecture and well-documented APIs for all external interfaces.","Main Features","A list of the main features of the Preference Determination Module (PDM) and Storage and DVCR Manager (SDM) follows.","Preference Determination Module\n\n","For a more detailed list of PDM features see detailed discussion of the PDM elsewhere in the disclosure.","Storage and DVCR Manager\n\n","For a more detailed list of SDM features see detailed discussion of the SDM elsewhere in the disclosure.","Architecture","PDM","The MbTV PDM is a machine learning system for a STB environment that learns about a user preference in TV programs by monitoring viewing activity. The knowledge gained by the learning process, which may also be referred to as a user profile, is then used to recommend programs that match the learned TV viewing preference. The learning process employs a wide variety of techniques ranging from statistics, Bayesian probability, to fuzzy logic and concepts of AI. Depending on the implementation requirements the PDM can be implemented as an independent library that could be used to simply rank TV programs. Alternatively when the automatic recording of desirable programs and enabling DVCR functionality for live broadcast channels is included in the implementation requirements, the PDM module could work in conjunction with a Storage and DVCR Manager (SDM) to facilitate automatic recording of TV programs based on the resident user profile. The PDM can be implemented in two ways:\n\n","Customer applications can use the data structures and functions in this section to target and manage advertisements, personalize Electronic Program Guides (EPGs) and VCRs, and perform other tasks suitable to your business requirements.","PDM Basic Operations","The PDM operates as a library, providing functions that compute preference determination. It monitors the click stream, the sequence of IR commands issued by the user, and uses this input with EPG information to generate a preference profile. The PDM provides a callback function to the CApp that specifies the requests the user generates during a TV viewing session. The PDM then processes these requests.","The PDM maintains an internal subset of EPG information for all the time periods spanning active viewing sessions, and generates viewer program records from the channel change information provided by the PDM callback function. This data is then used to generate a Preference Database, which creates and updates the user profile.","The PDM interface includes a number of functions.\n\n","Proper functioning of the PDM also assumes certain support functions from the CApp.\n\n","In addition to the features detailed above, the feature set of the PDM may also include:\n\n","A graphical representation of the STB architecture that includes the PDM is given in . The main control of the STB resides in a Controlling Application (CApp) which interfaces with various modules (including the PDM) of a STB to manage the aggregate functionality of a STB. The CApp manages the UI for the STB and calls the appropriate modules to execute user requests. All user requests typically associated with TV Viewing (such as channel change operations) are passed to the PDM. Specific requests to rate programs and control automatic learning are also passed to the PDM.","The PDM also provides the basic functionality of rating programs that are viewed on a MbTV enabled Set Top Box (STB). These rating could be used to generate the list of favorite show for that STB.","The other functionality provided by the PDM is to map the viewing patterns exhibited in the STB to a pre-determined number of clusters.","A cluster is also referred to as a profile. The number of clusters is either specified by the CApp or set to some default value by the PDM.","The PDM is comprised of several modules which interact with each other to provide the above aggregate functionality. These modules execute in 2 distinct contexts or in 2 separate threads of execution, the foreground context (also referred to as executing as a foreground task) and the background context (also referred to as executing as a background task).","Foreground Tasks","The foreground tasks are initiated by the Controlling Application (CApp) in response to actual requests made by the viewer. Of all the request made by a viewer, some of the request are communicated to the PDM only as event notifications, while some of the requests are actually passed to the PDM for further processing.","Event Notifications","One of the most important user requests which is passed by the CApp to the PDM as an event is the channel change event. Each channel change request is monitored by the Viewing Record Manager (VRM) module of the PDM. The VRM uses consecutive channel change operations events to determine the length of the viewing time for a channel. The length of viewing time so determined is stored in a viewer record along with the time of the viewing event and the channel id. Information on which profiles are active at the time of creating the record is also stored in the viewing record. The VRM invokes a PIM function which returns the probability value of the profile being active for all the profiles.","Viewing records whose viewing duration are below a certain threshold are ignored and not processed. The viewing records created by the VRM in the foreground context are then stored for further processing in the background context.","In addition to generating viewer records for future processing, the VRM also forwards the event notifications from the CApp to the PIM.","The PIM uses these notification events to generate its own records which would be processed in the background context to generate clustering information and determining the current profile mix. For details on the records created by the PIM in the foreground context please refer to the PIMEventRec structure defined in the document titled \u201cInterface Specification for Profile Identification Module\u201d.","PDM Request Processing","The requests which are actually processed by the PDM are requests to generate top 10 list of preferred programs, adjustment of MbTV rating of programs, controlling PDM learning behavior & profile operations (such as creating & deleting profiles, modifying profile operation, logging in\/out profiles). References to \u201ctop 10 list\u201d are meant to denote MbTV picks returned by the functions MbTVGetBestPrograms and MbTVGetCriteriaBasedBestPrograms, as described below.","Background Tasks","The primary responsibility of the background task is to process the viewing records generated by the VRM in the foreground context. The basic inputs for further processing are the viewer records, PIMEventRec records and the EPG data for the programs available during the viewing session for all the viewing record.","The Background Task interacts with all the PDM Modules and co-ordinates and synchronizes all the activity executed in the background context. If there are no background tasks to be done or all background tasks are currently completed, the background task goes to sleep. This task is either wakes itself up to complete scheduled tasks or is woken up by the VSM module when it generates a power on event. The tasks handled by the background task are:\n\n","In addition to the daily scheduled backup, the I\/O manager also handles unscheduled backups if requested by some other PDM module. This data backup is used as an error recovery mechanism in the event of a power failure. When booting up the STB, it is the I\/O manager's responsibility to restore the previously saved MbTV generated data.","The data which is backed up (and restored when booting up) includes the CDB, the VHM data and the String Table. If there are any unprocessed viewer records these are backed up (& restored) as well along with the EM records.","Preference Determination Engine","The preferred Preference Determination algorithm uses the principles of a Bayesian classifier to rate programs. The rating given to a program is the probability that the program would be watched by the user. This rating is computed independent of other programs in the lineup, so this is not the probability of the user picking the program from the lineup. The rating is only an indication of how appealing a particular program is to a user.","The probability that a user may watch the program is computed as the probability of the user watching a program given all relevant information available about the situation, P(w\/info). For example, in a channel lineup with 50 channels, all channels showing different programs with no information available about the channel line up or the program in those channels, the probability that a user may choose any of these programs is 1\/50, i.e. P(w\/info)= 1\/50, where info is NULL. If we know the probability of the user picking a program from TNT is \u2155, then P(w\/info)=P(w\/channel=TNT)=\u2155.","If we know all parameters which are relevant and can compute P(w\/all relevant parameters), we may obtain the most accurate computation of P(w\/info). But we cannot monitor all parameters which influence the viewer's choice of programs. This is due to two reasons: a) some of the parameters may be unknown or cannot be measured, and b) the memory and processing power needed to store all relevant parameters may be too high.","We approximate P(w\/info) to P(w\/monitored parameters) where the monitored parameters are the most relevant N parameters which we can afford to monitor within our limited resources.","There are numerous ways to compute P(w\/monitored parameters). One method is to approximate P(w\/monitored parameters) as a function of monitored parameters and compute the coefficients of this function. Any standard regression technique can be used to compute the coefficients of this function. The problem with this approach is that we need to maintain a rather large matrix of information regarding the effects that each parameter, or any arbitrary combination of parameters, has on watching of programs. We therefore preferably employ a different technique to approximate P(w\/monitored parameters).","We directly monitor P(w\/set of parameters) for different sets of parameters. We qualify the sets of parameters observed by assessing the relevance of the set and also the information content of P(w\/set of parameter).","Since we monitor only P(w\/set of parameters) for different sets of parameters, we will have to compute P(w\/monitored parameters) using the values of P(w\/set of parameters) which are monitoring. We use the following principle to compute P(w\/monitored parameters):\n\n()=()*()\/()\n\nif a and b are non correlated.\n\nIf a and b are correlated and if P(w\/b) is greater than P(w), we approximate\n\n()=()if ()>().\n\nThis is a good approximation as the most likely values of P(w\/a,b) would be between P(a\/b) and P(w\/a)*P(w\/b)\/P(w).

The internal modules that currently use the String Table are the EM and the CDB. The STM internally allocates a number of String Tables to store strings of various lengths. For example the STM might allocate 4 string tables where each string table could hold up to a maximum of 100 strings each. Each string table is used to store strings that are less than or equal to a specified length. The size of a string table could thus be used to refer to the size of the string that could be stored in the string table. The first string table could be used for all strings which are less than or equal to 30 characters long, the second string table could be used to store strings which are less than or equal to 60 characters long & so on. The STM stores any given string in the string table with the smallest possible size. If there is no space available in that string table, it tries to fit it in the next smallest string table. The STM returns a String Table ID (STID) for each string inserted in the string table. The STID is derived from the position of the string in the string table and which string table it is inserted in. Since the number of strings that can be stored in a string table is fixed, the STID returned by the STM could be used to determine which string table was used to store a string and the position of the string in the string table. If a string is inserted in the string table multiple times, the same STID is returned by the STM.","The STM provides basic functionality for string insertion, deletion & retrieval.","String Insertion","The STM first determines if the string is already inserted in a string table. If the string is already inserted, the STM returns the STID for the string and increments the reference count for that string by 1. If the string is not already inserted, it fits it in the smallest possible string table and in the first free location within the string table and set the reference for the string to 1 and returns the STID generated from the location where the string is inserted.","String Deletion","To delete a string, the caller provides the STID of the string to be deleted. The STM decrements the references count by 1. If the reference count becomes 0 the location occupied by the string becomes free and is available for insertion of a new string.","String Access","The STM provides support for string searches in the String Table. Based on the string size, the STM searches the smallest string table that could accommodate the string. If the string is not found in that table the next smallest table is searched. This process is continued till the string is found or not depending on whether the string was stored in the string table.","For each string table allocated by the STM, it maintains a separate sorted list of all strings in the string table. This sorted list is updated whenever a new string is inserted or when the reference count of a deleted string becomes 0. When searching for a string in a string table the STM uses this sorted list to optimize the string search.","Profile Identification Module","The PIM is responsible for creating and maintaining cluster information. In this document terms \u201cCluster\u201d and \u201cProfile\u201d are used interchangeably. The PIM is also responsible for computing profile mix at given time.

The PIM, using the clusters it created during the process as described previously, and viewer events of the current viewing session, computes the profile mix. The PIM accesses the events occurred during the current viewing session from PIMEventList.","Computing the profile mix entails the following steps:\n\n","While computing current profile mix, PIM takes into consideration the explicit login or logout actions taken by the viewer.","Example: Assume there are 3 active clusters in the system. Based on events received, the PIM computes the profile mix to be {0.3, 0.6, 0.1} for a set of profiles {Profile 1, Profile 2, Profile 3}. Let us also assume that profile 1 explicitly logged in. Because of explicit login the probability of Profile 1 being active increases. Thus the resultant profile mix for the given set becomes {0.1, 0.85, 0.05}.","The effect of explicit login reduces with time. This way, the PIM can take care of the situation where a profile logs in but the subsequent viewer events reflect absence of this profile.","Usage of the Profile Mix","The Category Database Module (CDM) and CApp use the profile mix for various purposes.\n\n","Example: Assume CApp calls the CDM function to get the 10 best programs. The CDM gets current profile mix from the PIM. Assume the mix is {0.2, 0.7, 0.1} corresponding to a profile set {profile 1, profile 2, profile 3}. In this case, the CDM returns a list of programs that includes 2 programs of profile 1's liking, 7 programs of profile 2's liking and 1 program of profile 3's liking.\n\n","As shown in , the PDM thread calls a function of the CDM to update the CDM database. This function learns about the viewer's interests. To perform this operation it uses viewer records generated by the VRM. For each viewing record, the CDM updates the liking of profiles based on the profile mix stored in the viewing record.","Example: Assume a profile mix stored in a viewing record is {0.1, 0.9, 0.0} corresponding to a profile set {profile 1, profile 2, profile 3}.

The CDM uses these viewer records to generate the Liking records. Liking records are used to monitor a set of EPG parameters of the programs derived from the viewer records. Of all the EPG parameters available for a program, only a few selected ones are relevant for generating CDB Liking records. Each liking record comprises of a set of EPG parameters. Information is also kept on the cumulative viewing duration of the set of parameters and the cumulative duration for which it was available for viewing.

The CDM uses these viewer records to create liking records.","The PDM background thread calls the CDMUpdateDatabase function. The CDMUpdateDatabase is achieved in 2 passes.","Pass-1: It reads viewing records from VRM. CDM uses information stored in a viewing record to get program information from Internal EPG (IEPG). It creates a set of index (these indexes are created when the EPG parameter string is entered in the String table) using the program information. This set of index forms a part of Liking record. It there exists no liking record with the given set of index, CDM creates one such record and puts it into Liking Record Database. Liking records created are of type self-learnt or user-prompted. There are some cases, such as Pay Per View channels, where some special handling is done. When inserting a new liking record the CDB scans for existing liking records for which some of the EPG parameter's values are the same. For each such matching record, a new liking record is created which consists of the only the matched parameter values.","Consider the following example. Let the EPG parameters being monitored be the Channel Parameter, Program Type & Title. Let one of the existing liking records comprise of the parameter values of (CNN, News, Evening News) respectively. Let the new record to be inserted comprise of the parameter values of (FOX NEWS, News, Fox News) respectively. When insert the above record, an additional record is also inserted which comprises of (DC, News, DC). Here DC refers to a predefined value (to signify a Don't Care condition) which would be considered a match with all parameter values that it is compared with. For example liking records comprising of (CNN, News, Evening News) and (DC, News, Evening News) are considered to be completely matched.","Pass-2: It updates the time watched and the time available fields for all matched the liking records. For a program viewed by the viewer, value of time watched and time available is computed using the viewing record and the liking records of all the matched records are updated. For all other programs that were available at the same time the time available field is updated for all the matching records. The watched\/available value correlates to the viewer's interest and is the basis for future computations for program preference.","Consider the liking records given in the table below.

It is an independent storage module, working in conjunction with the PDM to optimize storage content. It controls access to the DVCR in the Set Top Box, recording desirable programs, either through the automatically learned set of viewer preferences provided by the PDM or through explicit viewer request.","The main control of the STB resides in a Controlling Application (CApp) which interfaces with various modules (including the SDM and PDM) of a STB to manage the aggregate functionality of a STB. The CApp manages the UI for the STB and calls the appropriate modules to execute user requests. All requests requiring DVCR functionality and recordation are directed by the CApp to the SDM. To provide DVCR functionality the SDM relies on an underlying independent DVCR library. All request to record, play, fast forward or rewind a live or recorded program are passed by the CApp to the SDM which in turn forwards them to the DVCR library with the appropriate parameters. To obtain EPG data for recording purposes the SDM assumes the availability of an external EPG library to which it make appropriate calls to retrieve required program data (it relies on the same EPG interface the PDM accesses to obtain EPG data). Control of the TV tuner for channel change purposes is done independent of the SDM by the CApp. For automatic recording of programs the SDM uses the services of the PDM and a Viewing Status Module (VSM). The PDM is used to determine the choice of programs being recorded. The VSM module determines when the viewing device has been turned off or has become inactive so as to start the process of automatic recording and when the viewing device has been turned on or has become active to stop automatic recording.","To provide DVCR functionality the SDM relies on an underlying independent DVCR library. All user requests to record, play, fast forward or rewind a live or recorded program are passed by the CApp to the SDM, which forwards them with the appropriate parameters to the DVCR library.","The SDM is largely managed by the CApp, which controls the TV tuner for channel change and provides an EPG Database library. The SDM makes appropriate calls to the EPG library to retrieve required program data, relying on the same EPG interface that the PDM accesses.","The SDM also requires a Viewing Status Module (VSM), which tells the SDM when the viewing device, or TV screen, is inactive. Automatic recording, requested by the PDM, can only be performed by the SDM when the viewing device is off. The VSM module determines when the viewing device is inactive, so that the SDM can start automatically recording programs the viewer has requested or the PDM has determined to be desirable by examining the viewer's profile. When the viewing device becomes active the VSM stops automatic recording.","SDM Features","The SDM feature set includes these activities:\n\n","SDM Basic Operations","The SDM has two basic operations: it records programs, optimizing storage content, and it controls access to DVCR functionality.","Notice, however, that the SDM interface with the CApp provides services to two types of MbTV channel:\n\n","Program Recording","The SDM typically initiates program recording when the VSM has determined that the viewing device (e.g. TV) is off, and while it records it generates an event list of desirable programs. When storage becomes a constraint, the SDM determines which stored programs should be deleted to make room for more desirable programs, including the viewer's explicit recording requests. The SDM stops automatic recording when the viewing device is turned on again. During such automatic recording sessions the SDM assumes that available CApp functions will enable the SDM to change channels in order to find the programs the PDM determines to be desirable.","The SDM presents programs recorded while the viewing device is off to the viewer on virtual channels. A virtual channel is simply a channel created by MbTV, and shown on the EPG, on which a viewer can see what programs have been recorded while the TV was off. Unless a viewer explicitly requests only part of a program, the SDM considers a program to be recorded and displays it on a virtual channel only when the entire program has been recorded.","Controlling DVCR Functionality","When the viewing device is active, the SDM provides DVCR functionality. Since the SDM manages the storage resources and keeps track of the available space, customer applications must pass all DVCR calls to the SDM. The DVCR library and the SDM communicate through a set of non-blocking DVCR service calls provided by the DVCR library, and a non-blocking callback function provided by the SDM.","The DVCR library uses the SDM callback to return information related to a requested DVCR operation. The callback function indicates the completion of the current DVCR operation, which may be triggered by an End Of File (EOF) condition or by an explicitly requested STOP event.","The information that the SDM passes to the callback function is context dependent. When the callback indicates the completion of the operations fast forward, skip forward, rewind and skip backwards, it passes the time displacements in units of time. When it indicates completion of a recording operation, it passes the duration of the recording. All this information is forwarded to the CApp through CApp callback functions.","SDM Storage Configuration","The SDM conFIGS. the storage medium through a filter mechanism. Filters can control both the program content recorded and the amount of storage allocated for specific types of programs. Customer applications can use filters to\n\n","Each SDM filter is associated with a specific filter type. The CApp determines the number of filter types to support and provides interface functions that pass information on supported filter types. Each filter type is identified by a unique ID number and is associated with a single EPG parameter or set of parameters, determined by the CApp.","The CApp invokes the SDM filter interface functions to create and modify SDM filters, associating each filter with a specified filter type. When the CApp creates a filter, it coordinates the UI activities to extract the filter strings, the associated EPG parameter, and any other relevant parameters, and passes them to the SDM. When the SDM chooses a program to record, it determines whether the corresponding EPG data matches the existing filter strings and decides whether the program should be stored. The choice of a program to record and store depends on the current allocation of the filter, the desired allocation of the filter, and the maximum storage allowed by that filter.","SDM Recording Configuration","The SDM provides various mechanisms for managing recurring requests, resolving conflicting recording requests, providing alerts to the CApp for recording events requested by the viewer, and controlling recording quality.","The recording quality is controlled by specifying the recording bit rate (RBR) at which a recording operation is performed. The SDM accepts various default values at which recordings may be done. These defaults are:\n\n","Consider an example of an EPG where 2 of the EPG parameters are Program Category and Category Type. The possible values for the Program Category parameter could be MOVIES and SPORTS. The possible values for the Category Type parameter could be ACTION, ADVENTURE, BASEBALL, BASKETBALL etc. In this scenario the Capp could specify a Type Default recording bit rate for MOVIES & ACTION and a different Type Default recording bit rates for SPORTS & BASKETBALL. Any recording of programs that contain the above combination of EPG parameters would now use the applicable Type Default recording bit rate values as the default","When the Capp makes an explicit record request and the recording bit rate is not specified, the SDM attempts to determine if an applicable Type Default exists and uses it if it is available. Programs chosen for automatic recording by the SDM also chooses a Type Default if such an applicable default exists. The Type Default gets precedence over the System Default.\n\n","The SDM provides features that accept recurring requests for repetitive programs and overtime recordings. The CApp provides information on the repeat rate and the time period after which the request should be repeated. The customer can use the overtime recording feature to cover situations in which a program extends beyond the intended duration: sports and political events are examples of programs whose duration often goes over the time scheduled for them. Notice that overtime recording allows a customer application to extend the recording for a fixed period, but it does not provide verification procedures that check whether a program has in fact overrun its scheduled duration.","The SDM provides mechanisms that customer applications can use to notify the CApp about recording conflicts. Such conflicts can occur when either the viewer or the PDM specifies a recording request to the SDM. Notice that the SDM will accept an explicit recording request only if there are no conflicts with other explicit requests that were specified earlier. The SDM also provides notification if there is an active viewer session at the time of executing an explicit recording request.","SDM Bit Rate Configuration","The SDM will notify the CApp if there is an active viewer session (that is, if the viewing device is on) at the time it should execute an explicit recording request.","The SDM controls recording quality by specifying the recording bit rate (RBR) at which it performs a recording operation. The SDM accepts various default values for recordings:\n\n","For example, consider an EPG recording request in which two of the EPG parameters are Program Category and Category Type. Possible values for Program Category could be MOVIES and SPORTS. Possible values for the Category Type parameter could be ACTION, ADVENTURE, BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, or FOOTBALL. If the SDM records any programs that contain this combination of EPG parameters it uses whatever Type Default recording bit rate values are already specified for recording movies and sporting events.","When the CApp, in response to a user event, makes an explicit record request and the recording bit rate is not specified, the SDM attempts to determine whether an applicable Type Default exists, and uses it if it is available. If the PDM chooses a program to be recorded automatically, the SDM also chooses a Type Default if an applicable Type Default exists.","The Type Default value takes precedence over the System Default value.","Program Specific Default. The CApp specifies a specific bit rate for recording a program at the time a viewer makes an explicit request. This value takes precedence over all other default values, both for the current recording and for any future recurring requests for that program.","DVCR Library","The SDM manages DVCR functionality in a set-top box through a set of service functions provided by an underlying DVCR library. DVCR requests are relayed by the CApp to the SDM, which in turn invokes DVCR functions with appropriate parameters. The CApp-SDM interface calls programs channel IDs, but the SDM-DVCR Library interface uses file names to refer to programs.","The DVCR library interfaces directly with the underlying file system for performing input\/output (I\/O) operations, such as file playback and recording. All functions exported by the DVCR library to the SDM are non-blocking, and return control to the caller within a fixed period of time, irrespective of the duration of the DVCR operation the SDM requests. Through background tasks, The DVCR library manages any extended monitoring activities that result from a DVCR request.","The DVCR library uses a callback function to communicate status and information on incoming DVCR requests and other notification events. The callback may be invoked within the context of an incoming DVCR request or from some other appropriate context. All information that the callback function passes to the SDM is described below.","All DVCR operations, once started through the DVCR library, are expected to continue until an explicit viewer request occurs to discontinue the operation. Exceptions include Beginning of File (BOF) and End of File (EOF) conditions, when the current operation can no longer be continued. Callback functions indicate these conditions to the SDM and higher modules for appropriate resolutions. When passing DVCR requests to the DVCR library, it is the responsibility of the SDM to terminate the current DVCR operation before initiating a new one. The SMD maintains DVCR information and uses it to direct the correct sequence of calls to the DVCR library.","The state diagram depicted in  shows the DVCR state machine implemented by the MbTV compliant DVCR library.","The boxes represent DVCR states, and the arrows represent the transitions between them. The label on each transition shows which DVCR command causes the transition, and the action the DVCR library takes as a result of that transition. If more than one DVCR command can cause a state transition, the commands are separated by a slash (\u201c\/\u201d).","In this diagram, the action taken by the DVCR library is enclosed within square brackets and in italicized characters. The action taken by the DVCR library refers to the information that the DVCR library passes through the callback function provided by the SDM. The information shown includes the initialization of the preEventType and eventDuration fields of the callback data structure; the initialization of the currEventtype is not shown in the state diagram. It is implicitly assumed to be part of the information passed by the DVCR library.","The various states of the DVCR library are discussed below:","STOP CIS","A transition to the STOP CIS occurs when the current playback operation is stopped to change the input stream source, whether from one Virtual Channel to another or from a Time Shifted Channel to a Virtual Channel, or vice versa. A transition to this state occurs when a DVCRStop call occurs and the channelChange parameter is set to TRUE (shown in the state diagram as DVCRTStop).","STOP","A transition to the STOP state occurs when the current DVCR operation stops, due either to an explicit user request or to encountering an EOF\/BOF condition. No change in the input stream source is possible while in this state; any DVCR command that follows must operate on the same input stream. Transition to this STOP state occurs when a DVCRStop call is made while the channelChange parameter is set to FALSE (shown in the state diagram as DVCRFStop).","The diagram assumes that when entering the STOP state from the TIME SHIFTED PLAY all subsequent transitions between the STOP, VARIABLE FASTFORWARD, REWIND, and TIME SHIFTED PLAY states refer to operations on a Time Shifted Channel, although this is not explicitly shown. The same holds true for transitions between the STOP, VARIABLE FASTFORWARD & REWIND, and VIRTUAL CHANNEL PLAY states. The STOP state is primarily intended to prevent execution of consecutive DVCR operations without an intervening DVCRStop command.","TIME SHIFTED PLAY","The TIME SHIFTED PLAY state indicates ongoing playback operations with time shift capability, when the input stream is a live source. The function DVCRFlushTSBuffer initiates.channel change operations from one Time Shifted Channel to another. These operations do not cause a state transition.","Virtual Channel Play","The VIRTUAL CHANNEL PLAY state indicates ongoing playback operations with time shift capability when the input stream is not a live source, but a prerecorded input source available on the DVCR storage media. These prerecorded input sources are also called Virtual Channels. An EOF condition Channel (shown in the state diagram as StopDueToVCEOF) causes an automatic state transition to the STOP state.","Variable Fastforward & Rewind","The VARIABLE FASTFORWARD & REWIND state indicates ongoing rewind or fast forward operations at variable speeds, on a Time Shifted Channel or on a Virtual Channel. An automatic transition from this state occurs when the operation encounters a BOF or EOF condition during the rewind or fast-forward operation. A BOF condition (shown in the state diagram as StopDueToBOF) causes a transition to the STOP state for both Virtual Channel and Time Shifted Channels. An EOF condition on a Virtual Channel (shown in the state diagram as StopDueToVCEOF) causes an automatic transition to the STOP state. On a Time Shifted Channel, however, an EOF condition (shown in the state diagram as StopDueToTSEOF) causes a state transition to the TIME SHIFTED PLAY state, and the prevEventType field is set to DVCR_JUMP_TO_LIVE.","Record","The RECORD state indicates an ongoing recording operation. An EOF condition encountered during a recording operation on a Time Shifted Channel (shown in the state diagram as StopDueToTSEOF) causes an automatic transition to the STOP state. This is an illegal state if the current input stream is associated with a Virtual Channel.","Pause","A transition to the PAUSE state occurs when the current playback or record operation is explicitly paused by the user. The playback operation is valid both on a Time Shifted Channel or a Virtual Channel, whereas the record operation applies only to a Time Shifted Channel. Though it is not explicitly shown, the diagram of  assumes that when entering the PAUSE state from a RECORD state, the DVCRResume command following causes a transition back to the RECORD state. The same hold true for state transitions between the state TIME SHIFTED PLAY & PAUSE and the state VIRTUAL CHANNEL PLAY & PAUSE.","EOF Condition","Virtual Channels","In Virtual Channels an EOF Condition during fast-forward and playback operations causes an automatic transition to the STOP state. The DVCR library does not initiate an error recovery on its own. Error recovery from such a state is handled primarily by user intervention. Possible recovery procedures in such a condition are rewind or channel change.","The rewind operation in such situations is a valid operation and does not require any special handling by the DVCR library. In the case of a channel change operation, the Controlling Application Module forces a temporary transition to the VIRTUAL CHANNEL PLAY state (by issuing a DVCRPlay command) before entering the STOP CIS state (by issuing a DVCRStop with the channelChange parameter set to TRUE). It is assumed that a DVCRStop(True) call, invoked within a small predefined interval after issuing a DVCRPlay call, would cause a transition from the STOP state to the STOP CIS state via an intermediate VIRTUAL CHANNEL PLAY state. (This maybe achieved by delaying the indication of an EOF condition by a small interval when a DVCRPlay call is issued on an EOF condition).","Time Shifted Channels","In Time Shifted Channels, an EOF condition encountered during recording appears as an error. A lack of available recording space generates EOF conditions encountered during recording. Again, the DVCR library does not initiate an error recovery on its own and depends on the Controlling Application Module for error recovery. The Controlling Application Module can delete the channel or choose any other recovery mechanism.","EOF conditions during fast forward operations automatically transition to the TIME SHIFTED PLAY states and are indicated by a DVCR_JUMP_TO_LIVE event.","State Transitions Due to User Requests","The Controlling Application Module ensures that the sequence of commands issued to the DVCR library allows the DVCR library to maintain state and consistency with the above state diagram. At the same time, the CApp accepts any combination of DVCR requests the user issueds. For example, the Controlling Application Module accepts a user request to change to a Virtual Channel in the middle of an ongoing rewind operation in a Time Shifted Channel. The sequence of commands issued to the DVCR Library in this specific example is:\n\n","The semantics of these calls are more fully described in the following sections.","Electronic Program Guide (EPG)","The Electronic Program Guide contains television program information, such as scheduled program time, program or movie titles, and channel information. The EPG library is responsible for its own data downloading mechanisms, from the internet or directly through the input stream. MbTV supplies a recommended list of channel and program parameters. Based on this list, the customer then provides a list of parameters that are applicable to the customer environment. The format of the parameter information is described in the following sections.","Some of the EPG parameters MbTV requires are mandatory. Customers must provide\n\n","Tuner","The tuner provides tuning capabilities. The tuner module provides an interface for channel changing. Any channel changing the user initiates is controlled by CApp. Tuning to various channel for recording is controlled by SDM.","User Interface","User Interface is controlled by the Controlling Application CApp. It displays the various navigational screens to invoke MbTV functions. Although MbTV does not interact directly with the User Interface, MbTV has provided examples of these user interfaces to demonstrate implementation possibilities. The customers provide the presentation and navigation of the user interface, but the remote control is handled by the user interface.","O\/S Support","MbTV modules run on both preemptive and non-preemptive operating systems, in real-time or non-real time environments. MbTV allocates all the resources it requires, such as memory and semaphores, during initialization. Resources cannot be dynamically allocated.","Specific operating system functions are described in the following sections. Most MbTV processing is run as low-priority background tasks. The task is either a process or a thread. The Controlling Application invokes the MbTV interface functions as foreground tasks, to synchronize access to shared objects between the foreground and background tasks. MbTV uses whatever synchronized mechanism is provided by the customer operating system. The synchronization mechanism provided by the operating system must ensure that the task holding the resource executes at the highest priority among the tasks competing for the same resources. The customer decides the priorities of all tasks, both foreground and background. MbTV schedules between three and five background tasks, the number depending on the specific MbTV implementation the customer chooses.","Data Structures","The C data structures required by the various SDM interfaces are listed below.","pgmInfo_t","The pgmInfo_t structure is used to store information on a specific TV program.

Live channels when viewed with the time shift functionality enabled are also referred to as Time Shift Enabled (TSE) channels. The time shift capability of a TSE channel is achieved by performing a record operation of the program's audio\/video stream and providing simultaneous DVCR services on the recorded stream. The recorded audio\/video stream is stored as a circular buffer in a file allocated for this purpose. In terms of file I\/O time shifted functionality is equivalent to maintaining a set of 2 file pointers, viz\u2014a write pointer which controls the record operation and a read pointer which controls the playback, fast-forward and rewind operation. The duration for which such live programs are stored is determined by the size of circular buffer.","SDM service functions also provide DVCR services for pre-recorded programs made available on Virtual Channels. The SDM generates a Virtual Channel for each recorded program. Unlike TSE Channels which require simultaneous read and write capability, Virtual Channels require only read capability to be operational.","All SDM functions are non-blocking and control is returned to the caller within a fixed period of time. Details on the service functions provided by the SDM are given below","SDMStop","int SDMStop (boolean channelChange)","Called by the CApp to terminate the current DVCR operation which could be a playback, rewind, fast-forward or record operation being performed on a Virtual Channel or a TSE Channel. The CApp must ensure that the current DVCR operation is stopped by invoking SDMStop before a new one is started. The current DVCR operation should be stopped by an explicit user request or implicitly by the CApp. For example in a possible scenario of 2 successive DVCR requests of playback and rewind, the CApp should issue a SDMStop call to stop the playback operation before generating the new rewind request. Status and other information on the DVCR operation that has been terminated is communicated to the CApp by posting an SDM_STOP event through the CApp callback routine. In case of successful completion of a record operation an additional SDM_ADD_CHANNEL event is returned after indicating a SDM_STOP event.","The SDMStop function is also called by the CApp during a channel change operation from a TSE or Virtual Channel.

The input parameter channelChange is set to TRUE when SDMPlay is invoked for the purpose of a channel change and is set to FALSE otherwise. The input parameter channelType is used to indicate whether the playback operation is requested for a TSE channel (CHANNEL_TYPE_LIVE) or a Virtual Channel (CHANNEL_TYPE_VIRTUAL).

DVCR requests are passed on by the CApp to the SDM which in turn invokes DVCR functions with the appropriate parameters as necessary. All references to programs in the CApp-SDM interface are in terms of a channel ID whereas in the case of the SDM-DVCR Library interface, programs references are based on filenames. The DVCR library interfaces directly with the underlying file system for performing I\/O for file playback and recordation. All functions exported by the DVCR library to the SDM are non-blocking and returns control back to the caller in a fixed period of time irrespective of the duration of the DVCR operation being requested. Any extended monitoring activity that may results from a DVCR request are managed by the DVCR library through background tasks. DVCR library uses a callback function to communicate status and information on incoming DVCR requests and other events. The callback may be invoked within the context of an incoming DVCR request or from some other appropriate context. All information is passed to the SDM through the callback function in the cBackInfo_t structure described earlier. The set of functions provided by the DVCR library are given below.","All DVCR operations once started through the DVCR library are expected to continue till an explicit request is made to discontinue the operation. Exception situations (such as BOF and EOF conditions) when the current operation can no longer be continued are indicated to the SDM and higher modules for appropriate resolutions through callback functions. When passing DVCR request to the DVCR library it is the responsibility of the SDM to ensure that the current DVCR operation is terminated before a new one is initiated. The DVCR state information is maintained by the SDM and is used to direct the correct sequence of call to the DVCR library.","DVCRStop","ulong DVCRStop(int channelChange)","This function terminates the current ongoing operation (such as rewind, playback, record or fast-forward).

When terminating a playback or record operation, it sets the prevEventType field to DVCR_PLAY or DVCR_RECORD and indicates the duration accordingly. The duration returned is from the preceding playback, record or resume operation till the execution of the current stop operation. The DVCR library also sets the context field in the cbackInfo_t structure when terminating a rewind, fast-forward or playback operation in a Virtual Channel. This context is passed as an argument when invoking the DVCR playback function.","DVCR operations may also terminate automatically. Examples are automatic termination due to EOF condition for a fast-forward or playback operation, a BOF (Beginning-Of-File) condition for a rewind condition, lack of storage space during recording etc. Such events are monitored by the DVCR library and are communicated to the SDM through the callback with an DVCR_IMPLICIT_STOP event. The duration and context fields of the cBackInfo_t structure is set as described for the DVCRStop command. It is assumed that the CApp will initiate the succeeding appropriate operation as and when necessary. Typically in most cases the following operation should be a playback operation.","The DVCRStop function is also invoked to stop playback during a channel change from a TSE channel or from a Virtual Channel.

Each user request generated during a viewing session is processed by the CApp by invoking the relevant function in the appropriate module. DVCR request are passed to the SDM which may forwards them to the DVCR library if required. Commands which originate from the user may thus be trickled down to the SDM and DVCR through the CApp. Status returned by lower level modules in this scenario is communicated back to the CApp through an event notification mechanism. Status for commands that require DVCR support are passed by the DVCR to the SDM which then indicates them to the CApp. As each event is indicated to the CApp, it forwards them on to other modules (such as the PDM) which might require them for monitoring purposes. At each stage of the event notification procedure the event passed to a module maybe remapped to a different event before being indicated further. Details of event notification by each module is described in the following sections.","Event Notification by SDM","The event notification by the SDM to the CApp is through a callback function provided by the CApp. The SDM uses the callback mainly to pass status, indicate events and other information generated as a result of the requests made by the CApp. Callbacks are made mostly to indicate a start of a DVCR request or the completion of a DVCR request. Event notification by the SDM to the CApp is done only when the request originated from the CApp. Events which result from automatic recordation and deletion operations initiated by the SDM are not indicated to the CApp. The events indicated through the callback are given below.\n\n","The SDM_RECORD_ALERT event is generated when there is an explicit recording request scheduled during an active viewing session. This event is triggered at a predefined interval before the start of the actual recording operation. No other action is taken by the SDM other than providing the alert. The recording request for which the notification is provided is aborted. The aborted record request can now be executed only through an explicit immediate record request issued by the Capp. The SDM sets the eventTime and channelID fields to the start time (in local time) and the channel ID of the program to be recorded.","Details of the event notification function and other CApp support functions required by the SDM are given below","CAppEventNotification","void CAppEventNotification(struct cBackInfo_t *pcBackInfo)","This CApp function is called by the SDM to indicate the start of the current DVCR operation or completion of the previous DVCR operation. The SDM passes the address of a completed cBackInfo_t structure as input. The CApp is responsible for forwarding these events to other modules (such as the PDM) which request notification of such events.","CAppChannelChange","int CAppChannelChange(int chnlID)","This CApp function is called by the SDM to change the current channel. The channel being changed to is passed as input.","On success it returns a zero value and generates a channel change event for the other modules (such as the PDM). In case of failure it returns a non-zero error value.","Event Notification by DVCR Library","The set of event notifications indicated by the DVCR is a subset of the events indicated by the SDM. Unlike the SDM notification which indicate both the start and completion of a DVCR operation, the DVCR library notification primarily include completion of DVCR operations. The events generally indicated to the SDM are","The DVCR_STOP event to indicate the termination of the current DVCR request. Information available through this callback is dependent on the DVCR operation that has been terminated. The callback indicates the operation that has been terminated and specifies the relevant duration of the concluded operation.","The DVCR_PAUSE event to indicate pausing of playback or recording on the current channel.","The DVCR_JUMP_TO_LIVE event to indicate completion of the Jump To Live request.","The DVCR_IMPLICIT_STOP event to indicate automatic termination of the current DVCR operation. The DVCR operation that may terminate automatically are rewind due to a BOF condition or a fast forward or playback due an EOF condition or a RECORD due lack of storage resources. Additionally playback, record, rewind and fast forward may terminate due to I\/O errors.","The DVCR_SKIP_FORWARD & DVCR_SKIP_BACKWARD event to indicate the completion of a skip forward or a skip backward operation.","The DVCR_REWIND, DVCR_FAST_FORWARD, DVCR_PLAY and DVCR_RESUME events are returned in case of error conditions.","CApp Event Notification","Events communicated by the CApp are typically due to SDM event notifications resulting from servicing user requests. The CApp remaps some of the events indicated by the SDM before they are forwarded to other modules. Details of event notification provided by the CApp are given below.","MBTV_POWER_OFF event is indicated by the CApp when it processes a power off request for the viewing device. Indication of the MBTV_POWER_OFF is not mandatory and is usually done by the CApp when it has specific hardware support to detect such an event. In most configurations this event will not be indicated by the CApp.","MBTV_POWER_ON event is indicated by the CApp when it processes a power on request for the viewing device. Indication of the MBTV_POWER_ON is not mandatory and is usually done by the CApp when it has specific hardware support to detect such an event. In most configurations this event will not be indicated by the CApp.","MBTV_REWIND event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_REWIND event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_REWIND event indication to signal the start of a rewind operation.","MBTV_FAST_FORWARD event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_FAST_FORWARD event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_FAST_FORWARD event indication to signal the start of a fast forward operation.","MBTV_PAUSE event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_PAUSE event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_PAUSE event indication to signal the start pausing playback on the current channel.","MBTV_RESUME event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_RESUME event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_RESUME event indication to signal the resumption playback on the current channel.","MBTV_PLAY event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_PLAY event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_PLAY event indication to signal the start of playback on the Virtual Channel or a TSE Channel in response to a user request for a playback operation. Channel change requests to a Virtual or TSE Channel also result in the CApp invoking the SDMPlay function. However no event are indicated by the SDM to CApp in such cases.","MBTV_JUMP_TO_LIVE event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_JUMP_TO_LIVE event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_JUMP_TO_LIVE event indication to signal the completion of a Jump To Live request.","MBTV_CHANNEL_CHANGE event is indicated by the CApp when it completes the channel change operation requested by the user. A channel change operation to or from a Virtual Channel or a TSE Channel may involve the invocation of the SDMStop and SDMPlay function. In such requests no SDM events are indicated to the CApp except to communicate error conditions. In all such situations, the CApp generates a MBTV_CHANNEL_CHANGE as opposed to a MBTV_STOP or a MBTV_PLAY indication. Channel change operations, initiated by the user or by the SDM for automatic program recordings, are handled independently by the CApp and are always indicated to other modules (such as the PDM).","MBTV_ADD_CHANNEL event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_ADD_CHANNEL event from the SDM. The CApp indicates this event to signal the addition of a Virtual Channel. Each recorded program is presented as being available on a Virtual Channel provided it has been recorded in its entirety. Incomplete recording programs are not presented by the SDM and are automatically deleted.","MBTV_DEL_CHANNEL event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_DEL_CHANNEL event from the SDM. The CApp indicates this event to signal the deletion of a program due to an explicit delete request from a user.","MBTV_STOP event is indicated by the CApp when it receives an SDM_STOP event from the SDM. An SDM_STOP event is generated due to an explicit stop operation requested by the user. Channel change operations which require the invocation of the SDMStop and SDMPlay function do not generate a SDM_STOP event. The MBTV_STOP event also provides context dependent information on the operation that has been terminated by the user. The MBTV_STOP event is also indicated when it receives an SDM_IMPLICIT_STOP due to BOF or EOF conditions on explicit playback, record, rewind and fastforward request.","MBTV_RECORD event is indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_RECORD event from the SDM. The CApp generates a MBTV_RECORD event indication to signal the start of an explicit record request generated by the user for the currently viewed program. Record operations initiated by the SDM for automatic or explicit recording when the viewing device is considered to be inactive are not indicated by the SDM and hence are not indicated by the CApp.","The MBTV_SKIP_FORWARD and MBTV_SKIP_BACKWARD events are indicated by the CApp when it receives a SDM_SKIP_FORWARD & SDM_SKIP_BACKWARD event respectively from the SDM. These events are indicated by the CApp to signal the completion of a skip forward or a skip backward operation.","VSM Interfaces","The VSM interfaces with the SDM and the CApp to determine the status of the viewing device. The SDM uses this information to decide when to initiate automatic recording.","VSM-SDM Interface","The SDM provides a callback function to the VSM for notification on status of the viewing device. The VSM calls this function whenever there is a transition in the viewing status of the viewing device. Details on the function and other functions required for viewing status determination are given below.","SDMViewingStatus","int SDMViewingStatus(int eventType, time_t eventTime)","This SDM function is called by the VSM to indicate a transition in status of the viewing device through the input parameter eventType.

The VSM uses this value when it is certain that the viewing status has transitioned to the inactive state. To communicate VDEVICE_OFF events, the VSM may rely on available hardware\/software mechanism provided by the CApp for monitoring such activity. In the absence of such mechanism the VSM might uses other heuristics to determine an inactive state.","The VDEVICE_CHECK_STATUS value is used when the VSM does not have very high confidence that the a transition to the inactive state has taken place. It is used as a mechanism to alert the SDM of a possible pending VDEVICE_OFF event which could occur at the specified eventTime. For such events the VSM provides the VSMStatusCheckRequest function to the SDM to re-evaluate the viewer device status at any time beyond eventTime. The SDM make this callback before it starts any scheduled recording activity.","On success it returns a zero value and non-zero error value otherwise.","VSMStatusCheckRequest","int VSMStatusCheckRequest (void)","This non blocking VSM function is used by the SDM to request an evaluation of the viewing status.

The type of events indicated are listed in the section on data structures. Event notification is mandatory for all events with the exception of the MBTV_POWER_OFF and MBTV_POWER_ON events. If the CApp is capable the MBTV_POWER_OFF event would indicate a transition from the active to inactive state, while a reverse transition would be indicated by a MBTV_POWER_ON. In the absence of appropriate support for MBTV_POWER_OFF and MBTV_POWER_ON events the VSM might uses other heuristics to determine such state. transitions.","Before routing user requests to the SDM, the CApp always invokes VSMSetViewingStatus first to indicate the request.","On success it returns a zero value and non-zero error value otherwise.","CAppRequestStatus","int CAppRequestStatus(int *status)","This CApp function is called by the VSM to generate a query in the viewing device to elicit a user response. CAppRequestStatus allows for a fixed delay in eliciting a response before it returns a viewing status.

This function automatically determines which profile is currently engaged in viewing a device and generates the best program list for that profile. A different profile will generate a different set of programs for the same time frame.","Implementation Guidelines","The CApp invokes the function MbTVGetBestPrograms, which returns the list of programs and takes the necessary steps to display the list to the viewer. The CApp can also scroll forward or back in time, presenting the best programs for a specified profile at a different time, by using the same function with a different time parameter","Getting Criteria Based Best Programs","Feature Description","Provides the same functionality as the feature Getting the Best Programs, except that only programs that match a specified criterion are considered.","Invocation Screen:","See the feature Get Best Programs for a screen of this feature.","Implementation Guidelines","The CApp calls MbTVGetCBBestPrograms, which returns a list of the programs and takes the necessary steps to display the list to the viewer.","Getting Number of Profiles","Feature Description","Obtains the number of profiles currently supported.","Implementation Guidelines","The CApp calls MbTVGetNumProfiles, which returns the number of profiles a device currently supports.","Getting Profile Parameters","Feature Description","Gives the current values of a profile: its name and its status, whether active, frozen, or disabled.\n\n","The CApp first calls MbTVGetNumProfiles, then the function MbTVGetProfileID, then MbTVGetProfileParams, which returns the parameters of a specified profile, copying the appropriate values from the profile_t data structure.","Setting Profile Parameters","Feature Description","Modifies a profile by changing its name or status.

This information is communicated through callbacks. Event notification can be either generated or forwarded. When a function is initiated by DVCR operations, no event notification is necessary. Most DVCR notification events occur when an operation is stopped or paused, except DVCR_SKIP_FORWARD and DVCR_SKIP_BACKWARD.","The Controlling Application must be a context of the DVCR sequence. The Controlling Application and DVCR can also implement calls with any context, but they must maintain the sequence of the events.","Unlike the SDM notifications, which notify both the start and completion of a DVCR operation, the DVCR library notifications primarily indicate the completion of DVCR operations.

This process is typically done by conducting surveys to understand the product consumption of people with various characteristics. The output of this process is an index for each identified category of people. This index quantifies how much the product consumption of this group different from the general population.","For example, consumption of Coke may be 10 Cokes consumed per day by 1000 people. Consumption of Coke by people between 15 and 25 years of age (category 1) may be 15 Cokes per day by 1000 people. Consumption of Coke by people between 15 and 25 years of age who are earning between 20,000 and 40,000 dollars per year (category 2) may be 20 Cokes per day by 1000 people. In this example the consumption index of category 1 is 150 and consumption index of category 2 is 200. If the same marketing and message strategy is used for all segments and if the effectiveness of the messaging strategy is the same for all category of people, and if the consumption of Coke as opposed to Pepsi can be effected by advertising strategies, Coke can get better use of advertising money by targeting group 2 and group 1 than targeting the general population.","Identifying the target segment involves identifying the people with whom the advertisements will have the most effect. The target segment is represented by a set of parameters which are common to everyone in this segment. Output of this process may be as follows:\n\n","This is the process of finding the most efficient mechanisms to deliver advertisements to the target segment. The effectiveness of a target delivery scheme can be denoted as the percentage of impressions of the advertisement that are shown to the type of people mentioned in the targeting criteria, or may measured as an index which indicates how much more effective the targeting is in reaching the target segment compared to other mechanisms that do not employ targeting. For example, in the above Coke model, Coke may specify the following as the targeting criteria:\n\n","The Effectiveness of placing a billboard advertisement at a construction site may be denoted as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1530","num":"2112"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00087","num":"00087"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Percentage of targeting - 56%","indicates the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"percentage of people seeing the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"advertisement belonging to the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"target segment."]},{"entry":[{},"Targeting Index - 700","if the percentage of people"]},{"entry":[{},{},"in the general population is Y"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(8%) and if the targeting"]},{"entry":[{},{},"percentage of the ad is X (56)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"then the Targeting Index is X\/Y"]},{"entry":[{},{},"*100 (700)."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Messaging strategies are different techniques used in advertising to ensure that viewers of the ad retain the message in memory and also to encourage viewers to consume more of the advertised product. Certain aspects of messaging strategies may benefit from support by the delivery mechanism, such as may be provided by the following parameters:\n\n","Any new mechanism of ad delivery should have the flexibility of the current delivery medium and also additional flexibility that can improve messaging strategies.","Potentials for New Models","Increasing the effectiveness of the above three parameters can increase the effectiveness of an advertisement campaign within a given budget. Identifying the target segment is currently done irrespective of the medium for advertisement. When the target segment is known, the advertisement agencies or the product-marketing group of the company consider different delivery mechanisms. Each delivery mechanism is prioritized based on coverage, effectiveness in targeting, effectiveness in messaging strategy enabled by the medium, and the cost of implementing the campaign. The medium with higher ranking typically is allocated a larger share of the advertisement budget.","If a new advertisement delivery mechanism can increase the effectiveness of advertisements, the new mechanism can command a higher CPM (cost per thousands of impression). If the targeting index can be increased to five times the current targeting index, advertisers potentially will pay a price that is between up to five times the original CPM. This is because the advertisers have to buy only a fifth of the impressions to reach the same number of people in their target segment. The CPM would be less than 5 times the earlier CPM because with the earlier mechanism the advertiser buys five times the impressions, and because all the impressions made outside the target segment are not really a waste due to inaccuracies in identification of target segments or the need for branding in general beyond target segments.","Even if the new CPM can be increased to three times the earlier CPM, the need for buying impressions may go down by a third because of the effectiveness. This will reduce the number of impressions bought by various advertisers. The number of impression available may still remain the same if the industry is not planning to cut down the number of advertisements shown to the consumer every hour.","This may cause a surplus of impressions available and a reduction of demand, accompanied by a consequent reduction in CPM. A reduction in CPM to 2-2.5 times the current rate may make the medium a very attractive delivery mechanism for advertisers. This will cause some of the revenues generated by other media to be diverted to the broadcast\/cable\/satellite media. This will fill up the remaining available impressions and increase the overall revenues for the Broadcast\/Cable\/Satellite industry. This also provides a mechanism for the industry to deal with advertisement skipping tendencies shown by viewers of advanced PVRs.","Preferred embodiment of the Ad Manager","Model","In a conventional broadcast media, an advertisement is attached to a TV program. People watching the program will see the advertisement if they stay on the same channel when the advertisement is shown. Targeting is done by analyzing the demographics of different programs and choosing the programs that provides the best targeting percentage and coverage. In a system employing the Ad Manager of the invention, advertisements are de-coupled from programs. Targeting parameters, coverage and messaging parameters are specified for advertisements. Advertisements reach consumer set-top boxes through various delivery mechanisms. These may include sending advertisements on different channels or digital multiplex streams, using different delivery mediums, using different time periods or using the same slots used for conventional advertisements. Advertisements are mixed locally on set-top boxes and are displayed based on parameters attached to advertisements. Advertisements may be displayed during the viewing of programs, during the viewing of the guide, during the viewing of stored programs, during the viewing of other interactive services or during the viewing of the contents of a personal channel. Displaying of all advertisements are controlled by the client component of the Ad Manager (see ). Samples are collected on a set of selected set-top boxes. The samples may contain the following information:\n\n","The samples are used for creating behavioral profiles of people with different characteristics. These behavioral profiles are defined in terms of TV watching behaviors that can be used to distinguish people of the target characteristics. This information about different characteristics and how to identify them using their TV watching patterns are coded into rules and broadcast from the head-end to all set-top boxes. Set-top boxes use this information to compute values of different parameters for different viewers in a household. The client component of the Ad Manager may use these computed parameters to decide which advertisements to store, when to present these stored advertisements, and when to remove an advertisement from storage. Viewer sampling also may be used to estimate the targeting effectiveness of the system.","Functionality and Features","In a preferred embodiment, the Ad Manager would support or offer, at a minimum, the following functions:\n\n","Architecture","The preferred embodiment of the Ad Manager, as depicted in , comprises four major components:\n\n","The Ad Server is the component of the Ad Manager that allows appending targeting parameters to advertisements. The Ad Server provides a GUI for specifying the advertisement for which the parameters are added, the different fields that describe the advertisement, the targeting parameters for the advertisement, the number of impressions for the advertisement, and the messaging parameters for the advertisements. The Ad Server communicates with the Targeting Server to get the targeting parameters and messaging parameters supported by the Ad Manager. The Ad Server generates Meta-data about advertisements that could be processed by the Ad Mixer, and generates data modules and schedules the broadcast times for these data modules. The data modules generated may contain the Meta-data for advertisements in a proprietary format that could be easily processed by PVRs.","In a preferred embodiment, the Ad Server would support or offer, at a minimum, the following functions:\n\n","The Ad Mixer is the component of the Ad Manager that interfaces with the Measuring Agent, and stores and presents advertisements on a PVR. The Ad Mixer downloads rules for computing viewer characteristics, monitors TV viewing behaviors of different persons in the household, and computes target characteristics. The Ad Mixer also downloads Meta-data about advertisements and chooses the most relevant advertisements to store locally, and presents advertisements to viewers according to the targeting parameters specified. The Ad Mixer schedules presentation of advertisements according to the messaging parameters specified, and manages the mixing of advertisements with AV streams using an API to access platform functionality, including banner advertisements. The Ad Mixer further removes advertisements from storage when the targeting and messaging requirements for the advertisements are completed, when advertisements age beyond predefined thresholds, or when a higher priority advertisement is available to download.","In a preferred embodiment, the Ad Mixer would support or offer, at a minimum, the following functions:\n\n","The Measuring Agent is the component of the Ad Manager that communicates with the Targeting Server to report viewer behavior. The Measuring Agent will typically be activated only in a limited set of PVRs, and will preferably interface with the Ad Mixer through a proprietary API, as well as interface with the EPG data library, the SDM, and the PDM. The Measuring Agent will further interface with the CApp to present viewers with a set of questions to provide feedback to the system operator. The Measuring Agent collects the following information about the PVR:\n\n","In a preferred embodiment, the Measuring Agent would support or offer, at a minimum, the following functions:\n\n","The Targeting Server is typically operated on the premises of the system operator. The technology employed would preferably be in a form that requires limited operator input and control. The Targeting Server would typically analyze viewer behavior from the samples collected, and take targeting parameters as inputs to generate rules to identify the target characteristics on set-top boxes and PVRs. The Targeting Server would also estimate the coverage for combination of targeting parameters and also estimate the targeting efficiency. The Targeting Server would typically be able to generate messaging parameters for implementing messaging strategies, as well as report parameters from a previous monitoring interval for various advertisements that were presented during that period.","In a preferred embodiment, the Targeting Server would support or offer, at a minimum, the following functions:\n\n","Implementation Technology","The technological considerations that must be taken into account in developing an Ad Manager that functions effectively include:","Ad Server\n\n","Ad Mixer\n\n","Measuring Agent\n\n","Targeting Server\n\n","Certain aspects of the MbTV software embodying the preferred embodiment of the present invention depend on the customer's platform and architecture.

Program segmentation refers to a technology of final TV program production in the STB where video segments of programs (e.g. scenes, sections, highlights) are individually marked (i.e. tagged) and described, such as by content, length, rating, etc. Such program segmentation enables additional services to be offered to a viewer through the STB.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the system (e.g. the STB) may display a message to the viewer requesting that the viewer enter (more) personal details. This system request for viewer entry of more viewer personal details can arise with the AD Manager System targeting in operation in the STB (with HD) or PDR. It may arise if the system has been in operation for only a short time and the personal profile built up is only minimal. Also, it may arise even if the system has been in operation for a longer time and sophisticated audience targeting has begun, e.g. targeting the Income demographic, but the viewer has not yet input this information and the system has been unable to deduce it automatically using learning techniques and demographic conversion rules according to other aspects of the invention as discussed elsewhere.","Thus, the system may detect that it is not operating with enough information to make good personal programming decisions for the viewer, and therefore presents a warning message and request for information, such as\n\n","Additional information about the HELP request can also be provided, such as:","\u201cSystem has detected too few personal information details to operate most efficiently. Personalized programming will probably not be correctly made for you. If you take the trouble and input personal information using the interactive GUI screens provided, choosing or filling some or all of the requested information, the system will operate better for you.\u201d","(Personal Information may include a portion or all of the Metabyte, Ad Manager System, targeting metadata information details e.g. sex\/age, income salary, education, number of children, number of TVs, geographic location, program type preference, employment industry, etc.)","In another embodiment of the invention, the viewer may be provided with a control function to cause the STB to switch to a different personalized programming set. The need for this type of control and function could arise after the viewer has been viewing personalized programming for some time and the personalization has been working well, perhaps too well, and the viewer has become jaded and bored with the selection. A feature may be provided to satisfy the following types of desires:\n\n","An Extra Feature Button may be provided on the viewer's remote control to invoke any of these actions:","\u201cIf viewer is bored with present personal selection and would prefer to see a completely different selection of programs then press one of the following control buttons\u201d. Pressing this button may cause the system to perform any of the following actions:","(1) Request system to scramble (randomly modify) the viewer personal profile data, OR","(2) Request system to erase personal profile data and start learning program preference profile afresh (and re-create demographic profile data), OR","(3) Allow the viewer to selects a complete personal profile from sets of pre-captured or pre-created and canned profiles (examples follow) listed, labeled and presented to the viewer in a control window (GUI) and this profile is kept fixed by the system (not dynamically modified by future viewing) until further notice. If a demographic profile is selected, the program preferences may be looked up using parameters or rules downloaded from the operating server (i.e. the reverse of normal operation of the AD-Manager System). Possible profile examples include:","(3a) Cultural\/Demographic based:\n\n","(3b) Occupation based:\n\n","(3c) Specific persons (assuming it's legally available):\n\n","(3d) Profiles specific to certain program content. Such types of profiles may actually prove to be somewhat more difficult to automatically learn because the learning process usually involves input of various behavior and program types so would be unlikely to result in a profile as specific as these.","Such difficult to learn cases can involve, for example, types (as exemplified below) that cross the standard content information model categories e.g. GENRE, and require learning using for example words filtered from the TITLE as in the MNI methods\n\n","The viewer can manually modify or add to the list of Key words, from the more obvious word re-occurrences the system has automatically learned, to search program content information e.g. TITLE with.","(4) Viewer may select a complete personal profile from sets of pre-captured and canned profiles listed, labeled and presented as in (3) and this may be used by the system as the starting point for developing a \u2018my personal profile\u2019 (rather than starting from a clean slate). In this case the final profile, reached after a period of time, may be the same as from a \u2018clean slate\u2019 but may be different if the viewer has developed new interests in programs from the starting profile.\n\n(5) Request system to select a complete personal profile from sets of pre-prepared profiles using a random selection technique.\n\n(6) Request system to select profile details using a random selection technique (e.g. randomly selecting profile parameters from a number of different complete canned viewer profiles) thus in essence making up the profile of a fictitious person.\n\n(7) Viewer may view and have the capability to modify each individual element of the current created program preference profile and\/or related inferred demographic profile or any selected canned profile (as per (3) above). Viewer may be shown via a GUI (and text, numerals, graphs e.g. histograms) the in-use viewer program preferences (based on viewed program history) and\/or demographic profile (inferred from program preferences). The viewer may be allowed to edit the profile at will to create a more accurate profile or a less-accurate profile to try to make one that works better or is more interesting or is more exciting at this time. This can be done in the GUI by showing histogram graphs of the parameters (e.g. program genre, channels, duration, inferred age, inferred sex, inferred liking for drama programs) and allowing the viewer to click on each parameter and adjust it up and down, e.g. by drag-and-drop techniques. Also, instead of graphs, a GUI with quantity labels and associated buttons can be employed.\n","Adjustment up or down can be by selecting and clicking buttons where background processing makes sure the selections are sensible, e.g. selection of only one age group from a set of different age groups would be allowed.","In this case the system may be instructed (by viewer via GUI button) to take the changed parameters (after adjustment up or down) as fixed points (of a profile) or as a starting point for the creation of a new profile, in which case the pre-set profile parameters are altered by future use. In the latter case if there is no change in viewer behavior then the profile converges on the original profile prior to the adjustment.","In yet another embodiment of the invention, the system may display messages to the viewer regarding active segment content advisory. This may be a type of active content advisory system suitable for certain types of programs or movies where people of all ages may watch some scenes\/segments, and the plot of the program can still be understood where some viewers are prohibited from watching some scenes\/segments or do not desire to watch such scenes, and may be provided with alternative scenes.","The Metabyte Ad Manager TV system can operate this type of active rating system where individual video segments (e.g. consecutive scenes in a movie or other TV program) are each linked to demographic target description metadata. When presenting a movie, the STB (with HD) or the PDR may examine the audience targeting metadata and compare it to the viewer profile. If the profile is determined to be for a younger viewer (or in any other way different from) than those targeted, the active content advisory systems operates to prevent the higher rated segments being shown (unless defeated by a master viewer password). The AV segments may be tagged with other type of information, such as content, length, rating, title, subject, or category.","For example, a complying James Bond movie may be made with video segments individually marked and content rated. Thus when children are normally present in the viewer profile, scenes with (for example) exciting stunts can be shown but higher rated scenes with excessive violence or lewdness are tagged appropriately and may be treated differently, such as:","(1) The system may operate an interlock mechanism, and the movie stops and shows a warning message (see below) using an interactive GUI until a password keyed in to disable the interlock. Disablement may only operate for the duration of the one particular program at this one time of showing; OR\n\n(2) The system may automatically skip high rated movie scenes, or substitute an alternative scene suitable for all ages and briefly show a message (e.g. in a graphic\/text pop-up window) to indicate the action taken at the time of the scene; OR\n\n(3) As (2) but the message is shown in a GUI window at the beginning of the program and the message feature is disabled for the remainder of the program if a password is given. Disablement may only operate for the duration of the one particular program at the time of showing.\n","The benefit is that some programs or movies that could\/would not be watched by children or adults who prefer not to watch excessive violence, sex, etc., may now be watched.","Examples of Warning Messages include:","\u201cSystem has detected programming for a higher age range than is thought to be currently watching. Please verify permission to continue.\u201d OR","\u201cThe system has detected program content types not usually viewed by viewers of this system. Please verify permission to continue.\u201d OR","\u201cThe system has detected program content types not usually viewed by viewers of this system. Please verify permission to continue with alternative G rated segments substituted.\u201d","In a further embodiment of the invention, the system may examine the metadata of arriving video segments and present the viewer with a targeted index GUI made up from the metadata. This assumes that the Ad Manager System or a similar system is in operation. Also, it assumes programs are marked as segments and also described with sufficient program information to enable a STB agent to make programming decisions. Segments may be a group of related (short) programs or one program with segment markings of different sections of the material linked to segment information descriptions (summary, body detail, conclusions, lewd scenes, violent scenes, etc.).","The program may also be marked in segments that were unknown at the time the program information metadata (e.g. EPG) was produced, as they were perhaps added afterwards (e.g. marking the goal scoring scenes in a live soccer game). As the program is received a STB indexing agent examines the incoming (close-coupled) metadata (i.e. with the segment marking and ID and references to content description information). The agent uses this metadata to create an index of the segments and a GUI for presentation of the index to the viewer. Targeting details, if present (and if in use), can be observed and also shown in the index or used to show only preferred segments.","In another embodiment, the system may prompt the viewer to mark unviewed segments to be stored for later viewing. This may utilize the Ad Manager System or a similar system that may be in operation. This embodiment also requires that programs are marked as segments and described with sufficient program information to enable a STB agent or similar system to make programming decisions.","In this embodiment profile based selected segments are shown while all segments are already stored (or in the process of being stored). The STB system may present a GUI warning\/request message to the viewer such as \u201cSelected segments (scenes) not shown from the program are stored or being stored. Do you wish to mark the unviewed segments to be stored for later viewing or allow them to be over-written (or erased)?\u201d If the viewer chooses to retain the omitted scenes for later viewing, these scenes may be recorded\/retained onto the HD and marked appropriately for later retrieval and display in the correct chronological or plot-line order.","In another embodiment, the system may prompt the viewer for identification to match the viewer to interest in a particular program or type of program. This embodiment may enable viewers to periodically see a human readable interpretation of existing profiles the system has built, and be able to indicate to the system which profile(s) belong to them, and thereby improve performance without having to explicitly log in for each TV viewing session. The system may also allow the viewer to tag one or more profiles as belonging to her and hide them from other viewers in the household for privacy.","The system may include safeguards to protect the privacy of viewers within the household. There are programs that viewers may watch alone but would not want other viewers in the same household to know about. If the system suggests programs to a viewer that are based upon the preferences of a cohabitant, an embarrassing situation could arise. Possible security methods may include:","1) A passive option that, once the system has a high enough confidence in identifying a viewer, the viewer can ask (e.g. via a GUI pop-up window) to review the profiles that the system inferred to be the viewer's. A consequence of this option is it could possibly allow one viewer to see or affect other viewers' profiles, but the system could detect this type of occurrence and give a warning and then either prevent it or allow it.\n\n2) An \u2018on-demand\u2019 option, where the viewer positively asks to identify the profiles via a GUI, would be to have a module that interprets the machine profiles in a human-intuitive way that the viewer could relatively easily identify if that is their profile or not. A simplistic example includes the STB(PDR) system asking the following question via the GUI:\n\n\u201cThis profile watches lots of TV during the morning, and loves sports, if this is you please identify\u201d. In this instance any children in the household would instantly realize that this is not their profile, and one of the adults, perhaps the Grandfather, would identify the profile as belonging to him.\n\n3) The \u2018house taboo\u2019 option could filter out any preference engine outputs that contain anything related to an explicit global taboo list created by master viewers in the household.\n","This is an on-demand GUI presented screen (probably password protected) for a (main) viewer in the house to select what profile items are to be included or left out when the above 6 (1) and 6 (2) presentations are done. For example, the main viewer may choose to leave out all talk-show preferences and force the use of other program data or time to make the presentation profile ID.","In a different embodiment, the system may present a program guide sorted by content and preference. This novel feature sorts the displayed EPG information sorted by \u2018Preferred\u2019 channels, instead of by channel number, so that a viewer can see all the channel guides on one screen and not have to scroll back and forth e.g. from channel 199 to 409 to compare programming. Viewers can then utilize easy-to-use UP\/DOWN channel keys on the remote control to access interesting (predicted to be preferred) channels rather than the more cumbersome entering channel number or slow scrolling.","Current Program Guides are typically presented in the manner of Spread Sheets where each row corresponds to a program channel, numbered and named in a first column (or first two columns) with program titles in subsequent columns. They correspond to time slots, typically 30 minutes minimum, (though programs may extend for many columns) with the first time column containing programs for the current time. As time changes the time columns move to the left and off the display and new columns enter from the right. Program Guides do not typically offer the features of a spread sheet, but such features may be a useful addition.","The spread sheet graphics presentation agent examines each row in turn and re-writes the presented information with the rows in a different order more convenient or easier for the viewer. The presentation agent typically includes pre-canned re-sorting triggered by selecting a column item and clicking a labeled (e.g. Sort0>9 or SortA>Z ) GUI button e.g.:","(1) Sorting rows numerically according to a selected one of the columns, e.g. Channel Number in channel number first column (typical fixed format for program guides) or","(2) Sorting rows alphabetically according to a selected one of the columns e.g. Program Titles in a selected Time column.","In addition to typical spread sheet types, program guides can have additional useful features triggered by a specially labeled GUI button e.g.:","(3) Presentation of rows in order according to frequency of access to each row (TV channel) in the program guide. This is based on the ability to record and count the number of program guide accesses to each row in the program guide database over a time period and then sort according to that number.\n\n(4) Ability to select rows manually for presentation e.g. using a button on the remote control, where subsequent order of presentation is in order of selection.\n","Sorting types using program content description information (normally found in Personal TV systems and not in regular TV systems) may also be included. In this case the program information may add a third and normally unseen (Z) dimension to the program guide \u2018spread sheet\u2019. This Z-dimension program content description information may include LANGUAGE, GENRE.MAIN, GENRE.SUB, SUBJECT, PUBLISHER, PUBLICATION-DATE, CAST-LIST, and PREFERENCE-RATING. Invocation of this Z-dimension sorting is first by providing a 1st control button in the regular Program Guide GUI, for selecting a sort information parameter. When this button is pressed the program information content types (above) are shown to the viewer for selection e.g. GENRE, possibly shown in place of regular EPG or in a pop-up window over it. After this selection the GUI presentation switches back to the regular Guide display and the display is sorted for Genre based on the Current (1st) time column by default. If another column is selected then the sort is by Genre for that time column. At this time (after selecting Genre) the GUI presentation displays an informative note \u201cSort By GENRE\u201d selected active (and shown backlit) in a 2nd control button. Pressing this button cancels this special GUI mode (Sort by Genre) to go back to e.g. Sort by Channel Number. Toggling the \u201cSort By GENRE\u201d button reinstates and cancels the special mode.","(5) Program Guide row sorting can be alphabetically or numerically according to one of the Z dimension information items (Z-column) of the first or any time column, e.g. GENRE (Movie, Action), or SUBJECT, or spoken LANGUAGE, or PUBLISHER etc.","(6) Program Guide row sorting can be numerically according to one of the Z dimension information items (Z-column) of the first or any time column, e.g. by Program Preferences Rating number, where preference is that for the current viewer, or","(7) Taking the case of GENRE as an example, sorting can be across two Z-columns, initially amongst the Main-genre e.g. MOVIE, then Sub-genre e.g. ACTION. Sorting can be in combination with above types e.g. Numerically according to the viewer Program Preferences Rating number in conjunction with Genre type so the Program\/Channel row of the most popular Genre can be shown at the head of the presented list.\n\n(8) Channel rows corresponding to\n","(a) Channels where no programs have been watched for a certain monitoring period, or","(b) Channels where the summed preference rating for time periods columns presented or other (pre-defined) falls below a certain pre-set threshold, can be retired from the list so as not to clutter the guide presentation with unwanted information.","This feature may be implemented in Personal TV systems because they normally retain viewer program viewing history information data for determination of preference ratings. In this case a control button may be provided in the GUI to \u201cRestore all retired Channels\u201d. The button may be active and backlit when channels have been retired and can toggle the channel in\/out of the guide GUI.","Referring to , an alternative EPG presentation format may be depicted as a circular diagram or other type of \u201ctarget\u201d wherein the programs shown closer to the center or bulls-eye have a higher degree of correlation with the viewer's preferences. Time is not depicted in this type of EPG, but the viewer can select any program shown and a pop-up display provides relevant information for the program. In the embodiment shown, the diagram is subdivided into five areas, each denoted by a different color or shading and each containing programs belonging to a specific genre, e.g. movies or documentaries. The viewer can thus easily distinguish between various programs without having to invoke the pop-up display for each program presented and can concentrate on just the particular genre she wishes to view at the particular time.","In still another embodiment, the invention provides a Pause function that is engaged automatically when the viewer chooses to interact with an Interactive TV video segment that may impact the delivery schedule of subsequent video segments.","Such a \u2018One Touch Interact\u2019 feature may entail an application such as a software application residing in the TV, an STB, a computer controlling delivery of the video programming, a VCR\/PVR, or any other device functionally connected to the TV set. The application monitors the viewers interaction with the TV and, upon detecting that a video segment may run longer than originally scheduled due to the viewers interaction with it, automatically causes the PVR or other recording device connected to the TV to record the subsequent video information (i.e. programming) that is being broadcast to the TV. When the viewer has finished interacting with the chosen video segment, the PVR will automatically begin playing the subsequent, recorded programming with no scheduling discrepancy apparent to the viewer.","The method of the invention may be applied within different IT systems. One possibility is an IT system that provides two-way communication between the viewers TV and the cable network head-end. Thus, as the viewer commences interacting with the video segment, her choices are communicated to the head-end, which proceeds to provide alternative video information to the viewers TV while continuously broadcasting the subsequent, originally scheduled content. Although in such a system the head-end could also delay or advance the delivery of the subsequent video segments, providing such a service to millions of viewers would be impractical and costly in terms of head-end hardware. Providing the feature of the invention at each viewers TV set is a more practical and economical solution.","Another possibility entails downloading all alternative scenes provided by an interactive segment to be recorded by the PVR, which can then proceed to play back the appropriate scenes in accordance with the viewers interaction and selections. Such a system would not require two-way communication, and all interaction would be confined to the viewers TV and STB\/PVR system. In this manner, no information regarding the viewers interaction and selections would be transmitted outside of the viewers home, thus ensuring the viewers privacy.","In a preferred method of use of the method of the invention, when the viewer sees a video segment, e.g. a program or a commercial, that she wishes to interact with, she may press a single control button on the screen or TV remote control, and the controlling software application automatically executes to:","1) Automatically Pause the PVR replay (while TV program recording commences or continues); and","2) Launch the interactive environment along with any necessary communications.","When the viewer has finished interacting with the chosen video segment, she may once again press a single control button on the screen or remote-control and the controlling application automatically executes to:","1) Close the interactive environment and communications; and","2) Cause the PVR to play the recorded content from the point of the initial Pause.","Having now described the invention in accordance with the requirements of the patent statutes, those skilled in the art will understand how to make changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments to meet their specific requirements or conditions. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, as defined and limited solely by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 5","i":["a","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 9","i":["a","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 17(","i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 17(","i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 17(","i":"c"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 18(","i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 18(","i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 21","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 21","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 23","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 23","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 23","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 26(","i":["a","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIGS. 37-58"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
