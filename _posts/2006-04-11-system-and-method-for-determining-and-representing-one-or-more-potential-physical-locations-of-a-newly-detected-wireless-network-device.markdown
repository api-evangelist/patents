title: System and method for determining and representing one or more potential physical locations of a newly detected wireless network device
abstract: A previously unknown wireless device, which may be either an access point or a station, is detected by receipt of transmissions from that device at one or more access points that are currently operating within a managed wireless network. A graphic representation of the newly detected device is displayed in a region of a user interface external to a region containing a representation of the physical environment of the managed wireless network. A user selects a number of known access points from which an estimated distance to the newly detected device is to be determined and represented. A representation is generated of an estimated distance from each one of the selected number of access points, such as those access points that are estimated to be physically closest to the newly detected device, for example on the basis of signal strength with regard to transmissions from the newly detected device received at the known access points. The distance representations from the known access points may be provided using substantially circular “distance rings”, displayed in the region of the user interface containing a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The distance rings enable a user to may observe one or more distance ring intersections indicating one or more potential positions within the wireless network's physical environment at which the newly detected device may be located.

No. 10\/937,550, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,085,558 entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING AND REPRESENTING ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL PHYSICAL LOCATIONS OF A NEWLY DETECTED WIRELESS NETWORK DEVICE\u201d, filed Sep. 9, 2004, which is a Continuation in Part of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 7,043,277, entitled \u201cAUTOMATICALLY POPULATED DISPLAY REGIONS FOR DISCOVERED ACCESS POINTS AND STATIONS IN A USER INTERFACE REPRESENTING A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK DEPLOYED IN A PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT\u201d, and filed May 27, 2004, all disclosures of which are hereby included by reference herein.","The disclosed system relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more specifically to a system and method for determining and representing one or more potential physical locations of a newly detected wireless network device.","Wireless communication networks are becoming increasingly common for interconnecting many types of electronic devices. Computer systems of all sizes, personal digital assistants, input\/output devices, entertainment system components and other types of home appliances, are all examples of client station devices that are candidates for interconnection using a wireless communication network. Various specific wireless communication protocols have been developed. Examples of existing wireless communication protocols may be found in the family of standards for wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) known as IEEE 802.11, including the 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g wireless communication standards.","Generally, wireless networks include some number of access devices (referred to herein as \u201caccess points\u201d) that provide network access to some number of wireless client devices (referred to herein as \u201cstations\u201d). For example, an access point in a wireless network may be connected to a wired communication network, and client stations using the wireless network are provided wireless access to the wired network through the access point.","Existing systems for managing wireless networks have provided inconvenient, overly costly, and\/or inadequate tools for determining the physical position of a newly added, or newly operational, access points and\/or station. In general, a problem may arise when a new wireless device is added to a managed wireless network without notification of, and\/or permission from the manager of that network. The network manager may wish to locate such a \u201crogue\u201d device, in order to determine if it should be turned-off, disabled, reconfigured, etc. Similarly, the network manager may wish to find the physical location of a previously unknown wireless device that begins operation within the managed wireless network. The operation of such \u201crogue\u201d devices may compromise the overall security, and\/or performance of the wireless network.","In some existing systems, a significant number of \u201cprobe\u201d wireless devices must be installed at known positions within the wireless network in order to help a network manager determine the physical locations of all wireless devices. Such probe devices are costly, and the added cost to the overall network costs may be substantial. Moreover, such probe devices are incapable of simultaneously acting as probes and access points or station devices.","For the above reasons and others, it would be desirable to have a new system for determining the physical location of a wireless network device. The new system should be convenient and intuitive for use by a system manager, and not require the use of dedicated probe devices.","To address the above described and other shortcomings of existing systems, a method and system for determining and representing one or more potential locations of a newly detected wireless network device. The disclosed system first detects a wireless device, which may be either an access point or a station, by receiving transmissions from that device at one or more devices that are currently within the wireless network being managed. A graphic representation of the newly detected device is then provided in a predetermined region of a user interface, external to another region of the user interface containing a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The system then enables the user to select a number of known access points within the wireless network from which an estimated distance to the newly detected device is to be determined and represented. A representation is then generated of an estimated distance from each one of the selected number of access points, such as those access points that are estimated to be physically closest to the newly detected device. The estimations of distance between the newly detected device and the known access points may be made on the basis of signal strength with regard to transmissions from the newly detected device received at the known access points.","The representation of distance from each of the known access points to the newly added device may be provided using a substantially circular \u201cring\u201d, referred to herein for purposes of explanation as a \u201cdistance ring\u201d surrounding each of the known access points. The distance rings are displayed in the region of the user interface containing a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The distance rings may be displayed surrounding icon representations of the known access points, previously positioned over the representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed such that they correspond to physical locations of the known devices they represent.","After display of the distance rings, a user may observe one or more distance ring intersections. The distance ring intersections indicate one or more potential positions within the physical environment at which the newly detected device may be located. If the user desires more distance rings to be displayed, they can increase the number of known access points for which distance rings are to be generated. Similarly, if the number of distance rings being displayed is too great, the user can decrease the number of selected known access points.","Using the distance ring intersections, the user can then investigate the corresponding likely positions of the new device within the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The user may then, for example following sufficient confirmation of the new device's actual physical position, move the graphic representation of the new device into the region of the user interface in which a representation of the wireless network's physical environment is displayed. Alternatively, a network manager may wish to disable or remove the new device in order to eliminate potential or actual any adverse security or performance impact on the network.","In one embodiment, the distance rings may be displayed simultaneously with power range rings representing radio coverage ranges of the access point devices corresponding to the access point representations at their centers. In such a case, the distance rings are generated in a visually distinct manner with respect to the power range rings. For example, the width of the distance rings may be used to visually distinguish them from the power range rings, i.e. the distance rings may be substantially thicker than the power range rings.","Thus there is disclosed a new system for determining the physical location of a wireless network device. The disclosed system is advantageously convenient and intuitive for use by a system manager, and does not require the use of dedicated probe devices.","As shown in , an illustrative embodiment of the disclosed system includes a wireless communication network management software program  and a separate drawing software program  executing on a management station . The management station  may, for example, consist of any specific type of computer system, including one or more processors operable to execute program code stored in a computer program memory or other type of computer program storage device, and having a number of input\/output devices and interfaces. The management station  is communicably coupled to a wired network , which in turn is coupled to a number of wireless access point devices , shown for purposes of illustration as access points AP A, AP B, and AP C. The access point devices  provide wireless access to the wired network  to client station devices . The client station devices  are shown for purposes of illustration as client stations CS A, CS B, CS C, CS D, and CS E. The access point devices  and the client station devices  are shown within a wireless communication network . The wireless communication network  is accessible to and managed by the wireless communication network management program . The management station , and each of the access point devices  and client station devices  shown in  include hardware, firmware, and\/or software implemented functionality enabling them to communicate using one or more networking protocols to exchange information, such as messages or packets.","During operation of the embodiment shown in , the wireless communication network management program  uses graphical user interface software (GUI SW)  to provide a user interface output . The output  includes a graphical representation of the radio frequency domain characteristics of one or more devices in the wireless communication network , in combination with a graphical representation of the physical space in which the wireless communication network  is deployed. In order to generate the output , the wireless communication network management program  communicates with the drawing program  through an application programming interface (API) . For example, display objects , commands and\/or other data may be communicated between the wireless communication network management program  and the drawing program . An electronic, computer readable representation  of the physical space , such as a data file or other type of electronic document, is stored by or within the drawing program . In an illustrative embodiment, the drawing program  consists of a copy of the Visio\u00ae drawing program provided by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","20","50"]},"At step , the disclosed system operates to discover the access point and client station devices in the wireless communication network being managed. For example, the wireless communication network may be associated with a predetermined subnet mask, and that subnet mask may be used to discover devices on the wireless network that match the subnet mask. Such wireless network device discovery may be performed using techniques such as the PING (Packet Internet Groper) utility, which check for all responding device IP (Internet Protocol) addresses corresponding to the predetermined subnet mask. In addition, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) may, for example, then be used for translating IP addresses into the 6-byte Ethernet addresses of the discovered devices.","After the disclosed system has discovered a device on the wireless communication network, a request message, such as an SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) request message, is sent to that device to determine whether the device is manageable by the wireless communication network management program  of . Devices that return a positive response are sent further request messages to determine characteristics and settings of the devices. Such characteristics and settings may be obtained, for example, through values stored in the Management Information Base (MIB) of the devices, and include indications of characteristics and settings such as transmit power settings and lists of associated client stations for access points.","At step , the disclosed system operates to combine representations of the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices with the physical space representation. As a result, the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices may be conveniently indicated to the user within the context of and at the same scale as the physical space representation. For example, the disclosed system may operate by creating one or more wireless device radio frequency domain representations in one or more graphical \u201clayers\u201d defined using the drawing program , that may be superimposed over the physical space representation in a user interface display.","The wireless communication network management program  subsequently operates to periodically send further request messages to the access point devices discovered in step , in order to monitor their radio frequency domain characteristics and settings, such as current transmit power settings and associated client station lists. Any changes detected using these requests may then be used to modify radio frequency domain representations of the wireless network devices that are layered over the physical space representation  in the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["60","62","64","66","60","60","62"]},"As shown in , access point representation  has an associated power range ring . The multi-band access point representation  represents a single corresponding access point device having multiple radio frequency band capabilities, and includes conjoined access point representations  and , each having the same visual appearance as representations of single radio frequency band capable access point devices. For example, the access point representation  may represent the IEEE 802.11a radio frequency band circuitry within the multi-band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation , and the access point representation  may represent the IEEE 802.11g radio frequency band circuitry within the multi-band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation .","The conjoined access point representations  and  each have respective associated power range rings  and . The areas within the power range rings ,  and  represent radio coverage ranges of the access point devices corresponding to the access point representations at their centers. The greater the diameter of a power range ring, the larger the area of the radio coverage range it represents.","The thickness of each of the power range rings , , and  represents the potential bandwidth that can be provided by the associated access point devices to client stations located within them. A thicker power range ring indicates a relatively larger amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring, while a thinner power range ring indicates a relatively lower amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring. The appearances of the access point representations and associated power range rings are further indicative of the radio frequency channels on which the corresponding access point devices are currently operating. For example, the access point representation  may be displayed in a first predetermined color associated with a corresponding radio frequency channel, indicating that the corresponding access point device is operating within that radio frequency channel.","Similarly, since the multi-band access point representation  may correspond to a \u201cdual mode\u201d access point device, thus including two independent sets of radio circuitry, each of which can independently operate using a separate radio frequency band. Accordingly, each of the conjoined access point representations  and , and their associated power range rings may be represented to visually indicate the respective colors associated respectively with two different radio frequency channels that currently being used by the corresponding access point.","Each access point representation may further include textual information. For example, the access point representation  includes text  indicating the specific channel (\u201c\u201d) that the corresponding access point device is currently operating on, text  indicating the wireless LAN protocol used (\u201ca\u201d for 802.11a) by the corresponding access point device, and the last three characters of the MAC (Media Access Control) address (\u201c\u201d) of the corresponding access point.","The specific appearance, such as diameter, width, color and textual information, for each access point representation and associated power range ring may be determined in part response to configuration and setting information determined from the corresponding devices, for example by way of SNMP requests for MIB values stored in the devices. Such configuration information may include the type of wireless communication protocol supported and\/or enabled in the device, such as one of the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b or 802.11g protocols. The configuration and setting information determined from the devices may also include a current transmit power setting for the device, current channel, or other information that may be used to determine the appearance of the access point representations and power range rings. User provided information may also or alternatively be used to determine in part or completely how the access point representations and power range rings are represented, as described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["60","80","82","70","84","86","88","74","72","72","88","74","72","92","90","76","72","90","76","72","94","64"]},"The association lines provided between the client station and access point representations of  are formatted to visually indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding access point and client station devices, as well as the currently selected radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices.

In such an embodiment, a relatively thick association line may be used to represent a relatively large amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices, while a relatively thin association line may be used to represent a relatively small amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices. Similarly, the format of the association lines in  may be used to visually indicate a current radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations the connect.

The automatic client station placement button  enables a user to indicate that representations of client stations should be automatically placed in physical proximity to the representations of the access point devices with which they are associated. The channel representation buttons  enable a user to indicate how radio frequency channels currently in use should be represented in the device representations, power range rings, and association lines. For example, different radio channels may be distinctly represented by respective ones of a set of \u201cCRT\u201d colors, respective ones of a set of \u201cLCD\u201d colors, or by corresponding line formats in black and white patterns. The association line thickness check box  enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of association lines should be used to represent the relative amount of available bandwidth between associated devices. The association line thickness value field  enables a user to indicate an association line thickness to be used if the association line thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth between associated devices. The power range ring thickness check box  enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of displayed power range rings is to be used to indicate the amount of bandwidth available to client station devices within them.

A relatively small selected transmit power value in column  results in relatively smaller diameter power range rings, while a relatively large selected transmit power value in column  results in relatively larger diameter power range rings. This reflects the fact that a higher transmit power enables the radio signals from the wireless devices associated with the power range rings to carry greater amounts of data over greater distances. Accordingly, the disclosed system determines a diameter for each power range ring that corresponds to the distance in the physical space representation, based on scale information provided by the user, that would reflect the throughputs shown for the corresponding transmit power in the selected row. For example, if the radio button for \u221264 dBm were selected, and a device is being represented that uses IEEE 802.11b technology, the disclosed system generates power range rings having a diameter equal to the distance, in the scale of the physical space representation, that could be traversed using a transmit power of \u221264 DBm, and providing a maximum throughput of 11 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11b protocol. If the device being represented is an IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g device, the generated ring would have a diameter equal to the distance, in the scale of the physical space representation, that could be traversed using a transmit power of \u221264 DBm, and providing a maximum throughput of 54 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g protocols.","Similarly, the thickness of each power range ring decreases as the power range ring diameter increases, reflecting a smaller amount of available bandwidth within the area of the physical space representation within the power range ring. Accordingly, the values in columns ,  and  increase as the amount of transmit power in column  increases. For example, if the radio button in column  corresponding to \u221264 dBm is selected, the generated power range rings would have a relatively smaller thickness indicative of 11 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11b protocol devices, and a relatively greater thickness indicative of 54 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g protocol devices. Thus the thickness of each power range ring may be responsive to a user selected amount of radio signal attenuation, and reflects the distance in the physical space representation corresponding to the diameter of the power range ring, and the type of communication protocol used by the associated wireless device. The user may also select the bottom of the six radio button in the column , and then enter a value in dBm from \u221225 to \u221299 in the adjacent box.

The estimated distance may, for example, be determined based on measured signal strengths of one or more transmissions from the newly detected wireless device received by the known access points associated with the respective distance rings.","It will be recognized that even if a newly detected device is not manageable with network management software used to manage the deployed wireless communication network, it will still be heard by previously deployed access points, which will be able to report the channel on which the device is transmitting to the management system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["302","300","304","312","300","312","312"]},"As shown in , the portion  of user interface display includes a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless communication is deployed. Thus a user can determine potential physical locations of the newly discovered device from where the distance ring  is displayed over the representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed.","A power range ring  is further shown in  for the access point device corresponding to the access point representation . A dotted line  is shown connecting the access point representation  with the detected wireless device representation . The detected wireless device representation  has been moved, for example by way of a user dragging and dropping it, from its initial display within the access point display region where it initially was displayed when it was discovered. In the example of , the detected wireless device representation  corresponds to a \u201cdual mode\u201d access point device, thus including two independent sets of radio circuitry, each of which can independently operate using a separate radio frequency band. Accordingly, one of the conjoined access point representations is shown  having an associated power range ring . The communication channel on which the known access point has received transmissions from the newly detected wireless device may be displayed, for example, using the color of the distance ring . Another representation  of a dual mode access point is shown also including two conjoined access point representations, one of which is indicated  with a power range ring .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 24","FIG. 24","FIG. 24"],"b":["320","328","326","336","334","326","322","328","324","328","322","326","324","330","332","334","336","326","328","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["340","340","342","344"]},"Those skilled in the art will recognize that the physical characteristics of the execution environment for the wireless communication network being managed may have an impact on the likely physical locations of newly discovered devices provided by the disclosed system.
