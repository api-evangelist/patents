Description of the Related Art","In an information processing device which executes programs to perform various functions, the number of the functions of the information processing device can be increased or decreased according to the increase or decrease of the number of programs installed therein. Even after the information processing device is purchased, a user can use an additional desired function on the information processing device if a program which provides the desired function is purchased and installed in the information processing device.","As for some programs, activation of the programs in an information processing device must be performed at a time of installation of the programs, or after the time of the installation, in order to enable the functions provided by the programs to be effectively used on the information processing device. This activation is to perform an operation that licenses the user to use the program on the information processing device, or to generate license information that certifies the license and store the license information in a predetermined server or information processing device.

Because the starting information updating part  can update the starting information , if needed, management of an expiration date of the license file  and the sales package can be performed in a uniform manner.","Next, an example of management of an expiration date of a service package using a validity period, performed by the image forming device of an embodiment of the invention will be described.","There is a case where it is desired to designate an expiration date of a sales package by a predetermined validity date. For example, if an expiration date is set up at the time of shipment, a time lag between the shipment and the activation may arise, which causes inconvenience to the user.","To avoid the problem, the image forming device  of this embodiment is arranged to set up an expiration date of a sales package by a predetermined validity period.","The validity period may be registered in the license file . Alternatively, the validity period may be directly input by the user from the operation panel .

Therefore, it is possible to prevent the time lag between the shipment and the activation from arising, thereby improving the convenience to the user.","Next, an example of reminding a user of an expiration date performed by the image forming device of an embodiment of the invention will be described.","In the previous embodiment, the plug-in starter  does not start the function package if the expiration date is exceeded. If the user is notified prior to the expiration date that the expiration date is approaching, the user can understand that the expiration date will be reached.","In this embodiment, a date which is earlier than an expiration date by a predetermined period (called a remaining activation period) is set as the reminding date. Because the expiration date is set in the sales package information , the reminding date may be registered in the sales package information .

In the example of , the remaining activation period is set to \u201c30 days (about one month)\u201d.","For example, if the expiration date of the sales package is \u201c3\/31\u201d and the remaining activation period is subtracted from the expiration date, the reminding date is determined as being \u201c3\/1\u201d. If the reminding date \u201c3\/1\u201d is reached, the reminding of the expiration date to the user is performed. For this purpose, the reminding date\/time may be set exactly to \u201c0:00 a.m. of 3\/1\u201d.","The expiration date reminding part  registers the reminding date in the sales package information  so that the reminding date is stored. Because an expiration date is set up for each sales package, the reminding date is also registered for each sales package (which is stored with the association of the reminding date and the sales ID of the sales package).","The expiration date reminding part  may store as a constant the remaining activation period.

Warning Mail Request Is Sent).","In the warning mail, the expiration date is included in order to improve the convenience to the user. For this purpose, the expiration date reminding part  reads out from the sales package information  an expiration date of the sales package with which the reminding date is reached.","The expiration date reminding part  reads out from the HDD  an \u201ce-mail address of the user (or the administrator of the image forming device )\u201d, a \u201csubject name\u201d, and a \u201ctext\u201d which are stored beforehand therein. The expiration date reminding part  adds the expiration date and the name of the sales package, read from the sales package information , to the expiration date item in the text. The expiration date reminding part  sends these information items to the e-mail application , and the e-mail application  transmits the warning mail according to the communication protocol, such as SMTP, via the NIC .","An example of the warning mail is illustrated in . This warning mail depicts that the expiration date of \u201csales package \u201cAAA\u201d is 3\/31 and that the updating of the expiration date before that date is requested. Alternatively, the warning mail may depict that the expiration date of sales package \u201cAAA\u201d will be reached in 30 more days\u201d. In this case, the remaining activation period is notified to the user.","In this embodiment, the user is notified of the expiration of a service package before the expiration date is exceeded, thereby improving the convenience to the user.","The warning mail may be transmitted on the reminding date at a particular time. After the reminding date is reached, the warning mail may be transmitted at intervals of a given period (for example, in every week).

When the current date\/time from the system clock of the image forming device  is earlier than the date of creation of the license file  by a predetermined time, the activation is determined as a failure. Even if the contract term is defined by an expiration date, the service package may be illegally used beyond the expiration date by slowing the system clock of the image forming device . This embodiment is adapted to avoid the problem.","As described above, the license file  is created by the license server , and the date the license file  is created by the license server  is the date of creation of the license file .
