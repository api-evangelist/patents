title: Internet-based system for managing and delivering consumer product information to consumers along points of presence along the world wide web (WWW), using consumer product information (CPI) requesting and graphical user interface (GUI) displaying subsystems, driven by server-side components embodying universal product numbers (UPNS) and driven by UPN/URL links managed by product manufacturer team members and/or their agents
abstract: Method of and system for delivering consumer product related information to consumers over the Internet. The system and method involves creating an UPN-encoded Consumer Product Information (CPIR) enabling Serviet for each consumer product registered within a manufacturer-managed UPN/URL database management subsystem. Each CPIR-enabling Serviet is encapsulated within an executable file and then stored in the UPN/URL database management system. Each CPIR-enabling Serviet is searchable and downloadable by, for example, (1) retailers purchasing products from an electronic-commerce enabled product catalog, (2) advertisers desiring to link consumer product information to Web-based product advertisements, or (3) anyone having a legitimate purpose of disseminating such information within the stream of electronic commerce. After downloading and extraction from its encapsulating file, the CPIR-enabling Servlet is embedded within an HTML-encoded document associated with, for example, an EC-enabled store, on-line auction site, product advertisement, Internet search engine or directory, and the like. Upon encountering such a Servlet-encoded HTML document on the WWW, the consumer need only perform a single mouse-clicking operation to automatically execute its underlying CPIR-enabling Servlet, causing a UPN-directed search to be performed against the manufacturer-defined UPN/URL database management subsystem, and the results thereof displayed in an independent Java GUI, without disturbing the consumer's point of presence on the WWW. Preferably, the CPIR-enabling Servlets are realized using Javaâ„¢ technology, although it is understood that alternative technologies can be used to practice the system and methods of the present invention.

Field of Invention","The present invention generally relates to a novel method of and system for collecting consumer-product related information and transmitting and delivering the same along the consumer-product supply and demand chain using the International Information Infrastructure (e.g. the Internet), and more particularly to a novel method of and system for delivering consumer product related information to consumers within retail environments using Internet-based information servers and sales agents.","2. Brief Description of the Prior Art","Dissemination of consumer-product information between manufacturers and their retail trading partners must be accurate and timely. The traditional methods of phone calls and faxes are time consuming and resource intensive. An electronic Universal Product Code (UPC) Catalog (i.e. database system), accessible 24 hours a day, is a solution. In 1988, QuickResponse Services (QRS), Inc. Of Richmond, Calif., introduced the first independent product information database, using the retail industry standard UPC numbering system. Today the QRSolutions\u2122 Catalog contains information on over 52 million products from over 1500 manufacturers. The QRSolutions Catalog is a Windows-based application providing a critical information flow link between the retailers and the manufacturers along the supply and demand chain.","After assigning a UPC number to each item, the manufacturer organizes and sends the data via an electronic data interchange (i.e. EDI) transmission, or a tape, to QRS, Inc. to be loaded into the UPC Catalog database. Changes to the data can be made on a daily basis. Retailers with access to a manufacturer's data can view and download the data once it has been added or updated. Automatic update capabilities ensure the most recent UPC data will be in the EDI mailbox of each retailer customer quickly.","The effect of a centralized database such as QRS's UPC Catalog improves the flow of merchandise from the manufacturer to the retailer's selling floor and ultimately to the consumer. With the UPC Catalog, accurate, up-to-date product information is available when the retailer needs it, eliminating weeks from the order cycle time.","In addition to the electronic UPC-based product information subsystem (i.e. UPC Catalog) described above, a number of other information subsystems have been developed for the purpose of providing solutions to problems relating to electronic commerce (EC) merchandising and logistics within the global supply chain. Such ancillary information subsystems include, for example: Sales, Analysis and Forecasting Subsystems for producing and providing retailers with information about what products consumers are buying; Collaborative Replenishment Subsystems for determining what products retailers can buy in order to satisfy consumer demand at any given point of time; and Transportation and Logistics Information Subsystems for producing and providing retailers with information about when products purchased by them (at wholesale) will be delivered to their stores. Typically, such information subsystems are connected to various value added information networks in order to efficiently offer such information services to retailers on a global basis.","While the above-described information systems collectively cooperate to optimize the process of moving raw materials into finished products and into the hands of consumers, such information systems fail to address the information needs of the consumers of retail products who require and desire product-related information prior to, as well as after, the purchase of consumer-products. Moreover, prior art demand chain management systems operate in an open-loop mode with a \u201cbreak\u201d in information flow cycle, disabling the manufacturers from communicating with the consumers in an efficient manner to satisfy consumer needs.","Presently, an enormous amount of time, money and effort is being expended by companies in order to advertise and sell their products and services, and to provide product related information, product warranty service and the like after product purchase has taken place. Various types of media for decades have been used to realize such fundamental business functions.","In recent times, there have been a number of significant developments in connection with the global information network called the \u201cInternet\u201d, which have greatly influenced many companies to create multi-media Internet Web-sites in order to advertise, sell and maintain their products and services. Examples of such developments include, for example: the World Wide Web (WWW) based on the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) by Tim Berners-Lee, et al. (See \u201cWorld-Wide Web: The Information Universe\u201d by Tim Berners-Lee, et al; easy to use Java GUI-based Internet navigation tools, such as the Netscape\u00ae browser from Netscape Communications, Inc., the Internet Explorer\u2122 browser from MicroSoft Corporation and the Mosaic\u2122 browser from Spyglass Corporation; and the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) by Mark Pecse. Such developments in recent times have made it very easy for businesses to create 2-D Hypermedia-based Home Pages and 3-D VR Worlds (i.e. 3-D Web-sites) for the purpose of projecting a desired \u201ccorporate image\u201d and providing a backdrop for financial investment solicitation, as well as product advertising, sales and maintenance operations.","Presently, a person desiring to acquire information about any particular product has a number of available search options. In particular, he or she may attempt to directly contact the manufacturer, wholesaler or reseller by telephone, US mail, e-mail, or through the company's World Wide Web-site (WWW), if they have one. In the event one decides to acquire product information through the seller's WWW site, he or she must first determine the location of its WWW site (i.e. Internet address) which oftentimes can involve using Internet Search engines such as Yahoo\u00ae, AltaVista\u2122, WebCrawler\u2122, Lycos\u2122, Excite\u2122, or the like. This can be a very time consuming process and can sometimes lead to a dead end. Once the Internet address is obtained, one must then review the home page of the company's Web-site in order to find where information about a particular product resides on the Website, if it so exists. This search process can be both time consuming and expensive (in terms of Internet time) and may not turn up desired information on the product of interest.","In some instances, product brochures bear a preprinted Internet address designed to direct or point prospective customers to a particular Web-site where more detailed product information can be found. A recent example of this \u201cpreprinted Web Address\u201d pointing technique is the 1996 product brochure published by the Sony Corporation for its Sony\u00ae PCV-70 Personal Computer, which refers prospective customers to the Sony Web Address \u201chttp:\/\/www.sony.com\/pc\u201d. While this approach provides a direct way of finding product related information on the Internet, it is not without its shortcomings and drawbacks.","In particular, when a company improves, changes or modifies an existing Web-site which publishes product and\/or service advertisements and related information, it is difficult (if not impossible) not to change the Internet locations (e.g. Web addresses) at which such product and\/or service advertisements and related information appear. Whenever a company decides or is forced to change any of its advertising, marketing and\/or public relations firms, there is a substantial likelihood that new Web-sites will be created and launched for particular products and services, and that the Web addresses of such new Web-sites will no longer correspond with the Web addresses on preprinted product brochures currently in circulation at the time. This can result in pointing a consumer to erroneous or vacant Web-sites, that present either old or otherwise outdated product and\/or service information, possibly adversely influencing the consumer's purchasing decision.","Moreover, when a company launches a new Web-site as part of a new advertising and marketing campaign for a particular product, any preprinted advertising or marketing material relating to such products will not reflect the new Web-site addresses which the campaign is promoting. This fact about preprinted advertising media renders it difficult to unify new and old advertising media currently in circulation into an advertising and marketing campaign having a coherent theme. In short, the inherently static nature of the \u201cpreprinted Web address\u201d pointing technique described above is wholly incapable of adjusting to the dynamic needs of advertising, marketing and public relations firms alike.","Recently, two different methods have been proposed for providing product information to consumers over the Internet.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,193 to Wellner disclose's a system and method for accessing and displaying Web-based consumer product related information to consumers using a Internet-enabled computer system, whereby in response to reading a URL-encoded bar code symbol on or associated with a product, the information resource specified by the URL is automatically accessed and displayed on the Internet-enabled computer system. While this system and method enables access of consumer product information related information resources on the WWW by reading URL-encoded bar code symbols, it requires that custom URL-encoded bar code symbols be created and applied to each and every consumer product in the stream of commerce.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,773 to Hudetz, et al discloses a solution to the problem presented by the system and method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,193, by proposing the use of a UPC\/URL database in order to translate UPC numbers read from consumer products by a bar code scanner, into the URLs of published information resources on the WWW relating to the UPC-labeled consumer product.","While U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,773 provides an effective solution to the problem presented by U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,193, it completely fails to recognize or otherwise address the myriad of problems relating to UPC\/URL-link collection, management, delivery, access and display along the retail supply and demand chain, which the system and method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,773 presents and must be first solved in order deliver a technically feasible, globally-extensive, UPC-driven consumer product information system for the benefit of consumers worldwide.","Thus, it is clear that there is great need in the art for an improved Internet-based method of and system for delivering product related information to the consumers along the entire retail supply and demand chain, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel method and apparatus for collecting product-related information and transmitting and delivering the same between the manufacturers and retailers of products to the consumers thereof in retail shopping environments as well as at home, work and on the road, while overcoming the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an apparatus in the form of a novel consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system with an Internet-based product information database subsystem which, for each commercially available consumer-product, stores a number of information elements including: the name of the manufacturer; the

(purchased by retailers at wholesale) will be delivered to the retailer's stores; and Input\/Output Port Connecting Subsystems  for interconnecting the input and output ports of the above-identified subsystems through the infrastructure of the Internet and various value-added EDI networks of global extent. Notably, unlike prior art supply chain management systems, the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of the present invention embraces the manufacturers, retailers, and consumers of UPC-encoded products, and not simply the manufacturers and retailers thereof. As will become apparent hereinafter, this important feature of the present invention allows manufacturers and retailers to deliver valuable product related information to the consumers of their products, thereby increasing consumer purchases, consumer satisfaction and consumer loyalty. Prior art supply chain management systems have no way or means of providing such information services to the consumers of UPC-encoded products along the consumer-product supply and demand chain.","As shown in  and -, the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of  is realized as an arrangement of system components, namely: a central UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  for storing and serving various types of consumer-product information to retailers, manufacturers and consumers alike (e.g., the name of the product's manufacturer; the Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN) assigned to the product by the manufacturer; one or more URLs specifying the location of information resources on the Internet at which particular kinds of information relating to the consumer-product can be found; merchandise classification; style number; tradename; information specifying the size, color and other relevant characteristics of the consumer-product, where applicable; ordering criteria; availability and booking dates, etc.); a globally-based (packet-switched) digital telecommunications network (such as the Internet)  having an infrastructure including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Network Service Providers (NSPs), routers, telecommunication lines, channels, etc., for supporting packet-switched type digital data telecommunications using the TCP\/IP networking protocol well known in the art; one or more Internet Product Finding Directory (IPD) Servers, each indicated by reference numeral  and being connected to the Internet at strategically different locations via the Internet infrastructure  and data-synchronized with each other in order that each such Server maintains a mirrored relational-type database structure as represented in ; a plurality of Internet Product-Information (IPI) Servers, each indicated by reference numeral  and being connected to the Internet via the Internet infrastructure; a plurality of retailer-related electronic-commerce (EC) information servers A, each operably connected to the infrastructure of the Internet, and enabling the hosting of one or more EC-enabled stores or EC-enabled on-line catalogues (i.e. EC-enabled WWW sites) owned, operated, managed and\/or leased by one or more retailers along the retail supply and demand chain; a plurality of manufacturer-related electronic-commerce (EC) information servers B, each operably connected to the infrastructure of the Internet, and enabling the hosting or one or more EC-enabled stores or EC-enabled on-line catalogues (i.e. EC-enabled WWW sites) owned, operated, managed and\/or leased by one or more manufacturers along the retail supply and demand chain; a plurality of User (or Client) Computers, each indicated by reference numeral , being connected to the Internet via the Internet infrastructure and available to consumers (C, C, C, . . . , C); one or more data communication (i.e. EDI) networks , comprising data collection nodes  and communication links , operably connected to the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , each Client Computer  available to a Manufacturer (M, M, M, . . . , M) and Retailer (R, R, R, . . . , R) within the retail supply and demand chain; a Web-based Document Server  connected to at least one of the IPD Servers  and the Internet infrastructure, for transferring documents and messages to remote Client Computer Systems during the registration of manufacturers and consumer products with the system hereof and periodically updating product-related information with the IPD Servers  in an automatic manner; and a Web-based Document Administration Computer  connected to the Web-based Document Server  by way of a TCP\/IP connection , for administrating the registration of manufacturers and products with the system, initiating the transfer of consumer product related information (e.g. menu of URLs) between the remote Client Computer Systems and Web-Based Document Server , transferring such information to the IPD Servers , and maintaining local records of such information transfers and the like. As will become apparent hereinafter, Web-based Document Server  and Web-based Document Administration Computer  provide a subsystem for (i) managing the process of registering qualified manufacturers and their consumer products and related Web pages (e.g. UPC numbers and URLs), and (ii) updating the product-related information with the IPD Servers  in an automatic manner to ensure accurate links between UPNs and URLs within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem. The subsystem comprising the Web-based Document Server  and Web-based Document Administration Computer  shall be referred to as the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem of the consumer product information finding and delivery subsystem  and indicated by reference numeral  throughout the figure drawings hereof.","Preferably, the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  and at least one of the IPD Servers  are located at a secured information storage\/processing center , along with a multiprocessor (or mainframe) computer system, information servers, routers, data communication lines, disk storage devices (e.g. RAIDs), tape drives and tape-library system, uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), and other peripheral technology to provide on-line, batch and back-up operations. However, the IPI Servers, the Client Computers and the other IPD Servers (if provided for database mirroring purposes), typically will be located throughout the world, as the distribution of manufacturers, retailers and consumers who are encouraged to use the system is scattered across the Planet.","In the illustrative embodiment, the Web-based Document Server  is a Windows NT Server running WebDox\u2122 Server software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif. The Windows NT Server can be realized using a suitable computer system having a Pentium\u00ae or higher CPU, 64 MB of RAM or higher, running (i) Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or higher Operating System software from Microsoft Corporation, (ii) Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 or higher from Microsoft Corporation, and (iii) Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or higher software from Microsoft Corporation. Also, the WebDox\u2122 Server is provided with a dedicated Internet connection (i.e. ISDN or better) to the Internet infrastructure .","The EDI administration computer  is either a Windows 95 or Windows NT Computer system running WebDox Admin\u2122 software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif. The Windows 95 or Windows NT computer system  can be realized using a suitable computer system having an Intel 486 or higher CPU, 12 MB of RAM or higher, running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or higher, and having a TCP\/IP connection  to the WebDox\u2122 Server .","In order to use the WebDox\u2122 system, each remote Client Computer System  includes either a Windows 95 or Windows NT Computer system running WebDox Remote\u2122 software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif. The Windows 95 or Windows NT computer system  can be realized using a suitable computer system having an Intel 486 or higher CPU, 16 MB of RAM or higher, and a VGA monitor or better, and running (i) Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT 3.51 or higher Operating System (OS) software, and (ii) Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher from Microsoft Corporation. Also, the WebDox Remote\u2122 Server is provided with a dial-up Internet connection (i.e. 14,400 bps or better) to the Internet infrastructure. The function of the Web-based Document Server , Web-based Administration System  and remote client subsystems  running the Premenos\u00ae WebDox Remote\u2122 software is to provide a Web-based Document Transport System for automatically transferring information (e.g. UPN\/URLs) from manufacturers to the IPD Servers of the system in order to periodically update the same. While the illustrative embodiment of this Web-based Document Transport System has been described in terms of its implementation using the WebDox\u2122 system from Premenos, it is understood that other commercially available electronic document transport systems (e.g. COMMERCE:FORMS\u2122 Electronic Business Forms Package from Sterling Commerce, Inc., http:\/\/www.stercomm.com) can be used to carry out this subsystem. The operation of this Web-Based Document Transport System will be described in detail hereinafter with respect to the collection and delivery of consumer product-related information to the IPDs hereof.","The major subsystem components comprising the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of the present invention will be described in greater detail below.","In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the UPC Product-Information Subsystem  is realized using the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  and data communication networks  shown in  and -. Preferably, the product procurement services delivered by the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  are provided by modifying the prior art QRSolutions UPC Catalog currently implemented by QuickResponse Services, Inc., so that this subsystem includes the database structures (i.e. information fields and data elements) of the IPD Database Server  which are neither found in nor suggested by the prior art QRSolutions UPC Catalog. The structure and operation of the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem and IPD Server of the present invention will be described in greater detail hereinafter. The information services supported by the UPC Product-Information Subsystem  include those provided by the prior art QRSolutions UPC Catalog, and also a number of additional information services that can be used to carry out Product Registration within the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention. These additional information services will be described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to .","The Electronic Trading Information Subsystem  is realized using the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , Client Computer Systems  and data communication networks  of the technology platform shown in  and -. Preferably, the inventory procurement services delivered by the Electronic Trading Subsystem  are provided by the prior art QRSolutions Econnect and Electronic Data Interchange Services currently being implemented by QuickResponse Services, Inc.","Sale Analysis and Forecasting Information Subsystem  is realized using information storage\/processing center , Client Computer Systems , and the data communication networks  of the enabling technology platform shown in  and -.

Preferably, the product inventory management services delivered by the Collaborative Replenishment Information Subsystem  are provided by the prior art QRSolutions Replenishment Services currently being implemented by QuickResponse Services, Inc.","The Transportation and Logistics Information Subsystem  is realized using information storage\/processing center , Client Computer Systems , and the data communication networks  of the enabling technology platform shown in  and -. Preferably, the product distribution management services delivered by the Transportation and Logistics Information Subsystem  are provided by the prior art QRSolutions EDI and Logistics Management Services currently being implemented by QuickResponse Services, Inc.","In the illustrative embodiment of the system of the present invention, each Client Computer Subsystem  has a conventional Java GUI-based web browser program (e.g. Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mosaic, etc.) with a plug-in type module, such as CyberFinder\u2122 navigational software by Aladdin Systems, Inc., of Watsonville, Calif., that provides an on-screen graphical icon for a \u201cIPI Web-site Find\u201d function. An exemplary display screen  produced by such a Java GUI-based web browser program is set forth in . Alternatively, the URL of the home page of the IPI Web-site can be recorded as a browser \u201cbookmark\u201d for easy recall and access through a conventional Java GUI-based Internet browser. Once at the home page of the IPI Web-site, an Internet user can find product-related information on the Internet in essentially the same way as when using the web browser program of . As shown, the on-screen radio button  functions as an \u201cIPI Web-site Find\u201d Button (or Consumer Product Information Button) for instantly connecting the client subsystem to a particular IPI Web-site (i.e. hosted on each mirrored IPD Server) and especially adapted for carrying out the IPI finding and serving method of the present invention. As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, examples of \u201cIPI Web-sites\u201d can include, but are not limited to: (1) one or more mirrored UPC Request Central Web-sites from which consumer product information from all manufacturers is available for access to consumers from predetermined Internet domains; and (2) an UPC Request Retail Web-site, for each retailer, wherein consumer product information associated with only manufacturers of products offered by the retailer is available for access to consumers from predetermined Internet domains within physical retail \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d stores and \u201celectronic commerce enabled stores.","In general, each IPI Web-site can be sponsored by a retail store subscribing to the consumer product information service hereof, or by one or manufacturers and\/or service providers. The URL for the home page of any particular IPI Web-site can be selected with marketing considerations in mind, for example, \u201chttp:\/\/www.ipf.com\u201d or \u201chttp:\/\/www.upcrequest.com\u201d similar in form with the URLs of other information search-engines and directories currently available on the Internet. Upon selecting the IPI Web-site Find Button  (e.g. by a clicking of the mouse thereon shown in ), the user is automatically connected to the home-page of the IPI Web-site (hosted on each mirrored IPD Server) which, as shown in , supports a Netscape-style \u201cframework\u201d, within which web pages accessed through the IPI web-site are displayed. An excellent tutorial on \u201cframing\u201d entitled \u201cThe Netscape Frames Tutorial\u2122 (2nd edition)\u201d by Charlton D. Rose set forth at the URL: \u201chttp:\/\/www.newbie.net\/frames\/\u201d, last visited by Applicant on Mar. 26, 1997.","In general, the HTML-encoded documents served from the IPD Servers  hereof to the client subsystems  hereof will preferably have a three-field Netscape-style display framework which provides a unique and effective way of satisfactorily addressing the needs of consumers, hosting retailers, manufacturers and the IPI provider(s)\/publishers alike. In practice, the Netscape-style browser \u201cframework\u201d can simultaneously accommodate the needs of the consumers using the particular Client Subsystems of the present invention, as well as the needs of the retailers who typically will host client subsystems hereof either (1) physically within their stores, and\/or (2) electronically on their WWW sites using Web browser framing techniques as well.","As shown in , the first (top-most) display field, the sponsor frame A, can be used to display to the consumer, a Web page (e.g. HTML-encoded document) containing a message that the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is being delivered to the consumer by the IPI Provider under, for example, the sponsorship of either: (1) the hosting retailer; (2) one or more advertisers posting advertising \u201cbanners\u201d in the display frame A; or (3) the consumer himself\/herself by paying a subscription fee or the like. Understandably, the method of sponsorship employed will vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present invention. An exemplary message for this display screen might read, for example, as follows:\n\n\u201cWelcome to the UPC Request\u2122 Consumer Product-Information Finding and Serving System Sponsored by RETAILER X for your Shopping Convenience and Pleasure.\u201d\n\nThe height of the sponsor frame A need only be a small fraction of the consumer's display screen (e.g. \u00be inches) to convey this message to the consumers during use of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention within the retailer's real (or virtual\/electronic) shopping environment.\n","As shown in , the second (left-most) display field, the control frame B, is used to display an HTML-encoded document containing a Java GUI-based \u201ccontrol panel\u201d  for the consumer product information finding and serving subsystem of the present invention. In the illustrative embodiment, this control panel  includes six Check Box type buttons, namely: a first Check Box type button A which, when selected, automatically activates the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of the subsystem; a second Check Box type button B which, when selected, automatically activates the Manufacturer Website Search Mode of the subsystem; a third Check Box type button C which, when selected, automatically activates the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of the subsystem; a fourth Check Box type button D which, when selected, automatically activates the Trademark-Directed Search Mode; a fifth Check Box type button E which, when selected, automatically activates the Product-Description Directed Search Mode of operation of the subsystem; and a sixth Check Box type button F which, when selected, automatically activates the UPC-Encoded-Applet-Download\/Distribution Mode of operation of the subsystem. Each of these Check Box type buttons is hot-linked to a particular HTML-encoded document residing on the IPD Server(s)  of the subsystem hereof.","While the IPI Web-site of the illustrative embodiment has a framework characterized by three-display fields, namely, the sponsor frame A, the control frame B, and the information display frame C, it is understood, however, that there may be more or fewer display frames than that shown in . Each frame will act as a separate display screen where variables such as web-pages, scrolling, page colors, etc., are independently controllable.","As will become apparent hereinafter, one of the primary functions of the client subsystems  hereof is to provide UPN-driven consumer product information (CPI) GUIs within both \u201cphysical \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail stores\u201d and \u201cE-commerce\u201d enabled retail stores and product catalogues. Hereinafter, UPN-driven CPI GUIs provided within physical retail shopping environments will be referred to as \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cphysically-based\u201d UPN-driven CPI kiosks, whereas UPN-driven CPI GUIs provided within E-commerce enabled retail shopping environments will be referred to as \u201ccyber\u201d UPN-driven CPI kiosks, despite the fact that these devices may provide the substantially the same type of consumer product information services to consumers, retailers and manufacturers along the retail supply and demand chain.","Physically-based UPN-driven CPI consumer product information kiosks will have great utility in physical retail shopping environments. However, such subsystems will be of little value to consumers browsing the Internet and shopping at EC-enabled WWW sites, unless they are located in \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d type retail stores wherein consumers are provided with the option of shopping and conducting e-commerce transactions therein for all or selected items of merchandise offered for sale by the retailer. Moreover, when shopping in any particular retailer's EC-oriented store, however realized, it is also understood that great efforts must be undertaken to ensure that the shopper does not leave the EC-oriented store prior to making a purchase at the checkout page of the EC-oriented WWW site. Requiring, prompting or otherwise encouraging a shopper to link over to the IPD WWW site hereof (e.g. hosted on the IPD information server) for desired consumer product related information oftentimes presents a great risk that the shopper will not return to the EC-oriented store, at which he or she was once visiting, but rather will visit another EC-oriented store to make the product purchase.","The above limitations of physically-based consumer product information kiosks and the risks associated with consumer behavior while shopping on the Internet are overcome by the UPN-based cyber kiosks of the present invention. The primary function of UPN-based cyber CPI kiosks is to provide consumers with a simple and effective way of and means for producing UPN-driven CPI graphical user interfaces (GUIs) at the consumer's point of presence (POP) which may exist, for example, when: (i) shopping at EC-enabled stores, product catalogs and other types of EC-oriented WWW sites; (ii) reviewing and responding to Internet-based product advertisements (including Web-based discount coupons and the like) published at selected sections of Web-documents served from diverse types of WWW sites hosted on the millions of Internet information servers connected to the infrastructure of the Internet; and\/or (iii) encountering a Web-document addressing a particular consumer product under review, analysis or other form of observation where accurate consumer product related information is desired or required by the consumer, whomever they might be. The details of producing UPN-enabled CPI GUIs in both physical and cyber retail environments will be described hereinafter.","As shown in , each synchronized IPD Server  is interfaced with an ISP A in a conventional manner. The actual number of IPD Servers  used in any particular application will depend on various factors including, for example, user demand, Internet traffic conditions, network router capacity and performance, etc. Each such IPD Server  is assigned a static IP address and a common domain name on the Internet according to the Domain Name System (DNS) well known in the art. Data synchronization among such databases can be achieved using conventional data synchronization techniques well known in the art. In addition, a backup and mirroring program can be used to maintain data security. Preferably, the synchronized IPD Servers are maintained by a team of network managers under the supervision of one or more webmasters.","As shown in FIGS. B through B, using presently known technology available for use on the WWW, there are at least four different ways of configuring IPD Server  and back-end UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  of the illustrative embodiment. These four different subsystem architectures are schematically depicted in FIGS. B through B.","In the system architectures shown in FIGS. B through B, client-side Applets (\u201cApplets\u201d), having their <APPLET> HTML tags embedded within HTML documents (e.g. using the HTML 3.2 Specification), are executed with Java-enabled browsers on the client-side of the information network. In the system architecture set forth in FIG. B, server-side Applets (\u201cServlets\u201d), having their <SERVLET> HTML tags embedded within HTML documents (e.g. the HTML 3.2 Specification), are executed within Java-enabled Web servers on the server-side of the information network. Collectively, client-side Applets and server-side Applets shall be referred to as \u201cApplets\u201d, wherein the major distinction between these two types is based on where the Applet is executed on the network (i.e. client-side or server side).","In each of these four system architectures, the IPD Server  performs a number of basic functions, for example: (1) serving HTML-encoded documents associated with IPD Web-sites (e.g. UPC Request Central WWW site, UPC Request Retail WWW sites, etc.) to client subsystems  on the Internet so as to enable the six primary modes of operation of the consumer product information finding and delivery subsystem hereof including, but not limited to, access to consumer product related information stored within the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases on the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem ; as well as (2) serving Libraries of executable files containing \u201cUPN-enabled Java Applet tags\u201d for client-side Applets as well as server-side Applets also known as \u201cServlets\u201d, so as to enable retailers, manufacturers, advertisers, et al to download the executable \u201cApplet tag containing\u201d file to client subsystems.","According to the first system architecture shown in FIG. B, the UPN\/URL Database management Subsystem  is realized by a SQL-based RDBMS server , whereas the IPD server  is realized by a Java Web Server \u2032, provided with Java servlet support, and operably connected to the RDBMS server  by way of high-speed digital transmission link known in the art. During system operation, the Java Web Server \u2032 serves to a Java-enabled client subsystem , an HTML-encoded document containing a servlet HTML tag <SERVLET> which, upon selection by a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer, sends an http request to the Java Web Server \u2032, invoking a prespecified UPN-encoded servlet stored therewithin, causing the CPIR-enabling servlet to execute on the server-side of the network. This causes the servlet to call and run certain predefined Java methods which carry out a UPN-specified CPI search on the RDBMS server  and return the search results to the client subsystem  for display within a predetermined GUI generated therewithin. Using this system architecture, each UPN-encoded servlet executed within the Java Web Server \u2032 will contain information relating to (1) the UPN-specified consumer product on which product information is to be searched for within the RDBMS server , and (2) licensing information relating to whom the CPIR-enabling servlet has been licensed (although this architecture does not enable easy enforcement of the granted license as the servlet is executed on the server side of the network.","According to the second system architecture shown in FIG. B, the UPN\/URL Database management subsystem  is realized by a SQL-based RDBMS server , whereas the IPD server  is realized by a Java Web Server \u2033, providing Java Applet support and being operably connected to the RDBMS Server  by a high-speed digital data transmission link known in the art. During system operation, the Java Web Server \u2033 serves to the Java-enabled client subsystem , an HTML-encoded document containing a \u201cUPN-encoded\u201d Applet HTML tag <APPLET> which, upon selection by a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer, causes the CPIR-enabling Applet to execute on the client-side of the network, sending an http request to the Java Web Server \u2033, invoking a prespecified Common Gateway Interface (CGI) stored within the Java Web Server \u2033. This causes the Applet to call and CGI to run certain predefined methods for carrying out a UPN-specified CPI search on the RDBMS server  and returning the search results to the client subsystem  for display within a predetermined GUI prespecified within the Applet. Using this system architecture, each UPN-encoded Applet executed within the Java browser of the client machine  will contain information relating to (1) the UPN-specified consumer product on which product information is to be searched for within the RDBMS server , and (2) licensing information relating to whom the client-side Applet has been licensed and by whom the Applet may be served within the terms of the licensing program, etc.","According to the third system architecture shown in FIG. B, the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  is realized by a SQL-based RDBMS server , whereas the IPD server  is realized by a Java Web Server \u2032\u2033, providing client-side Applet support, and being operably connected to the RDBMS server  by way of a high-speed digital data transmission link known in the art. During system operation, the Java Web Server \u2032\u2033 serves to the Java-enabled client subsystem , an HTML-encoded document containing a UPN-encoded Applet HTML tag <APPLET> which, upon selection by a single-mouse clicking operation by the consumer, causes the Applet to execute on the client-side of the network, creating a \u201csocket-type\u201d connection at lower (TCP\/IP) communication layers between the client subsystem  and Java Web Server \u2032\u2033, enabling the Java Web Server \u2032\u2033 to run certain predefined Java methods for carrying out a UPN-specified CPI search on the RDBMS server , and returning the search results to the client subsystem  for display within a GUI prespecified within the Applet.

In this illustrative embodiment, the client computer subsystem embodied within the kiosk includes a 2-way RF communication link with its I\/O port and a network hub associated with an IP network mounted within the retail shopping environment of concern. A wireless spread-spectrum communication subsystem including base station  and network adapter cards, such as the Symbol Spectrum  wireless LAN by Symbol Technologies, Inc. can be used to realize the 2-Way RF communication link in a manner known in the communications network art. Such a wireless LAN provides (i) transportability with retail shopping environments for convenience of shoppers, as well as (ii) Internet access to the IPI Web-sites of the present invention (i.e. hosted on mirrored IPD Servers ). By strategically placing the access points within the retail environment, the Symbol Spectrum  wireless LAN makes it possible to create a wireless bridge between a wired (IP-based) LAN within the retail environment (operably connected to the Internet by an ISP) and any number of shopping cart supported kiosks, as well as fixed mounted kiosks, and transportable Internet access terminals lent to consumers for use within the retail shopping environment.","In alternative embodiments, any Client Computer  can be realized as a network computer (NC), a Web-TV\u2122 type Internet Terminal, a Newton MessagePad\u00ae PDA, or any other device providing Internet access to the IPI Web-site (i.e. mirrored IPD Servers) of the present invention. Notably, the same functionalities provided within the Web-based kiosk described above can be embodied with such alternative embodiments of client computer system.","For example, as shown in FIG. A, the client computer subsystem  can be realized as a transportable hand-held computer, such as the Newton\u00ae Model 130 Messagepad 70 from Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., provided with NetHopper\u2122 brand Internet Access (http-client) Software which supports the TCP\/IP networking protocol within the Newton MessagePad operating system, as well as the client-side of http, as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,905,251 incorporated herein by reference. Notably, the NetHopper\u2122 brand Internet Access (http-client) Software  provides the Newton Model 130 Messagepad with an integrated JAVA GUI-based web browser program for WWW access in a manner know in the Internet access art. As shown in FIG. A, the Newton Messagepad has a display panel , touch-screen type keypad , and programmed laser scanning bar code symbol reader  (e.g., Metrologic ScanQuest\u00ae Laser Scanning Module Model No. IS4120), integrated within the hand-held device as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,905,251. The function of bar code symbol scanner  is to read UPC or UPC\/EAN symbols on consumer products and to produce symbol character data representative of the numbers encoded within such standardized bar code structures. The Newton Messagepad Model 130, denoted by reference numeral , is also equipped with a Motorola PCMCIA-based modem card  having a RF transceiver for establishing a wireless digital communication link with either a cellular base station or one or more satellite-base stations  connected to the Internet by way of an ISP or NSP A in a manner well known in the global information networking art. As such, a first wireless digital communication link  is established between the Newton Messagepad 130 and cellular (or satellite) base stations , and a second digital communications link  is established between the base station  and the ISP or NSP associated with the infrastructure of the Internet. Accordingly, this embodiment of the client computer subsystem of the present invention is completely mobile (i.e. transportable and provide the consumer access to the Internet and all of its information resources on the WWW and elsewhere, provided that the device maintains its wireless digital communication link with base station , distributed through the globe, making access to the IPD servers hereof possible at home, in the office, within retail stores, as well as on the road wherever that may be.","As shown in FIG. A, the Newton MessagePad, ScanQuest\u00ae Laser Scanning Module  and auxiliary battery supply (not shown) are completely housed within a rubberized shock-proof housing , in order to provide a hand-supportable unitary device  of rugged construction. This hand-held Internet-enabled wireless information access terminal can be used virtually anywhere, provided wireless Internet access is enabled by digital IP communication network service providers (NSPs) in operation about the planet. Operation of Internet access terminal  is quite simple from the user's point of view. Upon reading a bar code symbol  on a consumer product , the object detection field  of the device automatically detects the consumer product, and in response thereto, a laser beam  is automatically projected and swept across the UPC symbol  thereon. While it is generally preferred that the automatic laser scanning engine  be interfaced with I\/O communications port of the Newton MessagePad device , it is understood that, in some instances, it may be desired to connect a pen or wand-type scanning device to the serial port thereof to provide bar code symbol reading capabilities thereto. Optionally, bar code decoding software can be run on the Message Pad device, or as firmware contained within the scanning engine  in a manner known in the art.","Notably, it is understood that there will be many different types of wireless mobile Internet-enabled access terminals that may be used to realize the client computer subsystems of the present invention. For example, recently 3COM, Inc. introduced into its commercial product line the PalmPilot VII Wireless Hand-Held Internet Access Terminal, which is similar in many respects to the Newton Messagepad Model 130 equipped with the Motorola PCMCIA-based modem card , and Nethopper\u2122 Software, described above. Also, Symbol Technologies, Inc. of Holtsville, N.Y. has introduced the Symbol SPT 1500, SPT 1700, SPT 1740 and PPT 2700 hand-held wireless bar code scanning Internet access terminals which have virtually the same functionalities embodied within the wireless hand-held Internet access terminal shown in FIG. A, and originally disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Such EC-enabled WWW sites, commonly referred to as electronic-commerce (EC) stores or storefronts, as well as on-line electronic commerce catalogues, can be operated by manufacturers, wholesalers and\/or retailers of consumer products, as indicated in  and -. As shown therein, retailer operated, managed and\/or owned EC stores (i.e. EC-enabled WWW sites) are hosted on retailer operated\/owned EC information servers (MECIS) B, whereas manufacturer operated, managed and\/or owned EC stores (i.e. EC-enabled WWW sites) are hosted on manufacturer operated\/owned EC information servers (MECIS) B operably connected to the infrastructure of the Internet.","The consumer product information delivery system of the present invention shall enable an infinite array of applications with regard to electronic commerce and home shopping, now made possible by the present invention.","The Database Structure of the IPD Server","In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, each data-synchronized IPD Server  of the preferred embodiment maintains at least two different relational-type databases, namely: a IPI Registrant Database for storing information about manufacturers whose products are registered with the system; and a Non-IPI Registrant Database for storing information about manufacturers whose products are not registered with the system. A schematic representation of the IPI Registrant Database is shown in FIG. A, whereas a schematic representation of the Non-IPI Registrant Database is shown in .","As shown in FIG. A, the relational-type IPI Registrant Database maintained by each IPD Server comprises a plurality of labeled information fields for each product \u201cregistered\u201d therewith, namely: an IPN Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Product Number (e.g. twelve-digit UPC Version A number, eight-digit UPC Version E number, thirteen-digit UPC\/EAN number, or twelve-digit UPC Version A number plus five-digit Add-On Code Segment number frequently used in the publishing industry) assigned to the consumer product; a Company Name Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the name of the company making, selling or distributing the corresponding product; a URL Information Field(s) for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Resource Locator (URL) or Universal Resource Locators (URLs) at which information resource(s) of the multimedia type can be found on the Internet relating to the corresponding consumer product; a Trademark Information Field for storing information (e.g. text and\/or alphanumeric strings) representative of each trademark (or Domain Name) used in connection with the promotion, sale, distribution and\/or use of the corresponding product, and preferably registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or other governmental or quasi-governmental agency (e.g. INTERNIC or Network Solutions, Inc.); a Product Description Information Field for storing information (e.g. text strings) descriptive of the corresponding product: an E-mail Address Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the e-mail address of the corresponding company (e.g. manufacturer) on the Internet; a CPIR-Enabling Applet Information Field for storing information representative of consumer product information request (CPIR) enabling Applets accessible by retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, Web publishers and the like by downloading operations to be described in detail hereinafter, and eventually inserted within the HTML code of Web documents on various types of Internet information servers used to host WWW sites of all sorts, so that, when executed, these CPIR-enabling Applets automatically access from the master UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof, a categorized menu of URLs specifying the location of information resources on the Internet pertaining to a particular UPN-labeled product and symbolically linked thereto by its manufacturer or authorized agent; image file storage field for storing color images of consumer products registered with the system; and a Status Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of whether the company (e.g. manufacturer) associated registered product has paid their monthly, quarterly or annual registration fees associated with registration within the IPD Servers of the information finding and serving subsystem hereof. Notably, each information item contained with the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is related or linked.","In general, the URL stored in the URL Information Field specifies the address of an information resource on the Internet (e.g. Web), and thus may point to any one of the following types of information resources: a HTML document or file on the World Wide Web (expressed in the HyperText Markup Language); a single record in a database; the front-end of an Internet program such as Gopher; or the results of a query made using another program. In accordance with convention, the syntactic structure of each URL generally comprises: a Protocol Specifier, such as \u201chttp\u201d, \u201cftp\u201d, \u201cgopher\u201d, \u201cnews\u201d, or \u201cmail to\u201d, and specifies the type of resource that the URL is pointing (i.e. connecting) to; a Host Indicator, represented by double slashes \u201c\/\/\u201d if the URL is requesting information from a Web Server; Server Name comprising an Internet Domain Name (e.g. \u201cwww.\u201d), the address of the Web Server (e.g. \u201cibm.\u201d), and a designator (e.g. \u201ccom\u201d, \u201cedu\u201d, \u201cint\u201d, \u201cmil\u201d, \u201cnet\u201d, \u201corg\u201d, etc.) identifying who owns the server or where it is located; a Path Name, such as \u201cProducts\/Computers\/\u201d, indicating a path to the destination information file on the identified Server; and a Resource Name (including file extension, e.g. \u201c.html\u201d), such as \u201captiva.html\u201d, identifying the actual named information file that contains actual information resource specified by the URL.","As used herein as well as in the Claims to Invention, the term \u201cregistered\u201d and the variants thereof shall be understood to mean listed or having an entry within a database. Such listing or entry can be achieved in a variety of ways including, but not limited to: (i) by specific request of the associated company or business; or (ii) by the system administrator without a request and\/or authorization of the corresponding company or business linked to the product.","Notably, each information item contained within the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is symbolically related or linked. Different products of the same registrant or related registrant may also be linked together so that a user looking for information about a particular product is automatically provided with URLs which are assigned to related products of the registrant which may satisfy the goals or objectives of a particular advertising and\/or marketing campaign or product promotion program of the registrant company. As it may be desired to relate particular products at particular points in time, the relationships therebetween can be dynamically changed within the IPI Registrant Database by a straightforward database updating operation carried out by a system administrator (or manager) who, in theory, can be located virtually anywhere throughout the world. Expectedly, such database updating operations would be carried out using appropriate system access and security procedures well known in the art.","Inasmuch as the UPC data structure is presently employed as a universal product identifier (i.e. a primary data structure) in a majority of industries throughout the world, its twelve-digit numeric string (for UPC Version A) or eight-digit numeric string (for UPC Version E) will be a preferred UPN (in many applications) for purposes of carrying out the principles of the present invention. This twelve (12) digit human-readable number, printed on the bottom of each UPC label (and encoded within the bars and spaces of the UPC label itself), comprises: (i) a six digit manufacturer number assigned to the manufacturer by the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UCC) of Dayton, Ohio, and consisting of a one digit \u201cnumber system\u201d number and a five digit manufacturer code; (ii) a five digit \u201cproduct\u201d number assigned to the product by the manufacturer; and (iii) a one digit modulo check digit (mathematically calculated) and added to each UPC number to check that the code has been read correctly by the bar code symbol reader.","In order to provide the requester greater control over what information is actually displayed on its client subsystem, the URL Information Field of the IPI Database shown in FIG. A contains a number of information subfields. As shown in FIG. A, these information subfields comprise: a Product Advertisement Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to advertising and\/or promotion of the product; a Product Specification (i.e. Description) Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to specifications on the product; a Product Update Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to product updates, recalls, notices, etc; a Product Distributor (e.g. Wholesaler and\/or Resaler) Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to distribution, sale and\/or ordering of the product; a Product Warranty\/Servicing Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to warranty, extended warranty offerings, servicing and maintenance of the product; a Product Incentive Information Field (e.g. rebates, discounts and\/or coupons) for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to rebates, discounts and sales on the product; a Product Review Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to reviews, analysis, testing, inspection and\/or comparison of the product; and Miscellaneous Information Field(s) for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to miscellaneous aspects of the product (e.g., direct product sales on the WWW, product installation\/set-up and operating manuals, company reports (10 Ks, annual reports, etc.), and the like. Each URL symbolically linked to a UPC-labeled product registered in the Registered IPI Database is categorized within one or more of these URL categories.","The list of URLs recordable in the IPI Registrant Database for each registered UPC-labeled product is virtually unlimited. Below are just a few examples of how the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof can be used as a virtual sales agent that provides value-added services to consumers, retailers and the like.","For each CD sound recording, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a promotional QuickTime\u00ae video recording or MP3-formatted sound recording published on the WWW for reviewing and evaluation by the consumer. The promotional song can be by a commissioned or endorsing artist, as is typically done in conventional advertising programs. The same can be done for video recordings on tape and digital video discs (DVDs). The URL may also provide the consumer with a down-loadable trial version of the product for a limited time period.","For each computer software product, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a demonstration of the solutions that the software product provides, as well as the functions and development tools that it enables. It may also provide the consumer with a down-loadable version of the software product for a time-limited trial period.","For electronic consumer products, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an audio-visual demonstration of the product in various user environments. Also, the URL can contain a URL that points to a Web-based Specification Sheet that can be printed out in a retail environment, at home, work or on the road.","For groceries and like articles, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a QuickTime\u00ae video recording or the like of the product, illustrating various cooking recipes and uses for the product. Also, the URL list can contain a URL that points to a Web-based Discount Coupon that can printed out in the store, at home or work.","For toys, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an audio-visual demonstration of the toy along with promotional endorsements by the various characters used in its advertising campaign.","For clothing, garments, or accessories (e.g. wearing apparel), the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a QuickTime\u00ae video recording or the like of the clothing, garments, and\/or accessories being modeled by stunning fashion models. Ideally, such video recordings, linked to particular articles of wearing apparel by their UPC number, can be used to extend and augment the advertising campaign being carried out in other forms of media (e.g. television, radio, print, billboards, etc.).","Preferably, the manufacturer, its marketing personnel and advertising agents will actively participate in the creation of the product related information resources, as well as the placement of their URLs into the above-defined (or like) URL categories maintained within the Database of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof. Also, using the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem hereof, manufacturers and\/or their agents can easily link their UPNs (e.g. UPC and\/or EANs) with such URL-s and manage the same in a dynamic manner to ensure that product related information on the Internet is accurately linked to the UPNs of the manufacturer's products. Through such active participation, the business objectives of any particular manufacturer or retailer can be promoted by way of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention. In this way, the information requesting consumer is provided with only the kinds of product-related information which he or she seeks.","As shown in , the Non-IPI Registrant Database maintained by each IPD Server comprises a plurality of labeled information fields for each product that is not currently registered with the IPD Server, namely: an IPSN (i.e. IPN) information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Product Number (e.g. a UPC number from a UPC numbering system, or an EAN numbering system) assigned to the non-registered product; a Company Name Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the name of the company making, selling or distributing the corresponding non-registered product; a Trademark Information Field for storing information (e.g. text and\/or alphanumeric strings) representative of each trademark used in connection the promotion, sale, distribution and\/or use of the corresponding product, and preferably registered with the USPTO or other governmental agency; a Product Description Information Field for storing information (e.g. text strings) descriptive of the corresponding product; and an E-mail Address Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the e-mail address of the corresponding company (e.g. manufacturer) on the Internet; a Status Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of whether the company associated non-registered product has been solicited by the IPD Server, and on what dates registration solicitation has occurred. Notably, each information item contained with the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is related or linked. The information required to construct the Non-IPI Registrant Database shown in  can be readily obtained from a number of commercially or publicly available information sources (e.g., the Universal Code Council, Inc., Dayton, Ohio; QRS, Inc. of Richmond, Calif.; General Electric Information Services (GEIS) of Delaware, Md.; etc.).","Constructing the IPI Registrant Database within the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem Hereof","The utility of the product finding functionalities of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof depends in large part on the number of consumer-products registered with the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases supported within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof, as illustrated in FIGS. B, B, B and B. In principle, numerous techniques may be employed separately or in combination with each other in order to construct the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases of the present invention. Six such techniques will be detailed below.","According to a first database construction technique, the administrator of the IPI Registrant Database would transmit Product Registration Requests (PRRs) in the form of electronic documents to each and every the manufacturer having been issued, for example, a six digit UPC Manufacturer Identification Number (MIN) by the UCC, Inc. Such electronic documents can be transmitted using conventional MIME protocols such as, for example, STMP. The Product Registration Request document would seek to ascertain from the manufacturers the various information items (including the menu of URLs) identified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A. In response to the Product Registration Request, each solicited manufacturer would send back to the administrator of the IPI Registrant Database (for each of its consumer products) its UPC number and a menu of categorized URLs indicating the location of the information resources identified in the Product Registration Request document. This information can then be used to readily construct the IPI Registrant Database of the illustrative embodiment.","According to a second database construction technique, a global advertising campaign would launched (over various media) in order to solicit the various information elements identified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A and thus register the products of the manufacturers selling UPC-labeled products. Preferably, such information would be collected by way of an electronic data transfer subsystem(s) set-up to cooperate with the system of the present invention in order to facilitate database construction operations.","According to a third database construction technique, the IPI system itself would continuously solicit consumer product registrations over time in order to collect information from companies responding favorably to the solicitations. While such solicitation efforts can involve the issuance of product registration requests using various types of media, it is preferred that the information collection operations are carried out using electronic data transfer techniques (e.g. ftp, EDI or XML\/ICE) described hereinabove.","According to a fourth database construction technique, a number of commercial on-line Internet search engines, such as AltaVista\u2122, Yahoo\u2122, WebCrawler\u2122, Lycos\u2122, Excite\u2122, as well as powerful off-line parallel-processing search engines, would be enlisted to analyze (i.e. mine) information on the WWW in order to collect and link the information elements specified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A.","Once an \u201cinitial\u201d IPI Registrant Database has been constructed using any one or more of the four database construction techniques described hereinabove, manufacturers registered therewith can be periodically contacted using Web-based electronic document (i.e. message) transfer techniques in order to request updating and confirmation of the UPN\/URL listings contained within the database of the IPI subsystem of the present invention.","According to a fifth database and preferred construction technique of the present invention, the Registrant IPI Database of the system would be initially \u201cseeded\u201d with several items of information obtained and related without the assistance of manufacturers of UPC-labeled products. Such information items include: (1) the six digit UPC Manufacturer Identification Numbers encoded in the UPC symbols (and numbers) applied to the products of such UCC-registered manufacturers; and (2) the URLs of the Web home pages of such manufacturers.","The first step of this database construction method involves obtaining the six digit Manufacturer Identification Numbers (MINs) uniquely issued to manufacturers by the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UCC) of Dayton, Ohio. Such MINs can be obtained from various commercial sources including GE Information Services, QRS, Inc., formerly Quick Response Services, Inc.), as well as the UCC. At present, about 180,000 Manufacturer Identification Numbers (MINs) have been issued to manufacturers by the UCC. A string of six zeros (i.e. 000000) may be added to each one of these 180,000 or so six digit Manufacturer Identification Numbers in order to produce 180,000 or so 12 digit numbers (i.e. hereinafter referred to as \u201cManufacturer's Reference Numbers\u201d) for the 180,000 or so manufacturers listed in the IPI Registrant Database under construction. As each such Manufacturer Reference Number has the same length as a UPC number of its manufacturer, this number can be conveniently thought of as the \u201cManufacturer Reference UPC Number\u201d which can be stored in the UPN Information Field of the Database along with the corresponding manufacturers name being stored in the Company Name Information Field.","The second step of the method involves finding the URL of the Web home page of each of the 180,000 manufacturers who have been assigned a Manufacturers Identification Code and are listed in the Database. Such URL information can be found using a number of available techniques: (i) using a commercially available search engine to search the WWW in order to find the URL of the home page of each manufacturer's Web-site, if it has one, using the name and address thereof obtained during the first step above; or (ii) using a commercially available (INTERNIC-enabled) Domain Name search service that uses the names and addresses of the manufacturers (obtained during the first step above) in order to determine whether a particular manufacturer has a registered domain name on the Internet, and if so, is the domain name being actively used in a URL that points to the home page of the manufacturer's Web-site. Once obtained, such URLs are then added to the IPI Database, along with the e-mail and\/or other address of the manufacturer symbolically linked thereto (if available).","Having constructed the \u201cseeded\u201d Database, it can then be used to connect the client subsystem of users to the home page of Web-sites of manufacturers of particular products. Initially, when an Internet user provides the UPC number of a particular product as input to the Input Box of the HTML form displayed in the information display frame of the client subsystem (e.g. when operated in its Manufacturer Website Search Mode), then the IPD Server need only compare the first six digits of the entered UPC number against the first six-digits of the Manufacturer Reference UPC Numbers (i.e. Manufacturer Identification Numbers) listed in the \u201cseeded\u201d Database. The corresponding (home-page) URL of the matching manufacturer is returned to the client subsystem Cfor display. In instances of an initially seeded Database, in which only the \u201cManufacturer Reference UPC Numbers\u201d are listed therein, the requesting client subsystems are provided with the URLs of the home pages of the symbolically linked manufacturers. Then as manufacturers begin to register their consumer products with the system (e.g. in response to mass e-mailings, advertisements and\/or marketing and promotional efforts, etc.), the IPD Database will return a menu of \u201chot-linked\u201d URLs, for each registered product, pointing to various types of product-related information resources on the Internet (described above) that can be easily accessed by simply clicking thereon in a conventional manner. Over time, Manufacturer Reference UPC Numbers and the URLs of the \u201chome pages\u201d of such manufacturers will become replaced by the UPC numbers of registered products and the menu of URLs on the WWW symbolically linked thereto by the manufacturers, thereby allowing consumers and users of the system to precisely pinpoint consumer product-related information on the WWW which has been specified by the manufacturer, its marketing department and\/or advertising agency. With manufacturer's and advertiser's participation and feedback, the initially seeded RDBMS described hereinabove will quickly grow into a robust RDBMS richly filled with the various information items described in FIGS. A and A, including the symbolically linked UPCs and URLs that point to very specific consumer product related information resources (i.e. files) stored within IPI Servers of the system located across the global expanse of the Internet.","According to a sixth database construction technique of the present invention, the Registrant IPI Database of the system would be constructed by allowing each manufacturer to construct a limited or restricted version of the master UPN\/URL Database (i.e. Registrant IPI Database) of the system, wherein only UPC-encoded products of the registered manufacturer and Web-based information items related thereto are entered into the database. As will be described in greater detail herebelow in connection with the third method of Product Registration in the subsystem hereof, the creation of such limited-version UPN\/URL databases can be carried out by providing each registered manufacturer with a computer program that allows its administrators to construct and manage a limited UPN\/URL database in a \u201cturn-key\u201d manner. Also, from its Website, the manufacturer can serve the limited UPN\/URL database over the Internet to consumers. As part of the registration process, each registered manufacturer transmits its limited UPN\/URL database to Web-server  which then integrates all such databases in order to update the master UPN\/URL database (IPI Registrant Database) of the system.","Methods of Constructing UPN-Encoded Server-Side and Client Side Applets and Distributing the HTML Tags Associated therewith to Remote Client Subsystems for Embedding within HTML-Encoded Documents to be Published Over the Internet in Connection with UPN-Labeled Consumer Products","In general, for each system architecture shown in FIGS. B through B, there will be a different Applet-driven method used to access consumer product related information (e.g. UPN\/URL links) from the RDBMS server  and display the search results within a Java-based GUI at the point of presence of the consumer using a Java-enabled client machine . In order to practice these different methods, it will be necessary to construct either server-side or client-side UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling Applets, to distribute the HTML tags associated therewith to remote client subsystems, and thereafter to embed these CPIR-enabling Applet tags within HTML-encoded documents for publishing over the Internet. Such CPIR-enabling Applet construction, distribution and embedding methods will now be described in detail hereinbelow.","The First Applet-Driven Method of Accessing and Displaying Categorized UPN\/URL Link Menus from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem the Present Invention","After providing a brief overview on the system architecture of FIG. B and the nature of the server-side CPIR-enabling Applets deployed therewithin, the steps associated with Applet-driven CPI-acquisition method of the first illustrative embodiment will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. E, E, F and F.","In general, the method of FIGS. E and E involves using a server-side CPIR-enabling Applet to automatically conduct a UPN-directed search on the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof (i.e. RDBMS server ) in response to a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer on the HTML tag associated with the server-side Applet. In the illustrative embodiment, the CPIR-enabling servlet of the present invention is a program written in the Java\u2122 programming language and has an HTML tag (indicated by <SERVLET>) which is designed to be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image can be included therewithin (according to the HTML 3.2 Specification).","CPIR-enabling servlets of the present invention are designed to work within a request\/response processing model, as shown in FIG. B. In this request\/response model, a client subsystem  sends a request message to the Java Web Server \u2032 and the Server \u2032 responds by sending back a reply message. In the illustrative embodiment, requests come in the form of http, although is understood that the use of other protocols such as ftp, EDI or a custom protocol, may be possible in particular embodiments. The request and the corresponding response reflect the state of the client and the server at the time of the request.","When using a Java-enabled browser to view a Web page containing a server-side CPIR-enabling Applet tag <SERVLET>, the servlet's compiled class code is automatically accessed from the Java Web Server \u2032 and executed on the server-side of the network connection illustrated in FIG. B. Thus, as shown in FIG. B, the Java Web Server \u2032 must provide a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for running\/executing Java servlets on the server-side of the network in much the same way that a client browser must provide a JVM for running Java Applets on the client side thereof. Additionally, the Java Web browser \u2032 must also support the Java Servlet API, developed by JavaSoft, and define how and when the servlet communicates with the Java Web Server. Essentially, the Servlet API is a well-defined set of function calls (i.e. set of Java classes) to get information to and from the Java Web Server. The servlet needs to be able to access server-defined variables, issue redirects, send error messages and the like. Sun's Java Web Server supports the Servlet API and, of course, includes their JVM.","As shown in FIG. B, the Java Web Server \u2032 includes a number of software components including the Java Servlet API which comprises several Java interfaces and fully defines the link between the hosting server (e.g. Java Web Server) and the servlets located at the middle tier. The Servlet API is defined as an extension to the standard JDK. This means that there is an explicit definition of servlet interfaces, but it is not part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.1 or the Java 2 platform. Instead, the servlet classes are delivered with the Java Servlet Development Kit (JSDK) version 2.0 from Sun (http:\/\/java.sun.com\/products\/servlet\/). This JSDK version is intended for use with both JDK 1.1 and the Java 2 platform. There are a few significant differences between JSDK 2.0 and JSDK 1.0.","JDK extensions are packaged under javax\u2014the root of the Java extension library tree. The Java Servlet API contains the following packages: Package javax.servlet; and Package javax.servlet.http dedicated to supporting HTTP protocol and HTML generation. The Servlet API provides a tight link between a server and servlets, allowing servlets to add new protocol support to a server. Essentially, any protocol (e.g. SMTP, POP, FTP, etc.) that follows a request\/response computing model can be implemented by a servlet.","General servlet support is provided by the package \u201cjavax.servlet\u201d which comprises the following components:\n\n","Support for HTTP Servlets is provided by the package \u201cjavax.servlet.http\u201d which comprises the following components:\n\n","Having provided an overview on server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets (i.e. Servlets) of the present invention and the support framework required thereby in a distributed-computing object oriented programming environment shown in FIG. B, it is appropriate to now describe the method of creating, loading, distributing, embedding and executing server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets in accordance with the principles of the present invention schematically illustrated in FIGS. E, E, F and F.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. E, the first step of the method involves using the Java Servlet API to write or otherwise author the source code for a server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet., for each UPN-specified consumer product registered in the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem . In general, the source code for each server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet (i.e. servlet) will embody one or more of the following items of information, namely: (i) the UPN of the particular product on which the CPI search is to be carried out and the search results thereof displayed; (ii) Java classes required for performing a UPN-directed search on the RDBMS Server  using one or more Java methods running natively on the Java Web Server \u2032, and producing a particular Java GUI for displaying the results obtained from the UPN-directed search; and (iii) license-related information specifying the terms and conditions of the CPIR-enabling Servlet license and the conditions under which the CPIR-enabling servlet shall operate.","Notably, such license-related information may specify: (1) one or more specific host domains (e.g. www.homedepot.com or www.walmart.com ) from which a Web document containing the corresponding servlet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling servlet under a licensing program; (2) one or more general Internet domains (e.g. .com, org., .gov, int, mil, .uk, etc.) from which a Web document containing the corresponding servlet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling servlet under a licensing program; (3) the time duration of the licensing period associated with the CPIR-enabling servlet; and (4) any other restrictions set by the associated manufacturer and\/or retailer, and\/or administrator of the consumer product information system hereof, that must be observed for a registered CPIR-enabled servlet to operate within a Web-document served from the registered Internet domain.","Notably, the Java source code for each CPIR-enabling Servlet will vary depending upon implementation. However, regardless of the particular implementation, it can be expected that each JDBC-supporting CPIR-enabling servlet when, for example, designed to search an (Oracle JDBC-supported) UPN\/URL Database Server A for the UPC\/URL list currently symbolically linked to a specified UPN and display the search results on the requesting client machine , will typically include Java source code specifying:\n\n","In the embodiment depicted in FIG. B, a UPN-encoded Servlet is used to replace a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script and provide a way of searching the UPN\/URL Database on RDBMS Server \u2032, with the advantage of increased speed and stability. In this instance, CPIR-enabling Servlets are accessed by the user as an HTML tag <SERVLET> embedded in an HTML document served to the client subsystem . For example, when the consumer selects the servlet tag (graphically encoded by an icon or image) in an HTML-encoded document, the linked servlet residing on the server-side of the network, is automatically executed, causing a UPN-directed search to be carried on the RDBMS server .","After writing\/authoring the source code for the Applet, the CPIR-enabling Java servlet is ascribed a unique name such as, \u201cUPNXXXXXXYYYYYZ\u201d for a 12 digit Uniform Product Code.","Reference can be made to the following technical publication for additional details on writing Java servlets, designing Java GUIs and the like: \u201cJava Servlets and Serialization With RMI\u201d (1999) by Scott McPherson, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; \u201cThe Java\u2122 Tutorial Second Edition: Object Oriented Programming For The Internet\u201d (1999), by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; \u201cThe JFC Swing Tutorial: A Java Guide To Constructing JAVA GUIs\u201d (1999), by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; \u201cJAVA\u201d (1997) by Ed Tittel and Bill Brogden, published by IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.; and \u201cWilde's WWW: Technical Foundations of the World Wide Web\u201d (1999) by Erik Wilde, published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; each said publication being incorporated herein by reference.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. E, the source code for the authored servlet is compiled into Java bytecode, and java bytecode for the servlet classfiles are placed in the server_root\/servlets directory on the Java Web Server \u2032. When compiling, the javax.servlet.* package should be placed in the classpath. The easiest way to do this is to include server_root\/lib\/classes.zip in the classpath, but it is understood that one must look to the compiler's documentation for specific details in this regard.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, the second step of the method involves using the Java Server Administration Applet to configure the Java Web Server so as to extend the functionalities thereof and embody (or install) the CPIR-enabling Java servlet within the Java Web Server \u2032. This process of extending the functionalities of the Java Web Server \u2032 involves specify the default parameters and arguments thereof. This configuration step is carried out when using the Servlet Loading facility of the Administration Applet in order. The loading process is achieved by clicking on the Servlets Button, and then selecting Add from the list of choices on the left GUI of the Servlet Loading Facility. Thereafter, to add a new servlet, the following procedure is performed: Enter in the Servlet Name field, the unique name for the CPIR-enabling Java servlet one is loading onto the Java Web Server (e.g. \u201cUPNXXXXXXYYYYYZ\u201d); Enter in the Servlet Class field, a valid class name for the Java class of the CPIR-enabling servlet, i.e., the full package name, e.g. \u201csun.server.http.FileServlet\u201d; and thereafter Click on the Add button.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, the fourth step of the method involves invoking the CPIR-enabling Java servlet by creating a URL having the path section \u201c\/servlet\/\u201d prepended to the assigned Servlet Name, so that the URL can be thereafter embodied within the servlet HTML tag <SERVLET>, prior to its insertion within the HTML code of a Web document. To invoke a servlet, the webmaster\/administrator calls the servlet by creating a URL with \u201c\/servlet\/\u201d prepended to the servlet name. One can confirm that the servlet is correctly invoked by entering this URL into one's Web browser and analyzing the output of the created servlet.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, the fifth step of the method involves (1) embodying the unique URL, created for each consumer product, within a CPIR-enabling servlet HTML tag <SERVLET>, (2) containing each such servlet HTML tag within an executable file, and (3) storing each such servlet tag containing file in the Central CPIR-Enabling Applet Library on the RDBMS Server .","As indicated at Block C in FIG. E, the sixth step of the method involves distributing the CPIR-enabling servlet HTML tags (within the Central CPIR-enabling Applet Library) to retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others who desire to deliver UPN-directed CPI search results to their customers, clients and the like. This distribution process can be carried out by downloading servlet tags containing files to a remote computer system connected to the Internet using, for example, ftp or other electronic data or document interchange protocols (e.g. XML\/ICE) to carry out the servlet tag transport process. These downloaded CPIR-enabling servlet tags can then be stored in a local CPIR-Enabling Applet\/Servlet Library maintained on a client computer , as shown in FIG. F, until it is time to embed the same into a particular HTML-encoded document.","As indicated at Block D in FIG. E, the seventh step of the method involves enabling retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others to (1) open the downloaded servlet tag containing files, (2) extract the CPIR-enabling servlet tags contained therewithin, and (3) embed (i.e. insert) one or more distributed CPIR-enabled servlets HTML tags into acceptable HTML-encoded documents associated with EC-enabled WWW sites, EC-enabled storefronts and catalogs, Internet product advertisements, on-line auction-based WWW sites, or other types of Web-documents.","In general, this step of the method involves first creating or otherwise procuring a suitable HTML-encoded document which may, understandably, include other types of code (e.g. XML) therein, other than HTML code. While such HTML documents can be created using any HTML-editing program, such as BBD-Edit, it is expected that in most applications the underlying HTML-encoded document will be generated using tools such as: GO-LIVE\u00ae WWW-Site Development and Management solution software from Adobe Systems, Inc. to create the HTML pages associated with a particular WWW site; CatalogMaker\u2122 and CatalogManager electronic commerce solution software programs from RealEDI, Inc; Intershop 4 Enfinity\u2122 Electronic Commerce Solution software from Intershop Communications, Inc; and\/or any other commercially available HTML-authoring tools which enable quick and easy creation of HTML-encoded documents, and easy insertion of any downloaded CPIR-enabling servlet tag <SERVLET> using, for example, simple commands or drag-and-drop procedures.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. E, the eighth step of the method involves serving \u201cservlet-tag\u201d encoded HTML documents from Internet information servers to Java-enabled client computer subsystems  operated by consumers at home, in the office, in EC-enabled or \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail stores, or on the road, as the case may be. As shown in , such Internet information servers can include, for example, IPI servers , retailer-related EC-enabled information servers A, manufacturer-related EC-enabled information servers B, and\/or any other Internet (http or ftp) information servers operating on the Internet from which HTML-encoded document are served for any informational, educational, and\/or entertainment purpose.","As indicated at Block F in FIG. E, the ninth step of the method hereof involves using a Java-enabled client computer subsystems  to display served HTML-encoded documents having one or more of CPIR-enabling servlet tags embedded therewithin. This step is carried out by the consumer pointing his or her Java-enabled browser program (e.g. Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer, or Sun Microsystems' HotJava program) to an HTML-encoded document within which a CPIR-enabling Java servlet tag is embedded, at a particular point of presence on the WWW.","As shown in FIGS. M through R, CPIR-enabling Applets can be graphically-encoded in a variety of different ways to provide the consumer with a visual indication clicking on the graphical object however manifested, will automatically result in a consumer product information search on a particular product identified by the UPN encoded within the associated servlet. In view of the fact the CPIR-enabling servlet tags are distributed over the Internet and inserted within HTML documents by others than the servlet author, at some future date, graphical encoding of CPIR-enabling servlets will typically occur at the time of writing the servlet.","With the above point in mind, it will be helpful to adopt a standardized icon for graphically indicating the presence of a CPIR-enabling servlet tag within an HTML document. In the illustrative embodiments shown in FIGS. P, P, R, R, S, and S, small predefined images of servicemarks such as \u201cGO: UPC Request Cyber-Service\u2122 URL Search\u201d are served to inform the consumer that the Java object, if selected from the displayed Web page, will automatically cause a product-specific URL search to be performed with respect to the particular consumer product and the results thereof displayed at the \u201cpoint of presence\u201d of the consumer who may be residing at a particular point in an EC-enabled store (e.g. at the check-out display screen or POS), at on-line auction site, at a Web-based product advertisement, or anywhere else on the WWW. Notably, an important advantage provided by this information search technique of the present invention is that it does not disturb the consumer at his or her point of presence (or sale), where ever that may be. Instead, the CPI search and display method hereof enables the delivery of accurate product-specific manufacturer-defined information at precise points in Cyberspace by performing a single mouse-clicking operation. This enables consumers to make informed decisions thereat based on the information displayed in the corresponding Java GUI generated upon launching a CPIR-enabling servlet at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW.","It is understood, however, that other techniques may be used to create a visual indication to the consumer that a CPIR-enabling Applet is located at a particular point on the WWW and that if this Applet is executed (e.g. by a single mouse-clicking operation), then a UPN-directed consumer product information search will be automatically executed and the results therefrom will be displayed within a Java GUI at the consumer's point of presence.","One alternative technique would be to embed within the CPIR-enabling Applet, a thumb-nail or large size photo-image of the consumer product being offered for sale, lease, auction, or other purpose on the WWW. Notably, this product image any reside on the RDBMS server , or on the http server from which the HTML-encoded document is served. Using this technique, the consumer need only click on the image to initiate a UPN-directed consumer product information search against the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof.","Notably, the person or persons responsible for delivering product advertisements to particular locations on one or more WWW sites can use the OPEN ADSTREAM\u2122 (OAS) 5.0 Internet Advertisement Management Solution software from Real Media, Inc., of New York, N.Y., and any other suitable software solution, running on the Internet (http) information server (, \u2032, A or B), and managed using an Web-enabled client subsystem , as shown in FIG. F. Using the OAS 5.0 advertisement management solution, and the CPI search and display method of present invention described above, a webmaster or advertising manager assigned to a particular Internet information server (, \u2032, A or B) can: (1) access the Web-based product advertisement for a particular product (i.e. HTML code, image files, and any other rich media content associated therewith); (2) access previously downloaded CPIR-enabling Java servlet(s) for the consumer product, stored in a locally-maintained \u201cLibrary (i.e. Catalog) of CPIR-Enabling Applets\u201d on a client machine or server on the network, or directly access CPIR-enabling Java servlets from the centrally-maintained \u201cLibrary (i.e. Catalog) of CPIR-Enabling Applets\u201d illustrated in FIG. F, via the Java Web Server \u2032; and (3) use Real Media's OAS 5.0 solution software deliver both the Web-based product advertisement (i.e. its HTML code and other media-rich content) and the corresponding CPIR-enabling Applet tag (and possibly any image files associated therewith) to a designated section on a particular Web page of a specific WWW-site.","It is understood that there are different ways of inserting\/embedding both of these objects within a particular section of an HTML-encoded document using the highly-advanced HTML-editing functionalities of the OAS 5.0 software system. For example, the Web-based product advertisement can be inserted within a first spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document occupying the largest portion of the purchased Internet advertising space, while the CPIR-enabling server-side Applet (i.e. servlet) is inserted within a second spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document occupying the balance of the purchased Internet advertising space. Alternatively, both the CPIR-enabling Applet and the Web-based product advertisement can be inserted within substantially the same spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document so as to achieve spatial overlap therebetween. This way when the consumer clicks on the advertisement image, or some preselected portion thereof, the underlying CPIR-enabling servlet will be automatically executed and the corresponding Java GUI generated for displaying the results of the UPN-directed database search.","In situations where the Internet product advertisement (e.g. banner advertisement) embodies a servlet HTML tag which, when executed, produces a new Java GUI (i.e. new browser interface), then a CPIR-enabling servlet can be embedded within the HTML-encoded document displayed in the new Java GUI. This servlet tag embedding technique will be useful in many applications where the display space allocated for the Web advertisement in the target HTML-encoded document is limited, and there is a need to generate a new Java GUI for presenting the content of the advertisement.","Other ways of embedding the Web-based advertisement and the related CPIR-enabling servlet tags will become apparent hereinafter to those skilled in the art having had the benefit of reading the present disclosure.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. E, the tenth step in the method involves the consumer recognizing that a CPIR-enabling servlet tag is embedded within a Web-document displayed on a Java-enabled client computer subsystem, and thereafter launching\/executing the associated servlet to initiate a UPN-directed consumer product information search within the RDBMS server .","Notably, the above illustrative embodiment has been described with particular focus given to CPIR-enabling servlets encoded with the UPN of a particular consumer product. It is understood, however, that the CPIR-enabling servlets of the present invention can be encoded with the trademark(s) used in connection with a particular consumer product, thus providing Trademark-encoded CPIR-enabling servlets, in contrast with UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling servlets. In such alternative embodiments, the encoded trademark would be used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in a new (independent) Java GUI generated at the point of servlet tag embodiment. Alternatively, a product descriptor associated with a particular product can be encoded within the corresponding CPIR-enabling servlet, used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in an independent Java GUI generated at the point of servlet tag embodiment.","The Second Applet-Driven Method of Accessing and Displaying Categorized UPN\/URL Link Menus from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem the Present Invention","After providing a brief overview on the system architecture of FIG. B and the nature of the client-side CPIR-enabling Applets deployed therewithin, the steps associated with Applet-driven CPI-acquisition method of the second illustrative embodiment will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. G , G, H and H.","In general, the method of FIGS. G and G involves using a client-side CPIR-enabling Applet to automatically conduct a UPN-directed search on the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem hereof (i.e. RDBMS server  ) in response to a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer on the HTML tag associated with the CPIR-enabling Applet. In the illustrative embodiment, the CPIR-enabling Applet of the present invention is a program written in the Java\u2122 programming language and has an HTML tag (indicated by <APPLET>) which is designed to be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image can be included therewithin (according to the HTML 3.2 Specification).","CPIR-enabling Applets of the present invention are designed to work within a request\/response processing model, as shown in FIG. B. In this request\/response model, a client subsystem  sends a request message to the Java Web Server \u2033 and the Server \u2033 responds by sending back a reply message. In the illustrative embodiment, requests come in the form of http, although is understood that the use of other protocol as such as ftp, EDI or a custom protocol, may be possible in particular embodiments. The request and the corresponding response reflect the state of the client and the server at the time of the request.","When using a Java-enabled browser to view a Web page containing a client-side CPIR-enabling Applet tag <APPLET>, the Applet's compiled class code is automatically accessed from the Java Web Server \u2033 and executed on the client-side of the network connection illustrated in FIG. B. Thus, as shown in FIG. B, the Java-enabled client machine  in this network architecture must run a Java-enabled browser program that provides a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for running\/executing Java Applets on the client-side of the network in much the same way that Java Web Server \u2033 must provide a JVM for running Java servlets on the server side thereof, as shown in FIG. B.","As shown in FIG. B, the Java-enabled Web browser  includes a number of software components including Java interfaces for fully defining the link between the Java Web browser and the Applets located at the middle tier. In order to write, compile and load Applets onto the Java Web Server \u2033, the system administrator or webmaster can use the Java API provided for within the Java 2 (development) platform from

client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets of the present invention and the support framework required thereby in a distributed-computing object oriented programming environment shown in FIG. B, it is appropriate to now describe the method of creating, loading, distributing, embedding and executing client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets in accordance with the principles of the present invention schematically illustrated in FIGS. G, G, H and H.","As indicated at Block A in  , the first step of the method involves using the Java Applet API to write or otherwise author the source code for a client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet for each UPN-specified consumer product registered in the RDBMS server . In general, the source code for each client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet (i.e. Applet) will embody one or more of the following items of information: (i) the UPN of the particular product on which the CPI-based search is to be carried out and the search results thereof displayed; (ii) Java classes required for performing a UPN-directed search on the RDBMS server  using a CGI script executing on the Java Web Server \u2033, and producing a particular Java GUI for displaying the results obtained from the UPN-directed search; and (iii) license-related information specifying the terms and conditions of the CPIR-enabling Applet license and conditions under which the CPIR-enabling Applet shall operate.","Notably, such license-related information may specify: (1) one or more specific host domains (e.g. www.homedepot.com or www.walmart.com ) from which a Web document containing the corresponding Applet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling Applet under a licensing program; (2) one or more general Internet domains (e.g. .com, org., .gov, int, mil, .uk, etc.) from which a Web document containing the corresponding Applet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling Applet under a licensing program; (3) the time duration of the licensing period associated with the CPIR-enabling Applet; and (4) any other restrictions set by the associated manufacturer and\/or retailer, and\/or administrator of the consumer product information system of the present invention, that must be satisfied for a registered CPIR-enabled Applet to operate within a Web-document.","Notably, the Java source code for each CPIR-enabling Applet will vary depending upon implementation. However, regardless of the particular implementation, it can be expected that each CPIR-enabling Applet designed, for example, to search an (Oracle-based JDBC) RDBMS Server  for a current categorized UPC\/URL list\/menu symbolically linked to a specified UPN and thereafter display the results in an independent Java GUI, will typically include Java source code specifying:\n\n","When using earlier versions of the HTML Specification (i.e. HTML 3.2 by the World Wide Web Consortium), the source code for each CPIR-enabling Java Applet would adhere to the following general syntax:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0278","num":"0379"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"[CODEBASE = codebaseURL]"]},{"entry":[{},"CODE - appletFile"]},{"entry":[{},"[ALT = alternateText]"]},{"entry":[{},"[NAME = appletInstanceName]"]},{"entry":[{},"WIDTH = pixels HEIGHT = pixels"]},{"entry":[{},"[ALIGN = alignment]"]},{"entry":[{},"[VSPACE = pixels] [HSPACE = pixels]"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},">"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"[<PARAM NAME = Attribute1 VALUE = value>]"]},{"entry":[{},"[<PARAM NAME = Attribute2 VALUE = value>]"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"[alternateHTML]"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/APPLET>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The optional <PARAM> tag lets you to specify applet-specific attributes that your applet can retrieve as Strings. These Strings can be used in an HTML document to customize the Applet's behavior and supply their respective values in command-line variables.","CODEBASE, CODE, WIDTH, and HEIGHT are attributes specified by the first part of the <APPLET> tag. The Java-enabled Web browser  uses these attributes to locate the CPIR-enabling Applet code on the Java Web Server \u2033 and to indicate the amount of space to be reserved in the target HTML document during display. CODEBASE directs the Java-enabled Web browser to look for code in the classes directory of the Java Web Server \u2033. The mandatory parameter CODE provides the name of the Java code file that is to be loaded from the Java Web Server \u2033. Any other class files used by the Applet are loaded from the Codebase Directory as well.","WIDTH and HEIGHT are attributes that tell the Java-enabled Web browser to reserve space in the document display before the Java code is loaded (\u201cx\u201d pixels wide by \u201cx\u201d pixels high), similar to the way browsers deal with images, reserving space before the complete image is available. To place an invisible Applet on a page, specify height and width of zero.","Current Java-enabled Web browsers ignore the Java language resize( ) method for applets. Although the applet viewer provided in the JDK responds to the resize( ) method, one will have to specify width and height correctly in the CPIR-enabling APPLET tag for general Web browsers.","VSPACE and HSPACE are attributes for specifying the amount of space (in pixels) that surrounds the CPIR-enabling Applet above and below (vspace) and on each side (hspace) of the Applet area.","ALIGN is another attribute used to designate where the Java-enabled Web browser is to place the Applet area in relation to any other design elements. ALIGN can have possible values like those for the IMG tag: left, right, top, texttop, middle, absmiddle, baseline, bottom, and absbottom.","Notably, the optional parameters ALIGN, VSPACE and HSPACE may be set either at the time of CPIR-enabling Applet creation (i.e. when writing the source code therefor), or at the latter time such as, for example, after compiling and loading the Java class code on the Java Web Server, after downloading CPIR-enabling Applet tag files, or after extracting CPIR-enabling Applets, but prior to embedding the CPIR-enabling Applet tag within a HTML-encoded document. Thus, these optional parameters enable the Web page, EC-commerce site and auction site designer to modify (after Java class code compiling and loading operations, but before Applet tag insertion\/embedding operations) certain parameters and attributes within each CPIR-enabling Applet tag that determine the precise location where the Java-enabled browser on the client machine  will display the CPIR-enabling Applet and its associated image graphics on the browser display screen.","The ALT attribute designates a string to be displayed if the browser understands the <APPLET> tag but does not have Java capabilities. Netscape 2.0 allows turning the Java interpreter on or off via a check box under Options on the Security Preferences menu. The ALT attribute is a way to remind users to turn Java back on after turning it off to avoid wasting time on slow applets (as can often occur on Web pages).","CPIR-enabling Applets that coexist on the same Web page communicate by means of the NAME attribute. The AppletContext method getApplet(String name) returns a reference to the named Applet if it can be found in the Web page and then allows communication between Applets in the conventional sense.","The PARAM tag is used in transferring text information to the Applet code by way of the getParameter(String param_name) applet method. Since the parameter-matching code is not case sensitive and quote marks are parsed out, the following tags are equivalent:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0289","num":"0390"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<PARAM name = EMAIL"]},{"entry":[{},"<param NAME = EMAIL"]},{"entry":[{},"<param name = \u201cemail\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"The final element of the Applet tag must be <\/applet> in order to tell the Web browser that the Applet has ended.","Notably, in the HTML 4.0 Specification, published by the World Wide Web Consortium at http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/WD-html40-970917\/, the Applet element has been deprecated in favor of the OBJECT element, which offers an all purpose solution to generic object inclusion. The HTML 4.0 Specification now allows the OBJECT element to include images (via the <IMG> tag) and Applets (via the <APPLET> tag) in the same manner. Thus, when constructing Web documents and CPIR-enabling Applets in accordance with the HTML 4.0 Specification, the source code for each CPIR-enabling Applet will adhere to an entirely different syntax, the details of which are set forth which in the HTML 4.0 Specification, supra, are incorporated herein by reference.","For additional details pertaining to Java Applet construction, embedding techniques and Java GUI design and development, reference can be made to the following technical publications: \u201cJAVA\u201d (1997) by Ed Tittel and Bill Brogden, published by IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.; \u201cWilde's WWW: Technical Foundations of the World Wide Web\u201d (1999) by Erik Wilde, published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; \u201cThe Java\u2122 Tutorial Second Edition: Object Oriented Programming For The Internet\u201d (1999), by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; and \u201cThe JFC Swing Tutorial: A Java Guide To Constructing JAVA GUIs\u201d (1999), by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; each said publication being incorporated herein by reference.","After writing\/authoring the source code for the Applet, the CPIR-enabling Java Applet is ascribed a unique name such as \u201cUPNXXXXXXYYYYYZ\u201d for a 12 digit Uniform Product Code.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. G, the second step of the method involves compiling the source code of the Applet into Java bytecode, and then placing\/loading the classfiles for the Applet within the server_root\/Applets directory on the Java Web Server \u2033.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. G, the third step of the method involves for each UPN-specified consumer product, (1) containing the complete Applet HTML tag <APPLET> within an executable file, and (2) storing each such Applet tag containing file in the Central CPIR-Enabling Applet Library on the RDBMS server , as shown in FIG. H.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. G, the fourth step of the method involves distributing the CPIR-enabling Applet HTML tags to retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others who desire to deliver UPN-directed CPI search results to their customers, clients and the like. This distribution process may be carried out in a number of ways.","For example, in one embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. M, retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others would visit the IPI Central WWW site as shown in  and selected the Applet Tag Download\/Distribute Mode by selecting mode control button F, whereupon a (Java) GUI, is displayed in the display frame C. Within this GUI, a \u201cmaster\u201d list of executable files containing CPIR-enabling Applet tags is displayed for each consumer product registered within the system. The CPIR-enabling Applet tag containing file associated with any particular consumer product can be searched for by UPN, trademark, and\/or product descriptor, and once found, can be viewed and simply downloaded to a remote client computer system connected to the Internet using, for example, ftp or other electronic data or document interchange protocols (e.g. XML\/ICE) suitable for carrying out the <APPLET> tag transport process. Downloaded CPIR-enabling Applet tag containing files can be then stored in a local CPIR-enabling Applet\/Servlet Library maintained on a client computer until it is time to extract the Applet tag therefrom and embed the same into a particular HTML-encoded document.","In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. M, the distribution of CPIR-enabling Applet tags is enabled by providing a \u201cCPIR-enabling Applet Tag Download\u201d Link\/Button  on the Web page of each product being offered for sale in an EC-enabled store or product catalog maintained by a manufacturer, retailer or other party. This inventive feature should be most useful in EC-enabled Business-to-Business (i.e. Vendor-to-Retailer) UPC-based Product Catalogs such as, for example, QRS's Keystone UPC Product Catalog, where purchasing agents of retailers could download \u201cApplet tag containing\u201d files, along with product images and other product information after placing a purchase order therethrough, for use in constructing the retailer's EC-enabled (retailer-to-consumer) store or product catalog. Using this method of the present invention, consumers would be provided with instant manufacturer-defined product information prior to, and\/or after a consumer purchase at an EC-enable store on the WWW, thereby greatly improving the consumer shopping experience on the WWW.","As indicated at Block D in FIG. G, the fifth step of the method involves enabling retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others to (1) open the downloaded Applet tag containing files, (2) extract the CPIR-enabling HTML tags contained therewithin, and (3) embed (i.e. insert) one or more distributed CPIR-enabled Applet tags into acceptable HTML-encoded documents associated with EC-enabled WWW sites, EC-enabled storefronts and catalogs, Internet product advertisements, on-line auction-based WWW sites, or other types of Web-documents.","In general, this step of the method involves first creating or otherwise procuring a suitable HTML-encoded document which may understandably include other types of code (e.g. XML) therein, other than HTML code. While such HTML documents can be created using any HTML-editing program, such as BBD-Edit, it is expected that in most applications the underlying HTML-encoded document will be generated using tools such as: GO-LIVE\u00ae WWW-Site Development and Management solution software from Adobe Systems, Inc. to create the HTML pages associated with a particular WWW site; CatalogMaker\u2122 and CatalogManager electronic commerce solution software programs from RealEDI, Inc; Intershop 4 Enfinity\u2122 Electronic Commerce Solution software from Intershop Communications, Inc; and\/or any other commercially available HTML-authoring tools which enable quick and easy creation of HTML-encoded documents, and easy insertion of any downloaded CPIR-enabling Applet HTML tag using, for example, simple commands or drag-and-drop procedures.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. G, the sixth step of the method involves serving HTML documents with inserted CPIR-enabling Applet tags, from Internet information servers to Java-enabled client computer subsystems  operated by consumers at home, in the office, in EC-enabled and \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail stores, or on the road, as the case may be. As shown in FIG. H, such Internet information servers can include, for example, IPI servers , retailer-related EC-enabled information servers A, manufacturer-related EC-enabled information servers B, and\/or any other Internet (http or ftp) information servers operating on the Internet from which HTML-encoded document are served for any informational, educational, and\/or entertainment purpose.","As indicated at Block F in FIG. G, the seventh step of the method hereof involves using a Java-enabled client computer subsystem  to display served HTML-encoded documents having one or more CPIR-enabling Applet tags embedded therewithin. This step is carried out by the consumer pointing his or her Java-enabled browser program (e.g. Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer, or Sun Microsystems' HotJava program) to an HTML-encoded document within which a CPIR-enabling Java Applet tag is embedded, at a particular point of presence on the WWW.","As shown in FIGS. M through R, CPIR-enabling Applets can be graphically-encoded in a variety of different ways to provide the consumer with a visual indication that clicking on the graphical object, however manifested, will automatically result in a CPI search on a particular product identified by a UPN encoded within the associated Applet.","In the illustrative embodiments shown in FIGS. P, Q, R and S, servicemarks such as \u201cUPC Request\u2122 Cyberservice\u2122 URL Search\u201d serve to inform the consumer that the object, if selected from the displayed Web page, will cause a URL search to be performed with respect to the particular consumer product and the results thereof displayed the \u201cpoint of presence\u201d of the consumer which may be at a particular point in an EC-enabled store (e.g. at the check-out display screen or POS), at on-line auction site, at a Web-based product advertisement, or anywhere else on the WWW. Notably, an important advantage provided by this information search technique of the present invention is that it does not disturb the consumer at his or her point of presence (or sale), where ever that may be. Instead, the CPI-based search and display method of the present invention enables the delivery of accurate product-specific manufacturer-defined information at a particular point in Cyberspace by the consumer performing a single mouse-clicking operation. This enables the consumer to make an informed decision thereat based on the information displayed in the corresponding Java GUI generated upon launching the CPIR-enabling Applet at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW.","It is understood, however, that other techniques may be used to create a visual indication to the consumer that a CPIR-enabling Applet is located at a particular point on the WWW and that if this Applet is executed (e.g. by a single mouse-clicking operation), then a UPN-directed consumer product information search will be automatically executed and the results therefrom will be displayed within a Java GUI at that point of presence. One alternative technique would be to embed the CPIR-enabling Applet within a thumb-nail or large size photo-image of the consumer product being offered for sale, lease, auction, or other purpose on the WWW. Using this technique, the consumer need only click on the image to initiate a UPN-directed consumer product information search on the IPI Registrant Database (e.g. RDBMS Server ) of the system.","Notably, the person or persons responsible for delivering product advertisements to particular locations on one or more WWW sites can use the OPEN ADSTREAM\u2122 (OAS) 5.0 Internet Advertisement Management Solution software from Real Media, Inc., of New York, N.Y., and any other suitable software solution, running on the Internet (http) information server (, \u2032, A or B), and managed using an Web-enabled client subsystem , as shown in FIG. H. Using the OAS 5.0 advertisement management solution, and the CPI search and display method of the present invention described above, a webmaster or advertising manager assigned to a particular Internet information server (, \u2032, A or B) can: (1) access the Web-based product advertisement for a particular product (i.e. HTML code, image files, and any other rich media content associated therewith); (2) access previously downloaded CPIR-enabling Java Applet(s) for the consumer product, stored in a locally-maintained \u201cLibrary (i.e. Catalog) of CPIR-Enabling Applets\u201d on a client machine or server on the network, or directly access CPIR-enabling Java Applets from the centrally-maintained \u201cLibrary (i.e. Catalog) of CPIR-Enabling Applets\u201d illustrated in FIG. H; and (3) use Real Media's OAS 5.0 solution software to deliver both the Web-based product advertisement (i.e. its HTML code, and other media-rich content) and the corresponding CPIR-enabling Applet tag (and image files associated therewith) to a designated section on a particular Web page of a specific WWW-site.","It is understood that there are different ways of inserting\/embedding both of these objects within a particular section of an HTML-encoded document using the highly-advanced HTML-editing functionalities of the OAS 5.0 software system. For example, the Web-based product advertisement can be inserted within a first spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document (occupying the largest portion of the purchased Internet advertising space), while the CPIR-enabling client-side Applet is inserted within a second spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document occupying the balance of the purchased Internet advertising space. Alternatively, both the CPIR-enabling Applet and the Web-based product advertisement can be inserted within substantially the same spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document so as to achieve spatial overlap therebetween. This way when the consumer clicks on the advertisement image, or some preselected portion thereof, the underlying CPIR-enabling Applet will be automatically executed and the corresponding Java GUI generated for displaying the results of the UPN-directed database search.","In situations where the Internet product advertisement (e.g. banner advertisement) embodies a Java Applet tag which, when executed, produces a new Java GUI (i.e. new browser interface), then a CPIR-enabling Applet tag can be embedded within the HTML-encoded document displayed in the new Java GUI.","Other ways of embedding the Web-based advertisement and the related CPIR-enabling Applet tags will become apparent hereinafter to those skilled in the art having had the benefit of reading the present disclosure.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. G, the eight step in the method involves the consumer recognizing that a CPIR-enabling Applet tag is embedded within a Web-document displayed on a Java-enabled client computer subsystem , and thereafter launching\/executing the associated Applet to initiate a UPN-directed search within the RDBMS server  by performing a single mouse clicking operation.","Notably, the second illustrative embodiment described above has been described with particular focus given to CPIR-enabling Applets encoded with the UPN of a particular consumer product. It is understood, however, that the CPIR-enabling Applets of the present invention can be encoded with the trademark(s) used in connection with a particular consumer product, thus providing Trademark-encoded CPIR-enabling Applets, in contrast with UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling Applets. In such alternative embodiments, the encoded trademark would be used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in a new (independent) Java GUI generated at the point of Applet tag embodiment. Alternatively, a product descriptor associated with a particular product can be encoded within the corresponding CPIR-enabling Applet, used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in an independent Java GUI generated at the point of Applet tag embodiment.","The Third Applet-Driven Method of Accessing and Displaying Categorized UPN\/URL Link Menus from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem the Present Invention","After providing a brief overview on the system architecture of FIG. B and the nature of the client-side CPIR-enabling Applets deployed therewithin, the steps associated with Applet-driven CPI-acquisition method of the third illustrative embodiment will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. I, I, J and J.","In general, the method of FIGS. I and I, like that of FIGS. G and G, involves using a client-side CPIR-enabling Applet to automatically conduct a UPN-directed search on the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem hereof (i.e. RDBMS server ) in response to a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer on the HTML tag associated with the CPIR-enabling Applet. In the illustrative embodiment, the CPIR-enabling Applet of the present invention is a program written in the Java\u2122 programming language and has an HTML tag (indicated by <APPLET>) which is designed to be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image can be included therewithin (in accordance with the HTML 3.2 Specification).","In the method of the second illustrative embodiment, CPIR-enabling Applets are designed to work within a request\/response processing model, as shown in FIG. B. In this request\/response model, a client subsystem  sends a request message to the Java Web Server \u2032\u2033 and the server \u2032\u2033 responds by sending back a reply message. In the illustrative embodiment, requests come in the form of http, although it is understood that other protocols (e.g. ftp, EDI or a custom protocol) may be used. The request and the corresponding response reflect the state of the client and the server at the time of the request.","When using a Java-enabled browser to view a Web page containing a client-side CPIR-enabling Applet tag <APPLET>, the Applet's compiled class code is automatically accessed from the Java Web Server \u2032\u2033 and executed on the client-side of the network connection illustrated in FIG. B. Thus, as shown in FIG. B, the Java-enabled client machine  in this network architecture must run a Java-enabled browser program that provides a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for running\/executing Java Applets on the client-side thereof, in much the same way that Java Web Server \u2032 must provide a JVM for running Java servlets on the server side thereof, as shown in FIG. B.","With reference to FIG. B, the method of creating, loading, distributing, embedding and executing client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets in accordance with the principles of the present invention schematically illustrated in FIGS. I, I, J and J will now be described below.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. I, the first step of the method involves using the Java Applet API to write or otherwise author the source code for a client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet for each UPN-specified consumer product registered in the RDBMS server . In general, the source code for each client-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet (i.e. Applet) will embody one or more of following items of information: (i) the UPN of the particular product on which the CPI search is to be carried out and the search results thereof displayed; (ii) Java classes required for performing a UPN-directed search on the RDBMS server  using a \u201csocket connection\u201d between the Java-enabled client subsystem  and the Java Web Server \u2032\u2033, producing a particular Java GUI for displaying the results obtained from the UPN-directed search; and (iii) license-related information specifying the terms and conditions of the CPIR-enabling Applet license and conditions under which the CPIR-enabling Applet shall operate.","Notably, such license-related information may specify: (1) one or more specific host domains (e.g. www.homedepot.com or www.walmart.com ) from which a Web document containing the corresponding Applet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling Applet under a licensing program; (2) one or more general Internet domains (e.g. .com, org., .gov, .int, mil, .uk, etc.) from which a Web document containing the corresponding Applet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling Applet under a licensing program; (3) the time duration of the licensing period associated with the CPIR-enabling Applet; and (4) any other restrictions set by the associated manufacturer and\/or retailer, and\/or administrator of the consumer product information system of the present invention, that must be satisfied for a registered CPIR-enabled Applet to operate within a Web-document.","Notably, the Java source code for each CPIR-enabling Applet will vary depending upon implementation.

However, regardless of the particular implementation, it can be expected that each CPIR-enabling Applet designed, for example, to search an (Oracle-based JDBC) RDBMS Server  for current UPC\/URL list symbolically linked to a specified UPN and thereafter display the results in an independent Java GUI, will typically include Java source code specifying:\n\n","When using earlier versions of the HTML Specification (i.e. HTML 3.2 by the World Wide Web Consortium), the source code for each CPIR-enabling Java Applet will adhere to the general syntax of that the HTML 3.2 Specification. Also, if the HTML 4.0 Specification is used, then the source code for each CPIR-enabling Java Applet will adhere to the general syntax of the HTML 4.0 Specification, as discussed above.","After writing\/authoring the source code for the CPIR-enabling Java Applet, the Applet is ascribed a unique name such as, for example, \u201cUPNXXXXXXYYYYYZ\u201d for a 12 digit Uniform Product Code.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. K, the second step of the method involves compiling the source code of the Applet into Java bytecode, and then placing\/loading the classfiles for the Applet within the server_root\/Applets directory on the Java Web Server \u2033\u2033.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. K, the third step of the method involves for each UPN-specified consumer product, (1) containing the complete Applet HTML tag <APPLET> within an executable file, and (2) storing each such Applet tag containing file in the Central CPIR-Enabling Applet Library on the RDBMS server , as shown in FIG. J.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. I, the fourth step of the method involves distributing the CPIR-enabling Applet HTML tags to retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others who desire to deliver UPN-directed CPI search results to their customers, clients and the like. This distribution process may be carried out in several different ways which have been detailed hereinabove in connection with the second illustrative method illustrated in FIGS. G through H and described above.","As indicated at Block D in FIG. K, the fifth step of the method involves enabling retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others to (1) open the downloaded Applet tag containing files, (2) extract the CPIR-enabling HTML tags contained therewithin, and (3) embed (i.e. insert) one or more distributed CPIR-enabled Applet tags into acceptable HTML-encoded documents associated with EC-enabled WWW sites, EC-enabled storefronts and catalogs, Internet product advertisements, on-line auction-based WWW sites, or other types of Web-documents.","In general, this step of the method involves first creating or otherwise procuring a suitable HTML-encoded document which may understandably include other types of code (e.g. XML) therein, other than HTML code. While such HTML documents can be created using any HTML-editing program, such as BBD-Edit, it is expected that in most applications the underlying HTML-encoded document will be generated using tools such as: GO-LIVE\u00ae WWW-Site Development and Management solution software from Adobe Systems, Inc. to create the HTML pages associated with a particular WWW site; CatalogMaker\u2122 and CatalogManager electronic commerce solution software programs from RealEDI, Inc; Intershop 4 Enfinity\u2122 Electronic Commerce Solution software from Intershop Communications, Inc; and\/or any other commercially available HTML-authoring tools which enable quick and easy creation of HTML-encoded documents, and easy insertion of any downloaded CPIR-enabling Applet HTML tag using, for example, simple commands or drag-and-drop procedures.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. K, the sixth step of the method involves serving servlet tag encoded HTML documents from Internet information servers to Java-enabled client computer subsystems  operated by consumers at home, in the office, in EC-enabled and \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail stores, or on the road, as the case may be. As shown in FIG. H, such Internet information servers can include, for example, IPI servers , retailer-related EC-enabled information servers A, manufacturer-related EC-enabled information servers B, and\/or any other Internet (http or ftp) information servers operating on the Internet from which HTML-encoded document are served for any informational, educational, and\/or entertainment purpose.","As indicated at Block F in FIG. G, the seventh step of the method hereof involves using a Java-enabled client computer subsystem  to display served HTML-encoded documents having one or more of CPIR-enabling Applet tags embedded therewithin. This step is carried out by the consumer pointing his or her Java-enabled browser program (e.g. Netscape's Navigator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, or Sun Microsystems' HotJava program) to an HTML-encoded document within which a CPIR-enabling Java Applet tag is embedded, at a particular point of presence on the WWW. As shown in FIGS. M through R, CPIR-enabling Applets can be graphically-encoded in a variety of different ways as described in detail detailed hereinabove in connection with the second illustrative method illustrated in FIGS. G through H.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. G, the eighth step in the method involves the consumer recognizing that a CPIR-enabling Applet tag is embedded within a Web-document displayed on a Java-enabled client computer subsystem, and thereafter launching\/executing the associated Applet to initiate a UPN-directed search within the RDBMS server  by performing a single mouse clicking operation.","Notably, the third illustrative embodiment has been described with particular focus given to CPIR-enabling Applets encoded with the UPN of a particular consumer product. It is understood, however, that the CPIR-enabling Applets of the present invention can be encoded with the trademark(s) used in connection with a particular consumer product, thus providing Trademark-encoded CPIR-enabling Applets, in contrast with UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling Applets. In such alternative embodiments, the encoded trademark would be used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in a new (independent) Java GUI generated at the point of Applet tag embodiment. Alternatively, a product descriptor associated with a particular product can be encoded within the corresponding CPIR-enabling Applet, used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in an independent Java GUI generated at the point of Applet tag embodiment.","While the illustrative embodiments described above have employed Java Applet technology, which is designed to work with nearly all modern Internet browser programs, it is understood, however, that it is possible to use Active-X type objects (i.e. Active-X Applets) embedded within Web-documents, such as XML and SGML encoded documents including Active Server Pages (ASPs) from the Microsoft Corporation, in order to implement UPN-directed methods or the present invention at the point of presence of the consumer within a Cyberspace environment. Such alternative embodiments are a straightforward application of the techniques and technology disclosed hereinabove and thus fall within the scope and spirit of the present invention.","Also, while the above-described method of information searching, access and display has been described in connection with consumer products, it is understood that the principles of the present invention can also be used to deliver Web-based information to consumers in connection with a particular consumer service which has been assigned a Universal Service Number (USN) that functions in a similar manner to a UPN used in connection with a particular consumer product. In such alternative embodiments, the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  can be readily extended to contain symbolic links between Universal Service Numbers (USN) and URLs to form a UPS\/URL database along the principles described hereinabove.","Also, the CPIR-enabling Applets of the present invention may be modified to provide consumers with general access to any IPI WWW site in accordance with the present invention, and not necessarily a product-specific Cyber-Service\u2122 search, as described above. Thus, for example, in the case where the CPIR-enabling Applet is not encoded with any particular UPN, then the CPIR-enabling Applet will generate and display a pop-up Java GUI at the point where its Applet tag (or related image IMG) is embedded. Such as Java GUI could be designed to enable either (1) a generalized (unrestricted) consumer product information display, as would be desired at WWW search Engines\/Directories such as Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Alta-Vista, and the like, or (2) a restricted consumer product information display, as would be desired by a particular retailer operating an EC-enabled store or on-line catalog where browsing for merchandise not carried in the store or catalog is not to be encouraged.","An example of a CPIR-enabling Applet designed to produce a Java GUI for the \u201cmanufacturer-unrestricted or generalized\u201d UPC Request CPI Service is illustrated in FIGS. N and Q by using a graphical icon or button, displayed on the lower portion of each display screen, and labeled as \u201cUPC REQUEST\u2122 CENTRAL Product Information Search\u201d. An example of the Java GUIs produced by these CPIR-enabling Applets are illustrated in FIG. N and Q, respectively.","An example of a CPIR-enabling Applet designed to produce a CPID-enabling Java GUI for the \u201cmanufacturer-restricted\u201d UPC Request Retailer CPI Service is indicated in FIG. O by a graphical icon or button, displayed on the lower portion of each display screen, and labeled as \u201cUPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Product Information @ SPORTS PLACE\u201d. An example of the Java GUI produced by this CPIR-enabling Applet is indicated in FIG. O. Notably, this type of CPIR-enabling Applet provides consumers with desired information about the UPN-encoded product, while disabling the consumer from browsing for merchandise not carried in the EC-oriented store or catalog of the hosting retailer.","As illustrated above, in the case where the CPIR-enabling Applet is encoded with a particular UPN, then the function of the CPIR-enabling Applet will be to generate and display an independent pop-up Java GUI at the point where the Applet tag (or associated image) is embedded, for displaying the search results made against the consumer product identified by the UPN embodied within the CPIR-enabling Applet. An example of a CPIR-enabling Applet designed to produce a CPID-enabling Java GUI for a Cyber-Service URL Search is indicated in FIGS. P and R by a graphical icon or button, displayed on the lower portion of each display screen, and labeled as \u201cUPC REQUEST\u2122 Cyber-Service\u2122 URL Search.\u201d Notably, operation of this type of CPIR-enabling Applet can be restricted to a particular retailer (or manufacturer) by the inclusion of a domain name constraint within the Applet itself, as described hereinabove. In the case of the Cyber-Service URL Search of the System, the executed CPIR-enabling Applet automatically returns for display a menu of categorized URLs symbolically linked to the encoded UPN by the manufacturer and\/or its agent. It would be desirable to embed this type of CPIR-enabling Applet on Web-documents in EC-enabled stores and on-line catalogs of a particular retailer or manufacturer, displaying consumer products to be purchased, as well as on Web-documents serving as Internet-based product advertisements.","Referring to FIGS. N and N, the above-described method of CPI searching and display will now be illustrated in the context of browsing a WWW Search Directory or Engine, and looking for a simple yet effective way of finding accurate consumer product related information on a particular product, or class of products. When searching for consumer product information at a WWW Search Directory or Engine, such as Yahoo, Excite, Alta Vista, Lycos, etc., it will be desirable for the consumer to search against all manufacturers within the entire UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  before returning the search results to the consumer for display. Therefore, in this sort of Cyberspace environment, it will be oftentimes desirable to embed a CPIR-enabling Applet in the home-page of the WWW search directory or engine so that, upon clicking the graphical icon thereof, an independent Java GUI to the UPC Request Central WWW site will be automatically produced so that all modes of searching are made available to the consumer against all manufacturers registered (and possibly unregistered) within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , as shown in FIG. N. Notably, this Java GUI is very similar to the Java GUI set forth in .","Referring to FIGS. O through O, the above-described method of CPI searching and display is illustrated in a different context, wherein a consumer is shopping\/browsing an EC-enabled storefront of a particular retailer, and considering whether or not to make an on-line purchase of a particular consumer product displayed within the catalog pages thereof. In this sort of environment, the retailer will typically prefer that the consumer can only search on manufacturers of merchandise being offered for sale within the EC-enabled store, lest the consumer be encouraged to leave upon finding out that what he or she is looking for is available in a different retail store, and not the store at which he or she is present. Therefore, in this sort of Cyberspace environment, it will be oftentimes desirable to embed a CPIR-enabling Applet in the home-page (or other conspicuous locations) of each retailer's WWW EC store so that, upon clicking the graphical icon thereof, an independent Java GUI to the UPC Request Retailer WWW site \u201c@ the retailer store\u201d will be automatically produced so that all modes of searching are made available to the consumer against only those manufacturers registered (and possibly unregistered) with the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  which supply consumer products for sale within the particular retail store, as shown in FIG. O. Notably, this Java GUI is similar to the Java GUI set forth in , except that a \u201cmanufacturer filter\u201d set by the retailer UPC product catalog is used to filter out the search results displayed on the Java GUI.","Referring to FIGS. P and P, it can be seen that the consumer within the EC-enabled store shown in FIGS. O and O has proceeded to look at a particular product in the retail store (e.g. the \u201cUltralite Dagger Mountain Bike\u201d being offered for sale for $285.00). At this point of presence within the EC-enabled retail store, the consumer might like to review the very best information published wherever on the WWW relating to this particular consumer product. Therefore, in this sort of Cyberspace environment, it will be desirable to embed a CPIR-enabling Applet within or near the image of this product in the retailer's EWW BC store so that, upon clicking the graphical icon thereof, a \u201cUPC Request Cyber-Service URL Search\u201d will be automatically carried out within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , and the search results thereof displayed in a Java GUI, as shown in FIG. P. As shown, the Java GUI displays a menu-formatted list of categorized URLs that have been symbolically linked to the UPN of the consumer product on which the search inquiry was initiated. Typically, this menu of URLs, accessed from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , would have been updated as early as the night before during UPN\/URL link updating\/management operations carried out between (i) the UPN\/URL catalog maintained in a client computer subsystem  within the backoffice of the manufacturer, and (ii) the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem , , using electronic data interchange processes based on any one of number of protocols (e.g. ftp, EDI, XML\/ICE, etc.).","Referring to FIGS. Q through Q, the above-described method of CPI display is illustrated in the context of a consumer visiting an on-line EC-enabled auction site (e.g. at http:\/\/www.ebay.com), and considering whether or not to place a bid on a particular consumer product displayed within the auction listings thereof. In general, this environment is similar to the situation where a consumer finds him\/herself searching for consumer product information at a WWW Search Directory or Engine, such as Yahoo, Excite, Alta Vista, Lycos, etc. In such an environment, it will be desirable for the consumer to search against all manufacturers within the entire UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  before returning the search results to the consumer for display. Therefore, in this sort of Cyberspace environment, it will be oftentimes desirable to embed a CPIR-enabling Applet in the home-page of the WWW on-line auction site so that, upon clicking the graphical icon thereof, an independent Java GUI to the UPC Request Central WWW site will be automatically produced so that all modes of searching are made available to the consumer against all manufacturers registered (and possibly unregistered) within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , as shown in FIG. Q. Notably, this Java GUI is very similar to the Java GUI set forth in .","Referring to FIG. R and R, it can be seen that the consumer within the on-line auction site shown in FIGS. Q and Q has proceed to look at a particular item being auctioned off (e.g. the \u201cSony Mavica MVC-FD81\u201d at a current bid of $420.50). At this point of presence within the on-line auction site, the consumer might very well like to review the very best information published wherever on the WWW relating to this particular consumer product. Therefore, in this sort of Cyberspace environment, it will also be desirable to embed a CPIR-enabling Applet within or near the title of the product being auctioned (or image thereof if available) so that, upon clicking the graphical icon thereof, a \u201cUPC Request Cyber-Service\u201d URL Search will be automatically carried out within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , and the search results thereof displayed in a CPID-enabling Java GUI, as shown in FIG. R. As shown, this Java GUI displays a menu-formatted list of categorized URLs that have been symbolically linked to the UPN of the auctioned consumer product on which the search inquiry was initiated. Typically, this categorized menu of URLs, accessed from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , would have been updated as early as the night before during daily UPN\/URL link updating\/management operations carried out in the manner described hereinabove.","Referring to FIGS. S through S, the above-described method of CPI searching and display is illustrated in the context of a consumer visiting a typical WWW site (e.g. the Applicant's Intellectual Property Law Firm at http:\/\/www.tjpatlaw.com), whereupon an Internet advertisement is presented for a particular consumer product, solely for illustrative purposes. At this point of presence on the WWW, the consumer might very well like to review information published on the WWW relating to the advertised consumer product. Therefore, in this sort of Cyberspace environment, it will also be desirable to embed a CPIR-enabling Applet within, closely near, or immediately about the space of the advertisement so that, upon clicking the image associated thereof, a \u201cUPC Request Cyber-Service\u201d URL Search will be automatically carried out within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , and the search results thereof displayed in a CPID-enabling Java GUI, as shown in FIG. S. As shown, this Java GUI displays a menu-formatted list of categorized URLs that have been symbolically linked to the UPN of the advertised consumer product on which the search inquiry was initiated. Typically, this categorized menu of URLs, accessed from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , would have been updated as early as the night before UPN\/URL link updating\/management operations carried out in the manner described hereinabove.","In situations where the advertisement itself embodies a Java-Applet, as in the case of most banner-type advertisements, it would be desirable to embed the CPIR-enabling Applet within the HTML-encoded document displayed within the new Java GUI generated when the Java-Applet is executed by the consumer upon his or her initial encounter of the advertisement. Upon the display of the menu-formatted list of categorized URLs within the CPID-enabling Java GUI, the consumer can easily access different Web-documents containing information related to the advertised consumer product by simply selecting the URL and linking to the information resource to which it points on the WWW. Notably, the displayed URL menu would include (i) one or more URLs pointing to EC-enabled stores and on-line catalogs at which the advertised product can be purchased over the Internet, as well as (ii) one or more URLs pointing to \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d type retail stores at which the advertised product can be purchased in the stream of commerce.","As shown in FIG. S, the consumer having accessed the product-specific search results of FIG. S, may then select, from the displayed URL Menu, a URL displayed in the \u201cBuy On The Web\u201d URL category thereof, thereby automatically linking to the EC-enabled store or product catalogue specified by the selected URL, as shown in FIG. S, and thus enabling the purchase of the advertised product or service thereat. Preferably, the EC-enabled store or product catalog employs the \u201cone-click purchase order\u201d placement system and method taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,411 to Hartman, et al., and assigned to Amazon.com, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This would simplify ordering the product by the retailer having the consumer's credit card and shipping address information on file.","Thus, the CPI-based search and display method of the present invention gives rise to a new method of and system for purchasing consumer products over the Internet (e.g. WWW) comprising the steps of: embedding a UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling Applet within the HTML-code of a consumer product advertisement, wherein the CPIR-enabling Applet, when executed, automatically displays a categorized URL menu containing one or more URLs pointing to one or more EC-enabled stores or on-line catalogs on the WWW at which the consumer product identified by the encoded UPN can be purchased and delivered to a particular address in physical space.","Referring to FIGS. T through T, the above-described method of CPI searching and display is illustrated in the context of a consumer visiting a particular on-line electronic trading WWW site (e.g. http:\/\/www\/etrade.com). At this site, the consumer is assumed to be reviewing the performance chart of a particular consumer product company displayed at this electronic trading WWW site, and is considering whether or not to buy, keep or sell securities (e.g. stock or bonds) in this consumer product company. At this point of presence on the WWW, the consumer decides that he or she would like to first ascertain specific information about the company's products by initiating a trademark\/company name-directed CPI search according to the principles of the present invention. In accordance with the present invention, this would be achieved by the consumer identifying a client-side or server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet embedded within the HTML code of the performance chart displayed at the on-line electronic trading WWW site. In the illustrated embodiment, the CPIR-enabling Applet is graphically indicated by an associated graphical image (e.g. UPC Request\u2122 Cyber-Service\u2122 Trademark-Directed URL Search) and is encoded with the trademark an\/or company name of a particular manufacturer\/vendor associated with the display performance chart. Notably, the creation, distribution and embedding of such CPIR-enabling Applets must be carried out well in advance of the consumer arriving at the particular point of presence shown in FIG. T. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, when the consumer performs a single mouse-clicking operation on the graphical image associated with the embedded CPIR-enabling Java Applet, the underlying CPIR-enabling Applet is executed and a trademark-directed URL search is automatically made against the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof. Quickly thereafter, the results from the trademark\/company name directed search are automatically displayed in a Java GUI on the browser of the requesting consumer's client machine, as shown in FIG. T. As shown, the consumer is free to scroll through the displayed GUI, looking for URLs on particular consumer products of the manufacturer\/vendor.","Preferably, in the above application, each entry in the displayed Trademark Search Results screen shown in FIG. T is itself a CPIR-enabling Java Servlet which, when clicked upon, automatically initiates a UPN-directed CPI search against a particular product of the manufacturer related to the displayed stock performance chart, as taught in great detail hereinabove. This novel technique will greatly simplify accessing and displaying accurate and up-to-date UPC\/URL menus on the products offered by a particular company in which a consumer is considering buying, keeping or selling a particular number of financial securities. Also, while conducting such on-line CPI research, the consumer may also consider purchasing a particular consumer product at an EC-enabled store or product catalog, as illustrated in FIG. S, supra.","Overview of Modes of Operation for IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem","In order to enter a primary mode of operation of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem, the consumer, retail sales clerk or retailer selects a particular mode activation button (e.g. A, B, C, D, E, or F) displayed in the control frame B of the Java GUI browser program at the requesting client subsystem . Upon making the selection, the Web browser at the client subsystem  automatically requests a particular HTML-encoded form (typically residing on the IPD Server(s) ). In general, each mode activation button A through F can be linked to a client-side or server-side Java Applet tag embedded within an HTML-cncoded document, or directly to a predefined static-type HTML form corresponding to the selected mode of operation. In the case of Java Applets, upon selecting the mode selection button, a Java GUI is automatically produced and displayed within the information display frame C of the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem. In the case of the directly-linked static-type HTML forms, a GUI in the form of HTML document is automatically produced and displayed within the information display frame C of the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem. In either case, the HTML-encoded form corresponds to the selected mode and is linked to a Java method (or CGI script) related to the selected mode and possibly to other methods or forms required to carry out the database access and\/or management process associated therewith. The requesting client subsystem then enters the information requested by the HTML form displayed within the information display frame C of the Web browser's GUI interface. Information entry into the HTML form can be carried out using bar code symbol reading equipment, keyboard or keypad, speech dictation equipment (by Dragon Systems, Inc. of Newton, Mass.), and the like.","In general, the particular messages which will be displayed within the HTML forms during any particular mode of operation will depend upon several factors namely: whether the IPI Web-site is intended for access by bar code driven kiosks (i.e. client subsystems ) as shown, for example, in FIGS. A, A, A, and A located within retail environments; or whether the IPI Web-site is intended for access by desktop, laptop and palmtop client computer systems  as shown, for example, in FIG. A located at home, in the office or on the road.","For example, if the IPI Web-site supported by the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof is intended for access by bar code driven kiosks, then the HTML documents related to the IPI Website will be particularly adapted to facilitate the use of bar code symbol readers at the client subsystem. This way UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN symbols) can be easily entered into the subsystem without manual key-entry operations. In contrast, if the IPI Web-site supported by the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof is intended for access by client subsystems not having bar code symbol readers (e.g. Web-enabled computer systems at home, in the office or on the road), then the HTML documents related to the IPI Website will be particularly adapted to facilitate the use of data-entry display screens at the client subsystem. This way, UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN symbols) can be easily entered into the subsystem using bar code symbol scanners avoiding manual key-entry operations. In the illustrative embodiment, bar code-code driven and manual data-entry IPI Websites are served from a \u201cframed\u201d Java GUI, in which the control strip B has six (6) Check Boxes A through F described above to enable the consumer, retail sales\/service personnel as well as manufacturers to select the particular mode of operation that suits his or her consumer product information needs at any particular instance in time.","It understood that the use of Java Applets (including Servlets) will be most beneficial in constructing Java-based IPI Central and retail WWW sites, as indicated above, and in most instances will be preferable over static HTML documents and CGIs linking the IPD (http) server  to the backend RBDMS servers  of the system. However, for purposes of illustration only, the six primary modes of operation of the system will be described below using a CGI implementation, illustrated in FIG. B. However, it is understood that implementations using CPIR-enabling Servlets as shown in FIG. BI can be used to replace such CGI constructions. Also, implementations using CPIR-enabling Applets as shown in FIGS. B and B can be used to enable access to the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  and its supporting RDBMS servers.","Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem C, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.  provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its","Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of Operation.","As indicated at Block A in , when selected from the user interface of an IPI Website, the first Check Box type button A automatically activates the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s) \u2033 based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box. As indicated at Block B in , this causes a HTML-encoded document residing on the IPD Server \u2033 shown in FIG. B, to requesting client subsystem  or display on the information display frame C thereof. The HTML document of the illustrative embodiment displays several types of information relevant to the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode, namely: eligibility requirements (i.e. qualifications) for a manufacturer to register with the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem; optional ways of registering consumer products and product-related information with the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem hereof ; ways of acquiring computer software necessary for managing consumer product-related information (e.g. UPNs, URLs, trademarks and product descriptors) on a particular computing platform using EDI (or XML\/EDI) techniques supported by the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem ; etc; and one or more Check Boxes embodying links (i.e. anchors) to HTML documents, CGI scripts and the like designed to facilitate this mode of operation. Notably, at least one of these HTML documents will be located on the Web Document Server  of the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem , providing manufacturers (and\/or their designated information-managers and agents) with a point of entry into the manufacturer\/product registration process hereof. As indicated at Block C in , the manufacturer and or its agent follow the instructions displayed on the HTML document, linking to the Web Document Server  of the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem  and filling out the various HTML forms transmitted to the requesting client subsystem, downloading Web-based EDI (or XML\/EDI) software for UPN\/URL management; and the like. While carrying out registration of manufacturers with the subsystem is relatively straightforward, there are a number of different ways of carrying out the Product Registration Mode of the subsystem. These alternative techniques will be described below.","The first method illustrated in  and - involves carrying out FTP between a client subsystem of the registering manufacturer (or its agent) Mand IPD Server \u2033 in order to update the IPI Registrant Database associated therewith. This can be carried out by the manufacturer's officer or agent surfing to the IPI Website, selecting the \u201cProduct Registration Mode\u201d from the control strip, and then following the instructions displayed on the various screens of the Website in this mode. When using the first method, product UPCs, URLs and other information elements can be formatted within suitable Product Registration Forms and transmitted by FTP from the client subsystem or Database Server of a registering manufacturer to the IPD Server \u2033 so that the IPI Registrant Database thereof can be updated accordingly. The first method will be desirable typically when registering a few consumer-products.","The second method illustrated in , involves first carrying out EDI between a client subsystem of the registering manufacturer (or its agent) and the UPN\/URL Database Subsystem , and then carrying out FTP or SMTP between the client subsystem and IPD Server \u2033 in order to update the IPI Registrant Database maintained therein. The second method will be desirable when a manufacturer needs or desires to register a large number of consumer-products. The details of these information transmission methods will be described below.","When using the second method, conventional EDI protocols or more modern protocols (e.g. XML\/ICE) can be used to transmit product UPCs, URLs and other information elements from client subsystems or database servers of manufactures to the UPN\/URL Database Subsystem  of the present invention. FTP can be used to transmit UPCs and URLs from the UPN\/URL Database Subsystem to each IPD Server in the system so that the IPI Registrant Database thereof can be updated accordingly. Once registered with the system using either of these methods in the Product Registration Mode, such consumer-products can be easily found on the Internet by anyone wishing to use the product finding techniques of the present invention.","The third method involves carrying out electronic data and document interchange over the Internet between the WebDox Remote\u2122 Computer System  and the WebDox\u2122 Server  of the system of the present invention, and communication between the WebDox\u2122 Server  and the WebDox\u2122 Admin computer system  of the system hereof. The various steps involved in this embodiment of the consumer product registration process will be described in detail below.","When the manufacturer selects the \u201cProduct Registration Mode\u201d of the system, a Manufacturer Registration Form is automatically downloaded from the WebDox\u2122 Server  to the Manufacturer's client computer system  (i.e. the WebDox Remote\u2122 Computer System). At the end of the downloading process, a Manufacturer Registration Form is presented (i.e. displayed) and the manufacturer then enters some requested identification information (e.g. Manufacturer's Company Name, Address, Name of CEO and President, phone number, 6-digit Manufacturer Identification Number assigned by the UCC, etc.) and presses the \u201cSend\u201d button on the Manufacturer Registration Form. The form is then transmitted immediately via the Internet and received by the WebDox\u2122 Server . At the WebDox\u2122 Server , an automated process takes the information in the Manufacturer Registration Form and registers the Manufacturer with the system.","Upon registering the manufacturer with the system, the manufacturer is asked to select which version of \u201ccustomized\u201d WebDox Remote\u2122 software (i.e. the UPN\/URL Registration Application) the manufacturer would like downloaded to its client computer system  (e.g. WebDox Remote with UPN\/URL Database and CGI scripts for MacOS WebServer, WebDox Remote with UPN\/URL Database and CGI scripts for UNIX Web Server, or WebDox Remote with UPN\/URL Database and CGI scripts for NT Web Server). Once the manufacturer makes its selection, the customized WebDox Remote software is automatically downloaded to the manufacturer's client computer system . This downloaded software includes a computer program that automatically generates (on the manufacturer's) client subsystem, a relational database management system (RDBMS) which allows the manufacturer (or its agents) to easily construct and maintain a UPN\/URL database (akin to that specified in FIG. A) but restricted to containing information relating only to the manufacturer's products. Thus, when the manufacturer attempts to enter a UPC number into the manufacturer's UPN\/URL database that does not contain the 6-digit Manufacturer Identification Number assigned to the manufacturer by the UCC, the RDBMS automatically blocks all such information entries. Consequently, the UPN\/URL database can only maintain information pertaining to the registered manufacturer's products and information relating thereto on the Internet. As the manufacturer adds or removes products from its retail or wholesale line, the database administrator simply adds or removes the UPC and URL information relating thereto from the RDBMS. As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, such database changes are periodically transmitted to the WebDox\u2122 Server  so that the IPI Registrant Database (i.e. master UPN\/URL database) of the system (maintained on the IPD Servers thereof) can be updated in a timely manner.","Preferably, the limited or restricted version of the UPN\/URL database maintained by each registered manufacturer on its client subsystem  is connected to the manufacturer's Internet Server \u2032 (or B) by a CGI script or Java method, as shown in  and -. In this way, the manufacturer's limited version of the UPN\/URL database can be made accessible to consumers world-wide from the manufacturer's Website which, in the illustrative embodiment, is assumed to be hosted on an Internet information server \u2032 or B that is similar to an IPI Server  described in detail hereinabove. In order to simplify the process of serving of the manufacturer's limited-version of the UPN\/URL database on the WWW, it is preferred that the CGI script , input forms, output forms, and methods for searching and the displaying the results from the limited-version UPN\/URL database are predesigned for use with manufacturer's Internet Server \u2032 (taking into consideration its operating system and the like). This way, prior to registration the manufacturer need only make a selection of the type of customized WebDox Remote\u2122 software it needs for its computing and Internet serving platform(s). Then, during software download, the WebDox Server  simply transmits the suitable version of the customized WebDox Remote\u2122 software to the manufacturer so that it can create, maintain and serve (on the WWW) its limited version of the UPN\/URL database in a \u201cturn-key\u201d manner.","In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the homepage of each registered manufacturer's Website will display a visually conspicuous radio button labeled \u201cUPC Request\u2122 Product Finder\u201d or the like. Moreover, whenever a consumer attempts to search the manufacturer's limited-version UPN\/URL database for products not registerable to the manufacturer (i.e. using UPC numbers not containing the manufacturer's 6-digit UCC Manufacturer Identification Number), the limited-version of the UPN\/URL database will automatically display an HTML-encoded message from the manufacturer's Website, urging the consumer to surf to the IPI Registrant Database of the system (maintained on the network of IPD servers ). Preferably, such HTML-encoded messages will have a hot-linked URL (i.e. anchor) to Website(s) providing consumer access to the \u201cmaster\u201d UPN\/URL database.","The WebDox Remote\u2122 computer system  available to each registered manufacturer has both online and offline modes of operation. In the offline mode, the manufacturer responds to a UPN\/URL Registration Request from the WebDox\u2122 Server in the following manner. First, the WebDox Remote\u2122 software analyzes the limited-version of the UPN\/URL database that has been currently created and maintained by the manufacturer or its designee. Thereafter, the WebDox software automatically creates a UPN\/URL Registration Response document which contains a set of currently active URLs specifying the address location of Web-based information resources associated with each UPC-encoded product of the manufacturer. Then, WebDox Remote\u2122 program establishes an Internet connection with the WebDox\u2122 Server, through a \u201cGet\/Send Mail\u201d option. This delivers the UPN\/URL Registration Response (document) to the WebDox\u2122 Server  and retrieves any documents which are waiting thereat for the manufacturer. These new documents are listed by WebDox Remote\u2122 program and presented in the InBasket of the manufacturer's WebDox Remote\u2122 computer system .","In the online mode, WebDox Remote\u2122 (under the control of the Form Application) can also send UPN\/URL Registration Request documents immediately. For very sensitive applications (i.e. Just-in-Time), this ensures that the UPN\/URL Registration Response document is received at the WebDox\u2122 Server  the moment that the manufacturer completes the document.","In general, the WebDox\u2122 Server  provides a high-volume document processing and mailboxing environment between the WebDox Server and the WebDox Remote\u2122 system of each registered manufacturer. WebDox\u2122 Server  performs: permanent storage and tracking of all UPN\/URL Registration Request documents sent and UPN\/URL Registration Response documents received; automatic reconciliation of acknowledgments from WebDox Remote\u2122 program; automatic creation of user-friendly receipt messages to the manufacturer; \u201cmailboxing\u201d of outbound UPN\/URL Registration documents for retrieval by manufacturer; and automatic manufacturer and profile creation based on forms received from manufacturers. The WebDox\u2122 Server  consists of online components that run as extensions to Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) using the ISAPI interface. This provides higher performance and lower hardware requirements than a conventional CGI Web Interface. Processing intensive tasks are performed asynchronously from the Web server. An integrated queuing and dispatching system manages the processing of documents and interaction with the corresponding application. For large volume situations, the WebDox\u2122 Server components can be deployed on different machines, the WebDox\u2122 Server components (ISAPI extensions) on one machine, the processing components and database on another machine.","Data for UPN\/URL Registration Request documents to be sent to manufacturers is extracted from the IPI Registrant Database using an interface or utility program. The document data (e.g. information fields associated with UPN\/URL registration) can then be accepted by WebDox in a direct manner after formatting. The UPN\/URL Registration Request document should be formatted to a file structure created during the design of the UPN\/URL Registration Application. The WebDox\u2122 Server  then converts the application data into a UPN\/URL Registration request document (i.e. data package). The data package for each manufacturer is then stored (as a message) in an assigned Mailbox of the WebDox\u2122 Server . These messages are then available to be retrieved by the registered manufacturers using WebDox Remote's\u2122 \u201cGet\/Send Mail\u201d feature.","As discussed above, the WebDox Remote\u2122 program transmits messages (e.g. UPN\/URL Registration Response documents) to the WebDox\u2122 Server , where, after passing security checks, they are placed in the WebDox Mailbox system. Incoming (document) messages are received from the Mailbox, processed, and converted into data files for direct transfer to the database management system handling the IPI Registrant Database.","For each document received, the WebDox\u2122 Server  will return a message to the manufacturer confirming receipt of the document. WebDox Remote\u2122 system also returns delivery confirmations to the WebDox Server. These messages are used by the WebDox\u2122 Server to track the status of messages. WebDox\u2122 Server  maintains Mailbox Files for all inbound and outbound messages. The status of messages is updated on an ongoing basis as acknowledgement messages are received, allowing timely and precise audits.","WebDox Admin\u2122 Computer system  provides an easy-to-use tool to manage the community of manufacturers, review the status of documents, and configure the WebDox\u2122 Server , including: ad hoc maintenance of manufacturer information; online display of the Mailbox permitting inquiry into document status or document activity for particular manufacturers, and the ability to reset document status; creation and maintenance of UPN\/URL Registration Profiles; preparation of \u201creleases\u201d of new and updated UPN\/URL Registration Applications; Distribution of new and updated UPN\/URL Registration Applications; and automatic inventory and tracking of UPN\/URL Registration Applications distributed to manufacturers.","In the preferred embodiment, UPN\/URL Registration Application design and development is carried out on a Windows 95 or NT workstation. The UPN\/URL Registration Application is developed, tested, and then fully implemented for production with manufacturers. New or updated UPN\/URL Registration Applications are registered with the WebDox Admin\u2122 computer system  and are then distributed to the manufacturers as described herein above.","In the preferred embodiment, UPN\/URL Registration Applications are developed using Microsoft Visual Basic\u2122 and related software tools. These products provide rapid design and creation of the screen-based forms that the manufacturer uses. In addition, the \u201cintelligence\u201d behind the form, in the UPN\/URL Registration Application, can be very powerful, making the manufacturer's work easier while ensuring that the user and Server application receive high quality data.","The WebDox Admin\u2122 system handles the distribution of UPN\/URL Registration Applications to manufacturers. New UPN\/URL Registration Applications can be sent to some or all of the existing manufacturers assigned UPC Manufacturer Identification Numbers. Updates to UPN\/URL Registration Applications can be sent to manufacturers who are currently using that UPN\/URL Application. The actual update is distributed by sending a small notification message to each manufacturer, which then results in the remote site downloading the new forms from the WebDox\u2122 Server , as hereinbefore described above.","Notably, the WebDoc\u2122 Solution described above provides one way and means of implementing a method of electronic data and document interchange between client machines of manufacturers and the IPI Registrant Database (i.e. master UPN\/URL database in subsystem ) of the system of the present invention. It is understood, however, that many different types of electronic data interchange solutions (e.g. XML or XML\/EDI) can be used to practice the system and method of UPN\/URL database management in an efficient and timely manner so that consumers will always be provided with up-to-date URL links on the Internet. For example, the new CenterStage 4 Application Suite from On Display, Inc. of San Ramon Calif., can be used to enable XML-based electronic data interchange (i.e. transfer) between the client computer subsystems  operated within the backoffices of manufacturers, and the IPI Registrant Database (i.e. master UPN\/URL database) of the system hereof operated in the backoffice of the system administrator. Manufacturers (i.e. vendors) can format their data transactions in any of the many new languages of electronic-business (e.g. cXML, RosettaNet, CBL, BizTalk, OBI, ICE proprietary formats, or standard EDI formats such as ANSI X12), and the CenterStage 4 platform will automatically convert their transactions into the chosen formats of the system administrator responsible for managing the master UPN\/URL database.","For further details on the use of electronic data interchange technologies in order to realize this functionality of the system of the present invention, reference can be made to the following technical publications: \u201cXML\/EDI: Cyber Assisted Business in Practice\u201d (1999) by Dick Raman (ISBN: 90-8050233-2-1); The A to Z of EDI and Its Role in E-Commerce\u201d Second Edition, 1998) by Nahid Jilovec, published by Duke Communications, Inc., Loveland, Colo.; \u201cElectronic Commerce With EDI: A Guide For Decision Makers\u201d (1998), by Robert L. Sullivan, published by Twain, Inc. North Andover, Mass.; and \u201cWild's WWW: Technical Foundations of the World Wide Web\u201d (1999) by Erik Wilde, published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; each said publication incorporated herein by reference as of set forth herein.","In , there is disclosed a novel distributed method of collecting, managing and transmitting UPN\/URL menus for consumer products. Notably, this distributed system and method will be useful in large corporate environments, where departmentalization is the general rule. As shown, instead of each manufacturer having a single EDI-enabled workstation (equipped with EDI or EDI\/XML software)  for carrying out UPN\/URL management operations, a group of EDI-enabled client computers  are connected to a local or wide area network  via a network-centric Web (http) server  using a network router  to interface with the infrastructure of the Internet, as well as the other local or wide area network  as shown in . Preferably, each client computer  on the LAN or WAN is equipped with UPN\/URL management software for managing the consumer product information collected in the UPN\/URL Database for a particular manufacturer, as shown in FIGS. A through B.","In one arrangement, each manufacturer-operated client machine  would be assigned the task of managing the UPN\/URLs associated with a particular department of the manufacturer (e.g. engineering department, sales department, service\/support department, marketing department, advertising department, etc.). The UPN\/URLs menus and other CPI related information collected by each department is maintained within a local UPN\/URL Database  on the department's client machine , and is periodically transmitted to a Manufacturer's UPN\/URL Database  hosted on the network Internet server . In addition to providing the client machine behind the corporate firewall with http, e-mail and ftp services, the network Internet server  is also equipped with an EDI (e.g. EDI or XML\/ICE) software solution which enables periodic uploading of the manufacturer's UPN\/URL Database  to the Central UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , shown in .","Another arrangement, each manufacturer-operated client machine  would be assigned the task of managing the UPN\/URLs associated with a particular department of the manufacturer (e.g. engineering department, sales department, service\/support department, marketing department, advertising department, etc.). The UPN\/URLs menus and other CPI related information collected by each department is maintained within a local UPN\/URL Database  on the department's client machine , and is periodically transmitted directly to the Central UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , shown in . In such an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the network Internet server  would provide each client machine behind the corporate firewall with http, e-mail and ftp services in a conventional manner, but not maintain a central manufacturer's UPN\/URL database .","The primary advantage of the above described techniques for distributed UPN\/URL management hereof is that such techniques provide manufacturers with a revolutionary way of and means for enlisting the different departments within the organization, having different business perspectives, goals and resources, to create \u201cup-to-date\u201d links between UPN's on their consumer products and the diverse types of consumer related information resources published on the Internet, all in concerted effort to achieve the sales, marketing and support programs of the company in a unified manner. Using the system and method of the present invention, symbolic links between the manufacturer' products and published information resources on the Internet (e.g. WWW) can be impressed upon the minds of consumers as they seek access to such current information at home, in the office, in physical and electronic stores, as well as on the road.","Manufacturer Website Search Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem Ca, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Manufacturer Website Search Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.  provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its Manufacturer Website Search Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in , when selected from the user-interface of a bar-code driven IPI Website, the second Check Box type button B automatically activates the Manufacturer Website Search Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s) \u2033 based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in , this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s) \u2033 to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the Manufacturer Website Search Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the Manufacturer Website Search Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, presumably, the IPD Server \u2033 that will act upon the request appropriately; and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. a UPC or EAN number associated with a particular consumer product) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in or scan in a UPC or EAN number assigned to a consumer product on which product related information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in , the consumer or retail clerk scans the bar coded consumer product, or enters the UPC or EAN number thereon into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon. In response thereto, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a GET request to the IPD server B\u2033 shown in FIG. B. When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored UPC (or EAN) value to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of the CGI script within the http server \u2033 that will process the request from the HTML form. This amounts to the Web browser constructing a GET request for that URL, with the arguments (the query string) being attached to the end of the URL. The arguments of the HTML form are specified by the INPUT items of the HTML form (i.e. the UPC or EAN number on the consumer product on which information is sought).","In general, the HTTP and HTML protocols provide three ways to pass the input (e.g. UPC or EAN number) from the users to CGI scripts on the IPD Server  (i.e. HTTP Server). All three CGI scripts accomplish the same thing: they allow the Web browser to pass information to the IPD Server \u2033.","As indicated at Block D in , the HTTP (httpd) program on IPD server \u2033 passing the arguments (the UPC or EAN numbers in the query string) to the CGI script thereon and the CGI script translates the query string into a proper query for use in searching the RDBMS  shown in FIG. B.","As indicated at Block E in , the translated query is used to search the RDBMS  in order to find the set of URLs pointing to HTML documents (i.e. Web Pages) published on the Internet and containing information relating to the consumer product having the input UPC or EAN number. The result returned from the RDBMS  is an ASCII record specifying the set of URLs pointing to HTML documents published on the Internet and containing information relating to the consumer product having the input UPC or EAN number entered into the HTML form. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search using the UPC or EAN input, the ASCII record must be converted into a HTML document (i.e. output HTML form). As indicated at Block F in , the IPD Server \u2033 creates the elements of an output HTML form (Web output form), inserts the result from the RDBMS \u2033 into the output form, and sets the Content-type to be text\/html. The CGI script may translate, filter, augment and reformat the result from the database search in any way so long as the result is an HTML document or some format that the Web browser of the client subsystem can display.","As indicated at Block G, the menu of URLs retrieved from the database search is displayed in the Web output form. At Block H, the consumer or retail sales clerk can link to a desired consumer product related information resource (HTML document) by selecting from the information menu, the URL anchored to the information resource in the displayed information menu.","UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem Ca, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.  provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in , when selected from the user-interface of an IPI Website, the third Check Box type button C automatically activates the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s)  based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in , this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s) \u2033 to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the Manufacturer Website Search Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, presumably, IPD Server \u2032 that will act upon the request appropriately; and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. a UPC or EAN number associated with a particular consumer product) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in or scan in a UPC or EAN number assigned to a consumer product on which product related information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in , the consumer or retail clerk scans the bar coded consumer product, or enters the UPC or EAN number thereon into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon. In response thereto, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a GET request to the IPD Server \u2033 shown in FIG. B. When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored UPC (or EAN) value to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of the IPD SERVER  that will process the request from the HTML form. This amounts to the Web browser constructing a GET request for that URL, with the arguments (the query string) being attached to the end of the URL. The arguments of the HTML form are specified by the INPUT items of the HTML form (i.e. the UPC or EAN number on the consumer product on which information is sought).","As indicated at Block D, the IPD server \u2033 passes the arguments (the UPC or EAN numbers in the query string) to a CGI script running therewithin which translates the Web query string into a proper query to the RDBMS  shown in FIG. B.","As indicated at Block E, the translated query is used to search the RDBMS A and find the set of URLs (i) linked to the registered consumer product (by the manufacturer or agent thereof) assigned the UPC or EAN number entered into the Input Box of the HTML form, and (ii) pointing to HTML documents on the WWW containing particular types of consumer product related information. The result returned from the RDBMS  is an ASCII record specifying the set of URLs satisfying the above criteria. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search during this mode, the ASCII record must be converted into a HTML document (i.e. Web output form).","As indicated at Block F, a CGI script within IPD server \u2033 creates the elements of an HTML document (Web output form), inserts the result from the RDBMS  into the Web output form, and sets the Content-type of this HTML document to text\/html. In the illustrative embodiment, when the Web output form is displayed by the requesting client subsystem, a set of URLs categorized by particular product information types is displayed on the information display frame C. Notably, this set of URLs points to particular types of consumer product related information registered within the RDBMS  of the system.","As indicated at Block G, the consumer or retail sales clerk can then access and display any HTML document (Web page) located at a particular URL within the information menu by selecting the same using a touch screen, mouse, or other input selection device.","Trademark-Directed Search Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem Ca, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI finding and serving subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Trademark-Directed Search Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem. FIGS. D through D, taken together, provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its Trademark-Directed Search Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. D, when selected from the user-interface of an IPI Website, the fourth Check Box type button D automatically activates the Trademark-Directed Search Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s) \u2033 based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. D, this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb input form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s) \u2033 to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the Trademark-Directed Search Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, (e.g. a CGI script running within http server \u2033 that will act upon the request appropriately); and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. the trademark or tradename used with a particular consumer product on which information is sought) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in the trademark or tradename believed or otherwise known to be used in connection with a particular consumer product on which information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. D, the consumer or retail clerk enters the trademark or tradename into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon. In response thereto, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a GET request to the IPD server \u2033 shown in FIG. B. When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored trademark value to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of the CGI script running within the IPD server \u2033 that will process the request from the HTML form. This amounts to the Web browser constructing a GET request for that URL, with the arguments (the query string) being attached to the end of the URL. The arguments of the HTML form are specified by the INPUT items of the HTML form (i.e. the trademark or tradename used in connection with the consumer product on which information is sought).","As indicated at Block D in FIG. D, the IPD server \u2033 passes the arguments (the trademark or tradename in the query string) to a CGI script running therewithin and the CGI script translates the Web query string into a proper query to the RDBMS , as shown in FIG. B.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. D, the translated query is used to search the RDBMS  in order to find all registered consumer products having product descriptions (PD) registered within the RDBMS  that are related to the trademark or tradename entered into the Input Box of the HTML form. The result returned from the RDBMS  is an ASCII record specifying each triplet data set (Product Description, UPN and Manufacturer) which satisfies the above trademark search criteria (to a particular degree) entered into the Input Box of the HTML form. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search during this mode, the ASCII record must be converted into another HTML form for use in refining the consumer product information display.","At Block F in FIG. D, a CGI script within IPD server \u2033 creates the elements of another HTML document (Web auxiliary input form), inserts the preliminary search result from the RDBMS  into the Web auxiliary input form, and sets the Content-type of this HTML document to text\/html. In the illustrative embodiment, the Web auxiliary-input form has an ACTION which specifies the URL of a CGI script within the IPD server \u2033 that will act upon the request appropriately as if the system were in the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode. The Web auxiliary input form includes an Input Box listing all triplet data sets (i.e. Product Description, Manufacturers and UPN number) satisfying the input trademark search criteria entered in the primary Web input document, described hereinabove. The qualifying triplets listed in the Input Box are provided with a Radio-Button to allow the consumer or retail sales clerk to select one of the triplets from the list thereof for use in a subsequent refined search of the RDBMS . The Web auxiliary-input form also has a SUBMIT button for sending the HTML form back to the IPD server \u2033 for processing.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. D, when the consumer or retails sales clerk makes a selection with the Radio-Button and then selects the SUBMIT button, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a request to the HTTP program on the IPD server \u2033 to get the completed HTML form.","As indicated at Block H in FIG. D, the HTTP (httpd) program on IPD server \u2033 passes the arguments (the trademark or tradename in the query string) to a CGI script running therewithin and the CGI script translates the Web query string into a proper query for use in searching RDBMS , as shown in FIG. B.","At Block I in FIG. D, the query is used to search the RDBMS  in order to find the set of URLs (i) related to the registered consumer product (by the manufacturer or agent thereof) assigned the UPN, (Product Description and Manufacturer) entered into the Input Box of the HTML (auxiliary) form, and (ii) pointing to HTML (or FTP) documents on the WWW containing particular types of consumer product related information. The result returned from the RDBMS  is an ASCII record specifying the set of URLs satisfying the above criteria. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search during this mode, the ASCII record must be converted into an HTML document (i.e. Web output form).","At Block J in FIG. D, the IPD Server \u2033 creates the elements of an HTML document (Web output form), inserts the result from the RDBMS  into the Web output form, sets the Content-type of this HTML document to text\/html, and sends the HTML form to the requesting client subsystem.","At Block K in FIG. D, the set of URLs categorized by particular product information types is displayed within the output HTML form on the information display frame C. Notably, this set of URLs points to particular types of consumer product related information registered within the RDBMS  of the system by the manufacturer of the product or its agent(s) thereof using the UPN\/URL management tools accessible during the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode hereof.","As indicated at Block L in FIG. D, the consumer or retail sales clerk can access and display any HTML document (Web page) located at a particular URL within the displayed information menu by selecting the same using a touch screen, mouse, or other input selection device available at the requesting client subsystem .","Product-Description Directed Mode of Operation","Referring to , the high level structure is shown for a communication protocol that can be used among a client subsystem Ca, an IPD Server Sb, and an IPI Server Sc of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof when it is induced into the Product-Description Directed Mode of operation from the point of view of the depicted client subsystem.

E through E provides a high level flow chart illustrating the steps involved in carrying out this communication protocol when the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem is in its Product-Description Directed Mode of operation.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. E, when selected from the user-interface of an IPI Website, the fifth Check Box type button E automatically activates the Product-Description Directed Search Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem by sending an HTTP request to the IPD Server(s) \u2033 based on a URL hot-linked to the selected Check Box.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, this causes a particular type of HTML-encoded document (i.e. called an \u201cHTML form\u201d or \u201cWeb input form document\u201d) residing on the IPD Server(s) \u2033 to be sent to the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem  and displayed on the information display frame C thereof (requesting this mode of service). As in the Trademark-Directed Search Mode described above, the HTML form sent in the Product-Description Directed Search Mode may also use any HTML format commands, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, but must include three unique items, namely: the METHOD by which the user input is to be sent; the ACTION, which specifies a URL to which the user input is to be sent, (e.g. a CGI script running within the IPD server \u2033 that will act upon the request appropriately); and a SUBMIT button, to send the completed form over the Internet via HTTP. In the illustrative embodiment, user input (i.e. the description or descriptor for a particular consumer product on which information is sought) is obtained by an Input Box, which allows the user (i.e. retail sales clerk or consumer) to type in the product description for a particular consumer product on which information is sought.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. E, the consumer or retail clerk enters the product description into the Input Box of the HTML form, and selects the SUBMIT button thereon. In response thereto, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a GET request to the IPD server \u2033. When selecting the SUBMIT button on the HTML form, the Web browser executes the METHOD associated with the HTML form and sends the stored product description to the URL specified by ACTION associated with the HTML form (i.e. the Web browser performs the action specified in the ACTION). The ACTION of the HTML form specifies the URL of a CGI script within the IPD server \u2033 that will process the request from the HTML form. This amounts to the Web browser constructing a GET request for that URL, with the arguments (the query string) being attached to the end of the URL. The arguments of the HTML form are specified by the INPUT items of the HTML form (i.e. the product description for the consumer product on which information is sought).","As indicated at Block D in FIG. E, the httpd program on the IPD server \u2033 passes the arguments (the product description in the query string) to a CGI script therewithin and the CGI script translates the Web query string into a proper query to the RDBMS  shown in FIG. B\u2032.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. E, the translated query is used to search the RDBMS  in order to find all registered consumer products having trademarks or tradenames within the RDBMS  that are linked to the product description entered into the Input Box of the HTML form. The result returned from the RDBMS  is an ASCII record specifying each triplet data set (Trademark, UPN and Manufacturer) which satisfies the above product-description search criteria (to a particular degree) entered into the Input Box of the HTML form. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search during this mode, the ASCII record must be converted into another HTML form for use in refining the consumer product information display.","At Block F in FIG. E, the IPD server \u2033 creates the elements of another HTML document (Web auxiliary input form), inserts the preliminary search result from the RDBMS  into the Web auxiliary input form, and sets the Content-type of this HTML document to text\/html. In the illustrative embodiment, the Web auxiliary-input form has an ACTION which specifies the URL of a CGI script within IPD server \u2033 that will act upon the request appropriately as if the system were in the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode. The Web auxiliary input form includes an Input Box listing all triplet data sets (i.e. Trademark, Manufacturer, and UPN number) satisfying the input product-description search criteria entered in the primary Web input document, described hereinabove. The qualifying triplets listed in the Input Box are provided with a Radio-Button to allow the consumer or retail sales clerk to select one of the triplets from the list thereof for use in a subsequent refined search of the RDBMS . The Web auxiliary-input form also has a SUBMIT button for sending the HTML form back to the IPD server \u2033 for processing.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. E, when the consumer or retails sales clerk makes a selection with the Radio-Button and then selects the SUBMIT button, the Web browser on the client subsystem  sends a request to the IPD server \u2033.","As indicated at Block H in FIG. E, the httpd program on the IPD server \u2033 passes the arguments (the product description in the query string) to a CGI script therewithin and the CGI script translates the Web query string into a proper query for use in searching RDBMS  shown in FIG. B.","At Block I in FIG. E, the query is used to search the RDBMS  in order to find the set of URLs (i) linked to the registered consumer product (by the manufacturer or agent thereof) assigned the UPN, (Trademark and Manufacturer) entered into the Input Box of the HTML (auxiliary) form, and (ii) pointing to HTML (or FTP) documents on the WWW containing particular types of consumer product related information. The result returned from the RDBMS  is an ASCII record specifying the set of URLs satisfying the above search criteria. In order for the Web browser of the requesting client subsystem to display the results of the database search during this mode, the ASCII record must be converted into a HTML document (i.e. output HTML form).","At Block J in FIG. E, the IPD server \u2033 creates the elements of an output HTML form, inserts the result from the RDBMS  thereinto, and sets the Content-type of this HTML document to text\/html and sends a request to the IPD server \u2033 to get the HTML form.","At Block K in FIG. E, the set of URLs categorized by particular product information types is displayed within the output HTML form on the information display frame C. Notably, this set of URLs points to particular types of consumer product related information registered within the RDBMS  of the system by the manufacturer of the product or its agent(s) thereof using the UPN\/URL management tools accessible during the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode hereof.","As indicated at Block L in FIG. E, the consumer or retail sales clerk can access and display any HTML document (Web page) located at a particular URL within the displayed information menu by selecting the same using a touch screen, mouse, or other input selection device available at the requesting client subsystem .","The protocols described above can be realized using any suitable programming language including, for example, an object-oriented programming language such as the Java\u2122 programming language.","CPIR-Enabling Applet Download\/Distribution Mode of System Operation","As illustrated in FIGS. F, F, H, H, J, J, L and L, a centralized Library of CPIR-enabling Applets\/Servlets is created, management and stored within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof in accordance with the above-described methods. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, these CPIR-enabling Applets\/Servlets must be widely distributed to retailers, manufacturers, advertisers and others about the globe and thereafter widely embedded within HTML-encoded documents, as taught in detail hereinabove, to practice this aspect of the present invention in a commercially successful manner. The function of the CPIR-enabling Applet Download\/Distribution mode of operation of the system is to enable the world-wide distribution of this centralized Library of CPIR-enabling Applets\/Servlets, in accordance with the licensing program associated with each such CPIR-enabling Applet.","As shown in , the CPIR-enabling Applet Download\/Distribution mode is automatically initiated by the user depressing mode control button F displayed on the control panel B of the UPC Request (Central or Retail) GUI of the illustrative embodiment, but certainly elsewhere in practice. The user can be anyone with the requisite authority to use the Applets in accordance with the terms of the licensing program to be enforced in connection therewith. Understandably, the terms of such licensing programs will be based on prevailing business conditions and will vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present invention.","As best illustrated in FIG. F, upon entering the UPC-Encoded-Applet-Download\/Distribution mode, the IPD server  of the illustrative embodiment will serve a custom Java GUI as shown in FIGS. M and M, for carrying out Applet tag downloading and licensing procedures. The GUI will provide (1) links to the centralized Library of CPIR-Enabling Applets\/Servlets maintained within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , as well as (2) launchable GUIs for downloading selected UPN-identifiable CPIR-enabling Applets to specified Internet-enabled client computer subsystems  or Internet information\/application servers operated by the user interfacing with this mode of system operation. Notably, electronic data interchange\/exchange processes (e.g. based on EDI, XML\/ICE or other protocols) can be used to carry out the downloading of CPIR-enabling Applets and other files between client computers and the IPD server  during this and other modes of operation.","For licensing purposes, it may be desirable or necessary to have the user supply \u201cend-use\u201d types of information to the IPD server  during this mode of operation in order to identify on which information servers or domains (e.g. www.ipfcorp.com) particular CPIR-enabling Applets are to be used (i.e. embedded within HTML-documents and launched therefrom by the end-user which will typically be the consumer). In some instances, licenses for CPIR-enabling Applets will carry a fee to be paid by the downloader; in other instances, there will be no fee requirements. Such details will depend on prevailing business conditions along the retail supply and demand chain.","Once a user has downloaded CPIR-enabling Applets onto a designated (target) client machine or server, the user will have built a local Library (or Catalog) of CPIR-enabling Applets for use during Applet embedding operations which will typically be carried out alongside of other HTML-code authoring and management operations involving, for example, the design, construction, management and maintenance of Web-pages, EC-stores, on-line (retail and wholesale) product catalogs, on-line auction site pages, Web advertisements, and the like.","As shown in FIG. F, during Step D of the Applet embedding process, CPIR-enabling requests are accessed from the local Library of CPIR-enabling Applets typically over an IP-type local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Then during Step D, the accessed CPIR-enabling Applet is inserted within the HTML code of the target document. This step of the process will typically involve use of HTML-editing tools of one sort or another, as discussed herein above.","Once the CPIR-enabling Applet has been embedded within the target HTML-encoded documents, the HTML-encoded can then be published in its intended publishing environment so that consumers can instantly initiate UPN-directed searches within the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof by clicking on the CPIR-enabling Applet, and thereafter display the search results within an independent Java GUI which performs the function of a \u201ccyber-kiosk\u201d provided at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW.","Accessing the Modes of Operation of the IPI Finding System hereof by Launching CPIR-Enabling Applets Embedded within HTML-Encoded Documents Associated with Electronic-Commerce Enabled Stores and Product Catalogues, Internet Advertisements, On-Line WWW Auction Sites, and the Like","As described in detail hereinabove, a consumer can automatically produce a CPID-enabling Java GUI (i.e. \u201ccyber-kiosk\u201d) by clicking upon a CPIR-enabling Java Applet that has been embedded within the HTML code of any Web-document. As illustrated in FIGS. N, O, P, Q, R and S, each consumer product information display (CPID) enabling GUI of the illustrative embodiment is a new and independent Web browser having a Netscape-type framework, in which the six mode selection buttons A through G of the illustrative embodiment are displayed. When such CPID-enabling GUIs are displayed at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW, the consumer is free to select any one of the mode selection buttons and cause the system to enter the selected mode and precisely deliver the information service associated therewith without disturbing his or her present Cyberspace experience. The description of these modes will be described in detail hereinbelow with reference to , -, A and C.","Registration Solicitation Mode of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem","In the illustrative embodiments of the present invention, the data-synchronized IPD Servers of the system hereof  are also provided with an \u201cAutomated Registration Solicitation Mode\u201d programmed by the webmaster (or administrator) of the IPI Web-site(s). In this mode, each IPD Server  analyzes the data collected within its Non-IPI Registrant Database. The data analysis procedure seeks to determine: (1) which \u201cunregistered\u201d products in the Non-IPI Registrant Database were the subject of an information request at the IPD Server; (2) how many hits (requests) were made for the product within a predetermined length of time (e.g. one week) by Internet users; and (3) whether the number of requests exceeds a particular \u201crequest threshold\u201d (e.g. 100 requests in week period). Then for each unregistered product which has exceeded the request threshold, the IPD Server automatically sends an E-mail message to the associated company. Preferably, the E-mail message is designed to (i) inform the company of recent information requests for their products, and (ii) solicit the registration of such products with the IPD Server. Once registered with the system, such products can be easily found on the Internet by anyone wishing to use the product information finding techniques of the present invention.","Operation of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem and Method Hereof","When the Check Box button C is selected from the control frame B, the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem enters its \u201cUPN-Directed Information Access Mode\u201d illustrated in . Preferably, the user is provided with a choice of language (e.g. English, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Chinese, etc.) by way of an appropriate menu-selection screen. After the desired language selection is made, the home page is displayed upon the client subsystem's display screen. A typical display screen produced from the IPD Server might read as follows:","\u201cWelcome to UPC-REQUEST\u2122, the only Universal Product-Information Finding and Serving System on the Internet.","Have you purchased a particular product, are you considering the purchase of a particular product, on which you would like current, up-to-date information from the manufacturer or advertiser?","Look no further than the UPC-REQUEST\u2122 Universal Product-Information Finding and Serving System.\u201d","When the subsystem is in its \u201cUPN-Directed Information Access Mode\u201d, a Web-based information resource pertaining to any commercial product registered with the system can be displayed and selected by the user in order to automatically access the same from the Internet. Such information resources can include advertisements, specifications, operation descriptions, product simulations, purchase information, maintenance information, warranty and servicing information, product updates, distributor\/reseller information, incentives (e.g. discounts, rebates, coupons, etc.), electronic data transaction screens, etc. In this mode, desired product information is obtained by simply entering the registered product's UPN (e.g. its UPC's 12 digit numerical string) into the Inout Box of the HTML form displayed in the information display frame C. Such data entry can be carried out manually using a keyboard data entry techniques, or automatically using a bar code symbol reader connected to the client subsystem as discussed in detail above. When using the seeded IPI Database described hereinabove, only the first six digits of the UPC number need be entered into the dialogue box. An exemplary display screen produced from the IPD Server might be as follows:","\u201cSimply enter the 12 digit UPC the particular product; click REQUEST, and then wait for the display of the list of Web locators (URLs) at which the desired product information can be found on the Internet?\u201d","In response to such data entry operations, a list or menu of URLs organized according to information subfield classifications as set forth, for example, in FIG. A, are displayed on client subsystem Ca making the request of the IPD Server . At this stage, another display screen associated with the HTML form produced from the IPD Server  would appear with an exemplary message as follows:","\u201cPlease select the URL from the displayed URL Menu using the information subfield product information category displayed above. This will connect you to the product information related to the selected URL. You can return to the URL display list at anytime.\u201d","Upon selecting a particular URL from the displayed URL menu, video and audio information content are automatically served from the IPI Server  hosting the selected URL and thereafter displayed on the client subsystem .","When the Check Box button D is selected, the IPI Finding and Searching Subsystem enters its Trademark-Directed Search Mode, illustrated in FIGS. D through D. Preferably, the user is provided with a choice of language (e.g. English, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) by way of an appropriate menu-selection screen.","When the system is in its Trademark-Directed Search Mode, a predesignated information resource pertaining to any commercial product registered with the system can be automatically accessed from the Internet and displayed from the Internet browser of a client subsystem . Such information resources can include advertisements, specifications, operation descriptions, product simulations, product upgrade information, purchase information, maintenance information, warranty and servicing information, etc. In this mode, desired product information is obtained by simply entering the registered product's trademark(s) and\/or associated company name into the Input Box of the HTML form displayed on the information display frame C of the client subsystem. An exemplary message associated with the HTML form produced from the IPD Server  might be as follows:","\u201cSimply enter the trademark used in connection with the particular product and\/or the company name of the product's manufacturer; click REQUEST, and then wait for the display of a list of Web locators (URLs) at which desired types of product information can be found on the Internet\u201d","In response to such data entry operations, a list of URLs organized according to the information subfield classifications set forth in FIG. A are displayed on the client subsystem placing the request. Upon selecting a particular URL from the displayed list thereof, video and audio information content are automatically served from the IPI Server hosting the selected URL and thereafter displayed on the client subsystem.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the UPN-Directed Information Access Mode and the Trademark-Directed Search Mode can be integrated into a single server application so that there is no need or desire to manually select between mode activation buttons C and D, respectively. In such an embodiment, the interaction between the IPD Server and the requesting client subsystem can be designed to support the following Web server display screens and script underlying the same:","\u201cWelcome to UPC-REQUEST\u2122, the only Universal Product-Information Finding and Serving System on the Internet.","Have you purchased a particular product, or considering the purchase of a particular product, on which you would like current, up-to-date information from the manufacturer or advertiser?","\u201cLook no further than the UPC-REQUEST\u2122 Universal Product Information Finding and Serving System.\u201d","\u201cSimply enter the 12 digit UPC number of the particular product, click REQUEST, and select from the displayed menu of Web locators (URLs) to find the desired product information on the WWW.","\u201cIf you do not know the UPC number associated with the product you are looking for, then simply enter the trademark used in connection with the particular product and\/or the company name of the manufacturer, then click REQUEST, and wait for the display of the list of Web locators (URLs) at which the desired product information can be found.","\u201cPlease select the URL from the displayed URL list by clicking on it. This will connect you to the product information related to the selected URL. You can return to the URL display list at anytime.\u201d","Notably, such an integrated Web server application can be realized in a variety of ways. The exact words and graphics used to create an interactive script for an integrated Web server application will vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present invention.","In instances when an IPI Website in accordance with the present invention is being served to consumers in retail environments using a computer-based kiosk as shown in FIG. A, the consumer as well as the retail sales clerk is presented with the option of ascertaining the price of a product in the store. This is achieved by simply depressing the \u201cPrice Display\u201d button F on Control Strip B, shown in , to engage the system in its price lookup\/display mode. In this mode of operation, the consumer then need only scan the UPC bar code symbol on the product using bar code scanner  in order for the price to be looked-up in the Product Price Database maintained in the Retailer's Price Server (RPS) , and displayed on the kiosk display screen. In general, the Product Price Database of the hosting retailer can be made accessible by the computer-based kiosk in several possible ways. As shown in  and -, one way is to place the retailer's RPS on Internet (by using an HTTP server) and connect the RPS to the IPD Server  of the system by way of a CGI well known in the art. The CGI can be made accessible only by authorized client subsystems (e.g. computer-based kiosks installed in the hosting retailer's store and possibly administrators of the information delivery system). An alternative technique of connecting the Product Price Database to each computer-based kiosk would involve providing the RPS with a direct interface to each computer-based kiosk in the hosting retailer's store(s). This alternative technique may require the use of computer networking technology well known in the art.","The IPI finding system (i.e. subsystem) of the present invention can be realized on the Internet in a variety of different ways. Each embodiment of the system will provide manufacturers, retailers, consumers and sponsors with various benefits hitherto unachievable using prior art systems and methodologies. A best mode embodiment of the system will now be described below with reference to Intent-to-Use (ITU) servicemarks that Assignee hereof has sought to register under the Lanham Act and ultimately use in reducing the Internet-based consumer product information finding system to commercial practice in the near future. The inventive subject matter herein disclosed can be readily applied to carry out such an Internet-based information finding and delivery system.","According to the best mode embodiment, the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem , referred to hereinabove as the \u201cUPC REQUEST\u2122 Consumer Product Information Finding System\u201d in  hereof, comprises an integration of several subsystems including, for example: the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem  (e.g. Web Document Server  and Workstation ) including Web-based and Value Added Networks (VAN)-based infrastructure and processes  for supporting EDI and UPN\/URL database management operations by manufacturers and\/or their agents; the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem  interfaced with the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem ; numerous UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks (e.g. client subsystems  ) installed in retail stores, retail outlets and the like, each having a bar code symbol driven Internet browser providing access to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP); and all of the Web-enabled client subsystems  located in consumer homes, in consumer offices and on the road, having access to the Internet through an ISP. While distributed geographically, these subsystems are integrated through the infrastructure of the Internet.","The function of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem  is two-fold: (1) to enable qualified manufacturers to quickly and easily register their companies with the System (i.e. the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem ) by way of a Web-enabled computer system of their choice; and (2) to enable manufacturers and\/or their agents to (i) easily link, manage and update their UPC numbers and linked URLs using any Web-enabled computer system  running the EDI (or XML\/EDI) based UPN\/URL Database Management software (downloaded during manufacturer registration), and periodically transmit such updated information to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem in order to update each manufacturer's information within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database (i.e., IPI Database shown in FIGS. A and A).","The function of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem  is to maintain and update the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database (shown in FIGS. A, A and FIGS. C through C), which contains various information items regarding registered manufacturers, service-subscribing retailers, and registered consumer products including, for example, UPC (and\/or UPC\/EAN) numbers assigned to consumer products and linked URLs pointing to published HTTP-encoded documents (i.e. Web pages) containing particular types of information related to such products.","Within the store of each retailer subscribing to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Consumer Information Service, the function of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk is to provide consumer access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website (e.g. UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail (Retailer X, UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail @ Retailer Y, etc.). The UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website served to both physical-kiosk and cyber-kiosks within the retailer's brick and mortar and EC stores, respectively, provides consumer access to UPN\/URL information links relating only to those products sold by the retailer and maintained within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System by the manufacturer or agent thereof. If desired by the subscribing retailer, its UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website can be freely served to customers over the Internet, e.g. accessible from a hot-link embedded somewhere in the retailer's Web-site.","Within the realm of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System , the function of the Web-enabled client computer system  of each consumer, wherever it may be located (e.g. at home, in the office or on the road), is to provide consumer access the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website which is freely served over the Internet to any consumer having a Web-enabled computer system. Unlike each UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website maintained by the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website provides consumer access to UPN\/URL information links relating to every product maintained within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System by every registered manufacturer. Any attempt by a consumer to access information from a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website regarding a product not sold in the retailer's store will automatically result in a link over to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","A Brief Description of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Information Service Suit","When installed in retail stores, the System will provide six revolutionary Internet-based consumer information services under the servicemarks HOME-PAGE\u2122, INFO-LINK\u2122, CYBER-SERVICE\u2122, TRADE-MARK\u2122, PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122, and UPC-ENCODED-APPLET-DOWNLOAD\u2122, respectively. Each of these information services is accessible to consumers and sales clerks alike from a UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website (e.g. UPC REQUEST\u2122 @ Retailer X Website) accessed within a retail store, as well as from on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","In the UPC REQUEST\u2122 version of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention, the INFO-LINK\u2122 provision is supported during and enabled by Manufacturer\/Product Registration Mode; the HOME-PAGE\u2122 provision is supported during and enabled by the Manufacturer Website Search Mode; the CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 provision is supported during and enabled by UPN-Directed Information Access Mode; the TRADE-MARK\u2122 provision is supported during and enabled by the Trademark-Directed Search Mode; the PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122 provision is supported during and enabled by the Product-Description Directed Search Mode; and the UPC-ENCODED-APPLET-TAG-DOWNLOAD\/DISTRIBUTE\u2122 provision is supported during and enabled by the UPC-Encoded Applet Tag Download\/Distribution Mode. Each of these system modes have been described in great detail hereinabove.","To constantly remind the public at large of the \u201cfee-paying\u201d sponsors of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System, all Web pages displayed by the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in a retail store (e.g. on UPC REQUEST\u2122 @ Retailer X Website), or on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, will be displayed within a three-frame display \u201cframework\u201d comprising a sponsor frame, a control frame, and an information frame.","The \u201csponsor frame\u201d, located on the upper-most portion of the Internet browser screen, displays the sponsor's greeting such as, for example, \u201cWelcome to UPC REQUEST, sponsored by Sponsor A and Sponsor B.\u201d","The \u201ccontrol frame\u201d, located on the left-most side of the Internet browser screen, will provide six mode activation buttons. The first mode activation button A enables consumers to request the INFO-LINK\u2122 service. The second mode activation button B enables consumers to request the HOME-PAGE\u2122 service. The third mode activation button C enables consumers to request CYBER-SERVICE. The fourth mode activation button D enables consumers to request TRADE-MARK\u2122. The fifth mode activation button E enables consumers to request PRODUCT-TYPE\u2122. The sixth mode activation button F enables consumers to request UPC-ENCODED-APPLET-DOWNLOAD\/DISTRIBUTE\u2122. A seventh button G enables the download of a free plug-in software module which automatically installs a \u201cProduct Information\u201d button on the graphical user interface of the consumer's Internet browser, so that the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website can be accessed anywhere in the world with a single click of the mouse button.","The \u201cinformation frame\u201d, occupying the balance of the Internet browser screen, will display: all HTTP (i.e. Web) and FTP pages launched by in-store scanning of UPC-labeled products during HOME-PAGE\u2122 or CYBER-SERVICE\u2122; all HTTP and FTP pages launched by clicking on hypertext-links embedded within Web pages accessed through a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website in retail stores or from the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website; as well as all information search and display (menu) screens served by a UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","In retail stores subscribing to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System, HOMEPAGE\u2122 manufacturer's Website search site will enable consumers to automatically access the WWW Home Page of any registered manufacturer by scanning the UPC (or UPC\/EAN) bar code symbol on any product thereof using the bar code symbol reader associated with a UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk. In general, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk can be realized by any Web-enabled computer system  having an Internet browser program, on-line access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website, and optionally a touch-screen display panel. The UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk may, however, be realized as an inexpensive Internet access terminal comprising a Web-enabled network computer (NC), an LCD touch-screen panel, and a laser scanning bar code symbol reader integrated within an ultra-compact housing that is mountable within diverse locations within retail stores. As shown in FIG. A, the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk may also be integrated within a conventional Point Of Sale (POS) station having a laser scanning bar code symbol reader and a large rotatable LCD display panel. Being as easy to install as a telephone modem, UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks of this design can be widely deployed throughout retail stores world-wide with minimal modifications to the preexisting information infrastructure.","At home, in the office, or on the road, HOME-PAGE\u2122 enables consumers to automatically access the WWW Home Page of any registered manufacturer by entering the UPN (or UPC\/EAN number) on any product into the search screen served up by a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website, or by the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","INFO-LINK\u2122, carried out using EDI (or XML\/EDI) based UPN\/URL Database Management software (downloaded from Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem ), enables manufacturers to simply relate (link), manage and update therein (i) the UPN (or UPC\/EAN number) on any product with (ii) the Internet address (i.e. URL) of product-related Web pages published on the Internet by the manufacturer, its agents, or others, for subsequent access and display by consumers using CYBER-SERVICE\u2122. While the INFO-LINK\u2122 service would be made accessible through UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks  in retail stores (i.e. for the sake of vendors who frequent the same), the actual UPN\/URL information linking and management operations associated with the INFO-LINK\u2122 service will typically occur in the \u201cback-offices\u201d of registered manufacturers using Internet-enabled computer systems accessing INFO-LINK\u2122 through a hot-linked URL posted on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retailer Website and\/or the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","UPC-ENCODED-APPLET-DOWNLOAD\u2122, carried out using EDI (or XML\/EDI) based processes, enables manufacturers (via the system administrator) to distribute CPIR-enabling Applets\/Servlets to retailers, manufacturers, advertisers and others about the globe so that they may embed the same within HTML-encoded documents in order that consumers can instantly initiate single mouse-click UPN-directed, Trademark-directed and\/or Product-Descriptor-directed CPI searches within the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof and display the search results within a CPID-enabling Java GUI which performs the function of a \u201ccyber-kiosk\u201d provided at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW. In the context of the illustrative embodiment of the system of the present invention, such single mouse-click initiated CPI searches solve a major fear of most retailers in both Physical and Cyber Space retail environments, namely: getting a customer into their store, and then having them step out to get some more advice, information or endorsement before making a purchase, or worse yet, never returning to make a purchase, and instead shopping elsewhere for the sought after product.","CYBER-SERVICE\u2122, accessible through a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website or the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, enables consumers at home, in the office, on the road, and in retail stores, to quickly access particular types of product-related information which have been published on the WWW by registered manufacturers, their agents and others about consumer products registered with the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management System. CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 displays such product-related information in a menu-like format organized by particular information types (e.g., Product Advertisements, Product Endorsements, Product Reviews, Product Rebates and Incentives, Product Description, Product Manual\/Instructions, Product Updates (at FTP Sites), Product Returns, Warranty and Repair Service, Direct Product Purchase, Retailers, Wholesalers, Complementary Products, Company Annual Report, Stock Purchase, etc.). Each displayed information menu associated with a consumer product contains hyper-linked URLs pointing to HTML-documents containing particular types of product-related information linked to the product by the manufacturer or its agent.","When CYBER-SERVICE\u2122 is selected from a particular UPC REQUEST\u2122 Retail Website, each product-related Web page listed in the displayed \u201cinformation menu\u201d can be accessed and displayed simply by touching the corresponding Internet address (i.e. URL) displayed on the touch-screen display panel of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosk in the retail store.

sources: Manufacturer Fees paid by manufacturers who want to register their products and product-related Web pages with the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database; Retailer Fees paid by retailers who want to provide bar code driven access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in retail stores; Sponsor Fees paid by Sponsors of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System; and Advertiser Fees paid by advertisers on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website.","Manufacturers desiring to register their consumer products and product-related Web pages within the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database would pay a one-time Manufacture Registration, Fee, based on volume of sales. An annual maintenance fee may be desired or necessary. Minimally, such fees should cover the cost of the EDI and UPN\/URL Database Management software (and updates) automatically downloaded to each manufacturer upon registration. Such Web-based EDI software enables manufacturers to easily manage the UPC numbers and Web page URLs associated with their changing product lines, and automatically transmit such information to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem in order that the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Database Management Subsystem is periodically updated.","Retailers providing bar code driven access to the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System in their retail stores would pay an annual Retailer License Fee based on the number of UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks deployed therein (within store isles, at POS stations and behind information\/service counters).","Each sponsor of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System would pay an annual Sponsor Fee for the right to display its name, trademark\/servicemark and\/or message in hypertext within a selected portion of the sponsor frame displayed by licensed UPC REQUEST\u2122 kiosks in retail stores, as well as Internet-enabled computer systems accessing the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website. For marketing reasons, it would be desirable to limit the number of sponsors of the UPC REQUEST\u2122 System at any instant in time.","Advertisers, who advertise on the UPC REQUEST\u2122 Central Website, would pay an Advertiser Fee based on the time and location that the Web advertisement is displayed.","Usage of the UPC REOUEST\u2122 in Diverse Retail Markets","The System can be used to provide consumers with quick access to useful product-related information in diverse types of retail shopping environments including, for example, retail superstores, discount department stores, home-improvement stores, computer superstores, drugstores and pharmacies, music stores, video rental stores, bookstores, supermarkets, grocery stores and the like. Each of these retail markets provides a unique environment in which the System can be used by manufacturers of consumer products to effectively deliver product-related information to consumers in retail stores, at home, in the office or on the road, before and after consumer purchases.","As the System provides manufacturers with an effective way and means of making direct contact with present and future customers, it enables both manufacturers and retailers alike to influence demand in ways that hitherto have been unavailable. Such features of the System present enormous growth opportunities in retail supply and demand chain management across diverse markets within the expanding global economy.","The present invention has been described in great detail with reference to the above illustrative embodiments. It is understood, however, that numerous modifications will readily occur to those with ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of reading the present disclosure.","For example, in the illustrative embodiments described hereinabove, separate databases are maintained by each data-synchronized IPD Server for (i) registered products within the system, and (ii) non-registered products within the system. Notably, the reasons for using a dual database design of this sort would be based largely on economics, namely: only those companies who have paid the required maintenance (or registration) fees get their products and linked-URLs \u201cregistered\u201d with the system, whereas non-paying companies and organizations do not get their products and linked-URLs registered with the system, regardless of how such product-URL information is ascertained (e.g. by solicitation versus data-mining).","Thus it is contemplated that in some embodiments of the present invention, each IPD Server will be designed to maintain only a single database for maintaining product-URL information currently available on the Internet. In such embodiments of the present invention, the concept of \u201cnon-registered\u201d products will be altogether avoided, since the system implementation and administration may be designed not to require companies to pay maintenance (or registration) fees in order that their products and linked URLs are registered with the IPI system. Instead, some alternative income producing scheme will be used in such embodiments of the present invention (e.g. user fees, subscription fees, Internet browser-licensing fees, etc.) for system maintenance and administration.","When practicing the system and method of the present invention, it is preferred that the UPC label (with its human-readable UPC number) assigned to the particular product be attached, embossed or otherwise embodied on an accessible surface thereof. In addition to applying the UPC label to the external packaging of the product, it is preferred that the UPC label also be printed on any and all product instructions and manuals provided with the product. In this way, the UPC number can be easily read by a human being and then used to access a desired type of product information using the system and method of the present invention.","In order that the system hereof can be used to find information pertaining to large products such as automobiles, motorcycles, skidoos, farm machinery, boats, etc., the present invention also contemplates assigning UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN numbers) to such products and attaching, embossing or otherwise embodying the same on an accessible surface thereof. Also, the UPN label can be printed on all instruction booklets and\/or operating manuals normally provided with the product. In this way, information related to any particular product that is posted anywhere on the Internet and linked to URLs registered with the IPD Servers  of the system hereof can be readily found using the uniquely assigned UPC number assigned thereto by the manufacturer at the time of sale. Notably, multimedia information about such products can be most helpful in regard to the operation, repair and servicing of such products.","The system and method of the present invention has been shown to combine the use of UPNs, trademarks and company names when making a product information request of the system. It is understood, however, that the present invention can be practiced using any one of these items of information, alone or in combination with each other, in order to place a product information request with the system hereof.","Also, while the system of the illustrative embodiment has been shown used to collect, transport and serve information related to consumer products, it is understood that the system can be used to link the URLs of HTML (and other Internet) documents with consumer services assigned uniform service numbers (USN) which may be based on the UPC or EAN numbering system, or some other suitable system. In such alternative embodiments, the IPI Database would contain information pertaining to uniform service numbers (USN) that have been linked to the URLs of HTML or like documents on the Internet by the manufacturer or its agents, in essentially the same manner as conducted for consumer products. Such USN\/URL management operations can be carried out in a similar to that described in connection with UPN\/URL management along the retail supply and demand chain.","In connection with the consumer service information (CSI) embodiment of the present invention, it is understood that at present, few (if any) services have been assigned a UPC (or EAN) number in the manner that nearly all consumer products have been assigned in the contemporary period. In spite of this fact, however, the present invention contemplates the need and utility of widespread assignment of UPC, EAN or similar numbers by service providers to particular services (as well as the imprinting of UPC, EAN or similar symbols on printed service brochures and advertisements). Notably, assigning uniform service numbers (USNs) to particular services, and labeling printed and graphical brochures and advertisements with such universal numbers, will provide a number of new opportunities hitherto unavailable.","In particular, service-related information could be easily found (i.e. located and accessed) on Web-sites using the system and method of the present invention, and thereafter the service easily procured through an electronic data transaction. In accordance with the present invention, this can be achieved by uniquely identifying and assigning \u201cparticular\u201d services by a Universal Service Code (USC) which has many if not all of the attributes of a conventional UPC. While not necessary, a single digit may be optionally added to the USC in order to demark that services, rather than products, are being identified. An example of such USC labeling would be printing an assigned UPC label (number) on: admission tickets to a theatrical, dramatic or musical performance and\/or its playbill; admission tickets to a movie; admission tickets to a concert and\/or its concert program; admission tickets to a sporting event and\/or its sports program; admission tickets to an art, science or history museum; admission tickets to the zoo or botanical gardens; and the like. The UPC label would be encoded to identify a particular event at which an entertainment, educational or professional service is provided. The UPC label printed on the tangible medium associated with the promotion of or access to the particular service would then be registered with the IPSI Registrant Database of the system hereof, along with the name of the provider of the service, and a list of URLs that identify the Web locations at which particular kinds of information related to the particular service can be found (in accordance with the categories of FIG. A).","These and all other such modifications and variations are deemed to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the accompanying Claims to Invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of how to practice the Objects of the Present Invention, the following Detailed Description of the Illustrative Embodiments can be read in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-1","b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":"9"},"FIG.
