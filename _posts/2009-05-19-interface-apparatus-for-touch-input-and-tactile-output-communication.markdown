By way of example, the inventive touch device interface can be used as a user-input section of a touch screen interface. Although a touch screen appears to be a unitary piece of hardware, it actually comprises an output device, namely a display or screen, and an input device which is sensitive to touching or approaching the surface of the display with a finger or stylus. Touch screens can be implemented by organizing an x-y matrix of infrared rays over the screen, in which case touching the display surface is not necessary. Alternatively the screen can be overlaid by a transparent pressure-sensitive switch matrix which is scanned in substantially similarly to the way electronic keyboard matrices are scanned. The layout of the switch matrix may resemble that of a general-purpose typewriter, or the layout may be dedicated to specific purposes or applications. Touch screen interfaces are frequently used in connection with laptop or palmtop computers, personal digital assistants (\u201cPDA\u201d), remote control devices, digital cameras, navigators, entertainment devices, and many other types of devices.","A problem with conventional touch screen interfaces is that the user of the touch screen interface must be able to see the layout of the switch matrix in order to be able to select a specific key to be activated (\u201cpushed\u201d). Seeing the layout of the switch matrix is not always possible or easy, and visually impaired persons are a prime example. Even in cases wherein the user could see the switch matrix layout, looking at the switch matrix layout may disturb the user, such as the driver of a car.","An object of the invention is to develop a method and equipment so as to alleviate one or more of the problems identified above. In other words the object of the invention is to provide an improved touch screen interface which requires less visual attention from its user than prior art touch screen interfaces do. The object of the invention is attained by methods and equipment as specified in the attached independent claims. The dependent claims and the present description relate to specific embodiments of the invention.","An aspect of the invention is a interface apparatus according to claim . The interface apparatus according to claim , which provides two-way communication with the user, comprises a touch input section and a tactile output section. The term \u201csection\u201d implies that the touch input section and a tactile output section are comprised within the two-way interface apparatus. The touch input section comprises a surface arranged so as to be touched or approached by a body member, which typically is the user's finger. This surface may be called a touch surface. The touch surface has at least one touch-sensitive area having a predetermined position. The touch input section comprises or is operatively connectable to data processing means for assigning at least one function to the least one touch-sensitive area. The touch input section comprises presence-detecting means for detecting a presence or absence of a user's body member near the at least one touch-sensitive area. Touch-sensitive smart phones, car navigators, touch pads of laptop or palmtop computers, or the like provide Illustrative but non-restrictive examples of the touch input section. The data processing means comprises an appropriately programmed microprocessor with associated hardware. The microprocessor and its associated hardware can reside within the interface apparatus or in an external data processing system. The presence-detecting means are typically implemented by appropriate programming of the microprocessor: the surface touched or approached by the body member is typically arranged as an X-Y matrix which is scanned by the associated electronics of the touch input section. When the user's body member presses an area of the surface, one or more of the X lines are connected to one or more of the Y lines, and the X and Y coordinates of the connection are detected by the processor. The X and Y coordinates are typically compared with coordinates that define predetermined areas.","In an illustrative but non-restrictive example, the function assigned to the touch-sensitive area is providing an input to an application program, such as a selection of an option (\u201cyes\/no\/cancel\u201d) or a selection of an act to be performed. The border or perimeter of the touch-sensitive area need not be a sharply-defined one, so long as it is possible to say that touching or approaching a point within the touch-sensitive area invokes the function assigned to the touch-sensitive area, while touching or approaching another point outside the area does not.","The number of functions assigned to a touch-sensitive area is not restricted to one. Instead it is possible to assign multiple functions to one, some or all touch-sensitive areas, such that a single touch (\u201cclick\u201d) invokes a first function, two touches within a predefined time window (\u201cdouble click\u201d) invokes a second function, and so on.","An illustrative example of an interface apparatus which comprises the function-assigning means is a standalone device, such as a palmtop computer, a smart telephone or a remote controller. An illustrative example of a touch device which is connectable to the function-assigning means is an interface panel which does not contain any application-level programs but is connectable to an external data processing equipment executing one or more application-level programs which use the interface panel as an input device. In such environments it is beneficial to define an application programming interface (API), via which the application-level programs can accept input from a user, and optionally provide feedback to the user.","As regards functionality, the touch input section can be implemented via conventional technology. As stated earlier, the conventional technology causes the problem that the user must see what area(s) of the touch input section need to be pushed.","In order to solve the problems associated with conventional touch input technology, the inventive interface apparatus also comprises a tactile output section, which in turn comprises an electro-sensory stimulus generator for generating an electro-sensory stimulus to the body member. The electro-sensory stimulus generator comprises one or more conducting electrodes, each conducting electrode being provided with an insulator wherein, when the body member is proximate to the conducting electrode, the insulator prevents flow of direct current from the conducting electrode to the body member and a capacitive coupling over the insulator is formed between the conducting electrode and the body member. The electro-sensory stimulus generator also comprises a high-voltage source for applying an electrical drive to the one or more conducting electrodes, wherein the electrical drive comprises a first frequency component in a frequency range between 1 Hz and 1000 Hz. The capacitive coupling and electrical drive are dimensioned to produce an electro-sensory sensation, independently of any mechanical vibration of the one or more conducting electrodes or insulators.","As stated earlier, the touch input section comprises presence-detecting means for detecting a presence or absence of a user's body member near the at least one touch-sensitive area. The tactile output section according to the invention is operatively coupled to the presence-detecting means and comprises stimulus-variation means, such that the stimulus-variation means are configured to receive an input from the presence-detecting means and to temporally vary the electro-sensory stimulus based on input from the presence-detecting means. The stimulus may be varied by varying one or more of the electrical parameters defining it, including drive voltage, frequency or the capacitive coupling.","The significance of such a stimulus-variation means may not be immediately apparent. Yet the stimulus-variation means provides a clear benefit, for the following reason. Touch input devices, such as touch-sensitive displays, may provide a large number of distinct predefined areas. In some cases, the number of distinct predefined areas roughly equals the size of the touch-sensitive display divided by the size of a typical fingertip. For example, a modern smart phone may provide up to 20 distinct predefined areas, or even more, in its touch-sensitive display. The invention aims at eliminating or reducing the need to see the touch-sensitive display, in order to identify the distinct predefined areas. As regards the inventive tactile output section, however, it may be technically challenging to match the spatial resolution of the touch input section. The significance of the stimulus-variation means will be easiest to understand by assuming that the user touches the touch-sensitive display by only one finger at a time. Information on the area touched by the user's finger is detected by the presence-detecting means and relayed to the stimulus-variation means. The stimulus-variation means utilizes this information, such that touching different areas by the finger causes different electro-sensory stimuli to the finger. This means that tactile output section of the inventive interface apparatus may utilize relatively coarse spatial resolution and good temporal resolution to create an illusion of a spatial resolution that matches that of the touch input section. Under the assumption that the user touches the touch-sensitive display by only one finger at a time, even one electrode suffices to create an illusion of a much higher spatial resolution. In reality, the entire surface of the electrode provides the same stimulus intensity, but by varying the stimulus intensity based on information of the area touched by the user's finger, the inventive interface apparatus creates an illusion of multiple areas, each of which provides a distinct stimulus intensity. Such feedback may be provided by the interface section of device itself and\/or the application-level program and\/or the API that couples the application-level program to the interface device. Thus the inventive interface apparatus is capable of creating an illusion of a tactile output section with a spatial resolution exceeding its actual spatial resolution. An advantage of this feature is that the number of electrodes can be quite small, sometimes as low as one. The required number of electrodes equals the number of simultaneous, individually controlled stimuli. If, say, the tactile output section needs to create an individually controllable stimulus for each of two halves of the touch surface, two electrodes are sufficient. In many applications the user touches the touch surface with only one fingertip at a time, which means that one tactile output electrode suffices to create an illusion of a spatial resolution equal to that of the touch input section. Accordingly, the electrode(s) may be quite large, such as over 5 mm in both dimensions, up to the full size of the touch surface.","In an illustrative example, the electro-sensory stimulus is more intensive within the touch-sensitive areas. It is not necessary for the intensity of the electro-sensory stimulus to vary in precise accordance with the border(s) of the touch-sensitive area(s). For instance, assuming that the size and shape of the touch-sensitive areas correspond to a typical fingertip, it suffices to provide an intensity peak for the electro-sensory stimulus at the centre of each touch-sensitive area.","As an alternative to a comprehensive two-way interface apparatus which comprises the touch input section and tactile output section as described above, the invention can also be embodied as an upgrade to existing touch input devices. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention is a tactile output device, which comprises all features of the tactile output section as defined in claim . The tactile output device is adapted for installation into a touch input device comprising all features of the touch input section as defined in claim , such that installation of the tactile output device into the touch input device results in the interface apparatus according to claim .","The usage of the terms \u201cinterface apparatus\u201d, \u201cdevice\u201d and \u201csection\u201d is such that \u201capparatus\u201d refers to a comprehensive two-way interface apparatus which comprises the touch input section and tactile output section. In other words, the two \u201csections\u201d are portions of the comprehensive two-way interface apparatus. On the other hand, the word \u201cdevice\u201d is used in contexts where the tactile output device is provided separately, for upgrading an existing touch input device. Thus the terms \u201csection\u201d and \u201cdevice\u201d are functionally interchangeable, and the difference between them is such that \u201csections\u201d form parts of a comprehensive apparatus, while \u201cdevices\u201d may be sold separately, such that an inventive tactile output device may upgrade an existing touch input device such the upgrading results in an inventive interface apparatus.","The invention solves or at least alleviates the problems associated with prior art touch screen interfaces by providing the user with a spatially variant electro-sensory stimulus, wherein the spatial variations of the electro-sensory stimulus are based on the layout of the touch-sensitive areas of the touch screen interface. The expression \u201care based on\u201d refers to the fact that a touch screen interface may comprise up to three superimposed layouts: a first layout defines the touch-sensitive areas, a second layout defines the spatially variant electro-sensory stimulus according to the present invention, while a third layout defines the visual cues which in prior art devices help the user see the layout of the switch matrix. The third layout (the visual cues), which is virtually mandatory in prior art devices, is optional in the inventive touch screen interlace because its function can be delegated to the inventive second layout, namely the spatially variant electro-sensory stimulus. Naturally, all the two or three layouts should correspond to one another but absolute precision is not required, so long as no confusion arises regarding which touch-sensitive area is currently activated.","Touch screen interfaces are frequently used in connection with equipment in which the keyboard or keypad legend varies over time. A prime example is an automat which serves customers in several languages. Another example is a multi-function remote controller, wherein the keypad legend varies depending on which set or piece of equipment is being controlled. A residual problem in touch screen interfaces is that the act of touching per se does not provide the user with any feedback as to whether the key press was accepted or not. This is why prior art touch screen interfaces are normally provided with a separate feedback system which may employ visual or aural information. But for the reasons stated above, visual feedback is not always satisfactory and aural feedback has its own problems, such as difficulty of detection in noisy surroundings.","Accordingly, some embodiments of the invention address the above-described feedback problems by providing electro-sensory feedback indicating whether or not a touch-sensitive area is currently being activated.","In order to provide the electro-sensory stimulus which provides the user with an indication of the layout of the touch-sensitive areas, the touch screen interface according to the invention can be implemented by means of a capacitive electro-sensory interface as described in commonly assigned patent applications FI20075651, filed Sep. 18, 2007, or U.S. 60\/960,899, filed Oct. 18, 2007, both titled \u201cSensory interface\u201d. Later in this document, the acronym \u201cCEI\u201d refers to a capacitive electro-sensory interface.","The electro-sensory stimulus generator is preferably dimensioned such that the electrosensory sensation is produced independently of relative motion between the user's body member, such as a finger, and the insulated electrode(s). Creation of the electrosensory sensation without finger movement provides the benefit that the user's finger can feel an underlying area, to which a function is assigned. Some prior art techniques require finger movement to create the electrosensory sensation. For instance, reference document 1 (Yamamoto) discloses a technique in which a variable electric field is used to modulate the frictional force between the finger and the underlying surface. This means that the inventive technique can provide an indication when the user's finger is (stationary) on top of a predefined area, whereas the prior art, as exemplified by Yamamoto, can only indicate when the user's finger is moving over the predefined area. The ability to provide an indication of a stationary finger on top of a predefined area brings about the benefit that the user may select the function assigned to the predefined area, and then let their finger rest in place to wait for an acknowledgment that the user's selection of function has been accepted. The acknowledgment may be provided by varying the electrosensory stimulus, while the user's finger is stationary on top of the predefined area.","The embodiments described in the following relate to the operation and implementation of a capacitive electro-sensory interface (\u201cCEI\u201d) which can be employed in the inventive touch screen interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","106","108","120","121","106","120","106","120","121","122"]},"The high-voltage amplifier  is driven by a signal IN which results in a substantial portion of the energy content of the resulting Coulomb forces to reside in a frequency range to which the Pacinian corpuscles  are sensitive. For humans this frequency range is between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz, preferably between 50 Hz and 500 Hz and optimally between 100 Hz and 300 Hz, such as about 240 Hz. The frequency response of the Pacinian corpuscles is further discussed in connection with .","It should be understood that, while \u201ctactile\u201d is frequently defined as relating to a sensation of touch or pressure, the electrosensory interface according to the present CEI, when properly dimensioned, is capable of creating a sensation of vibration to a body member even when the body member  does not actually touch the insulator  overlaying the electrode . This means that unless the electrode  and\/or insulator  are very rigid, the pulsating Coulomb forces between the electrode  and body member  (particularly the Pacinian corpuscles ) may cause some slight mechanical vibration of the electrode  and\/or insulator , but the method and apparatus according to the CEI are capable of producing the electrosensory sensation independently of such mechanical vibration.","The high-voltage amplifier and the capacitive coupling over the insulator  are dimensioned such that the Pacinian corpuscles or other mechanoreceptors are stimulated and an electrosensory sensation (a sensation of apparent vibration) is produced. For this, the high-voltage amplifier  must be capable of generating an output of several hundred volts or even several kilovolts. In practice, the alternating current driven into the body member  has a very small magnitude and can be further reduced by using a low-frequency alternating current.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["100","102","104","104","100","102","112","114","100","106","108","120","121","106","121","122","122"]},"A benefit of the capacitive coupling between the electrode  and the electrically conductive tissue underneath the skin surface, which is known as the Corneus Layer and which contains the Pacinian corpuscles , is that the capacitive coupling eliminates high local current densities to finger tissue, which would result from contact that is conductive at direct current.","It is beneficial, although not strictly necessary, to provide a grounding connection which helps to bring the subject to be stimulated, such as the user of the apparatus, closer to a well-defined (non-floating) potential with respect to the high-voltage section of the apparatus. In the embodiment shown in , the grounding connection, denoted by reference numeral , connects a reference point REF of the high-voltage section to a body part  which is different from the body part(s)  to be stimulated. In the embodiment shown in , the reference point REF is at one end of the secondary winding of the transformer , while the drive voltage for the electrode(s) A, B, C is obtained from the opposite end of the secondary winding.","In an illustrative implementation, the apparatus is a hand-held apparatus which comprises a touch display activated by finger(s) . The grounding connection  terminates at a grounding electrode . An illustrative implementation of the grounding electrode  is one or more ground plates which are arranged such that they are conveniently touched one hand  of the user while the apparatus is manipulated by the other hand. The ground plate(s) may be positioned on the same side of the apparatus with the touch display and next to the touch display, or it\/they may be positioned on adjacent or opposite side(s) from the side which comprises the touch display, depending on ergonomic considerations, for example.","In real-world apparatuses, the coupling  between the reference point REF and the non-stimulated body part  may be electrically complex. In addition, hand-held apparatuses typically lack a solid reference potential with respect to the surroundings. Accordingly, the term \u201cgrounding connection\u201d does not require a connection to a solid-earth ground. Instead the grounding connection means any connection which helps to decrease the potential difference between the reference potential of the apparatus and a second body member distinct from the body member(s) to be stimulated. This definition does not rule out any capacitive parallel or stray elements, so long as the grounding connection  helps bring the user of the apparatus, along with the non-stimulated body part , to a potential which is reasonably well defined with respect to the high-voltage section of the apparatus. A capacitive grounding connection will be discussed in connection with . In the present context, the reasonably well-defined potential should be understood in view of the voltage OUT which drives the electrode(s) A, B, C. If the electrode drive voltage OUT is, say, 1000 V, a potential difference of, say, 100 V, between the user's body and the reference point REF may not be significant.","The non-capacitive coupling  between the reference point REF of the high-voltage section and the non-stimulated body part  greatly enhances the electro-sensory stimulus experienced by the stimulated body part . Conversely, an equivalent electro-sensory stimulus can be achieved with a much lower voltage and\/or over a thicker insulator when the non-capacitive coupling  is being used.","The amplifier ,  is driven with a high-frequency signal  which is modulated by a low-frequency signal  in a modulator . The frequency of the low-frequency signal  is such that the Pacinian corpuscles, which reside in the electrically conductive tissue underneath the skin surface, are responsive to that frequency. The frequency of the high-frequency signal  is preferably slightly above the hearing ability of humans, such as 18 to 25 kHz, more preferably between about 19 and 22 kHz. If the frequency of the signal  is within the audible range of humans, the apparatus and\/or its drive circuit may produce distracting sounds. On the other hand, if the frequency of the signal  is far above the audible range of humans, the apparatus drives more current into the member . A frequency of about 20 kHz is advantageous in the sense that components designed for audio circuits can generally be used, while the 20 kHz frequency is inaudible to most humans. Experiments carried out by the inventors suggest that such modulation is not essential for the CEI. Use of a high-frequency signal with low-frequency modulation, such as the one schematically shown in , as opposed to a system which relies on the low-frequency signal alone, provides the benefit that the relatively high alternating voltage (a few hundred volts or a few kilovolts) can be generated with a relatively small transformer .","Terms like frequency or kHz should not be understood such that the high- or low-frequency signals ,  are restricted to sinusoidal signals, and many other waveforms can be used, including square waves. The electrical components, such as the modulator , amplifier  and\/or transformer  can be dimensioned such that harmonic overtones are suppressed. The inventors have discovered that pulses with durations of 4 ms (approximately one half-cycle of the low-frequency signal) or longer can be readily detected and with a practical insulator thickness the peak-to-peak voltage in the electrode  needs to be at least 500 V, preferably about 750 V. Unloaded peak-to-peak voltage measured in the electrode  should be in the range of approximately 750 V-100 kV. Near the lower limit of this voltage range, the insulator thickness may be 0.05-1 mm, for example. As material technology and nanotechnology develop, even thinner durable insulating surfaces may become available. This may also permit a reduction of the voltages used.","The elements of  described so far produce a steady-state electrosensory sensation as long as the body member, such as the finger , is in the vicinity of the electrode . In order to convey useful information, the electrosensory sensation must be modulated. In some simple embodiments, such modulation can be implemented by positioning the electrode  such that useful information is conveyed by the fact that the finger  can sense the presence of the electrode . For example, the electrode  can be positioned over a switch, or in the vicinity of it, such that the switch can be detected without having to see it.","In other embodiments, such information-carrying modulation can be provided by electronically controlling one or more operating parameters of the inventive apparatus. The information-carrying modulation should not be confused with the modulation of the high-frequency signal  by the low-frequency signal , the purpose of which is to reduce the size of the transformer . In the schematic drawing shown in , such information-carrying modulation is provided by controller , which controls one or more of the operating parameters of the inventive apparatus. For instance, the controller  may enable, disable or alter the frequency or amplitude of the high- or low-frequency signals , , the gain of the amplifier , or it may controllably enable or disable the power supply (not shown separately) or controllably break the circuit at any point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["200","206","206","206","216","217","206","206","206","216","216"]},"A benefit of the embodiment shown in  is that virtually all the drive circuitry, including the high-voltage amplifier , controller , and switch matrix , can be integrated into a common enclosure which is denoted by reference numeral . In this embodiment only the electrodes A, B and C and a single connecting wire for each electrode are outside the enclosure . As stated earlier, the electrodes need to be nothing more than simple conducting or semi-conducting plates covered by appropriate insulators. Therefore the enclosure  can be positioned in virtually any convenient position because the only elements external to it are very simple electrodes and connecting wires (and, in some implementations a power supply, not shown separately).","Some prior art systems provide direct stimulation of nerves via galvanic current conduction to the outermost layer of the skin. Because of the galvanic current conduction, such systems require two electrodes to stimulate an area of skin.

The inventors have also studied an alternative hypothesis wherein the Pacinian corpuscles are stimulated by current flowing through them, but this hypothesis does not explain the observations as well as the one which is based on Coulomb forces acting on the Pacinian corpuscles.

The spatially varying sensory stimulation provides the user with an indication of the layout of the touch-sensitive areas of the touch screen interface.","In addition to the spatially varying sensory stimulation, the controller  may direct the switch array  to produce a temporally varying electro-sensory stimulation, which can be used for a wide variety of useful effects. For instance, the temporally varying electro-sensory stimulation can be used to indicate a detected activation of a touch-sensitive area (\u201ckey press\u201d). This embodiment address a common problem associated with prior art touch screen apparatuses, namely the fact that a detection of a key press produces no tactile feedback. It is true that the application-level program used via the touch screen apparatus may provide visual or aural feedback, which exhibit various problems described earlier. In addition production of the visual or aural feedback from the application-level program causes a burden on the programming and execution of those programs. In some implementations of the invention, an interface-level or driver-level program provides a tactile feedback from a detected activation of a touch-sensitive area by using the temporally and spatially variant electro-sensory stimulation, and such interface-level or driver-level programs can be used by any application-level programs. For example, the application-level programs can be coupled to the inventive touch screen interface via an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) whose set of available functions includes the feedback generation described above.","The temporally and spatially variant electro-sensory stimulation can also be used to change the layout of the touch-sensitive areas \u201con the fly\u201d. This operation is roughly analogous to changing the keyboard or keypad layout depending on the application program or user interface screen currently executed. However, when prior art touch screen apparatuses change keyboard or keypad layout on the fly, the new layout must be somehow indicated to the user, and this normally requires that the user sees the touch screen apparatus.","Some embodiments of the inventive interface apparatus eliminate the need to see the touch screen section or device, assuming that the layout of the touch-sensitive areas is sufficiently simple. For instance, up to about two dozen different \u201ckey legends\u201d can be indicated to the user by providing different patterns for the temporally and spatially variant electro-sensory stimulation. As used herein, the expression \u201ckey legend\u201d refers to the fact that prior art touch screen apparatuses, which produce no tactile feedback, normally produce visual cues, and these are commonly called \u201clegends\u201d. In some embodiments of the present invention, the function of the key legends can be provided via different patterns. For instance, the following patterns can be identified with one fingertip: pulses with low, medium or high repetition rate; sweeps to left, right, up or down, each with a few different repetition rates; rotations clockwise or anti-clockwise, each with a few different repetition rates.","From the above, it is evident that the inventive electro-sensory interface can produce a large number of different touch-sensitive areas, each with a distinct \u201cfeel\u201d (technically: a different pattern for the temporal and spatial variation of the electro-sensory stimulus). Hence the screen section of a conventional touch screen is not absolutely needed in connection with the present invention, and the term \u201ctouch input device\u201d or \u201ctouch input section\u201d should be interpreted as an interface equipment which, among other things, is suitable for applications commonly associated with touch screen equipment, although the presence of the screen is not mandatory.","Moreover, the strength of the capacitive coupling between the inventive CEI and a body member of its user (or the capacitive coupling between an individual electrode or a group of electrodes and the user's body member) can be determined by direct or indirect measurements. This measurement information can be utilized in various ways. For instance, the strength of the capacitive coupling can indicate the body member's proximity to the electrode, or it can indicate touching the electrode by the body member. Such measurement functionality can be provided by a dedicated measurement unit (not shown) or it can be integrated into one of the blocks described earlier, such as the switch matrix . The switch matrix  (or the optional dedicated measurement unit) can send the measurement information to the controller  which can utilize it to vary the electric fields generated by the electrodes, by varying the voltage or frequency. In addition or alternatively the controller  may forward the measurement information, or some information processed from it, to a data processing equipment, such as the personal computer PC shown in .","Yet further, two or more inventive interface devices can be interconnected via some communication network(s) and data processing equipment. In such an arrangement, the electro-sensory stimulation provided to the users of the touch screen devices may be based on some function of all users' contribution to the proximity to their respective devices. In one illustrative example, such an interconnection of two (or more) touch screen devices can provide their users with tactile feedback whose strength depends on the sum of the areas of hands touch the touch-sensitive areas. This technique simulates a handshake whose strength reflects the sum of hand pressure exerted by both (or all) users. In another illustrative example, a music teacher might \u201csense\u201d how a remotely located student presses the keys of a simulated piano keyboard.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1","2","1","2","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"U","mn":"1"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"C","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"C","mn":"1"},{"mi":"C","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"e"}}}}},"This voltage is lower than the drive voltage e from the voltage source. In a general case the reference potential of the apparatus may be floating, as will be shown in . This arrangement further decreases the electric field directed to the body member, such as finger.","For these reasons some embodiments of the invention aim at keeping the capacitance C low in comparison to that of C. At least capacitance C should not be significantly higher than C. Some embodiments aim at adjusting or controlling C, for instance by coupling the reference potential of the apparatus back to the user, as will be shown in .","Instead of the measures described in connection with , or in addition to such measures, stray capacitances can be controlled by arrangements in which several electrodes are used to generate potential differences among different areas of the touch screen surface. By way of example, this technique can be implemented by arranging the touch-sensitive surface of a hand-held device (eg the top side of the device) to a first potential, while the opposite side is arranged to a second potential, wherein the two different potentials can be the positive and negative poles of the device. Alternatively, a first surface area can be the electric ground (reference potential), while a second surface area is charged to a high potential.","Moreover, within the constraints imposed by the insulator layer(s), it is possible to form minuscule areas of different potentials, such as potentials with opposite signs or widely different magnitudes, wherein the areas are small enough that the user's body member, such as finger, is simultaneously subjected to the electric fields from several areas with different potentials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["4","1","2"]},"In one implementation, the apparatus is arranged to utilize such indication of the touching or approaching body member such that the apparatus uses a first (lower) voltage to detect the touching or approaching by the body member and a second (higher) voltage to provide feedback to the user. For instance, such feedback can indicate any of the following: the outline of the\/each touch-sensitive area, a detection of the touching or approaching body member by the apparatus, the significance of (the act to be initiated by) the touch-sensitive area, or any other information processed by the application program and which is potentially useful to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","120","1406"],"sub":["1","2 ","3","1","2 ","3 "]},"According to an embodiment of the invention, a conventional touch-sensitive screen  can be complemented by a tactile output device according to an embodiment of the invention. Reference numeral  denotes an electrode which is an implementation of the electrodes described in connection with previously-described embodiments, such as the electrode  described in connection with . A supplemental insulator  may be positioned between the touch-sensitive screen  and the inventive electrode , in case the touch-sensitive screen  itself provides sufficient insulation.","In addition to conventional touch-screen functionality, namely detection of approaching or touching by the touch-sensitive areas by the user's finger, the controller  uses information of the position of the finger  to temporally vary the intensity of the electro-sensory stimulation invoked by the electrode  on the finger . Although the intensity of the electro-sensory stimulation is varied over time, time is not an independent variable in the present embodiment. Instead, timing of the temporal variations is a function of the position of the finger  relative to the touch-sensitive areas (here: A, Aand A). Thus it is more accurate to say that the present embodiment is operable to cause variations in the intensity of the electro-sensory stimulation invoked by the electrode  on the finger , wherein the variations are based on the position of the finger  relative to the touch-sensitive areas.","The bottom side of  illustrates this functionality. The three touch-sensitive area A, Aand Aare demarcated by respective x coordinate pairs {x, x}, {x, x} and {x, x}. (Processing in the y direction is analogous and a detailed description is omitted.) The controller  does not sense the presence of the finger, or senses the finger as inactive, as long as the finger is to the left of any of the touch-sensitive areas A, Aand A. In this example the controller  responds by applying a low-intensity signal to the electrode . As soon as the finger  crosses the x coordinate value x, the controller  detects the finger over the first touch-sensitive area Aand starts to apply a medium-intensity signal to the electrode . Between the areas Aand A(between x coordinates xand x), the controller again applies a low-intensity signal to the electrode . The second touch-sensitive area Ais processed similarly to the first touch-sensitive area A, but the third touch-sensitive area Ais processed somewhat differently. As soon as the controller  detects the finger  above or in close proximity to the area A, it begins to apply the medium-intensity signal to the electrode , similarly to areas Aand A. But the user decides to press the touch screen  at a point x within the third area A. The controller  detects the finger press (activation of the function assigned to the area A) and responds by applying a high-intensity signal to the electrode .","Thus the embodiment shown in  can provide the user with a tactile feedback which creates an illusion of a textures surface, although only a single electrode  was used to create the electro-sensory stimulus. A residual problem is, however, that the user has to memorize the significance of the several touch-sensitive areas or obtain visual or aural information on their significance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14","FIG. 15"]},"The operation of the embodiment shown in  differs from the one described in connection with  in that the controller, here denoted by reference numeral , applies different temporal variations to the intensity of the signal to the electrode . In this example, the first touch-sensitive area Ais processed similarly to the preceding embodiment, or in other words, the intensity of the electro-sensory stimulus depends only on the presence of the finger  in close proximity to the area A. But in close proximity to areas Aand A, the controller  also applies temporal variations to the intensity of the electro-sensory stimulus. For example the significance (coarsely analogous with a displayed legend) of area Ais indicated by a pulsed electro-sensory stimulus at a first (low) repetition rate, while the significance of area Ais indicated by a pulsed electro-sensory stimulus at a second (higher) repetition rate. In an illustrative example, the three touch-sensitive areas A, Aand Acan invoke the three functions in a yes\/no\/cancel-type user interface, wherein the user can sense the positions of the user interface keys (here: the three touch-sensitive areas) and the indication of an accepted input only via tactile feedback. In other words, the user needs no visual or aural information on the positions of the touch-sensitive areas or on the selected function. The embodiment described in connection with  is particularly attractive in car navigators or the like, which should not require visual attention from their users.","In the embodiments shown in , when the user's finger  has selected the function assigned to area Aand the controller CTRL ,  generates the high-intensity electro-sensory stimulus via the electrode , the high-intensity stimulus is sensed via any of the areas A, Aand A. In other words, if one finger of the user presses the area A, other finger(s) in close proximity to the other areas Aand\/or Awill also sense the high-intensity stimulus. In cases where this is not desirable, the embodiments shown in  can be combined with the multi-electrode embodiment disclosed in connection with , such that the signal to each of several electrodes (shown in  as items through ) is controlled individually.","In the scenarios shown in , the variation of the electrosensory stimulus on the finger  was synchronized on the basis of the finger's movement over the areas A, Aand A. But unlike some prior art technologies, such as the one disclosed in reference document 1, the present invention does not require finger movement to create the electrosensory stimulus or the user's sensation. In other words, the illusion of a textured surface is based on the finger's position (and the stimulus intensity applied by the controller at the various positions) but not on finger movement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 16A","b":["1600","1602","1604","1606","1608","1620","1640","1620","1622","1624","1640","1642","1644"]},"The embodiment A also comprises a tactile output section, which is comprised of a tactile output controller  and an insulated electrode layer , interconnected by an interconnection wire .

On the other hand, the embodiment B shown in  more easily lends itself to upgrade devices for pre-existing touch-sensitive displays.","In some implementations, it is beneficial to provide a floating energy feed and signalling interface to the touch input section of the interface apparatus. Benefits of the floating coupling include the possibility to share elements between the touch-sensitive layer  and the insulated electrode layer . For instance, a conductive film may act as both the touch-sensitive layer  and the insulated electrode layer . The tactile output controller  may be isolated from the bus , wherein the isolation is applied to both energy feed and signalling. Energy feed to the tactile output controller  may be inductive or capacitive, for example. Optical isolation may be used for signalling. This makes it possible to use the touch-sensitive layer , together with its control electronics, also as the insulated electrode layer . The insulation for the floating coupling can be installed on either side of the touch input controller .","One specific implementation involves creating a patterned structure on top of capacitive sensing area. The patterned structure has areas of different conductivity. When the topmost electrosensory layer is not charged to a high voltage for usage as a tactile output, it provides a spatial distribution of conductivity to an underlying capacitive detector or a grid of capacitive detectors which respond to variations of the capacitive coupling between the user's finger and the capacitive sensing area as the user's finger approaches or touches various positions of the sensing area. Such a grid for capacitive sensing may be called a projected capacitive screen. The capacitive detectors are operated at a relatively high frequency compared to the capacitive output system. The input devices typically operate using frequencies from several kilohertz to several megahertz, while the capacitive electrosensory output system operates at a frequency between a few dozes and a few hundred Hertz. Thus the capacitive input is able to detect the location of the touching body member. When the tactile output is used in the low frequency range, the top layer becomes approximately evenly charged and provides the electrosensory tactile output. In the case of a touch screen, the conductive areas can be made of indium tin oxide (ITO), for example, and the less conductive areas can be made of either thinner, less conductive, ITO or a semiconductive transparent polymer, for example.","Grounding of the interface apparatus and its user was studied in connection with  by means of equivalent diagrams. As regards practical implementation, grounding may be of capacitive or galvanic (resistive or semi-conductive) in nature. Capacitive grounding isolates direct current while the other forms of grounding conduct direct current at least to some degree. While galvanic grounding, ie, grounding via negligible resistance, is functionally good, in some circumstances it may be uncomfortable to the user because of intensive static discharges. In an implementation with multiple individually controlled electrodes, a ground reference for an electrode may be provided by its neighbour electrodes.","It is readily apparent to a person skilled in the art that, as the technology advances, the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways.
