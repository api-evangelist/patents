This description and its specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only. This invention, therefore, is not limited to the embodiments described in this patent application, and may be variously modified.","Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. In this application, the use of \u201cor\u201d means \u201cand\/or\u201d unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term \u201cincluding\u201d, as well as other forms, such as \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluded\u201d, is not limiting.

For a variable that occurs more than one time in any substituent or in the compound of the invention or any other formulae herein, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Combinations of substituents are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Stable compounds are compounds which can be isolated in a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture.","It is meant to be understood that proper valences are maintained for all combinations herein, that monovalent moieties having more than one atom are attached through their left ends, and that divalent moieties are drawn from left to right.","As used in the specification and the appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated:","The term \u201calkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbyl substituent typically containing from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl, and hexyl and the like.\n\nThe term \u201calkenyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more double bonds and typically from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethenyl (vinyl), 2-propenyl, 3-propenyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, 1,4-butadienyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, and 3-butenyl and the like.\n\nThe term \u201calkynyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more triple bonds and typically from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, 2-butynyl, and 3-butynyl and the like.\n\nThe term \u201ccarbocyclyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d), partially saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkenyl\u201d), or completely unsaturated (i.e., \u201caryl\u201d) hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms (\u201cring atoms\u201d are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent). A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.\n\nA carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 7 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl. In a fused-ring carbocyclyl system, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two- or three-fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl (tetralinyl), indenyl, indanyl (dihydroindenyl), anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and decalinyl.\n\nThe term \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring, which typically contains from 3 to 7 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single-ring cycloalkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. A cycloalkyl may alternatively be polycyclic or contain more than one ring. Examples of polycyclic cycloalkyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls.\n\nThe term \u201caryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, and indenyl.\n\nIn some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC-C-\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 6 carbon ring atoms.\n\nThe term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.\n\nThe term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.\n\nThe term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.\n\nThe term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.\n\nThe term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).\n\nA substituent is \u201csubstitutable\u201d if it comprises at least one carbon or nitrogen atom that is bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms. Thus, for example, hydrogen, halogen, and cyano do not fall within this definition. In addition, a sulfur atom in a heterocyclyl containing such atom is substitutable with one or two oxo substituents.\n\nIf a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated). If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.\n\nThis patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.\n\nThe prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).\n\nThe prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term \u201cperfluoro\u201d means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term \u201cperfluoroalkyl\u201d means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.\n\nThe term \u201ccarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014.\n\nThe term \u201caminocarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014NH.\n\nThe term \u201coxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an ether substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014O\u2014.\n\nThe term \u201calkyloxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an alkylether substituent, i.e., \u2014O-alkyl. Examples of such a substituent include methoxy (\u2014O\u2014CH), ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, iso-butoxy, sec-butoxy, and tert-butoxy.\n\nThe term \u201calkylcarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)-alkyl.\n\nThe term \u201caminoalkylcarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)-alkyl-NH.\n\nThe term \u201calkyloxycarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014O-alkyl.\n\nThe term \u201ccarbocyclylcarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)-carbocyclyl.\n\nSimilarly, the term \u201cheterocyclylcarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)-heterocyclyl.\n\nThe term \u201ccarbocyclylalkylcarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)-alkyl-carbocyclyl.\n\nSimilarly, the term \u201cheterocyclylalkylcarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)-alkyl-heterocyclyl.\n\nThe term \u201ccarbocyclyloxycarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014O-carbocyclyl.\n\nThe term \u201ccarbocyclylalkyloxycarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014O-alkyl-carbocyclyl.\n\nThe term \u201cthio\u201d or \u201cthia\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a thiaether substituent, i.e., an ether substituent wherein a divalent sulfur atom is in the place of the ether oxygen atom. Such a substituent may be depicted as \u2014S\u2014. This, for example, \u201calkyl-thio-alkyl\u201d means alkyl-5-alkyl (alkyl-sulfanyl-alkyl).\n\nThe term \u201cthiol\u201d or \u201csulfhydryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a sulfhydryl substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014SH.\n\nThe term \u201c(thiocarbonyl)\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a carbonyl wherein the oxygen atom has been replaced with a sulfur. Such a substituent may be depicted as \u2014C(S)\u2014.\n\nThe term \u201csulfonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014S(O)\u2014.\n\nThe term \u201caminosulfonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014S(O)\u2014NH.\n\nThe term \u201csulfinyl\u201d or \u201csulfoxido\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014S(O)\u2014.\n\nThe term \u201cheterocyclyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated (i.e., \u201cheterocycloalkyl\u201d), partially saturated (i.e., \u201cheterocycloalkenyl\u201d), or completely unsaturated (i.e., \u201cheteroaryl\u201d) ring structure containing a total of 3 to 14 ring atoms. At least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom (i.e., oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur), with the remaining ring atoms being independently selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. A heterocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.\n\nA heterocyclyl may be a single ring, which typically contains from 3 to 7 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms.

Examples of heteroaryl substituents include 6-membered ring substituents such as pyridyl, pyrazyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, and 1,3,5-, 1,2,4- or 1,2,3-triazinyl; 5-membered ring substituents such as imidazyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, 1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, 1,2,5-, or 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl and isothiazolyl; 6\/5-membered fused ring substituents such as benzothiofuranyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, purinyl, and anthranilyl; and 6\/6-membered fused rings such as benzopyranyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, cinnolinyl, quinazolinyl, and benzoxazinyl.\n\nA prefix attached to a multi-component substituent only applies to the first component. To illustrate, the term \u201calkylcycloalkyl\u201d contains two components: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, the C-C\u2014 prefix on C-C-alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the C-C-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further, the prefix \u201chalo\u201d on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as \u201chalogen-substituted alkyloxyalkyl\u201d rather than \u201chaloalkyloxyalkyl.\u201d And finally, if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as \u201calkyloxyhaloalkyl.\u201d\n","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed, in part, to a class of compounds having a structure of Formula I",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0043"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"29.72mm","wi":"59.86mm","file":"US08093396-20120110-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"R, R, and Rare independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, R(O)CO(O)R, NRR, and \u2014C(O)NRR;
