title: Automatically persisting data from a model to a database
abstract: Projects often involve multiple teams of developers in different locations. The different teams make updates to a central or shared database(s) that can store information about the project, such as progress. Each team or even different members of the different teams can check out instances of a representation of a model for the project. The different teams/members can independently modify their instance with data specific to that member and/or team. Database operations embedded in the individual instances are then executed on the database(s) to persist the data from their individual instances to the database(s). Database mechanisms can handle locking and/or conflicts that may arise from performance of the database operations. A manager can then request a report from the database(s), and the report with data from the different members and/or teams can be generated from the database(s).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["Embodiments of the inventive subject matter generally relate to the field of data persistence and modeling, and, more particularly, to persisting data from an instance of a model to a database.","The Unified Modeling Language\u2122 (UML\u2122) is the industry-standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting artifacts of software systems. One of the visual depictions of models created in accordance with UML is a class diagram. A class diagram represents classes, attributes of the classes, and relationships between classes.","Embodiments of the inventive subject matter include a method for automatically persisting data from an instance of a representation of a model to a database. The method comprises fetching an instance of a representation of a model. The instance of the model representation is comprised of a plurality of elements. A first element of the plurality of elements is annotated with a database operation for execution on a database, and data to persist from the instance of the model representation to the database. The database has a schema defined to be congruous with the model. The first element is indicated as having data to persist to the database. The instance of the model representation is used to automatically persist the data from the instance of the model representation to the database.","The description that follows includes exemplary systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences and computer program products that embody techniques of the present inventive subject matter. However, it is understood that the described embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. For instance, although examples refer to annotation, database operations and\/or data to be persisted to a database may be embedded as an attribute or tagged value in an element of an instance of a representation of a model. In other instances, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obfuscate the description.","A model can be used to persist data to a database. Using a mapping file or creating custom code, however, persists the data in a rigid manner. If using a mapping file, whoever maintains the mapping file must be informed of any changes to the database schema. If custom code is used, then whoever maintains the custom code must be informed of changes to the model by the topology architect. Embedding database operations in elements of an instance of a model representation allows data to persist from a model to a database with flexibility.","Projects often involve multiple teams of developers in different locations. The different teams make updates to a central or shared database(s) that can store information about the project, such as progress. Each team or even different members of the different teams can check out instances of a representation of a model for the project. The different teams\/members can independently modify their instance with data specific to that member and\/or team. Database operations embedded in the individual instances are then executed on the database(s) to persist the data from their individual instances to the database(s). Database mechanisms can handle locking and\/or conflicts that may arise from performance of the database operations. A manager can then request a report from the database(s), and the report with data from the different members and\/or teams can be generated from the database(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["111","117","119","115","111","111","107","113","115"]},"The model representation instance  includes a plurality of elements , , and  for class objects. Each element , , and  indicates a class, one or more attributes for the class, and one or more annotations. One or more database operations are embedded in each of the annotations. Data to persist to the database  is also embedded in the annotations. The annotation can be made automatically or manually. Some or all of the annotations may exist in the instance  as checked out from the model store . A user or process can then modify, add, and\/or remove annotations at the client . Although not depicted, the instance  may also have rules and\/or custom logic to be applied. As with the annotations, a user and\/or process can modify, add, and\/or delete rules and\/or custom logic in the instance .","At a stage B, a transform engine  walks over the instance  to determine any elements marked or indicated as having data to persist to the database. An element can be marked, for example, with a stereotype, a flag, etc. The transform engine  determines the database operations embedded in the elements of the instance , including the elements , , and .","The transform engine  then causes the determined database operations to be performed on a database  at a stage C. The schema of the database  is congruous with the model. The transform engine  can cause the database operations to be performed with different techniques. For instance, the transform engine  can execute the database operations directly. As another example, the transform engine can pass the database operations to another process or make calls to an application programming interface. Performing the embedded database operations allows the data to persist from the instance  to the database .","The stages A, B, and C are performed at the clients  and , as well as  using instances of the model representation fetched from the model store . With the data persisted to the database  from the client ,  and , reports can be generated with the data persisted from the various independent instances of the model representation. At a stage D, a client  requests a report based on the data in the database . At a stage E, one or more reports are generated from the database .","It should be understood that the example depicted in  is meant to aid in understanding embodiments and should not be used to limit embodiments. For instance, embodiments are not limited to client devices. The functionality described in  may be performed on server devices, devices that operate as both client and server, etc. As another example, it is not necessary for different devices to automatically persist data from a model to a database and to request reports. Although not limited to a single device, a single device can both automatically persist data from a model to a database and generate a report from the database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["201","203","205","207","209","211"]},"At block , the data is written into the annotation of the selected element. For instance, the already embedded database operation is modified to write the determined data to the target database.","At block , an annotation is created on the selected element. The annotation is created with a database operation and the determined data. Embodiments can use different techniques to annotate the selected element (e.g., write the database operation with the data, write the database operation and the data separately, write the database operation with a reference to the data, etc.). At block , it is indicated that the selected element has data to persist. For example, the selected element is marked with a flag. As another example, a process or thread sets a tagged value in the selected element or defines a stereotype. The stereotype indicates the element has data to persist to a database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","303","305","309","307"]},"At block , a database operation embedded in the element is queued. Control flows from block  to block .","At block , it is determined if the traversal is complete. If the traversal is complete, then control flows to block . If not, then control flows to block .","At block , traversal continues. Control flows from block  to block .","At block , the queued database operations are dequeued and caused to be performed.","The example operation in the depicted flowcharts are intended to aid in understanding embodiments and should not construed as limiting embodiments. Embodiments may perform additional operations, fewer operations, and\/or different operations. For instance, referring to , the embedded database operations may be executed as they are encountered. In another embodiment, a process or thread scans the queue of database operations to optimize the database operations (e.g., locate and eliminate redundant operations). In another embodiment, a list of references can be maintained for each element with persistable data instead or in addition to marking the elements.","The described embodiments may be provided as a computer program product, or software, that may include a machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions, which may be used to program a computer system (or other electronic device(s)) to perform a process according to embodiments, whether presently described or not, since every conceivable variation is not enumerated herein.
