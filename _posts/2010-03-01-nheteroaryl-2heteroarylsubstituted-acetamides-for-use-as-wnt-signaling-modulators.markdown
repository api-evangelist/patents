PCT\/US2010\/025813 filed Mar. 1, 2010, which application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/156,599 filed Mar. 2, 2009; and to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/245,187 filed Sep. 23, 2009. Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.","The present invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating the Wnt signaling pathway.","The Wnt gene family encodes a large class of secreted proteins related to the Int1\/Wnt1 proto-oncogene and wingless (\u201cWg\u201d), a Wnt1 homologue (Cadigan et al. (1997) Genes & Development 11:3286-3305). Wnts are expressed in a variety of tissues and organs and play a major role in many developmental processes, including segmentation in ; endoderm development in ; and establishment of limb polarity, neural crest differentiation, kidney morphogenesis, sex determination, and brain development in mammals (Parr, et al. (1994) Curr. Opinion Genetics & Devel. 4:523-528). The Wnt pathway is a master regulator in animal development, both during embryogenesis and in the mature organism (Eastman, et al. (1999) Curr Opin Cell Biol 11: 233-240; Peifer, et al. (2000) Science 287: 1606-1609).","Wnt signals are transduced by the Frizzled (\u201cFz\u201d) family of seven transmembrane domain receptors (Bhanot et al. (1996) Nature 382:225-230). Wnt ligands bind to Fzd, and in so doing, activate the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl-1, 2 and 3 in humans and mice) (Boutros, et al. (1999) Mech Dev 83: 27-37) and phosphorylate LRP5\/6. A signal is thereby generated which prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of Armadillo\/\u03b2(beta)-catenin, in turn leading to the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin (Perrimon (1994) Cell 76:781-784). This stabilization is occasioned by Dvl's association with axin (Zeng et al. (1997) Cell 90:181-192), a scaffolding protein that brings various proteins together, including GSK3, APC, CK1, and \u03b2-catenin, to form the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex.","The Wingless-type (Wnt) Frizzled protein receptor pathway involves important regulatory genes that carry polymorphisms associated with primary carcinomas. In the course of downstream signaling, cytosolic \u03b2-catenin accumulates, translocates into the nucleus, and then enhances gene expression by complexing with other transcription factors Uthoff et al., 31:56-62 (2001). In the absence of Wnt signals, free cytosolic \u03b2-catenin is incorporated into a complex consisting of Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2. Conjunctional phosphorylation of Axin, APC, and \u03b2-catenin by GSK-3\u03b2 designates \u03b2-catenin for the ubiquitin pathway and degradation by proteasomes Uthoff et al., 31:56-62 (2001); Matsuzawa et al., 7:915-926 (2001).","Disheveled (Dvl) is a positive mediator of Wnt signalling positioned downstream of the frizzled receptors and upstream of \u03b2catenin. GSK-3 phosphorylates several proteins in the Wnt pathway and is instrumental in the downstream regulation of \u03b2catenin. Mutations in the gene APC are an initiating event for both sporadic and hereditary colorectal tumorigenesis. APC mutants are relevant in tumorigenesis, since the aberrant protein is an integral part of the Wnt-signaling cascade. The protein product contains several functional domains acting as binding and degradation sites for \u03b2catenin. Mutations that occur in the amino-terminal segment of \u03b2catenin are usually involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation and, thus, stabilize \u03b2 catenin. When stabilized cytoplasmic-catenin accumulates, it translocates to the nucleus interacting with the Tcf\/Lef high-mobility group of transcription factors that modulate expression of oncogenes such as c-myc.","It is known that Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling promotes cell survival in various cell types Orford et al., 146:855-868 (1999); Cox et al., 155:1725-1740 (2000); Reya et al., 13:15-24 (2000); Satoh et al., 24:245-250 (2000); Shin et al., 274:2780-2785 (1999); Chen et al., 152:87-96 (2001); Ioannidis et al., 2:691-697 (2001). Wnt signaling pathway is also thought to be associated with tumor development and\/or progression (Polakis et al., 14:1837-1851 (2000); Cox et al., 155:1725-1740 (2000); Bienz et al., 103:311-320 (2000); You et al., 157:429-440 (2002)). Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is associated with a variety of human cancers, correlating with the over-expression or amplification of c-Myc (Polakis et al., 14:1837-1851 (2000); Bienz et al., 103:311-320 (2000); Brown et al., 3:351-355 (2001); He et al., 281:1509-1512 (1998); Miller et al., 18:7860-7872 (1999).

No. 6,602,677. The assay may be conducted in 96- or 384-well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS). See Cree et al (1995) 6:398-404. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units (RLU). Inhibition of cell proliferation may also be measured using colony formation assays known in the art.","Furthermore, the invention provides for methods of treating a Wnt-mediated disorder in a mammal suffering therefrom, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a Wnt antagonist. In one embodiment, the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder associated with aberrant, e.g., increased, expression of activity of Wnt signaling. In another embodiment, the disorder results from increased expression of a Wnt protein. In yet another embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer, such as for example, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cancer associated with various disorders relating to HSC's, such as leukemias and various other blood related cancers, and cancer related to neuronal proliferative disorders, including brain tumors, such as gliomas, astrocytomas, meningiomas, Schwannomas, pituitary tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), medulloblastomas, craniopharyngioma, pineal region tumors, and skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.","Treatment of the cell proliferative disorder by administration of a Wnt antagonist results in an observable and\/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following: reduction in the number of cancer cells or absence of the cancer cells; reduction in the tumor size; inhibition of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone; inhibition of tumor metastasis; inhibition, to some extent, of tumor growth; and\/or relief to some extent, one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific cancer; reduced morbidity and mortality, and improvement in quality of life issues. To the extent the Wnt antagonist may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. Reduction of these signs or symptoms may also be felt by the patient.","The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TDP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR). Metastasis can be determined by staging tests and by bone scan and tests for calcium level and other enzymes to determine spread to the bone. CT scans can also be done to look for spread to the pelvis and lymph nodes in the area. Chest X-rays and measurement of liver enzyme levels by known methods are used to look for metastasis to the lungs and liver, respectively. Other routine methods for monitoring the disease include transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and transrectal needle biopsy (TRNB). In a specific embodiment, the administration of Wnt antagonist decreases tumor burden (e.g., reduces size or severity of the cancer). In yet another specific embodiment, the administration of Wnt antagonist kills the cancer.","Pharmacology and Utility","The present invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. In particular embodiments, the present invention provides compositions and methods that inhibit Wnt signal transduction activity by modulating activation of the Wnt pathway, thereby treating, diagnosing, preventing, and\/or ameliorating Wnt signaling-related disorders.","The current paradigm for developing therapies for Wnt signaling-related disorders relies on targeting \u03b2-cat or Wnt pathway components downstream of \u03b2-cat. Recent studies, however, suggest that inhibition of the extracellular ligand-receptor interaction component is effective in reducing the tumorigenicity, even though the event initiating the Wnt signaling may have occurred downstream. Moreover, the transfection of inoperative frizzled receptor (Frz7 ectodomain) into carcinoma cell line (SK-CO-1) restored a normal \u03b2-catenin phenotype. This cell line has active Wnt signaling due to a homozygous APC mutation. Such cells also did not demonstrate tumor formation when transferred in vivo. Vincan et al., Differentiation 2005; 73: 142-153. This demonstrates that the inhibition of Wnt signaling at the extracellular level can downregulate Wnt signaling resulting from activation of a downstream intracellular Wnt signaling pathway component. This further suggests that inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway may be used in the treatment of any Wnt-mediated disorder, regardless of the particular manner in which Wnt signaling has been activated.","Disorders Associated with Wnt Signaling Activity","Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway may be caused by somatic mutations in genes encoding various Wnt signaling pathway components. For example, aberrant Wnt signaling activity has been associated with Wnt ligand overexpression in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [You et al., 2004; 23: 6170-6174], chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [Lu et al., 2004; 101: 3118-3123], gastric cancer [Kim et al., 2003; 25: 211-215; Saitoh et al., 2002; 9: 515-519], head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [Rhee et al., 2002; 21: 6598-6605], colorectal cancer [Holcombe et al., 2002; 55: 220-226], ovarian cancer [Ricken et al., 2002; 143: 2741-2749], basal cell carcinoma (BCC) [Lo Muzio et al., 2002; 22: 565-576] and breast cancer. Moreover, the reduction of various Wnt ligand regulatory molecules such as sFRP and WIF-1 have been associated with breast cancer [Klopocki et al., 2004; 25: 641-649; Ugolini et al., 2001; 20: 5810-5817; Wissmann et al., 2003; 201: 204-212], bladder cancer [Stoehr et al., 2004; 84: 465-478; Wissmann et al., supra], mesothelioma [Lee et al., 2004; 23: 6672-6676], colorectal cancer [Suzuki et al., 2004; 36: 417-422; Kim et al., 2002; 1: 1355-1359; Caldwell et al., 2004; 64: 883-888], prostate cancer [Wissman et al., supra], NSCLC [Mazieres et al., 2004; 64: 4717-4720], and lung cancer [Wissman et al., supra].","Aberrant Wnt signaling resulting from overexpression of various components of the Frz-LRP receptor complex have also been associated with certain cancers. For example, LRP5 overexpression has been associated with osteosarcoma [Hoang et al., 2004; 109: 106-111], while Frz overexpression has been associated with cancers such as prostate [Wissmann et al., supra], HNSCC [Rhee et al., 2002; 21: 6598-6605], colorectal [Holcombe et al., supra], ovarian cancer [Wissman et al., supra], esophageal [Tanaka et al., 1998; 95: 10164-10169] and gastric [Kirikoshi et al., 2001; 19: 111-115]. Additionally, overexpression of Wnt signaling pathway components such as Dishevelled have been associated with cancers such as prostate [Wissman et al, supra], breast [Nagahata et al., 2003; 94: 515-518], mesothelioma [Uematsu et al., 2003; 63: 4547-4551] and cervical [Okino et al, 2003; 10: 1219-1223]. Frat-1 overexpression has been associated with cancers such as pancreatic, esophageal, cervical, breast and gastric. [Saitoh et al., 2002; 20: 785-789; Saitoh et al., 2001; 19: 311-315]. Axin loss of function (LOF) mutations have been associated with hepatocellular cancer [Satoh et al., 2000; 24: 245-250; Taniguchi et al., 2002; 21: 4863-4871] and medulloblastoma [Dahmen et al., 2001; 61: 7039-7043; Yokota et al., 2002; 101: 198-201].","Furthermore, a multitude of cancers has been associated with activating \u03b2-catenin through disruption of the \u201cdegradation complex\u201d such as gain-of-function mutations in \u03b2-catenin or loss-of-function mutations in APC. A reduction in the degradation of \u03b2-catenin results in greater amounts of functional \u03b2-catenin in the cell, which then causes increased transcription of the target genes, resulting in aberrant cell proliferation. For example, mutations in the gene encoding \u03b2-catenin (i.e., CTNNB1) have been associated with cancers such as gastric [Clements et al., 2002; 62: 3503-3506; Park et al., 1999; 59: 4257-4260], colorectal [Morin et al., 1997; 275: 1787-1790; Ilyas et al., 1997; 94: 10330-10334], intestinal carcinoid [Fujimori et al., 2001; 61: 6656-6659], ovarian [Sunaga et al., 2001; 30: 316-321], pulmonary adenocarcinoma [Sunaga et al., supra], endometrial [Fukuchi et al., 1998; 58: 3526-3528; Kobayashi et al., 1999; 90: 55-59; Mirabelli-Primdahl et al., 1999; 59: 3346-3351], hepatocellular [Satoh et al., supra.; Wong et al., 2001; 92: 136-145], hepatoblastoma [Koch et al., 1999; 59: 269-273], medulloblastoma [Koch et al., 2001; 93: 445-449], pancreatic [Abraham et al., 2002; 160: 1361- 1999; 59: 1811-1815; Garcia-Rostan et al., 2001; 158: 987-996], prostate [Chesire et al., 2000; 45: 323-334; Voeller et al., 1998; 58: 2520-2523], melanoma [Reifenberger et al., 2002; 100: 549-556], pilomatricoma [Chan et al., 1999; 21: 410-413], Wilms' tumor [Koesters et al., 2003; 199: 68-76], pancreatoblastomas [Abraham et al., 2001; 159: 1619-1627], liposarcomas [Sakamoto et al., 2002; 126: 1071-1078], juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas [Abraham et al., 2001; 158: 1073-1078], desmoid [Tejpar et al., 1999; 18: 6615-6620; Miyoshi et al., 1998; 10: 591-594], synovial sarcoma [Saito et al., 2000; 192: 342-350]. While loss-of-function mutations have been associated with cancers such as colorectal [Fearon et al., 1990; 61: 759-767; Rowan et al., 2000; 97: 3352-3357], melanoma [Reifenberger et al., 2002; 100: 549-556; Rubinfeld et al., 1997; 275: 1790-1792], medulloblastoma [Koch et al., 2001; 93: 445-449; Huang et al., 2000; 156: 433-437] and desmoids [Tejpar et al., 1999; 18: 6615-6620; Alman et al., 1997; 151: 329-334].","Other disorders associated with aberrant Wnt signaling, include but are not limited to osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, polycystic kidney disease, diabetes, schizophrenia, vascular disease, cardiac disease, non-oncogenic proliferative diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.","Aberrant Wnt Signaling in Cancers and Leukemia","Aberrant Wnt pathway activation, through the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin, plays a central role in tumorigenesis for many colorectal carcinomas. It is estimated that 80% of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) harbor inactivating mutations in the tumor repressor APC, which allows for uninterrupted Wnt signaling. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the Wnt-pathway activation may be involved in melanoma, breast, liver, lung, gastric cancer, and other cancers.","Unregulated activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is also a precursor to the development of leukemia. Experimental evidence exists supporting the oncogenic growth of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages as dependent on Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling has been implicated in regulating both the chronic and acute forms of myeloid leukemia. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients and blast crisis cells from patients resistant to therapy display activated Wnt signaling. Moreover, inhibition of \u03b2-catenin through ectopic expression of Axin decreases the replating capacity of leukemic cells in vitro, suggesting that chronic myelogenous leukemia precursors are dependent on Wnt signaling for growth and renewal. Wnt overexpression also caused GMPs to acquire stem-cell-like properties of long-term self renewal, supporting the hypothesis that Wnt signaling is important for the normal development of blood lineages, but that aberrant Wnt signaling results in the transformation of progenitor cells.","Recent studies also suggest that lymphoid neoplasias may also be influenced by Wnt signaling. Wnt-16 is overexpressed in pre-B-cell leukemia cell lines carrying the E2A-PbX translocation, suggesting that autocrine Wnt activity may contribute to oncogenesis. McWhirter, et al., 96: 11464-11469 (1999). The role of Wnt signaling in the growth and survival of normal B-cell progenitors further supports this notion. Reya et al., 13: 15-24 (2000); Ranheim et al., 105: 2487-2494 (2005). Autocrine dependence on Wnt has also been proposed for regulating the growth of multiple myeloma, a cancer of terminally differentiated B-cells. Derksen et al., 101: 6122-6127 (2004). Primary myelomas and myeloma cell lines were also found to express stabilized (i.e., independent of degradation complex). Although no mutations in Wnt signaling components was present, the overexpression of several components, including Wnt-5A and Wnt-10B suggest that tumor dependency and cancer self-renewal is not necessarily dependent on mutations appearing in Wnt signaling pathway components, but rather only upon constitutive activation of the pathway itself.","The transition of self-renewing, pluripotent stem cells to myeloid progenitors is accompanied by the downregulation of Wnt signaling. Reya et al, 423: 409-414 (2003). Similarly, the stable expression of \u03b2-catenin in lymphoid progenitors restored multiple differentiation options, albeit such cells lacked markers typically associated with either cell type. Baba et al, 23: 599-609 (2005).","Aberrant Wnt Signaling in Neural Disorders","It has also been observed that the activation of Wnt signaling through \u03b2-catenin can increase cycling and expansion of neural progenitors, and that loss of such signaling can result in a loss of progenitor compartment. Chenn et al., 297: 365-369 (2002); Zechner et al., 258: 406-418 (2003). Just as normal activation of Wnt signaling may promote self-renewal of neuronal stem cells, aberrant Wnt pathway activation may be tumorigenic in the nervous system. Experimental evidence supporting this conclusion is the discovery that medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor of the cerebellum, contains mutations in both \u03b2-catenin and Axin\u2014thereby suggesting that medulloblastomas arise from primitive progenitors that become transformed in response to uncontrolled Wnt signaling. Zurawel et al., 58: 896-899 (1998); Dahmen et al., 61: 7039-7043 (2001); Baeza et al., 22: 632-636 (2003). Thus, it is strongly suggested that the inhibition of Wnt signaling by the Wnt antagonists of the invention may be an effective therapeutic in the treatment of various neuronal proliferative disorders, including brain tumors, such as gliomas, astrocytomas, meningiomas, Schwannomas, pituitary tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), medulloblastomas, craniopharyngioma, pineal region tumors, and non cancerous neurofibromatoses.","Wnt Signaling in Hematopoietic Stem Cells","Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to the adult blood cells of the circulatory system in a process of lineage-committed progenitor cells from multipotential hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). It is also apparent that Wnt signaling contributes to the self-renewal and maintenance of HSC's, and that dysfunctional Wnt signaling is responsible for various disorders resulting from HSC's, such as leukemias and various other blood related cancers. Reya et al., 434: 843-850 (2005); Baba et al., 23: 599-609 (2005); Jamieson et al., 351(7): 657-667 (2004). Wnt signaling is normally reduced as stem cells convert to committed myeloid progenitor cells. Reya et al., 423: 409-414 (2003).","Not only are Wnt ligands themselves produced by HSC's, but Wnt signaling is also active, thereby suggesting autocrine or paracrine regulation. Rattis et al., 11: 88-94 (2004); Reya et al., Nature 423: 409-414 (2003). Additionally, both \u03b2-catenin and Wnt3a promote self renewal of murine HSCs and progenitor cells, while application of Wnt-5A to human hematopoietic progenitors promotes the expansion of undifferentiated progenitors in vitro. Reya et al., supra.; Willert et al., 423: 448-452 (2003); Van Den Berg et al., 92: 3189-3202 (1998).","In addition to HSC's, it is apparent that embryonic stem cells, epidermal stem cells and epithelial stem cells are responsive or dependent on Wnt signaling for maintenance in an undifferentiated, proliferating state. Willert et al., supra; Korinek et al., 19: 379-383 (1998); Sato et al., 10: 55-63 (2004); Gat et al., 95: 605-614 (1998); Zhu et al., 126: 2285-2298 (1999). Therefore the inhibition of Wnt signaling with the Wnt antagonists of the present invention may be a therapeutic in the treatment of disorders resulting from dysfunctional hematopoieses, such as leukemias and various blood related cancers, such as acute, chronic, lymphoid and myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative disorders. These include myeloma, lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's) chronic and nonprogressive anemia, progressive and symptomatic blood cell deficiencies, polycythemia vera, essential or primary thrombocythemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mantle cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobinemia,","Wnt Signaling in Aging","The Wnt signaling pathway may also play a critical role in aging and age-related disorders. As reported in Brack A S, et al., 317(5839):807-10 (2007), muscle stem cells from aged mice were observed to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as they begin to proliferate. This conversion is associated with an increase in canonical Wnt signaling pathway activity in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Additionally, components of serum from aged mice bind to the Frizzled proteins and may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells. Injection of Wnt3A into young regenerating muscle reduced proliferation and increased deposition of connective tissue.","The Wnt signaling pathway has been further implicated in aging process in studies using the Klotho mouse model of accelerated aging in which it was determined that the Klotho protein physically interacted with and inhibited Wnt proteins. Liu H, et al., Science, 317(5839):803-6 (2007). In a cell culture model, the Wnt-Klotho interaction resulted in the suppression of Wnt biological activity while tissues and organs from Klotho-deficient animals showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling.","Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions","In general, compounds of the invention will be administered in therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents.
