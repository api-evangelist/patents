title: HAND-SUPPORTABLE PLANAR LASER ILLUMINATION AND IMAGING (PLIIM) BASED CAMERA SYSTEM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING DIGITAL LINEAR IMAGES OF AN OBJECT, CONTAINING PIXELS HAVING A SUBSTANTIALLY UNIFORM ASPECT-RATIO INDEPENDENT OF THE MEASURED RELATIVE VELOCITY OF AN OBJECT WHILE MANUALLY MOVING SAID PLIIM BASED CAMERA SYSTEM PAST SAID OBJECT DURING ILLUMINATION AND IMAGING OPERATIONS
abstract: A hand-supportable planar laser illumination and imaging (PLIIM) based camera system for producing digital linear images of a object within a working range, wherein the digital linear images contain pixels having a substantially uniform aspect-ratio independent of the measured relative velocity of the object while the PLIIM based camera system is manually moved (e.g. swept) past the object during illumination and imaging operations. The hand-supportable PLIIM based camera system comprises an object velocity measurement subsystem mounted within its hand-supportable housing, for determining the velocity of the object relative to the hand-supportable housing and generating object velocity data indicative of the determined velocity of the object. Also, a camera control computer is mounted within the hand-supportable housing, for controlling the operation of the PLIIM-based linear imaging subsystem, in automatic response to object velocity data generated by the object velocity measurement subsystem. During object illumination and imaging operations, the camera control computer (1) uses the object velocity data to determine a photo-integration time period parameter for the linear image detection array which produces digital linear images of the object, containing pixels having a substantially uniform aspect-ratio, independent of relative velocity of the object; and then (2) uses the determined photo-integration time period parameter to automatically control the operation of the linear image detection array so that the linear image detection array automatically produces digital linear images of the object, containing pixels having a substantially uniform aspect-ratio independent of the measured velocity of the moving object. By virtue of the present invention, it is now possible to produce digital images of objects containing pixels having a substantially uniform aspect-ratio, thereby satisfying the processing constraints associated with conventional 2-D bar code reading and OCR algorithms used in automatic object identification applications.

Field of Invention","The present invention relates generally to improved methods of and apparatus for illuminating moving as well as stationary objects, such as parcels, during image formation and detection operations, and also to improved methods of and apparatus and instruments for acquiring and analyzing information about the physical attributes of such objects using such improved methods of object illumination, and digital image analysis.","2. Brief Description of the State of Knowledge in the Art","The use of image-based bar code symbol readers and scanners is well known in the field of auto-identification. Examples of image-based bar code symbol reading\/scanning systems include, for example, hand-hand scanners, point-of-sale (POS) scanners, and industrial-type conveyor scanning systems.","Presently, most commercial image-based bar code symbol readers are constructed using charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensing\/detecting technology. Unlike laser-based scanning technology, CCD imaging technology has particular illumination requirements which differ from application to application.","Most prior art CCD-based image scanners, employed in conveyor-type package identification systems, require high-pressure sodium, metal halide or halogen lamps and large, heavy and expensive parabolic or elliptical reflectors to produce sufficient light intensities to illuminate the large depth of field scanning fields supported by such industrial scanning systems. Even when the light from such lamps is collimated or focused using such reflectors, light strikes the target object other than where the imaging optics of the CCD-based camera are viewing. Since only a small fraction of the lamps output power is used to illuminate the CCD camera's field of view, the total output power of the lamps must be very high to obtain the illumination levels required along the field of view of the CCD camera The balance of the output illumination power is simply wasted in the form of heat.","While U.S. Pat. No. 4,963,756 to Quan et al disclose a prior art CCD-based hand-held image scanner using a laser source and Scheimpflug optics for focusing a planar laser illumination beam reflected off a bar code symbol onto a 2-D CCD image detector, U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,856 to Schaham discloses a CCD-based hand-held image scanner which uses a LED and a cylindrical lens to produce a planar beam of LED-based illumination for illuminating a bar code symbol on an object, and cylindrical optics mounted in front a linear CCD image detector for projecting a narrow a field of view about the planar beam of illumination, thereby enabling collection and focusing of light reflected off the bar code symbol onto the linear CCD image detector.","Also, in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/190,273 entitled \u201cCoplanar Camera\u201d filed Mar. 17, 2000, by Chaleff et al., and published by WIPO on Sep. 27, 2001 as part of WIPO Publication No. WO 01\/72028 A1, both being incorporated herein by reference, there is disclosed a CCD camera system which uses an array of LEDs and a single apertured Fresnel-type cylindrical lens element to produce a planar beam of illumination for illuminating a bar code symbol on an object, and a linear CCD image detector mounted behind the apertured Fresnel-type cylindrical lens element so as to provide the linear CCD image detector with a field of view that is arranged with the planar extent of planar beam of LED-based illumination.","However, most prior art CCD-based hand-held image scanners use an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs) to flood the field of view of the imaging optics in such scanning systems. A large percentage of the output illumination from these LED sources is dispersed to regions other than the field of view of the scanning system. Consequently, only a small percentage of the illumination is actually collected by the imaging optics of the system, Examples of prior art CCD hand-held image scanners employing LED illumination arrangements are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 36,528, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,777,314, 5,756,981, 5,627,358, 5,484,994, 5,786,582, and 6,123,261 to Roustaei, each assigned to Symbol Technologies, Inc. and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In such prior art CCD-based hand-held image scanners, an array of LEDs are mounted in a scanning head in front of a CCD-based image sensor that is provided with a cylindrical lens assembly. The LEDs are arranged at an angular orientation relative to a central axis passing through the scanning head so that a fan of light is emitted through the light transmission aperture thereof that expands with increasing distance away from the LEDs. The intended purpose of this LED illumination arrangement is to increase the \u201cangular distance\u201d and \u201cdepth of field\u201d of CCD-based bar code symbol readers. However, even with such improvements in LED illumination techniques, the working distance of such hand-held CCD scanners can only be extended by using more LEDs within the scanning head of such scanners to produce greater illumination output therefrom, thereby increasing the cost, size and weight of such scanning devices.","Similarly, prior art \u201chold-under\u201d and \u201chands-free presentation\u201d type CCD-based image scanners suffer from shortcomings and drawbacks similar to those associated with prior art CCD-based hand-held image scanners.","Recently, there have been some technological advances made involving the use of laser illumination techniques in CCD-based image capture systems to avoid the shortcomings and drawbacks associated with using sodium-vapor illumination equipment, discussed above. In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 5,988,506 (assigned to Galore Scantec Ltd.), incorporated herein by reference, discloses the use of a cylindrical lens to generate from a single visible laser diode (VLD) a narrow focused line of laser light which fans out an angle sufficient to fully illuminate a code pattern at a working distance. As disclosed, mirrors can be used to fold the laser illumination beam towards the code pattern to be illuminated in the working range of the system. Also, a horizontal linear lens array consisting of lenses is mounted before a linear CCD image array, to receive diffused reflected laser light from the code symbol surface. Each single lens in the linear lens array forms its own image of the code line illuminated by the laser illumination beam. Also, subaperture diaphragms are required in the CCD array plane to (i) differentiate image fields, (ii) prevent diffused reflected laser light from passing through a lens and striking the image fields of neighboring lenses, and (iii) generate partially-overlapping fields of view from each of the neighboring elements in the lens array. However, while avoiding the use of external sodium vapor illumination equipment, this prior art laser-illuminated CCD-based image capture system suffers from several significant shortcomings and drawbacks. In particular, it requires very complex image forming optics which makes this system design difficult and expensive to manufacture, and imposes a number of undesirable constraints which are very difficult to satisfy when constructing an auto-focus\/auto-zoom image acquisition and analysis system for use in demanding applications.","When detecting images of target objects illuminated by a coherent illumination source (e.g. a VLD), \u201cspeckle\u201d (i.e. substrate or paper) noise is typically modulated onto the laser illumination beam during reflection\/scattering, and ultimately speckle-noise patterns are produced at the CCD image detection array, severely reducing the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the CCD camera system. In general, speckle-noise patterns are generated whenever the phase of the optical field is randomly modulated. The prior art system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,988,506 fails to provide any way of, or means for reducing speckle-noise patterns produced at its CCD image detector thereof, by its coherent laser illumination source.","The problem of speckle-noise patterns in laser scanning systems is mathematically analyzed in the twenty-five (25) slide show entitled \u201cSpeckle Noise and Laser Scanning Systems\u201d by Sasa Kresic-Juric, Emanuel Marom and Leonard Bergstein, of Symbol Technologies, Holtsville, N.Y., published at http:\/\/www.ima.umn.edu\/industrial\/99-2000\/kresic\/sld001.htm, and incorporated herein by reference. Notably, Slide 11\/25 of this WWW publication summaries two generally well known methods of reducing speckle-noise by superimposing statistically independent (time-varying) speckle-noise patterns: (1) using multiple laser beams to illuminate different regions of the speckle-noise scattering plane (i.e. object); or (2) using multiple laser beams with different wavelengths to illuminate the scattering plane. Also, the celebrated textbook by J. C. Dainty, et al, entitled \u201cLaser Speckle and Related Phenomena\u201d (Second edition), published by Springer-Verlag, 1994, incorporated herein by reference, describes a collection of techniques which have been developed by others over the years in effort to reduce speckle-noise patterns in diverse application environments.","However, the prior art generally fails to disclose, teach or suggest how such prior art speckle-reduction techniques might be successfully practiced in laser illuminated CCD-based camera systems.","Thus, there is a great need in the art for an improved method of and apparatus for illuminating the surface of objects during image formation and detection operations, and also an improved method of and apparatus for producing digital images using such improved methods object illumination, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art illumination, imaging and scanning systems and related methodologies.","Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of and system for illuminating the surface of objects during image formation and detection operations and also improved methods of and systems for producing digital images using such improved methods object illumination, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved method of and system for illuminating the surface of objects using a linear array of laser light emitting devices configured together to produce a substantially planar beam of laser illumination which extends in substantially the same plane as the field of view of the linear array of electronic image detection cells of the system, along at least a portion of its optical path within its working distance.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved method of and system for producing digital images of objects using a visible laser diode array for producing a planar laser illumination beam for illuminating the surfaces of such objects, and also an electronic image detection array for detecting laser light reflected off the illuminated objects during illumination and imaging operations.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of and system for illuminating the surfaces of object to be imaged, using an array of planar laser illumination modules which employ VLDs that are smaller, and cheaper, run cooler, draw less power, have longer lifetimes, and require simpler optics (i.e. because the spectral bandwidths of VLDs are very small compared to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum).","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved method

that the minimum width thereof (e.g. 0.6 mm along its non-spreading direction) occurs at a point or plane which is the farthest object distance at which the system is designed to capture images.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein a fixed focal length imaging subsystem is employed, and the laser beam focusing technique of the present invention helps compensate for decreases in the power density of the incident planar illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam

subsystem, and (ii) any 1\/rtype losses that would typically occur when using the planar laser illumination beam of the present invention.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein scanned objects need only be illuminated along a single plane which is coplanar with a planar section of the field of view of the image formation and detection module being used in the PLIIM system.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein low-power, light-weight, high-response, ultra-compact, high-efficiency solid-state illumination producing devices, such as visible laser diodes (VLDs), are used to selectively illuminate ultra-narrow sections of a target object during image formation and detection operations, in contrast with high-power, low-response, heavy-weight, bulky, low-efficiency lighting equipment (e.g. sodium vapor lights) required by prior art illumination and image detection systems.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein the planar laser illumination technique enables modulation of the spatial and\/or temporal intensity of the transmitted planar laser illumination beam, and use of simple (i.e. substantially monochromatic) lens designs for substantially monochromatic optical illumination and image formation and detection operations.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein special measures are undertaken to ensure that (i) a minimum safe distance is maintained between the VLDs in each PLIM and the user's eyes using a light shield, and (ii) the planar laser illumination beam is prevented from directly scattering into the FOV of the image formation and detection module within the system housing.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein the planar laser illumination beam and the field of view of the image formation and detection module do not overlap on any optical surface within the PLIIM system.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a planar laser illumination and imaging system, wherein the planar laser illumination beams are permitted to spatially overlap with the FOV of the imaging lens of the PLIIM only outside of the system housing, measured at a particular point beyond the light transmission window, through which the FOV is projected.","Another object of

In the case of both fixed and variable focal length imaging systems, this inventive principle helps compensate for decreases in the power density of the incident planar laser illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing object distances away from the imaging subsystem.","By virtue of the novel principles of the present invention, it is now possible to use both VLDs and high-speed electronic (e.g. CCD or CMOS) image detectors in conveyor, hand-held, presentation, and hold-under type imaging applications alike, enjoying the advantages and benefits that each such technology has to offer, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks hitherto associated therewith.","These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent hereinafter and in the claims to Invention.","Referring to the figures in the accompanying Drawings, the preferred embodiments of the Planar Light Illumination and Imaging (PLIIM) System of the present invention will be described in great detail, wherein like elements will be indicated using like reference numerals.","Overview of the Planar Laser Illumination and Imaging (PLIIM) System of the Present Invention","In accordance with the principles of the present invention, an object (e.g. a bar coded package, textual materials, graphical indicia, etc.) is illuminated by a substantially planar light illumination beam (PLIB), preferably a planar laser illumination beam, having substantially-planar spatial distribution characteristics along a planar direction which passes through the field of view (FOV) of an image formation and detection module (e.g. realized within a CCD-type digital electronic camera, a 35 mm optical-film photographic camera, or on a semiconductor chip as shown in  hereof), along substantially the entire working (i.e. object) distance of the camera, while images of the illuminated target object are formed and detected by the image formation and detection (i.e. camera) module.","This inventive principle of coplanar light illumination and image formation is embodied in two different classes of the PLIIM-based systems, namely: (1) in PLIIM systems shown in , V, A, I, A, and J, wherein the image formation and detection modules in these systems employ linear-type (1-D) image detection arrays; and (2) in PLIIM-based systems shown in , A and A, wherein the image formation and detection modules in these systems employ area-type (2-D) image detection arrays. Such image detection arrays can be realized using CCD, CMOS or other technologies currently known in the art or to be developed in the distance future. Among these illustrative systems, those shown in , A and A each produce a planar laser illumination beam that is neither scanned nor deflected relative to the system housing during planar laser illumination and image detection operations and thus can be said to use \u201cstationary\u201d planar laser illumination beams to read relatively moving bar code symbol structures and other graphical indicia. Those systems shown in FIGS. V, I, J, A, A and A, each produce a planar laser illumination beam that is scanned (i.e. deflected) relative to the system housing during planar laser illumination and image detection operations and thus can be said to use \u201cmoving\u201d planar laser illumination beams to read relatively stationary bar code symbol structures and other graphical indicia.","In each such system embodiments, it is preferred that each planar laser illumination beam is focused so that the minimum beam width thereof (e.g. 0.6 mm along its non-spreading direction, as shown in FIG. I) occurs at a point or plane which is the farthest or maximum working (i.e. object) distance at which the system is designed to acquire images of objects, as best shown in FIG. I. Hereinafter, this aspect of the present invention shall be deemed the \u201cFocus Beam At Farthest Object Distance (FBAFOD)\u201d principle.","In the case where a fixed focal length imaging subsystem is employed in the PLIIM-based system, the FBAFOD principle helps compensate for decreases in the power density of the incident planar laser illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing object distances away from the imaging subsystem.","In the case where a variable focal length (i.e. zoom) imaging subsystem is employed in the PLIIM-based system, the FBAFOD principle helps compensate for (i) decreases in the power density of the incident planar illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing object distances away from the imaging subsystem, and (ii) any 1\/rtype losses that would typically occur when using the planar laser planar illumination beam of the present invention.","By virtue of the present invention, scanned objects need only be illuminated along a single plane which is coplanar with a planar section of the field of view of the image formation and detection module (e.g. camera) during illumination and imaging operations carried out by the PLIIM-based system. This enables the use of low-power, light-weight, high-response, ultra-compact, high-efficiency solid-state illumination producing devices, such as visible laser diodes (VLDs), to selectively illuminate ultra-narrow sections of an object during image formation and detection operations, in contrast with high-power, low-response, heavy-weight, bulky, low-efficiency lighting equipment (e.g. sodium vapor lights) required by prior art illumination and image detection systems. In addition, the planar laser illumination techniques of the present invention enables high-speed modulation of the planar laser illumination beam, and use of simple (i.e. substantially-monochromatic wavelength) lens designs for substantially-monochromatic optical illumination and image formation and detection operations.","As will be illustrated in greater detail hereinafter, PLIIM-based systems embodying the \u201cplanar laser illumination\u201d and \u201cFBAFOD\u201d principles of the present invention can be embodied within a wide variety of bar code symbol reading and scanning systems, as well as image-lift and optical character, text, and image recognition systems and devices well known in the art.","In general, bar code symbol reading systems can be grouped into at least two general scanner categories, namely: industrial scanners; and point-of-sale (POS) scanners.","An industrial scanner is a scanner that has been designed for use in a warehouse or shipping application where large numbers of packages must be scanned in rapid succession. Industrial scanners include conveyor-type scanners, and hold-under scanners. These scanner categories will be described in greater detail below.","Conveyor scanners are designed to scan packages as they move by on a conveyor belt. In general, a minimum of six conveyors (e.g. one overhead scanner, four side scanners, and one bottom scanner) are necessary to obtain complete coverage of the conveyor belt and ensure that any label will be scanned no matter where on a package it appears. Conveyor scanners can be further grouped into top, side, and bottom scanners which will be briefly summarized below.","Top scanners are mounted above the conveyor belt and look down at the tops of packages transported therealong. It might be desirable to angle the scanner's field of view slightly in the direction from which the packages approach or that in which they recede depending on the shapes of the packages being scanned. A top scanner generally has less severe depth of field and variable focus or dynamic focus requirements compared to a side scanner as the tops of packages are usually fairly flat, at least compared to the extreme angles that a side scanner might have to encounter during scanning operations.","Side scanners are mounted beside the conveyor belt and scan the sides of packages transported therealong. It might be desirable to angle the scanner's field of view slightly in the direction from which the packages approach or that in which they recede depending on the shapes of the packages being scanned and the range of angles at which the packages might be rotated.","Side scanners generally have more severe depth of field and variable focus or dynamic focus requirements compared to a top scanner because of the great range of angles at which the sides of the packages may be oriented with respect to the scanner (this assumes that the packages can have random rotational orientations; if an apparatus upstream on the on the conveyor forces the packages into consistent orientations, the difficulty of the side scanning task is lessened). Because side scanners can accommodate greater variation in object distance over the surface of a single target object, side scanners can be mounted in the usual position of a top scanner for applications in which package tops are severely angled.","Bottom scanners are mounted beneath the conveyor and scans the bottoms of packages by looking up through a break in the belt that is covered by glass to keep dirt off the scanner. Bottom scanners generally do not have to be variably or dynamically focused because its working distance is roughly constant, assuming that the packages are intended to be in contact with the conveyor belt under normal operating conditions. However, boxes tend to bounce around as they travel on the belt, and this behavior can be amplified when a package crosses the break, where one belt section ends and another begins after a gap of several inches. For this reason, bottom scanners must have a large depth of field to accommodate these random motions, to which a variable or dynamic focus system could not react quickly enough.","Hold-under scanners are designed to scan packages that are picked up and held underneath it. The package is then manually routed or otherwise handled, perhaps based on the result of the scanning operation. Hold-under scanners are generally mounted so that its viewing optics are oriented in downward direction, like a library bar code scanner. Depth of field (DOF) is an important characteristic for hold-under scanners, because the operator will not be able to hold the package perfectly still while the image is being acquired.","Point-of-sale (POS) scanners are typically designed to be used at a retail establishment to determine the price of an item being purchased. POS scanners are generally smaller than industrial scanner models, with more artistic and ergonomic case designs. Small size, low weight, resistance to damage from accident drops and user comfort, are all major design factors for POS scanner. POS scanners include hand-held scanners, hands-free presentation scanners and combination-type scanners supporting both hands-on and hands-free modes of operation. These scanner categories will be described in greater detail below.","Hand-held scanners are designed to be picked up by the operator and aimed at the label to be scanned.","Hands-free presentation scanners are designed to remain stationary and have the item to be scanned picked up and passed in front of the scanning device. Presentation scanners can be mounted on counters looking horizontally, embedded flush with the counter looking vertically, or partially embedded in the counter looking vertically, but having a \u201ctower\u201d portion which rises out above the counter and looks horizontally to accomplish multiple-sided scanning. If necessary, presentation scanners that are mounted in a counter surface can also include a scale to measure weights of items.","Some POS scanners can be used as handheld units or mounted in stands to serve as presentation scanners, depending on which is more convenient for the operator based on the item that must be scanned.","Various generalized embodiments of the PLIIM system of the present invention will now be described in great detail, and after each generalized embodiment, various applications thereof will be described.","First Generalized Embodiment of the PLIIM-Based System of the Present Invention","The first generalized embodiment of the PLIIM-based system of the present invention  is illustrated in FIG. A. As shown therein, the PLIIM-based system  comprises: a housing  of compact construction; a linear (i.e. 1-dimensional) type image formation and detection (IFD) module  including a 1-D electronic image detection array A, and a linear (1-D) imaging subsystem (LIS) B having a fixed focal length, a fixed focal distance, and a fixed field of view (FOV), for forming a 1-D image of an illuminated object  located within the fixed focal distance and FOV thereof and projected onto the 1-D image detection array A, so that the 1-D image detection array A can electronically detect the image formed thereon and automatically produce a digital image data set  representative of the detected image for subsequent image processing; and a pair of planar laser illumination arrays (PLIAs) A and B, each mounted on opposite sides of the IFD module , such that each planar laser illumination array A and B produces a plane of laser beam illumination A, B which is disposed substantially coplanar with the field view of the image formation and detection module  during object illumination and image detection operations carried out by the PLIIM-based system.","An image formation and detection (IFD) module  having an imaging lens with a fixed focal length has a constant angular field of view (FOV), that is, the imaging subsystem can view more of the target object's surface as the target object is moved further away from the IFD module. A major disadvantage to this type of imaging lens is that the resolution of the image that is acquired, expressed in terms of pixels or dots per inch (dpi), varies as a function of the distance from the target object to the imaging lens. However, a fixed focal length imaging lens is easier and less expensive to design and produce than a zoom-type imaging lens which will be discussed in detail hereinbelow with reference to FIGS. A through J.","The distance from the imaging lens B to the image detecting (i.e. sensing) array A is referred to as the image distance. The distance from the target object  to the imaging lens B is called the object distance. The relationship between the object distance (where the object resides) and the image distance (at which the image detection array is mounted) is a function of the characteristics of the imaging lens, and assuming a thin lens, is determined by the thin (imaging) lens equation (1) defined below in greater detail. Depending on the image distance, light reflected from a target object at the object distance will be brought into sharp focus on the detection array plane. If the image distance remains constant and the target object is moved to a new object distance, the imaging lens might not be able to bring the light reflected off the target object (at this new distance) into sharp focus. An image formation and detection (IFD) module having an imaging lens with fixed focal distance cannot adjust its image distance to compensate for a change in the target's object distance; all the component lens elements in the imaging subsystem remain stationary. Therefore, the depth of field (DOF) of the imaging subsystems alone must be sufficient to accommodate all possible object distances and orientations. Such basic optical terms and concepts will be discussed in more formal detail hereinafter with reference to FIGS. J and J.","In accordance with the present invention, the planar laser illumination arrays A and B, the linear image formation and detection (IFD) module , and any non-moving FOV and\/or planar laser illumination beam folding mirrors employed in any particular system configuration described herein, are fixedly mounted on an optical bench  or chassis so as to prevent any relative motion (which might be caused by vibration or temperature changes) between: (i) the image forming optics (e.g. imaging lens) within the image formation and detection module  and any stationary FOV folding mirrors employed therewith; and (ii) each planar laser illumination array (i.e. VLD\/cylindrical lens assembly) A, B and any planar laser illumination beam folding mirrors employed in the PLIIM system configuration. Preferably, the chassis assembly should provide for easy and secure alignment of all optical components employed in the planar laser illumination arrays A and B as well as the image formation and detection module , as well as be easy to manufacture, service and repair. Also, this PLIIM-based system  employs the general \u201cplanar laser illumination\u201d and \u201cfocus beam at farthest object distance (FBAFOD)\u201d principles described above. Various illustrative embodiments of this generalized PLIIM-based system will be described below.","First Illustrative Embodiment of the PLIIM-Based System of the Present Invention Shown in ","The first illustrative embodiment of the PLIIM-based system A of  is shown in FIG. B. As illustrated therein, the field of view of the image formation and detection module  is folded in the downwardly direction by a field of view (FOV) folding mirror  so that both the folded field of view  and resulting first and second planar laser illumination beams A and B produced by the planar illumination arrays A and B, respectively, are arranged in a substantially coplanar relationship during object illumination and image detection operations. One primary advantage of this system design is that it enables a construction having an ultra-low height profile suitable, for example, in unitary object identification and attribute acquisition systems of the type disclosed in , wherein the image-based bar code symbol reader needs to be installed within a compartment (or cavity) of a housing having relatively low height dimensions. Also, in this system design, there is a relatively high degree of freedom provided in where the image formation and detection module  can be mounted on the optical bench of the system, thus enabling the field of view (FOV) folding technique disclosed in FIG. L to practiced in a relatively easy manner.","The PLIIM system A illustrated in FIG. B is shown in greater detail in FIGS. B and B. As shown therein, the linear image formation and detection module  is shown comprising an imagine subsystem B, and a linear array of photo-electronic detectors A realized using high-speed CCD technology (e.g. Dalsa IT-P4 Linear Image Sensors, from Dalsa, Inc. located on the WWW at http:\/\/www.dalsa.com). As shown, each planar laser illumination array A, B comprises a plurality of planar laser illumination modules (PLIMs) A through F, closely arranged relative to each other, in a rectilinear fashion. For purposes of clarity, each PLIM is indicated by reference numeral. As shown in FIGS. K and K, the relative spacing of each PLIM is such that the spatial intensity distribution of the individual planar laser beams superimpose and additively provide a substantially uniform composite spatial intensity distribution for the entire planar laser illumination array A and B.","In FIG. B, greater focus is accorded to the planar light illumination beam (PLIB) and the magnified field of view (FOV) projected onto an object during conveyor-type illumination and imaging applications, as shown in FIG. B. As shown in FIG. B, the height dimension of the PLIB is substantially greater than the height dimension of the magnified field of view (FOV) of each image detection element in the linear CCD image detection array so as to decrease the range of tolerance that must be maintained between the PLIB and the FOV. This simplifies construction and maintenance of such PLIIM-based systems. In FIGS. B and B, an exemplary mechanism is shown for adjustably mounting each VLD in the PLIA so that the desired beam profile characteristics can be achieved during calibration of each PLIA. As illustrated in FIG. B, each VLD block in the illustrative embodiment is designed to tilt plus or minus 2 degrees relative to the horizontal reference plane of the PLIA. Such inventive features will be described in greater detail hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0876","num":"0875"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["11","6","6","1","2"]},"As shown in , the planar laser illumination module of  comprises: a visible laser diode (VLD)  supported within an optical tube or block ; a light collimating (i.e. focusing) lens  supported within the optical tube ; and a cylindrical-type lens element  configured together to produce a beam of planar laser illumination . As shown in , a focused laser beam  from the focusing lens  is directed on the input side of the cylindrical lens element , and a planar laser illumination beam  is produced as output therefrom.","As shown in , the PLIIM-based system A of  comprises: a pair of planar laser illumination arrays A and B, each having a plurality of PLIMs A through F, and each PLIM being driven by a VLD driver circuit  controlled by a micro-controller  programmable (by camera control computer ) to generate diverse types of drive-current functions that satisfy the input power and output intensity requirements of each VLD in a real-time manner; linear-type image formation and detection module ; field of view (FOV) folding mirror , arranged in spatial relation with the image formation and detection module ; an image frame grabber  operably connected to the linear-type image formation and detection module , for accessing 1-D images (i.e. 1-D digital image data sets) therefrom and building a 2-D digital image of the object being illuminated by the planar laser illumination arrays A and B; an image data buffer (e.g. VRAM)  for buffering 2-D images received from the image frame grabber ; an image processing computer , operably connected to the image data buffer , for carrying out image processing algorithms (including bar code symbol decoding algorithms) and operators on digital images stored within the image data buffer, including image-based bar code symbol decoding software such as, for example, SwiftDecode\u2122 Bar Code Decode Software, from Omniplanar, Inc., of Princeton, N.J. (http:\/\/www.omniplanar.com); and a camera control computer  operably connected to the various components within the system for controlling the operation thereof in an orchestrated manner.","Detailed Description of an Exemplary Realization of the PLIIM-Based System Shown in FIG. B through F","Referring now to FIGS. G through N, an exemplary realization of the PLIIM-based system shown in FIGS. B through F will now be described in detail below.","As shown in FIGS. G and G, the PLIIM system  of the illustrative embodiment is contained within a compact housing  having height, length and width dimensions 45\u2033, 21.7\u2033, and 19.7\u2033 to enable easy mounting above a conveyor belt structure or the like. As shown in FIG. G, the PLIIM-based system comprises an image formation and detection module , a pair of planar laser illumination arrays A, B, and a stationary field of view (FOV) folding structure (e.g. mirror, refractive element, or diffractive element) , as shown in FIGS. B and B. The function of the FOV folding mirror  is to fold the field of view (FOV) of the image formation and detection module  in a direction that is coplanar with the plane of laser illumination beams A and B produced by the planar illumination arrays A and B respectively. As shown, components A, B,  and  are fixedly mounted to an optical bench  supported within the compact housing  by way of metal mounting brackets that force the assembled optical components to vibrate together on the optical bench. In turn, the optical bench is shock mounted to the system housing using techniques which absorb and dampen shock forces and vibration. The 1-D CCD imaging array A can be realized using a variety of commercially available high-speed line-scan camera systems such as, for example, the Piranha Model Nos. CT-P4, or CL-P4 High-Speed CCD Line Scan Camera, from Dalsa, Inc. USA\u2014http:\/\/www.dalsa.com. Notably, image frame grabber , image data buffer (e.g. VRAM) , image processing computer , and camera control computer  are realized on one or more printed circuit (PC) boards contained within a camera and system electronic module  also mounted on the optical bench, or elsewhere in the system housing ","In general, the linear CCD image detection array (i.e. sensor) A has a single row of pixels, each of which measures from several \u03bcm to several tens of \u03bcm along each dimension. Square pixels are most common, and most convenient for bar code scanning applications, but different aspect ratios are available. In principle, a linear CCD detection array can see only a small slice of the target object it is imaging at any given time. For example, for a linear CCD detection array having 2000 pixels, each of which is 10 \u03bcm square, the detection array measures 2 cm long by 10 \u03bcm high. If the imaging lens B in front of the linear detection array A causes an optical magnification of 10\u00d7, then the 2 cm length of the detection array will be projected onto a 20 cm length of the target object. In the other dimension, the 10 \u03bcm height of the detection array becomes only 100 \u03bcm when projected onto the target. Since any label to be scanned will typically measure more than a hundred \u03bcm or so in each direction, capturing a single image with a linear image detection array will be inadequate. Therefore, in practice, the linear image detection array employed in each of the PLIIM-based systems shown in FIGS. A through J builds up a complete image of the target object by assembling a series of linear (1-D) images, each of which is taken of a different slice of the target object. Therefore, successful use of a linear image detection array in the PLIIM-based systems shown in FIGS. A through J requires relative movement between the target object and the PLIIM system. In general, either the target object is moving and the PLIIM system is stationary, or else the field of view of the PLIIM-based system is swept across a relatively stationary target object, as shown in FIGS. J through J. This makes the linear image detection array a natural choice for conveyor scanning applications.","As shown in FIG. G, the compact housing  has a relatively long light transmission window  of elongated dimensions for projecting the FOV of the image formation and detection (IFD) module  through the housing towards a predefined region of space outside thereof, within which objects can be illuminated and imaged by the system components on the optical bench . Also, the compact housing  has a pair of relatively short light transmission apertures A and B closely disposed on opposite ends of light transmission window , with minimal spacing therebetween, as shown in FIG. G, so that the FOV emerging from the housing  can spatially overlap in a coplanar manner with the substantially planar laser illumination beams projected through transmission windows A and B, as close to transmission window  as desired by the system designer, as shown in FIGS. G and G. Notably, in some applications, it is desired for such coplanar overlap between the FOV and planar laser illumination beams to occur very close to the light transmission windows , A and B (i.e. at short optical throw distances), but in other applications, for such coplanar overlap to occur at large optical throw distances.","In either event, each planar laser illumination array A and B is optically isolated from the FOV of the image formation and detection module . In the preferred embodiment, such optical isolation is achieved by providing a set of opaque wall structures A B about each planar laser illumination array, from the optical bench  to its light transmission window A or B, respectively. Such optical isolation structures prevent the image formation and detection module  from detecting any laser light transmitted directly from the planar laser illumination arrays A, B within the interior of the housing. Instead, the image formation and detection module  can only receive planar laser illumination that has been reflected off an illuminated object, and focused through the imaging subsystem of module .","As shown in FIG. G, each planar laser illumination array A, B comprises a plurality of planar laser illumination modules A through F, each individually and adjustably mounted to an L-shaped bracket  which, in turn, is adjustably mounted to the optical bench. As shown, a stationary cylindrical lens array  is mounted in front of each PLIA (A, B) adjacent the illumination window formed within the optics bench  of the PLIIM-based system. The function performed by cylindrical lens array  is to optically combine the individual PLIB components produced from the PLIMs constituting the PLIA, and project the combined PLIB components onto points along the surface of the object being illuminated. By virtue of this inventive feature, each point on the object surface being imaged will be illuminated by different sources of laser illumination located at different points in space (i.e. by a source of spatially coherent-reduced laser illumination), thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-pattern noise observable at the linear image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","As mentioned above, each planar laser illumination module  must be rotatably adjustable within its L-shaped bracket so as permit easy yet secure adjustment of the position of each PLIM  along a common alignment plane extending within L-bracket portion A thereby permitting precise positioning of each PLIM relative to the optical axis of the image formation and detection module . Once properly adjusted in terms of position on the L-bracket portion A, each PLIM can be securely locked by an allen or like screw threaded into the body of the L-bracket portion A. Also, L-bracket portion B, supporting a plurality of PLIMs A through B, is adjustably mounted to the optical bench  and releasably locked thereto so as to permit precise lateral and\/or angular positioning of the L-bracket B relative to the optical axis and FOV of the image formation and detection module . The function of such adjustment mechanisms is to enable the intensity distributions of the individual PLIMs to be additively configured together along a substantially singular plane, typically having a width or thickness dimension on the orders of the width and thickness of the spread or dispersed laser beam within each PLIM. When properly adjusted, the composite planar laser illumination beam will exhibit substantially uniform power density characteristics over the entire working range of the PLIIM-based system, as shown in FIGS. K and K.","In FIG. G, the exact position of the individual PLIMs A through F along its L-bracket A is indicated relative to the optical axis of the imaging lens B within the image formation and detection module . FIG. G also illustrates the geometrical limits of each substantially planar laser illumination beam produced by its corresponding PLIM, measured relative to the folded FOV  produced by the image formation and detection module . FIG. G, illustrates how, during object illumination and image detection operations, the FOV of the image formation and detection module  is first folded by FOV folding mirror , and then arranged in a spatially overlapping relationship with the resulting\/composite planar laser illumination beams in a coplanar manner in accordance with the principles of the present invention.","Notably, the PLIIM-based system of FIG. G has an image formation and detection module with an imaging subsystem having a fixed focal distance lens and a fixed focusing mechanism. Thus, such a system is best used in either hand-held scanning applications, and\/or bottom scanning applications where bar code symbols and other structures can be expected to appear at a particular distance from the imaging subsystem. In FIG. G, the spatial limits for the FOV of the image formation and detection module are shown for two different scanning conditions, namely: when imaging the tallest package moving on a conveyor belt structure; and when imaging objects having height values close to the surface of the conveyor belt structure. In a PLIIM-based system having a fixed focal distance lens and a fixed focusing mechanism, the PLIIM-based system would be capable of imaging objects under one of the two conditions indicated above, but not under both conditions. In a PLIIM-based system having a fixed focal length lens and a variable focusing mechanism, the system can adjust to image objects under either of these two conditions.","In order that PLLIM-based subsystem  can be readily interfaced to and an integrated (e.g. embedded) within various types of computer-based systems, as shown in , subsystem  also comprises an I\/O subsystem  operably connected to camera control computer  and image processing computer , and a network controller  for enabling high-speed data communication with others computers in a local or wide area network using packet-based networking protocols (e.g. Ethernet, AppleTalk, etc.) well known in the art.","In the PLIIM-based system of FIG. G, special measures are undertaken to ensure that (i) a minimum safe distance is maintained between the VLDs in each PLIM and the user's eyes, and (ii) the planar laser illumination beam is prevented from directly scattering into the FOV of the image formation and detection module, from within the system housing, during object illumination and imaging operations. Condition (i) above can be achieved by using a light shield A or B shown in FIGS. G and G, respectively, whereas condition (ii) above can be achieved by ensuring that the planar laser illumination beam from the PLIAs and the field of view (FOV) of the imaging lens (in the IFD module) do not spatially overlap on any optical surfaces residing within the PLIIM-based system. Instead, the planar laser illumination beams are permitted to spatially overlap with the FOV of the imaging lens only outside of the system housing, measured at a particular point beyond the light transmission window , through which the FOV  is projected to the exterior of the system housing, to perform object imaging operations.","Detailed Description of the Planar Laser Illumination Modules (PLIMs) Employed in the Planar Laser Illumination Arrays (PLIAs) of the Illustrative Embodiments","Referring now to FIGS. G through I, the construction of each PLIM  and  used in the planar laser illumination arrays (PLIAs) will now be described in greater detail below.","As shown in FIG. G, each planar laser illumination array (PLIA) A, B employed in the PLIIM-based system of FIG. G, comprises an array of planar laser illumination modules (PLIMs)  mounted on the L-bracket structure , as described hereinabove. As shown in FIGS. G through G, each PLIM of the illustrative embodiment disclosed herein comprises an assembly of subcomponents: a VLD mounting block  having a tubular geometry with a hollow central bore A formed entirely therethrough, and a v-shaped notch B formed on one end thereof; a visible laser diode (VLD)  (e.g. Mitsubishi ML1XX6 Series high-power 658 nm AlGaInP semiconductor laser) axially mounted at the end of the VLD mounting block, opposite the v-shaped notch B, so that the laser beam produced from the VLD  is aligned substantially along the central axis of the central bore A; a cylindrical lens , made of optical glass (e.g. borosilicate) or plastic having the optical characteristics specified, for example, in FIGS. G and G, and fixedly mounted within the V-shaped notch B at the end of the VLD mounting block , using an optical cement or other lens fastening means, so that the central axis of the cylindrical lens  is oriented substantially perpendicular to the optical axis of the central bore A; and a focusing lens , made of central glass (e.g. borosilicate) or plastic having the optical characteristics shown, for example, in FIGS. H and H, mounted within the central bore A of the VLD mounting block  so that the optical axis of the focusing lens  is substantially aligned with the central axis of the bore A, and located at a distance from the VLD which causes the laser beam output from the VLD  to be converging in the direction of the cylindrical lens . Notably, the function of the cylindrical lens  is to disperse (i.e. spread) the focused laser beam from focusing lens  along the plane in which the cylindrical lens  has curvature, as shown in FIG. I while the characteristics of the planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) in the direction transverse to the propagation plane are determined by the focal length of the focusing lens , as illustrated in FIGS. I and I.","As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the focal length of the focusing lens  within each PLIM hereof is preferably selected so that the substantially planar laser illumination beam produced from the cylindrical lens  is focused at the farthest object distance in the field of view of the image formation and detection module , as shown in FIG. I, in accordance with the \u201cFBAFOD\u201d principle of the present invention. As shown in the exemplary embodiment of FIGS. I and I, wherein each PLIM has maximum object distance of about 61 inches (i.e. 155 centimeters), and the cross-sectional dimension of the planar laser illumination beam emerging from the cylindrical lens , in the non-spreading (height) direction, oriented normal to the propagation plane as defined above, is about 0.15 centimeters and ultimately focused down to about 0.06 centimeters at the maximal object distance (i.e. the farthest distance at which the system is designed to capture images). The behavior of the height dimension of the planar laser illumination beam is determined by the focal length of the focusing lens  embodied within the PLIM. Proper selection of the focal length of the focusing lens  in each PLIM and the distance between the VLD  and the focusing lens B indicated by reference No. (D), can be determined using the thin lens equation (1) below and the maximum object distance required by the PLIIM-based system, typically specified by the end-user. As will be explained in greater detail hereinbelow, this preferred method of VLD focusing helps compensate for decreases in the power density of the incident planar laser illumination beam (on target objects) due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing distances away from the imaging subsystem (i.e. object distances).","After specifying the optical components for each PLIM, and completing the assembly thereof as described above, each PLIM is adjustably mounted to the L-bracket position A by way of a set of mounting\/adjustment screws turned through fine-threaded mounting holes formed thereon. In FIG. G, the plurality of PLIMs A through F are shown adjustably mounted on the L-bracket at positions and angular orientations which ensure substantially uniform power density characteristics in both the near and far field portions of the planar laser illumination field produced by planar laser illumination arrays (PLIAs) A and B cooperating together in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Notably, the relative positions of the PLIMs indicated in FIG. G were determined for a particular set of a commercial VLDs  used in the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, and, as the output beam characteristics will vary for each commercial VLD used in constructing each such PLIM, it is therefore understood that each such PLIM may need to be mounted at different relative positions on the L-bracket of the planar laser illumination array to obtain, from the resulting system, substantially uniform power density characteristics at both near and far regions of the planar laser illumination field produced thereby.","While a refractive-type cylindrical lens element  has been shown mounted at the end of each PLIM of the illustrative embodiments, it is understood each cylindrical lens element can be realized using refractive, reflective and\/or diffractive technology and devices, including reflection and transmission type holographic optical elements (HOEs) well know in the art and described in detail in International Application No. WO 99\/57579 published on Nov. 11, 1999, incorporated herein by reference. As used hereinafter and in the claims, the terms \u201ccylindrical lens\u201d, \u201ccylindrical lens element\u201d and \u201ccylindrical optical element (COE)\u201d shall be deemed to embrace all such alternative embodiments of this aspect of the present invention.","The only requirement of the optical element mounted at the end of each PLIM is that it has sufficient optical properties to convert a focusing laser beam transmitted therethrough, into a laser beam which expands or otherwise spreads out only along a single plane of propagation, while the laser beam is substantially unaltered (i.e. neither compressed or expanded) in the direction normal to the propagation plane.","Alternative Embodiments of the Planar Laser Illumination Module (PLIM) of the Present Invention","There are means for producing substantially planar laser beams (PLIBs) without the use of cylindrical optical elements. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,299 to Powell, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a linear diverging lens which has the appearance of a prism with a relatively sharp radius at the apex, capable of expanding a laser beam in only one direction. In FIG. GA, a first type Powell lens A is shown embodied within a PLIM housing by simply replacing the cylindrical lens element  with a suitable Powell lens A taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,299. In this alternative embodiment, the Powell lens A is disposed after the focusing\/collimating lens \u2032 and VLD . In FIG. GB, generic Powell lens B is shown embodied within a PLIM housing along with a collimating\/focusing lens \u2032 and VLD . The resulting PLIMs can be used in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention.","Alternatively, U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,738 to Ozaki discloses an optical arrangement which employs a convex reflector or a concave lens to spread a laser beam radially and then a cylindrical-concave reflector to converge the beam linearly to project a laser line. Like the Powell lens, the optical arrangement of U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,738 can be readily embodied within the PLIM of the present invention, for use in a PLIIM-based system employing the same.","In FIGS. G through GD, there is shown an alternative embodiment of the PLIM of the present invention , wherein a visible laser diode (VLD) , and a pair of small cylindrical (i.e. PCX and PCV) lenses  and  are both mounted within a lens barrel  of compact construction. As shown, the lens barrel  permits independent adjustment of the lenses along both translational and rotational directions, thereby enabling the generation of a substantially planar laser beam therefrom. The PCX-type lens  has one plano surface A and a positive cylindrical surface B with its base and the edges cut in a circular profile. The function of the PCX-type lens  is laser beam focusing. The PCV-type lens  has one plano surface A and a negative cylindrical surface B with its base and edges cut in a circular profile. The function of the PCX-type lens  is laser beam spreading (i.e. diverging or planarizing).","As shown in FIGS. GB and GC, the PCX lens  is capable of undergoing translation in the x direction for focusing, and rotation about the x axis to ensure that it only effects the beam along one axis. Set-type screws or other lens fastening mechanisms can be used to secure the position of the PCX lens within its barrel  once its position has been properly adjusted during calibration procedure.","As shown in FIG. GD, the PCV lens  is capable of undergoing rotation about the x axis to ensure that it only effects the beam along one axis. FIGS. GE and GF illustrate that the VLD  requires rotation about the y and x axes, for aiming and desmiling the planar laser illumination beam produced from the PLIM. Set-type screws or other lens fastening mechanisms can be used to secure the position and alignment of the PCV-type lens  within its barrel  once its position has been properly adjusted during calibration procedure. Likewise, set-type screws or other lens fastening mechanisms can be used to secure the position and alignment of the VLD  within its barrel  once its position has been properly adjusted during calibration procedure.","In the illustrative embodiments, one or more PLIMs  described above can be integrated together to produce a PLIA in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Such the PLIMs associated with the PLIA can be mounted along a common bracket, having PLIM-based multi-axial alignment and pitch mechanisms as illustrated in FIGS. B and B and described below.","Multi-Axis VLD Mounting Assembly Embodied within Planar Laser Illumination (PLIA) of the Present Invention","In order to achieve the desired degree of uniformity in the power density along the PLIB generated from a PLIIM-based system of the present invention, it will be helpful to use the multi-axial VLD mounting assembly of FIGS. B and B in each-PLIA employed therein. As shown in FIG. B, each PLIM is mounted along its PLIA so that (1) the PLIM can be adjustably tilted about the optical axis of its VLD , by at least a few degrees measured from the horizontal reference plane as shown in FIG. B, and so that (2) each VLD block can be adjustably pitched forward for alignment with other VLD beams, as illustrated in FIG. B. The tilt-adjustment function can be realized by any mechanism that permits the VLD block to be releasably tilted relative to a base plate or like structure  which serves as a reference plane, from which the tilt parameter is measured. The pitch-adjustment function can be realized by any mechanism that permits the VLD block to be releasably pitched relative to a base plate or like structure which serves as a reference plane, from which the pitch parameter is measured. In a preferred embodiment, such flexibility in VLD block position and orientation can be achieved using a three axis gimbel-like suspension, or other pivoting mechanism, permitting rotational adjustment of the VLD block  about the X, Y and Z principle axes embodied therewithin. Set-type screws or other fastening mechanisms can be used to secure the position and alignment of the VLD block  relative to the PLIA base plate  once the position and orientation of the VLD block has been properly adjusted during a VLD calibration procedure.","Detailed Description of the Image Formation and Detection Module Employed in the PLIIM-Based System of the First Generalized Embodiment of the Present Invention","In FIG. J, there is shown a geometrical model (based on the thin lens equation) for the simple imaging subsystem B employed in the image formation and detection module  in the PLIIM-based system of the first generalized embodiment shown in FIG. A. As shown in FIG. J, this simple imaging system B consists of a source of illumination (e.g. laser light reflected off a target object) and an imaging lens. The illumination source is at an object distance rmeasured from the center of the imaging lens. In FIG. J, some representative rays of light have been traced from the source to the front lens surface. The imaging lens is considered to be of the converging type which, for ordinary operating conditions, focuses the incident rays from the illumination source to form an image which is located at an image distance ron the opposite side of the imaging lens. In FIG. J, some representative rays have also been traced from the back lens surface to the image. The imaging lens itself is characterized by a focal length f, the definition of which will be discussed in greater detail hereinbelow.","For the purpose of simplifying the mathematical analysis, the imaging lens is considered to be a thin lens, that is, idealized to a single surface with no thickness. The parameters f, rand r, all of which have units of length, are related by the \u201cthin lens\u201d equation (1) set forth below: \n\n","This equation may be solved for the image distance, which yields expression (2) \n\n","If the object distance rgoes to infinity, then expression (2) reduces to r=f. Thus, the focal length of the imaging lens is the image distance at which light incident on the lens from an infinitely distant object will be focused. Once f is known, the image distance for light from any other object distance can be determined using (2).","Field of View of the Imaging Lens and Resolution of the Detected Image","The basic characteristics of an image detected by the IFD module  hereof may be determined using the technique of ray tracing, in which representative rays of light are drawn from the source through the imaging lens and to the image. Such ray tracing is shown in FIG. J. A basic rule of ray tracing is that a ray from the illumination source that passes through the center of the imaging lens continues undeviated to the image. That is, a ray that passes through the center of the imaging lens is not refracted. Thus, the size of the field of view (FOV) of the imaging lens may be determined by tracing rays (backwards) from the edges of the image detection\/sensing array through the center of the imaging lens and out to the image plane as shown in FIG. J, where d is the dimension of a pixel, n is the number of pixels on the image detector array in this direction, and W is the dimension of the field of view of the imaging lens. Solving for the FOV dimension W, and substituting for rusing expression (2) above yields expression (3) as follows: \n\n","Now that the size of the field of view is known, the dpi resolution of the image is determined. The dpi resolution of the image is simply the number of pixels divided by the dimension of the field of view. Assuming that all the dimensions of the system are measured in meters, the dots per inch (dpi) resolution of the image is given by the expression (4) as follows: \n\n\nWorking Distance and Depth of Field of the Imaging Lens\n","Light returning to the imaging lens that emanates from object surfaces slightly closer to and farther from the imaging lens than object distance rwill also appear to be in good focus on the image. From a practical standpoint, \u201cgood focus\u201d is decided by the decoding software  used when the image is too blurry to allow the code to be read (i.e. decoded), then the imaging subsystem is said to be \u201cout of focus\u201d. If the object distance rat which the imaging subsystem is ideally focused is known, then it can be calculated theoretically the closest and farthest \u201cworking distances\u201d of the PLIIM-based system, given by parameters rand r, respectively, at which the system will still function. These distance parameters are given by expression (5) and (6) as follows: \n\n","where D is the diameter of the largest permissible \u201ccircle of confusion\u201d on the image detection array. A circle of confusion is essentially the blurred out light that arrives from points at image distances other than object distance r. When the circle of confusion becomes too large (when the blurred light spreads out too much) then one will lose focus. The value of parameter D for a given imaging subsystem is usually estimated from experience during system design, and then determined more precisely, if necessary, later through laboratory experiment.","Another optical parameter of interest is the total depth of field \u0394r, which is the difference between distances r, and r; this parameter is the total distance over which the imaging system will be able to operate when focused at object distance r. This optical parameter may be expressed by equation (7) below: \n\n","It should be noted that the parameter \u0394r is generally not symmetric about r; the depth of field usually extends farther towards infinity from the ideal focal distance than it does back towards the imaging lens.","Modeling a Fixed Focal Length Imaging Subsystem Used in the Image Formation and Detection Module of the Present Invention","A typical imaging (i.e. camera) lens used to construct a fixed focal-length image formation and detection module of the present invention might typically consist of three to fifteen or more individual optical elements contained within a common barrel structure. The inherent complexity of such an optical module prevents its performance from being described very accurately using a \u201cthin lens analysis\u201d, described above by equation (1). However, the results of a thin lens analysis can be used as a useful guide when choosing an imaging lens for a particular PLIIM-based system application.","A typical imaging lens can focus light (illumination) originating anywhere from an infinite distance away, to a few feet away. However, regardless of the origin of such illumination, its rays must be brought to a sharp focus at exactly the same location (e.g. the film plane or image detector), which (in an ordinary camera) does not move. At first glance, this requirement may appear unusual because the thin lens equation (1) above states that the image distance at which light is focused through a thin lens is a function of the object distance at which the light originates, as shown in FIG. J. Thus, it would appear that the position of the image detector would depend on the distance at which the object being imaged is located. An imaging subsystem having a variable focal distance lens assembly avoids this difficulty because several of its lens elements are capable of movement relative to the others. For a fixed focal length imaging lens, the leading lens element(s) can move back and forth a short distance, usually accomplished by the rotation of a helical barrel element which converts rotational motion into purely linear motion of the lens elements. This motion has the effect of changing the image distance to compensate for a change in object distance, allowing the image detector to remain in place, as shown in the schematic optical diagram of FIG. J.","Modeling a Variable Focal Length (Zoom) Imaging Lens Used in the Image Formation and Detection Module of the Present Invention","As shown in FIG. J, a variable focal length (zoom) imaging subsystem has an additional level of internal complexity. A zoom-type imaging subsystem is capable of changing its focal length over a given range; a longer focal length produces a smaller field of view at a given object distance. Consider the case where the PLIIM-based system needs to illuminate and image a certain object over a range of object distances, but requires the illuminated object to appear the same size in all acquired images. When the object is far away, the PLIIM-based system will generate control signals that select a long focal length, causing the field of view to shrink (to compensate for the decrease in apparent size of the object due to distance). When the object is close, the PLIIM-based system will generate control signals that select a shorter focal length, which widens the field of view and preserves the relative size of the object. In many bar code scanning applications, a zoom-type imaging subsystem in the PLIIM-based system (as shown in FIGS. A through J) ensures that all acquired images of bar code symbols have the same dpi image resolution regardless of the position of the bar code symbol within the object distance of the PLIIM-based system.","As shown in FIG. J, a zoom-type imaging subsystem has two groups of lens elements which are able to undergo relative motion. The leading lens elements are moved to achieve focus in the same way as for a fixed focal length lens. Also, there is a group of lenses in the middle of the barrel which move back and forth to achieve the zoom, that is, to change the effective focal length of all the lens elements acting together.","Several Techniques for Accommodating the Field of View (FOV) of a PLIIM System to Particular End-User Environments","In many applications, a PLIIM system of the present invention may include an imaging subsystem with a very long focal length imaging lens (assembly), and this PLIIM-based system must be installed in end-user environments having a substantially shorter object distance range, and\/or field of view (FOV) requirements or the like. Such problems can exist for PLIIM systems employing either fixed or variable focal length imaging subsystems. To accommodate a particular PLIIM-based system for installation in such environments, three different techniques illustrated in FIGS. K-K, L and L can be used.","In FIGS. K and K, the focal length of the imaging lens B can be fixed and set at the factory to produce a field of view having specified geometrical characteristics for particular applications. In FIG. K, the focal length of the image formation and detection module  is fixed during the optical design stage so that the fixed field of view (FOV) thereof substantially matches the scan field width measured at the top of the scan field, and thereafter overshoots the scan field and extends on down to the plane of the conveyor belt . In this FOV arrangement, the dpi image resolution will be greater for packages having a higher height profile above the conveyor belt, and less for envelope-type packages with low height profiles. In FIG. K, the focal length of the image formation and detection module  is fixed during the optical design stage so that the fixed field of view thereof substantially matches the plane slightly above the conveyor belt  where envelope-type packages are transported. In this FOV arrangement, the dpi image resolution will be maximized for envelope-type packages which are expected to be transported along the conveyor belt structure, and this system will be unable to read bar codes on packages having a height-profile exceeding the low-profile scanning field of the system.","In , a FOV beam folding mirror arrangement is used to fold the optical path of the imaging subsystem within the interior of the system housing so that the FOV emerging from the system housing has geometrical characteristics that match the scanning application at hand. As shown, this technique involves mounting a plurality of FOV folding mirrors A through E on the optical bench of the PLIIM system to bounce the FOV of the imaging subsystem B back and forth before the FOV emerges from the system housing. Using this technique, when the FOV emerges from the system housing, it will have expanded to a size appropriate for covering the entire scan field of the system. This technique is easier to practice with image formation and detection modules having linear image detectors, for which the FOV folding mirrors only have to expand in one direction as the distance from the imaging subsystem increases. In , this direction of FOV expansion occurs in the direction perpendicular to the page. In the case of area-type PLIIM-based systems, as shown in FIGS. A through F, the FOV folding mirrors have to accommodate a 3-D FOV which expands in two directions. Thus an internal folding path is easier to arrange for linear-type PLIIM-based systems.","In FIG. L, the fixed field of view of an imaging subsystem is expanded across a working space (e.g. conveyor belt structure) by using a motor  to controllably rotate the FOV  during object illumination and imaging operations. When designing a linear-type PLIIM-based system for industrial scanning applications, wherein the focal length of the imaging subsystem is fixed, a higher dpi image resolution will occasionally be required. This implies using a longer focal length imaging lens, which produces a narrower FOV and thus higher dpi image resolution. However, in many applications, the image formation and detection module in the PLIIM-based system cannot be physically located far enough away from the conveyor belt (and within the system housing) to enable the narrow FOV to cover the entire scanning field of the system. In this case, a FOV folding mirror F can be made to rotate, relative to stationary for folding mirror G, in order to sweep the linear FOV from side to side over the entire width of the conveyor belt, depending on where the bar coded package is located. Ideally, this rotating FOV folding mirror F would have only two mirror positions, but this will depend on how small the FOV is at the top of the scan field. The rotating FOV folding mirror can be driven by motor  operated under the control of the camera control computer , as described herein.","Method of Adjusting the Focal Characteristics of Planar Laser Illumination Beams Generated by Planar Laser Illumination Arrays Used in Conjunction with Image Formation and Detection Modules Employing Fixed Focal Length Imaging Lenses","In the case of a fixed focal length camera lens, the planar laser illumination beam A, B is focused at the farthest possible object distance in the PLIIM-based system. In the case of fixed focal length imaging lens, this focus control technique of the present invention is not employed to compensate for decrease in the power density of the reflected laser beam as a function of 1\/rdistance from the imaging subsystem, but rather to compensate for a decrease in power density of the planar laser illumination beam on the target object due to an increase in object distance away from the imaging subsystem.","It can be shown that laser return light that is reflected by the target object (and measured\/detected at any arbitrary point in space) decreases in intensity as the inverse square of the object distance. In the PLIIM-based system of the present invention, the relevant decrease in intensity is not related to such \u201cinverse square\u201d law decreases, but rather to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases as the object distance increases. This \u201cbeam-width\/object-distance\u201d law decrease in light intensity will be described in greater detail below.","Using a thin lens analysis of the imaging subsystem, it can be shown that when any form of illumination having a uniform power density E(i.e. power per unit area) is directed incident on a target object surface and the reflected laser illumination from the illuminated object is imaged through an imaging lens having a fixed focal length f and f-stop F, the power density E(measured at the pixel of the image detection array and expressed as a function of the object distance r) is provided by the expression (8) set forth below: \n\n","FIG. M shows a plot of pixel power density Evs. object distance r calculated using the arbitrary but reasonable values E=1 W\/m, f=80 mm and F=4.5. This plot demonstrates that, in a counter-intuitive manner, the power density at the pixel (and therefore the power incident on the pixel, as its area remains constant) actually increases as the object distance increases. Careful analysis explains this particular optical phenomenon by the fact that the field of view of each pixel on the image detection array increases slightly faster with increases in object distances than would be necessary to compensate for the 1\/rreturn light losses. A more analytical explanation is provided below.","The width of the planar laser illumination beam increases as object distance r increases. At increasing object distances, the constant output power from the VLD in each planar laser illumination module (PLIM) is spread out over a longer beam width, and therefore the power density at any point along the laser beam width decreases. To compensate for this phenomenon, the planar laser illumination beam of the present invention is focused at the farthest object distance so that the height of the planar laser illumination beam becomes smaller as the object distance increases; as the height of the planar laser illumination beam becomes narrower towards the farthest object distance, the laser beam power density increases at any point along the width of the planar laser illumination beam. The decrease in laser beam power density due to an increase in planar laser beam width and the increase in power density due to a decrease in planar laser beam height, roughly cancel each other out, resulting in a power density which either remains approximately constant or increases as a function of increasing object distance, as the application at hand may require.","Also, as shown in conveyor application of FIG. B, the height dimension of the planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) is substantially greater than the height dimension of the magnified field of view (FOV) of each image detection element in the linear CCD image detection array. The reason for this condition between the PLIB and the FOV is to decrease the range of tolerance which must be maintained when the PLIB and the FOV are aligned in a coplanar relationship along the entire working distance of the PLIIM-based system.","When the laser beam is fanned (i.e. spread) out into a substantially planar laser illumination beam by the cylindrical lens element employed within each PLIM in the PLIIM system, the total output power in the planar laser illumination beam is distributed along the width of the beam in a roughly Gaussian distribution, as shown in the power vs. position plot of FIG. M. Notably, this plot was constructed using actual data gathered with a planar laser illumination beam focused at the farthest object distance in the PLIIM system. For comparison purposes, the data points and a Gaussian curve fit are shown for the planar laser beam widths taken at the nearest and farthest object distances. To avoid having to consider two dimensions simultaneously (i.e. left-to-right along the planar laser beam width dimension and near-to-far through the object distance dimension), the discussion below will assume that only a single pixel is under consideration, and that this pixel views the target object at the center of the planar laser beam width.","For a fixed focal length imaging lens, the width L of the planar laser beam is a function of the fan\/spread angle \u03b8 induced by (i) the cylindrical lens element in the PLIM and (ii) the object distance r, as defined by the following expression (9): \n\n","FIG. M shows a plot of beam width length L versus object distance r calculated using \u03b8=50\u00b0, demonstrating the planar laser beam width increases as a function of increasing object distance.","The height parameter of the planar laser illumination beam \u201ch\u201d is controlled by adjusting the focusing lens  between the visible laser diode (VLD)  and the cylindrical lens , shown in FIGS. I and I. FIG. M shows a typical plot of planar laser beam height h vs. image distance r for a planar laser illumination beam focused at the farthest object distance in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As shown in FIG. M, the height dimension of the planar laser beam decreases as a function of increasing object distance.","Assuming a reasonable total laser power output of 20 mW from the VLD  in each PLIM , the values shown in the plots of FIGS. M and M can be used to determine the power density Eof the planar laser beam at the center of its beam width, expressed as a function of object distance. This measure, plotted in , demonstrates that the use of the laser beam focusing technique of the present invention, wherein the height of the planar laser illumination beam is decreased as the object distance increases, compensates for the increase in beam width in the planar laser illumination beam, which occurs for an increase in object distance. This yields a laser beam power density on the target object which increases as a function of increasing object distance over a substantial portion of the object distance range of the PLIIM system.","Finally, the power density Eplot shown in  can be used with expression (1) above to determine the power density on the pixel, E. This Eplot is shown in FIG. O. For comparison purposes, the plot obtained when using the beam focusing method of the present invention is plotted in  against a \u201creference\u201d power density plot Ewhich is obtained when focusing the laser beam at infinity, using a collimating lens (rather than a focusing lens ) disposed after the VLD , to produce a collimated-type planar laser illumination beam having a constant beam height of 1 mm over the entire portion of the object distance range of the system. Notably, however, this non-preferred beam collimating technique, selected as the reference plot in , does not compensate for the above-described effects associated with an increase in planar laser beam width as a function of object distance. Consequently, when using this non-preferred beam focusing technique, the power density of the planar laser illumination beam produced by each PLIM decreases as a function of increasing object distance.","Therefore, in summary, where a fixed or variable focal length imaging subsystem is employed in the PLIIM system hereof, the planar laser beam focusing technique of the present invention described above helps compensate for decreases in the power density of the incident planar illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases for increasing object distances away from the imaging subsystem.","Producing a Composite Planar Laser Illumination Beam Having Substantially Uniform Power Density Characteristics in Near and Far Fields, by Additively Combining the Individual Gaussian Power Density Distributions of Planar Laser Illumination Beams Produced by Planar Laser Illumination Beam Modules (PLIMS) in Planar Laser Illumination Arrays (PLIAs)","Having described the best known method of focusing the planar laser illumination beam produced by each VLD in each PLIM in the PLIIM-based system hereof, it is appropriate at this juncture to describe how the individual Gaussian power density distributions of the planar laser illumination beams produced a PLIA A, B are additively combined to produce a composite planar laser illumination beam having substantially uniform power density characteristics in near and far fields, as illustrated in FIGS. P and P.","When the laser beam produced from the VLD is transmitted through the cylindrical lens, the output beam will be spread out into a laser illumination beam extending in a plane along the direction in which the lens has curvature. The beam size along the axis which corresponds to the height of the cylindrical lens will be transmitted unchanged. When the planar laser illumination beam is projected onto a target surface, its profile of power versus displacement will have an approximately Gaussian distribution. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the plurality of VLDs on each side of the IFD module are spaced out and tilted in such a way that their individual power density distributions add up to produce a (composite) planar laser illumination beam having a magnitude of illumination which is distributed substantially uniformly over the entire working depth of the PLIIM-based system (i.e. along the height and width of the composite planar laser illumination beam).","The actual positions of the PLIMs along each planar laser illumination array are indicated in FIG. G for the exemplary PLIIM-based system shown in FIGS. G through I. The mathematical analysis used to analyze the results of summing up the individual power density functions of the PLIMs at both near and far working distances was carried out using the Matlab\u2122 mathematical modeling program by Mathworks, Inc. (http:\/\/www.mathworks.com). These results are set forth in the data plots of FIGS. P and P. Notably, in these data plots, the total power density is greater at the far field of the working range of the PLIIM system. This is because the VLDs in the PLIMs are focused to achieve minimum beam width thickness at the farthest object distance of the system, whereas the beam height is somewhat greater at the near field region. Thus, although the far field receives less illumination power at any given location, this power is concentrated into a smaller area, which results in a greater power density within the substantially planar extent of the planar laser illumination beam of the present invention.","When aligning the individual planar laser illumination beams (i.e. planar beam components) produced from each PLIM, it will be important to ensure that each such planar laser illumination beam spatially coincides with a section of the FOV of the imaging subsystem, so that the composite planar laser illumination beam produced by the individual beam components spatially coincides with the FOV of the imaging subsystem throughout the entire working depth of the PLIIM-based system.","Methods of Reducing the RMS Power of Speckle-Noise Patterns Observed at the Linear Image Detection Array of a PLIIM-Based System when Illuminating Objects Using a Planar Laser Illumination Beam","In the PLIIM-based systems disclosed herein, seven (7) general classes of techniques and apparatus have been developed to effectively destroy or otherwise substantially reduce the spatial and\/or temporal coherence of the laser illumination sources used to generate planar laser illumination beams (PLIBs) within such systems, and thus enable time-varying speckle-noise patterns to be produced at the image detection array thereof and temporally (and possibly spatially) averaged over the photo-integration time period thereof, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed (i.e. detected) at the image detection array.","In general, the root mean square (RMS) power of speckle-noise patterns in PLIIM-based systems can be reduced by using any combination of the following techniques: (1) by using a multiplicity of real laser (diode) illumination sources in the planar laser illumination arrays (PLIIM) of the PLIIM-based system and cylindrical lens array  after each PLIA to optically combine and project the planar laser beam components from these real illumination sources onto the target object to be illuminated, as illustrated in the various embodiments of the present invention disclosed herein; and\/or (2) by employing any of the seven generalized speckle-pattern noise reduction techniques of the present invention described in detail below which operate by generating independent virtual sources of laser illumination to effectively reduce the spatial and\/or temporal coherence of the composite PLIB either transmitted to or reflected from the target object being illuminated. Notably, the speckle-noise reduction coefficient of the PLIIM-based system will be proportional to the square root of the number of statistically independent real and virtual sources of laser illumination created by the speckle-noise pattern reduction techniques employed within the PLIIM-based system.","In FIGS. I through ID, a first generalized method of speckle-noise pattern reduction in accordance with the principles of the present invention and particular forms of apparatus therefor are schematically illustrated.

These general conditions have been clearly identified by J. C. Dainty, et al, in page 124 of \u201cLaser Speckle and Related Phenomena\u201d, supra, and are restated below for the sake of completeness: (i) that the standard deviation of the surface height fluctuations in the scattering surface (i.e. target object) should be greater than \u03bb, thus ensuring that the phase of the scattered wave is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to 2\u03c0; and (ii) that a great many independent scattering centers (on the target object) should contribute to any given point in the image detected at the image detector.","First Generalized Method of Speckle-Noise Pattern Reduction and Particular Forms of Apparatus Therefor Based on Reducing the Spatial-Coherence of the Planar Laser Illumination Beam before it Illuminates the Target Object by Applying Spatial Phase Modulation Techniques During the Transmission of the PLIB Towards the Target","Referring to FIGS. I through IC, the first generalized method of speckle-noise pattern reduction and particular forms of apparatus therefor will be described. This generalized method is based on the principle of spatially modulating the \u201ctransmitted\u201d planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) prior to illuminating a target object (e.g. package) therewith so that the object is illuminated with a spatially coherent-reduced planar laser beam and, as a result, numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns are produced and detected over the photo-integration time period of the image detection array (in the IFD subsystem), thereby allowing these speckle-noise patterns to be temporally averaged and possibly spatially averaged over the photo-integration time period and the RMS power of observable speckle-noise pattern reduced. This method can be practiced with any of the PLIM-based systems of the present invention disclosed herein, as well as any system constructed in accordance with the general principles of the present invention.","Whether any significant spatial averaging can occur in any particular embodiment of the present invention will depend on the relative dimensions of: (i) each element in the image detection array; and (ii) the physical dimensions of the speckle blotches in a given speckle-noise pattern which will depend on the standard deviation of the surface height fluctuations in the scattering surface or target object, and the wavelength of the illumination source \u03bb. As the size of each image detection element is made larger, the image resolution of the image detection array will decrease, with an accompanying increase in spatial averaging. Clearly, there is a tradeoff to be decided upon in any given application. Such spatial averaging techniques, embraced by the Ninth Generalized Speckle-Pattern Noise Reduction Method Of The Present Invention, will be described in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to FIG. ID","As illustrated at Block A in FIG. IB, the first step of the first generalized method shown in FIGS. I through IC involves spatially phase modulating the transmitted planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) along the planar extent thereof according to a (random or periodic) spatial phase modulation function (SPMF) prior to illumination of the target object with the PLIB, so as to modulate the phase along the wavefront of the PLIB and produce numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise pattern at the image detection array of the IFD Subsystem during the photo-integration time period thereof. As indicated at Block B in FIG. IB, the second step of the method involves temporally and spatially averaging the numerous substantially different speckle-noise patterns produced at the image detection array in the IFD Subsystem during the photo-integration time period thereof.","When using the first generalized method, the target object is repeatedly illuminated with laser light apparently originating from different points (i.e. virtual illumination sources) in space over the photo-integration period of each detector element in the linear image detection array of the PLIIM system, during which reflected laser illumination is received at the detector element. As the relative phase delays between these virtual illumination sources are changing over the photo-integration time period of each image detection element, these virtual sources are effectively rendered spatially incoherent with each other. On a time-average basis, these time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally (and possibly spatially) averaged during the photo-integration time period of the image detection elements, thereby reducing the RMS power of the speckle-noise pattern (i.e. level) observed thereat. As speckle noise patterns are roughly uncorrelated at the image detection array, the reduction in speckle-noise power should be proportional to the square root of the number of independent virtual laser illumination sources contributing to the illumination of the target object and formation of the image frame thereof. As a result of the present invention, image-based bar code symbol decoders and\/or OCR processors operating on such digital images can be processed with significant reductions in error.","The first generalized method above can be explained in terms of Fourier Transform optics. When spatial phase modulating the transmitted PLIB by a periodic or random spatial phase modulation function (SPMF), while satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above, a spatial phase modulation process occurs on the spatial domain. This spatial phase modulation process is equivalent to mathematically multiplying the transmitted PLIB by the spatial phase modulation function. This multiplication process on the spatial domain is equivalent on the spatial-frequency domain to the convolution of the Fourier Transform of the spatial phase modulation function with the Fourier Transform of the transmitted PLIB. On the spatial-frequency domain, this convolution process generates spatially-incoherent (i.e. statistically-uncorrelated) spectral components which are permitted to spatially-overlap at each detection element of the image detection array (i.e. on the spatial domain) and produce time-varying speckle-noise patterns which are temporally (and possibly) spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of each detector element, to reduce the RMS power of the speckle-noise pattern observed at the image detection array.","In general, various types of spatial phase modulation techniques can be used to carry out the first generalized method including, for example: mechanisms for moving the relative position\/motion of a cylindrical lens array and laser diode array, including reciprocating a pair of rectilinear cylindrical lens arrays relative to each other, as well as rotating a cylindrical lens array ring structure about each PLIM employed in the PLIIM-based system; rotating phase modulation discs having multiple sectors with different refractive indices to effect different degrees of phase delay along the wavefront of the PLIB transmitted (along different optical paths) towards the object to be illuminated; acousto-optical Bragg-type cells for enabling beam steering using ultrasonic waves; ultrasonically-driven deformable mirror structures; a LCD-type spatial phase modulation panel; and other spatial phase modulation devices. Several of these spatial light modulation (SLM) mechanisms will be described in detail below.","Apparatus of the Present Invention for Micro-Oscillating a Pair of Refractive Cylindrical Lens Arrays to Spatial Phase Modulate the Planar Laser Illumination Beam Prior to Target Object Illumination","In FIGS. IA through ID, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a PLIA A, B with a pair of refractive-type cylindrical lens arrays A and B, and an electronically-controlled mechanism  for micro-oscillating the pair cylindrical lens arrays A and B along the planar extent of the PLIB. In accordance with the first generalized method, the pair of cylindrical lens arrays A and B are micro-oscillated, relative to each other (out of phase by 90 degrees) using two pairs of ultrasonic (or other motion-imparting) transducers A, B, and A, B arranged in a push-pull configuration. The individual beam components within the PLIB  which are transmitted through the cylindrical lens arrays are micro-oscillated (i.e. moved) along the planar extent thereof by an amount of distance \u0394x or greater at a velocity v(t) which causes the spatial phase along the wavefronts of the transmitted PLIB to be modulated and numerous (e.g. 25 or more) substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array of the IFD Subsystem during the photo-integration time period thereof. The numerous time-varying speckle-noise patterns produced at the image detection array are temporally (and possibly spatially) averaged during the photo-integration time period thereof, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","As shown in FIG. IC, an array support frame  with a light transmission window  and accessories A and B for mounting pairs of ultrasonic transducers A, B and A, B, is used to mount the pair of cylindrical lens arrays A and B in a relative reciprocating manner, and thus permitting micro-oscillation in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In ID, the pair of cylindrical lens arrays A and B are shown configured between pairs of ultrasonic transducers A, B and A, B (or flexural elements driven by voice-coil type devices) operated in a push-pull mode of operation. By employing dual cylindrical lens arrays in this optically assembly, the transmitted PLIB is spatial phase modulated in a continual manner during object illumination operations. The function of cylindrical lens array B is to optically combine the spatial phase modulated PLIB components so that each point on the surface of the target object being illuminated by numerous spatial-phase delayed PLIB components. By virtue of this optical assembly design, when one cylindrical lens array is momentarily stationary during beam direction reversal, the other cylindrical lens array is moving in an independent manner, thereby causing the transmitted PLIB  to be spatial phase modulated even at times when one cylindrical lens array is reversing its direction (i.e. momentarily at rest). In an alternative embodiment, one of the cylindrical lens arrays can be mounted stationary relative to the PLIA, while the other cylindrical lens array is micro-oscillated relative to the stationary cylindrical lens array.","In the illustrative embodiment, each cylindrical lens array A and B is realized as a lenticular screen having 64 cylindrical lenslets per inch. For a speckle-noise power reduction of five (5\u00d7), it was determined experimentally that about 25 or more substantially different speckle-noise patterns must be generated during a photo-integration time period of 1\/10000second, and that a 125 micron shift (\u0394x) in the cylindrical lens arrays was required, thereby requiring an array velocity of about 1.25 meters\/second. Using a sinusoidal function to drive each cylindrical lens array, the array velocity is described by the equation V=A\u03c9sin(\u03c9t), where A=3\u00d710meters and \u03c9=370 radians\/second (i.e. 60 Hz) providing about a peak array velocity of about 1.1 meter\/second. Notably, one can increase the number of substantially different speckle-noise patterns produced during the photo-integration time period of the image detection array by either (i) increasing the spatial period of each cylindrical lens array, and\/or (ii) increasing the relative velocity cylindrical lens array(s) and the PLIB transmitted therethrough during object illumination operations. Increasing either of this parameters will have the effect of increasing the spatial gradient of the spatial phase modulation function (SPMF) of the optical assembly, causing steeper transitions in phase delay along the wavefront of the PLIB, as the cylindrical lens arrays move relative to the PLIB being transmitted therethrough. Expectedly, this will generate more components with greater magnitude values on the spatial-frequency domain of the system, thereby producing more independent virtual spatially-incoherent illumination sources in the system. This will tend to reduce the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","Conditions for Producing Uncorrelated Time-Varying Speckle-Noise Pattern Variations at the Image Detection Array of the IFD Module (i.e. Camera Subsystem)","In general, each method of speckle-noise reduction according to the present invention requires modulating the either the phase, intensity, or frequency of the transmitted PLIB (or reflected\/received PLIB) so that numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns are generated at the image detection array each photo-integration time period\/interval thereof. By achieving this general condition, the planar laser illumination beam (PLIB), either transmitted to the target object, or reflected therefrom and received by the IFD subsystem, is rendered partially coherent or coherent-reduced in the spatial and\/or temporal sense. This ensures that the speckle-noise patterns produced at the image detection array are statistically uncorrelated, and therefore can be temporally and possibly spatially averaged at each image detection element during the photo-integration time period thereof, thereby reducing the RMS power of the speckle-patterns observed at the image detection array. The amount of RMS power reduction that is achievable at the image detection array is, therefore, dependent upon the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns that are generated at the image detection array during its photo-integration time period thereof. For any particular speckle-noise reduction apparatus of the present invention, a number parameters will factor into determining the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns that must be generated each photo-integration time period, in order to achieve a particular degree of reduction in the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns at the image detection array.","Referring to FIG. IE, a geometrical model of a subsection of the optical assembly of FIG. IA is shown. This simplified model illustrates the first order parameters involved in the PLIB spatial phase modulation process, and also the relationship among such parameters which ensures that at least one cycle of speckle-noise pattern variation will be produced at the image detection array of the IFD module (i.e. camera subsystem). As shown, this simplified model is derived by taking a simple case example, where only two virtual laser illumination sources (such as those generated by two cylindrical lenslets) are illuminating a target object. In practice, there will be numerous virtual laser beam sources by virtue of the fact that the cylindrical lens array has numerous lenslets (e.g. 64 lenslets\/inch) and cylindrical lens array is micro-oscillated at a particular velocity with respect to the PLIB as the PLIB is being transmitted therethrough.","In the simplified case shown in FIG. IE, wherein spatial phase modulation techniques are employed, the speckle-noise pattern viewed by the pair of cylindrical lens elements of the imaging array will become uncorrelated with respect to the original speckle-noise pattern (produced by the real laser illumination source) when the difference in phase among the wavefronts of the individual beam components is on the order of \u00bd of the laser illumination wavelength \u03bb. For the case of a moving cylindrical lens array, as shown in FIG. IA, this decorrelation condition occurs when:\n\n\u03942\n\n","To ensure additive cancellation of the uncorrelated time-varying speckle-noise patterns detected at the (coherent) image detection array, it is necessary that numerous substantially different (i.e. uncorrelated) time-varying speckle-noise patterns are generated during each the photo-integration time period. In the case of optical system of FIG. IA, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array during each photo-integration time period thereof: (i) the spatial period of each refractive cylindrical lens array: (ii) the width dimension of each cylindrical lenslet; (iii) the length of each lens array; (iv) the velocity thereof; and (v) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system. Parameters (1) through (iv) will factor into the specification of the spatial phase modulation function (SPMF) of the system. In general, if the system requires an increase in reduction in the RMS power of speckle-noise at its image detection array, then the system must generate more uncorrelated time-varying speckle-noise patterns for averaging over each photo-integration time period thereof. Adjustment of the above-described parameters should enable the designer to achieve the degree of speckle-noise power reduction desired in the application at hand.","For a desired reduction in speckle-noise pattern power in the system of FIG. IA, the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise pattern samples which need to be generated per each photo-integration time interval of the image detection array can be experimentally determined without undue experimentation. However, it should be noted that this minimum sampling parameter threshold is expressed on the time domain, and that expectedly, the lower threshold for this sample number at the image detection (i.e. observation) end of the PLIIM-based system, for a particular degree of speckle-noise power reduction, can be expressed mathematically in terms of (i) the spatial gradient of the spatial phase modulated PLIB, and (ii) the photo-integration time period of the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","By ensuring that these two conditions are satisfied to the best degree possible (at the planar laser illumination subsystem and the camera subsystem) will ensure optimal reduction in speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detector of the PLIIM-based system of the present invention. In general, the reduction in the RMS power of observable speckle-noise patterns will be proportional to the square root of the number of statistically uncorrelated real and virtual illumination sources created by the speckle-noise reduction technique of the present invention. FIGS. IF and IG illustrate that significant mitigation in speckle-noise patterns can be achieved when using the particular apparatus of FIG. IA in accordance with the first generalized speckle-noise pattern reduction method illustrated in FIGS. I through IB.","Apparatus of the Present Invention for Micro-Oscillating a Pair of Light Diffractive (e.g. Holographic) Cylindrical Lens Arrays to Spatial Phase Modulate the Planar Laser Illumination Beam Prior to Target Object Illumination","In FIG.

In accordance with the first generalized method, the pair of reflective elements A and B are micro-oscillated relative to each other (at 90 degrees out of phase) using two pairs of ultrasonic transducers A, B and A, B arranged in a push-pull configuration. The transmitted PLIB is micro-oscillated (i.e. move) along the planar extent thereof (i) by an amount of distance \u0394x or greater at a velocity v(t) which causes the spatial phase along the wavefront of the transmitted PLIB to be modulated and numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array of the IFD Subsystem during the photo-integration time period thereof.

IA, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a PLIA A, B with a cylindrical lens array , and an acousto-optical (i.e. Bragg Cell) beam deflection mechanism  for micro-oscillating the PLIB  prior to illuminating the target object. In accordance with the first generalized method, the PLIB  is micro-oscillated by an acousto-optical (i.e. Bragg Cell) beam deflection device  as acoustical waves (signals)  propagate through the electro-acoustical device transverse to the direction of transmission of the PLIB . This causes the beam components of the composite PLIB  to be micro-oscillated (i.e. moved) the along the planar extent thereof by an amount of distance \u0394x or greater at a velocity v(t). Such a micro-oscillation movement causes the spatial phase along the wavefront of the transmitted PLIB to be modulated and numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof. The numerous time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally and possibly spatially averaged at the image detection array during each the photo-integration time period thereof. As shown, the acousto-optical beam deflective panel  is driven by control signals supplied by electrical circuitry under the control of camera control computer .","In the illustrative embodiment, beam deflection panel  is made from an ultrasonic cell comprising: a pair of spaced-apart optically transparent panels A and B, containing an optically transparent, ultrasonic-wave carrying fluid, e.g. toluene (i.e. CHCH) ; a pair of end panels A and B cemented to the side and end panels to contain the ultrasonic wave carrying fluid  within the cell structure formed thereby; an array of piezoelectric transducers  mounted through end wall A; and an ultrasonic-wave dampening material  disposed at the opposing end wall panel B, on the inside of the cell, to avoid reflections of the ultrasonic wave at the end of the cell. Electronic drive circuitry is provided for generating electrical drive signals for the acoustical wave cell  under the control of the camera control computer . In the illustrative embodiment, these electrical drives signals are provided to the piezoelectric transducers  and result in the generation of an ultrasonic wave that propagates at a phase velocity through the cell structure, from one end to the other. This causes a modulation of the refractive index of the ultrasonic wave carrying fluid , and thus a modulation of the spatial phase along the wavefront of the transmitted PLIB, thereby causing the same to be periodically swept across the cylindrical lens array . The micro-oscillated PLIB components are optically combined as they are transmitted through the cylindrical lens array  and numerous phase-delayed PLIB components are projected onto the same points of the surface of the object being illuminated. After reflecting from the object and being modulated by the micro-structure thereof, the received PLIB produces numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns on the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system during the photo-integration time period thereof. These time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally and spatially averaged at the image detection array, thereby reducing the power of speckle-noise patterns observable at the image detection array.","In the case of optical system of FIG. IA, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array during each photo-integration time period thereof: (i) the spatial frequency of the cylindrical lens array; (ii) the width dimension of each lenslet; (iii) the temporal and velocity characteristics of the acoustical wave  propagating through the acousto-optical cell structure ; (iv) the optical density characteristics of the ultrasonic wave carrying fluid ; and (v) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system. Parameters (1) through (iv) will factor into the specification of the spatial phase modulation function (SPMF) of this speckle-noise reduction subsystem design. In general, if the system requires an increase in reduction in the RMS power of speckle-noise at its image detection array, then the system must generate more uncorrelated time-varying speckle-noise patterns for averaging over each photo-integration time period thereof.","One can expect an increase the number of substantially different speckle-noise patterns produced during the photo-integration time period of the image detection array by either: (i) increasing the spatial period of each cylindrical lens array; (ii) the temporal period and rate of repetition of the acoustical waveform propagating along the cell structure ; and\/or (iii) increasing the relative velocity between the stationary cylindrical lens array and the PLIB transmitted therethrough during object illumination operations, by increasing the velocity of the acoustical wave propagating through the acousto-optical cell . Increasing either of these parameters should have the effect of increasing the spatial gradient of the spatial phase modulation function (SPMF) of the optical assembly, e.g. by causing steeper transitions in phase delay along the wavefront of the composite PLIB, as it is transmitted through cylindrical lens array  in response to the propagation of the acoustical wave along the cell structure . Expectedly, this should generate more components with greater magnitude values on the spatial-frequency domain of the system, thereby producing more independent virtual spatially-incoherent illumination sources in the system.

IA, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a PLIA A, B with a cylindrical lens array  (supported within a frame ), and an electromechanical PLIB micro-oscillation mechanism  for micro-oscillating the PLIB prior to transmission to the target object to be illuminated. In accordance with the first generalize method, the PLIB components produced by PLIA A, B are reflected off a piezo-electrically driven deformable mirror (DM) structure  arranged in front of the PLIA, while being micro-oscillated along the planar extent of the PLIBs. These micro-oscillated PLIB components are reflected back towards a stationary beam folding mirror  mounted (above the optical path of the PLIB components) by support posts A, B and C, reflected thereoff and transmitted through cylindrical lens array  (e.g. operating according to refractive, diffractive and\/or reflective principles). These micro-oscillated PLIB components are optically combined by the cylindrical lens array so that numerous phase-delayed PLIB components are projected onto the same points on the surface of the object being illuminated. During PLIB transmission, in the case of an illustrative embodiment involving a high-speed tunnel scanning system, the surface of the DM structure  (\u0394x) is periodically deformed at frequencies in the 100 kHz range and at few microns amplitude, to produce moving ripples aligned along the direction that is perpendicular to planar extent of the PLIB (i.e. along its beam spread). These moving ripples cause the beam components within the PLIB  to be micro-oscillated (i.e. moved) along the planar extent thereof by an amount of distance \u0394x or greater at a velocity v(t) which modules the spatial phase among the wavefront of the transmitted PLIB and produces numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof. These numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally and possibly spatially averaged during each photo-integration time period of the image detection array. FIG. IA shows the optical path which the PLIB travels while undergoing spatial phase modulation by the piezo-electrically driven DM structure  during target object illumination operations.","In the case of optical system of FIG.

Notably, one can expect an increase the number of substantially different speckle-noise patterns produced during the photo-integration time period of the image detection array by either: (i) increasing the spatial period of each cylindrical lens array; (ii) the spatial gradient of the surface deformations produced along the DM structure ; and\/or (iii) increasing the relative velocity between the stationary cylindrical lens array and the PLIB transmitted therethrough during object illumination operations, by increasing the velocity of the surface deformations along the DM structure . Increasing either of these parameters should have the effect of increasing the spatial gradient of the spatial phase modulation function (SPMF) of the optical assembly, causing steeper transitions in phase delay along the wavefront of the composite PLIB, as it is transmitted through cylindrical lens array in response to the propagation of the acoustical wave along the cell. Expectedly, this should generate more components with greater magnitude values on the spatial-frequency domain of the system, thereby producing more independent virtual spatially-incoherent illumination sources in the system. This should tend to reduce the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","For a desired reduction in speckle-noise pattern power in the system of FIG.

I through IF, the second generalized method of speckle-noise pattern reduction and particular forms of apparatus therefor will be described. This generalized method is based on the principle of temporal intensity modulating the \u201ctransmitted\u201d planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) prior to illuminating a target object (e.g. package) therewith so that the object is illuminated with a temporally coherent-reduced planar laser beam and, as a result, numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns are produced and detected over the photo-integration time period of the image detection array (in the IFD subsystem). These speckle-noise patterns are temporally averaged and\/or spatially averaged and the observable speckle-noise patterns reduced. This method can be practiced with any of the PLIIM-based systems of the present invention disclosed herein, as well as any system constructed in accordance with the general principles of the present invention.","As illustrated at Block A in FIG. IB, the first step of the second generalized method shown in FIGS. I through IA involves modulating the temporal intensity of the transmitted planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) along the planar extent thereof according to a (random or periodic) temporal-intensity modulation function (TIMF) prior to illumination of the target object with the PLIB. This causes numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns to be produced at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof. As indicated at Block B in FIG. IB, the second step of the method involves temporally and spatially averaging the numerous time-varying speckle-noise patterns detected during each photo-integration time period of the image detection array in the IFD Subsystem, thereby reducing the RMS power of the speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","When using the second generalized method, the target object is repeatedly illuminated with planes of laser light apparently originating at different moments in time (i.e. from different virtual illumination sources) over the photo-integration period of each detector element in the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system. As the relative phase delays between these virtual illumination sources are changing over the photo-integration time period of each image detection element, these virtual illumination sources are effectively rendered temporally incoherent (or temporally coherent-reduced) with respect to each other. On a time-average basis, virtual illumination sources produce these time-varying speckle-noise patterns which are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of the image detection elements, thereby reducing the RMS power of the observed speckle-noise patterns. As speckle-noise patterns are roughly uncorrelated at the image detector, the reduction in speckle noise amplitude should be proportional to the square root of the number of independent real and virtual laser illumination sources contributing to the illumination of the target object and formation of the image frames thereof. As a result of the method of the present invention, image-based bar code symbol decoders and\/or OCR processors operating on such digital images can be processed with significant reductions in error.","The second generalized method above can be explained in terms of Fourier Transform optics. When temporally modulating the transmitted PLIB by a periodic or random temporal intensity modulation (TIMF) function, while satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above, a temporal intensity modulation process occurs on the time domain. This temporal intensity modulation process is equivalent to mathematically multiplying the transmitted PLIB by the temporal intensity modulation function. This multiplication process on the time domain is equivalent on the time-frequency domain to the convolution of the Fourier Transform of the temporal intensity modulation function with the Fourier Transform of the transmitted PLIB. On the time-frequency domain, this convolution process generates temporally-incoherent (i.e. statistically-uncorrelated) spectral components which are permitted to spatially-overlap at each detection element of the image detection array (i.e. on the spatial domain) and produce time-varying speckle-noise patterns which are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of each detector element, to reduce the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","In general, various types of temporal intensity modulation techniques can be used to carry out the first generalized method including, for example: mode-locked laser diodes (MLLDs) employed in the planar laser illumination array; electro-optical temporal intensity modulators disposed along the optical path of the composite planar laser illumination beam; internal and external type laser beam frequency modulation (FM) devices; internal and external laser beam amplitude modulation (AM) devices; etc. Several of these temporal intensity modulation mechanisms will be described in detail below.","Electro-Optical Apparatus of the Present Invention for Temporal Intensity Modulating the Planar Laser Illumination (PLIB) Beam Prior to Target Object Illumination Employing High-Speed Beam Gating\/Shutter Principles","In FIGS. IA through IB, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a PLIA A, B with a refractive-type cylindrical lens array  (e.g. operating according to refractive, diffractive and\/or reflective principles) supported in frame , and an electrically-active temporal intensity modulation panel  (e.g. high-speed electro-optical gating\/shutter device) arranged in front of the cylindrical lens array . Electronic driver circuitry  is provided to drive the temporal intensity modulation panel  under the control of camera control computer . In the illustrative embodiment, electronic driver circuitry  can be programmed to produce an output PLIB  consisting of a periodic light pulse train, wherein each light pulse has an ultra-short time duration and a rate of repetition (i.e. temporal characteristics) which generate spectral harmonics (i.e. components) on the time-frequency domain. These spectral harmonics, when optically combined by cylindrical lens array , and projected onto a target object, illuminate the same points on the surface thereof, and reflect\/scatter therefrom, resulting in the generation of numerous time-varying speckle-patterns at the image detection array during each photo-integration time period thereof in the PLIIM-based system.","During system operation, the PLIB  is temporal intensity modulated according to a (random or periodic) temporal-intensity modulation (e.g. windowing) function (TIMF) so that numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns are produced at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof. The time-varying speckle-noise patterns detected at the image detection array are temporally and spatially averaged during each photo-integration time period thereof, thus reducing the RMS power of the speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","In the case of optical system of FIG. IA, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated during each photo-integration lime period: (i) the time duration of each light pulse in the output PLIB ; (ii) the rate of repetition of the light pulses in the output PLIB; and (iii) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system. Parameters (i) and (ii) will factor into the specification of the temporal intensity modulation function (TIMF) of this speckle-noise reduction subsystem design. In general, if the PLIIM-based system requires an increase in reduction in the RMS power of speckle-noise at its image detection array, then the system must generate more uncorrelated time-varying speckle-noise patterns for averaging over each photo-integration time period thereof. Adjustment of the above-described parameters should enable the designer to achieve the degree of speckle-noise power reduction desired in the application at hand.","For a desired reduction in speckle-noise pattern power in the system of FIG. IA, the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise pattern samples which need to be generated per each photo-integration time interval of the image detection array can be experimentally determined without undue experimentation. However, for a particular degree of speckle-noise power reduction, it is expected that the lower threshold for this sample number at the image detection array can be expressed mathematically in terms of (i) the temporal derivative of the temporal intensity modulated PLIB, and (ii) the photo-integration time period of the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","Electro-Optical Apparatus of the Present Invention for Temporal Intensity Modulating the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) Prior to Target Object Illumination Employing Visible Mode-Locked Laser Diodes (MLLDs)","In FIGS. IA through IB, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a cylindrical lens array  (e.g. operating according to refractive, diffractive and\/or reflective principles), mounted in front of a PLIA A, B embodying a plurality of visible mode-locked visible diodes (MLLDs) \u2032. In accordance with the second generalized method of the present invention, each visible MLLD \u2032 is configured and tuned to produce ultra-short pulses of light having a time duration and at occurring at a rate of repetition (i.e. frequency) which causes the transmitted PLIB  to be temporal-intensity modulated according to a (random or periodic) temporal intensity modulation function (TIMF) prior to illumination of the target object with the PLIB. This causes numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns produced at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof. These numerous time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally and spatially averaged during each photo-integration time period of the image detection array in the IFD Subsystem, thereby reducing the RMS power of the speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","As shown in FIG. IB, each MLLD \u2032 employed in the PLIA of FIG. IA comprises: a multi-mode laser diode cavity  referred to as the active layer (e.g. InGaAsP) having a wide emission-bandwidth over the visible band, and suitable time-bandwidth product for the application at hand; a collimating lenslet  having a very short focal length; an active mode-locker  (e.g. temporal-intensity modulator) operated under switched electronic control of a TIM controller ; a passive-mode locker (i.e. saturable absorber)  for controlling the pulse-width of the output laser beam; and a mirror , affixed to the passive-mode locker , having 99% reflectivity and 1% transmittivity at the operative wavelength band of the visible MLLD. The multi-mode diode laser diode \u2032 generates (within its primary laser cavity) numerous modes of oscillation at different optical wavelengths within the time-bandwidth product of the cavity. The collimating lenslet  collimates the divergent laser output from the diode cavity , has a very short local length and defines the aperture of the optical system. The collimated output from the lenslet  is directed through the active mode locker , disposed at a very short distance away (e.g. 1 millimeter). The active mode locker  is typically realized as a high-speed temporal intensity modulator which is electronically-switched between optically transmissive and optically opaque states at a switching frequency equal to the frequency (f) of the mode-locked laser beam pulses to be produced at the output of each MLLD. This laser beam pulse frequency fis governed by the following equation: f=c\/2L, where c is the speed of light, and L is the total length of the MLLD, as defined in FIG. IB. The partially transmission mirror , disposed a short distance (e.g. 1 millimeter) away from the active mode locker , is characterized by a reflectivity of about 99%, and a transmittance of about 1% at the operative wavelength band of the MLLD. The passive mode locker , applied to the interior surface of the mirror , is a photo-bleachable saturatable material which absorbs photons at the operative wavelength band. When the passive mode blocker  is totally absorbed (i.e. saturated), it automatically transmits the absorbed photons as a burst (i.e. pulse) of output laser light from the visible MLLD. After the burst of photons are emitted, the passive mode blocker  quickly recovers for the next photon absorption\/saturation\/release cycle. Notably, absorption and recovery time characteristics of the passive mode blocker  controls the time duration (i.e. width) of the optical pulses produced from the visible MLLD. In typical high-speed package scanning applications requiring a relatively short photo-integration time period (e.g. 10sec), the absorption and recovery time characteristics of the passive mode blocker  can be on the order of femtoseconds. This will ensure that the composite PLIB  produced from the MLLD-based PLIA contains higher order spectral harmonics (i.e. components) with sufficient magnitude to cause a significant reduction in the temporal coherence of the PLIB and thus in the power-density spectrum of the speckle-noise pattern observed at the image detection array of the IFD Subsystem. For further details regarding the construction of MLLDs, reference should be made to \u201cDiode Laser Arrays\u201d (1994), by D. Botez and D. R. Scifres, supra, incorporated herein by reference.","In the case of optical system of FIG. IA, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated during each photo-integration time period: (i) the time duration of each light pulse in the output PLIB ; (ii) the rate of repetition of the light pulses in the output PLIB; and (iii) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system.

A straightforward approach to temporal intensity modulating the PLIB would be to either (i) modulate the diode current driving the VLDs of the PLIA in a non-linear mode of operation, or (ii) use an external optical modulator to temporal intensity modulate the PLIB in a non-linear mode of operation. By operating VLDs in a non-linear manner, high order spectral harmonics can be produced which, in cooperation with a cylindrical lens array, cooperate to generate substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns during each photo-integration time period of the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","In principal, non-linear amplitude modulation (AM) techniques can be employed with the first approach (i) above, whereas the non-linear AM, frequency modulation (FM), or temporal phase modulation (PM) techniques can be employed with the second approach (ii) above. The primary purpose of applying such non-linear laser modulation techniques is to introduce spectral side-bands into the optical spectrum of the planar laser illumination beam (PLIB). The spectral harmonics in this side-band spectra are determined by the sum and difference frequencies of the optical carrier frequency and the modulation frequency(ies) employed. If the PLIB is temporal intensity modulated by a periodic temporal intensity modulation (time-windowing) function (e.g. 100% AM), and the time period of this time windowing function is sufficiently high, then two points on the target surface will be illuminated by light of different optical frequencies (i.e. uncorrelated virtual laser illumination sources) carried within pulsed-periodic PLIB. In general, if the difference in optical frequencies in the pulsed-periodic PLIB is large (i.e. caused by compressing the time duration of its constituent light pulses) compared to the inverse of the photo-integration time period of the image detection array, then observed the speckle-noise pattern will appear to be washed out (i.e. additively cancelled) by the beating of the two optical frequencies at the image detection array. To ensure that the uncorrelated speckle-noise patterns detected at the image detection array can additively average (i.e. cancel) out during the photo-integration time period of the image detection array, the rate of light pulse repetition in the transmitted PLIB should be increased to the point where numerous time-varying speckle-patterns are produced thereat, while the time duration (i.e. duty cycle) of each light pulse in the pulsed PLIB is compressed so as to impart greater magnitude to the higher order spectral harmonics comprising the periodic-pulsed PLIB generated by the application of such non-linear modulation techniques.","In FIG. IC, there is shown an optical subsystem  for despeckling which comprises a plurality of visible laser diodes (VLDs)  and a plurality of cylindrical lens elements  arranged in front of a cylindrical lens array  supported within a frame . Each VLD is driven by a digitally-controlled temporal intensity modulation (TIM) controller  so that the PLIB transmitted from the PLIA is temporal intensity modulated according to a temporal-intensity modulation function (TIMF) that is controlled by the programmable drive-current source. This temporal intensity modulation of the transmitted PLIB modulates the temporal phase along the wavefront of the transmitted PLIB, producing numerous substantially different speckle-noise patterns at the image detection array of the IFD subsystem during the photo-integration time period thereof. In turn, these time-varying speckle-patterns are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of the image detection array, thus reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","As shown in FIG. ID, the temporal intensity modulation (TIM) controller  employed in optical subsystem  in FIG. IE, comprises: a programmable current source for driving each VLD, which is realized by a voltage source , and a digitally-controllable potentiometer  configured in series with each VLD  in the PLIA; and a programmable microcontroller  in operable communication with the camera control computer .

IF graphically illustrates the light intensity output from each VLD in the PLIA of FIG. IC, generated in response to the triangular electrical current waveform transmitted across the junction of the VLD.","Notably, the current waveforms generated by the microcontroller  can be quite diverse in character, in order to produce temporal intensity modulation functions (TIMF) which exhibit a spectral harmonic constitution that results in a substantial reduction in the RMS power of speckle-pattern noise observed at the image detection array of PLIIM-based systems.","In accordance with the second generalized method of the present invention, each VLD  is preferably driven in a non-linear manner by a time-varying electrical current produced by a high-speed VLD drive current modulation circuit, referred to as the TIM controller  in FIGS. IC and ID. In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIGS. IC through IF, the electrical current flowing through each VLD  is controlled by the digitally-controllable potentiometer  configured in electrical series therewith, and having an electrical resistance value R programmably set under the control of microcontroller . Notably, microcontroller  automatically responds to timing\/synchronization signals and control data periodically received from the camera control computer  prior to the capture of each line of digital image data by the PLIIM-based system. The VLD drive current supplied to each VLD in the PLIA effectively modulates the amplitude of the output planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) component. Preferably, the depth of amplitude modulation (AM) of each output PLIB component will be close or equal to 100% in order to increase the magnitude of the higher order spectral harmonics generated during the AM process. Increasing the rate of change of the amplitude modulation of the laser beam (i.e. its pulse repetition frequency) will result in the generation of higher-order spectral components in the composite PLIB. Shortening the width of each optical pulse in the output pulse train of the transmitted PLIB will increase the magnitude of the higher-order spectral harmonics present therein during object illumination operations.","In the case of optical system of FIG. IC, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated during each photo-integration time period: (i) the time duration of each light pulse in the output PLIB ; (ii) the rate of repetition of the light pulses in the output PLIB; and (iii) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system.

Internal-type laser modulation devices, employing laser current and\/or temperature control techniques, modulate the temporal intensity of the transmitted PLIB in a non-linear manner (i.e. zero PLIB power, full PLIB power) by controlling the current of the VLDs producing the PLIB. In contrast, external-type laser modulation devices, employing high-speed optical-gating and other light control devices, modulate the temporal intensity of the transmitted PLIB in a non-linear manner (i.e. zero PLIB power, full PLIB power) by directly controlling temporal intensity of luminous power in the transmitted PLIB. Typically, such external-type techniques will require additional heat management apparatus. Cost and spatial constraints will factor in which techniques to use in a particular application.","Third Generalized Method of Speckle-Noise Pattern Reduction and Particular Forms of Apparatus Therefor Based on Reducing the Temporal-Coherence of the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) before It Illuminates the Target Object by Applying Temporal Phase Modulation Techniques During the Transmission of the PLIB Towards the Target","Referring to FIGS. I through IE, the third generalized method of speckle-noise pattern reduction and particular forms of apparatus therefor will be described. This generalized method is based on the principle of temporal phase modulating the \u201ctransmitted\u201d planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) prior to illuminating a target object therewith so that the object is illuminated with a temporally coherent reduced planar laser beam and, as a result, numerous time-varying (random) speckle-noise patterns are produced and detected over the photo-integration time period of the image detection array (in the IFD subsystem), thereby allowing these speckle-noise patterns to be temporally averaged and\/or spatially averaged and the observable speckle-noise pattern reduced. This method can be practiced with any of the PLIM-based systems of the present invention disclosed herein, as well as any system constructed in accordance with the general principles of the present invention.","As illustrated at Block A in FIG. IB, the first step of the third generalized method shown in FIGS. I through IA involves temporal phase modulating the transmitted PLIB along the entire extent thereof according to a (random or periodic) temporal phase modulation function (TPMF) prior to illumination of the target object with the PLIB, so as to produce numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise pattern at the image detection array of the IFD Subsystem during the photo-integration time period thereof. As indicated at Block B in FIG. IB, the second step of the method involves temporally and spatially averaging the numerous substantially different speckle-noise patterns produced at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","When using the third generalized method, the target object is repeatedly illuminated with laser light apparently originating from different moments (i.e. virtual illumination sources) in time over the photo-integration period of each detector element in the linear image detection array of the PLIIM system, during which reflected laser illumination is received at the detector element. As the relative phase delays between these virtual illumination sources are changing over the photo-integration time period of each image detection element, these virtual sources are effectively rendered temporally incoherent with each other. On a time-average basis, these time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of the image detection elements, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed thereat. As speckle-noise patterns are roughly uncorrelated at the image detection array, the reduction in speckle-noise power should be proportional to the square root of the number of independent virtual laser illumination sources contributing to the illumination of the target object and formation of the images frame thereof. As a result of the present invention, image-based bar code symbol decoders and\/or OCR processors operating on such digital images can be processed with significant reductions in error.","The third generalized method above can be explained in terms of Fourier Transform optics. When temporal intensity modulating the transmitted PLIB by a periodic or random temporal phase modulation function (TPMF), while satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above, a temporal phase modulation process occurs on the temporal domain. This temporal phase modulation process is equivalent to mathematically multiplying the transmitted PLIB by the temporal phase modulation function. This multiplication process on the temporal domain is equivalent on the temporal-frequency domain to the convolution of the Fourier Transform of the temporal phase modulation function with the Fourier Transform of the composite PLIB. On the temporal-frequency domain, this convolution process generates temporally-incoherent (i.e. statistically-uncorrelated or independent) spectral components which are permitted to spatially-overlap at each detection element of the image detection array (i.e. on the spatial domain) and produce time-varying speckle-noise patterns which are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of each detector element, to reduce the speckle-noise pattern observed at the image detection array.","In general, various types of spatial light modulation techniques can be used to carry out the third generalized method including, for example: an optically resonant cavity (i.e. etalon device) affixed to external portion of each VLD; a phase-only LCD (PO-LCD) temporal intensity modulation panel; and fiber optical arrays. Several of these temporal phase modulation mechanisms will be described in detail below.","Electrically-Passive Optical Apparatus of the Present Invention for Temporal Phase Modulating the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) Prior to Target Object Illumination Employing Photon Trapping, Delaying and Releasing Principles within an Optically-Reflective Cavity (i.e. Etalon) Externally Affixed to Each Visible Laser Diode within the Planar Laser Illumination Array (PLIA)","In FIGS. IA through IB, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a PLIA A, B with a refractive-type cylindrical lens array  (e.g. operating according to refractive, diffractive and\/or reflective principles) supported within frame , and an electrically-passive temporal phase modulation device (i.e. etalon)  realized as an external optically reflective cavity) affixed to each VLD  of the PLIA A, B.","The primary principle of this temporal phase modulation technique is to delay portions of the laser light (i.e. photons) emitted by each laser diode  by times longer than the inherent temporal coherence length of the laser diode. In this embodiment, this is achieved by employing photon trapping, delaying and releasing principles within an optically reflective cavity. Typical laser diodes have a coherence length of a few centimeters (cm). Thus, if some of the laser illumination can be delayed by the time of flight of a few centimeters, then it will be incoherent with the original laser illumination. The electrically-passive device  shown in FIG. IB can be realized by a pair of parallel, reflective surfaces (e.g. plates, films or layers) A and B, mounted to the output of each VLD  in the PLIA A, B. If one surface is essentially totally reflective (e.g. 97% reflective) and the other about 94% reflective, then about 3% of the laser illumination (i.e. photons) will escape the device through the partially reflective surface of the device on each round trip. The laser illumination will be delayed by the time of flight for one round trip between the plates. If the plates A and B are separated by a space  of several centimeters length, then this delay will be greater than the coherence time of the laser source. In the illustrative embodiment of FIGS. IA and IB, the emitted light (i.e. photons) will make about thirty (30) trips between the plates. This has the effect of mixing thirty (30) photon distribution samples from the laser source, each sample residing outside the coherence time thereof, thus destroying or substantially reducing the temporal coherence of the laser beams produced from the laser illumination sources in the PLIA of the present invention. A primary advantage of this technique is that it employs electrically-passive components which might be manufactured relatively inexpensively in a mass-production environment. Suitable components for constructing such electrically-passive temporal phase modulation devices  can be obtained from various commercial vendors.","During operation, the transmitted PLIB  is temporal phase modulated according to a (random or periodic) temporal phase modulation function (TPMF) so that the phase along the wavefront of the PLIB is modulated and numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns are produced at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof.

Preferably, the output end of the fiber optic array is optically coupled to the cylindrical lens array to minimize optical losses during PLIB propagation from the FOA through the cylindrical lens array.","During system operation, the FOA  modulates the temporal phase along the wavefront of the PLIB by introducing (i.e. causing) different phase delays along different phase control points along the PLIB wavefront, and these phase delays are greater than the coherence length of the VLDs employed in the PLIA. The cylindrical lens array optically combines numerous phase-delayed PLIB subcomponents and projects them onto the same points on the surface of the object being illuminated, causing such points to be illuminated by a temporal coherence reduced PLIB. This illumination process results in producing numerous substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns at the image detection array (of the accompanying IFD subsystem) during the photo-integration time period thereof. These time-varying speckle-noise patterns are temporally and possibly spatially averaged thereover, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","In the case of optical system of FIG. IC, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array during each photo-integration time period thereof: (i) the number and diameter of the optical fibers employed in the FOA; (ii) the amount of phase delay introduced by fiber optical element, in comparison to the coherence length of the corresponding VLD; (iii) the spatial period of the cylindrical lens array; (iv) the number of temporal phase control points along the PLIB; and (v) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system. Parameters (1) through (v) will factor into the specification of the temporal phase modulation function (TPMF) of this speckle-noise reduction subsystem design. In general, if the system requires an increase in reduction in the RMS power of speckle-noise at its image detection array, then the system must generate more uncorrelated time-varying speckle-noise patterns for averaging over each photo-integration time period thereof. Adjustment of the above-described parameters should enable the designer to achieve the degree of speckle-noise power reduction desired in the application at hand.","For a desired reduction in speckle-noise pattern power in the system of FIG. IC, the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise pattern samples which need to be generated per each photo-integration time interval of the image detection array can be experimentally determined without undue experimentation. However, for a particular degree of speckle-noise power reduction, it is expected that the lower threshold for this sample number at the image detection array can be expressed mathematically in terms of (i) the time derivative of the temporal phase modulated PLIB, and (ii) the photo-integration time period of the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","Fourth Generalized Method of Speckle-Noise Pattern Reduction and Particular Forms of Apparatus Therefor Based on Reducing the Temporal Coherence of the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) before It Illuminates the Target Object by Applying Temporal Frequency Modulation Techniques During the Transmission of the PLIB Towards the Target","Referring to FIGS.

This generalized method is based on the principle of temporal frequency modulating the \u201ctransmitted\u201d planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) prior to illuminating a target object therewith so that the object is illuminated with a temporally coherent reduced planar laser beam and, as a result, numerous time-varying (random) speckle-noise patterns are produced and detected over the photo-integration time period of the image detection array (in the IFD subsystem), thereby allowing these speckle-noise patterns to be temporally averaged and\/or spatially averaged and the observable speckle-noise pattern reduced. This method can be practiced with any of the PLIM-based systems of the present invention disclosed herein, as well as any system constructed in accordance with the general principles of the present invention.","As illustrated at Block A in FIG. IB, the first step of the fourth generalized method shown in FIGS.

As indicated at Block B in FIG. IB, the second step of the method involves temporally and spatially averaging the numerous substantially different speckle-noise patterns produced at the image detection array during the photo-integration time period thereof, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","When using the fourth generalized method, the target object is repeatedly illuminated with laser light apparently originating from different moments (i.e. virtual illumination sources) in time over the photo-integration period of each detector element in the linear image detection array of the PLIIM system, during which reflected laser illumination is received at the detector element. As the relative phase delays between these virtual illumination sources are changing over the photo-integration time period of each image detection element, these virtual illumination sources are effectively rendered temporally incoherent with each other. On a time-average basis, these virtual illumination sources produce time-varying speckle-noise patterns which are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of the image detection elements, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed thereat. As speckle-noise patterns are roughly uncorrelated at the image detection array, the reduction in speckle-noise power should be proportional to the square root of the number of independent virtual laser illumination sources contributing to the illumination of the target object and formation of the images frame thereof. As a result of the present invention, image-based bar code symbol decoders and\/or OCR processors operating on such digital images can be processed with significant reductions in error.","The fourth generalized method above can be explained in terms of Fourier Transform optics. When temporal intensity modulating the transmitted PLIB by a periodic or random temporal frequency modulation function (TFMF), while satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above, a temporal frequency modulation process occurs on the temporal domain. This temporal modulation process is equivalent to mathematically multiplying the transmitted PLIB by the temporal frequency modulation function. This multiplication process on the temporal domain is equivalent on the temporal-frequency domain to the convolution of the Fourier Transform of the temporal frequency modulation function with the Fourier Transform of the composite PLIB. On the temporal-frequency domain, this convolution process generates temporally-incoherent (i.e. statistically-uncorrelated or independent) spectral components which are permitted to spatially-overlap at each detection element of the image detection array (i.e. on the spatial domain) and produce time-varying speckle-noise patterns which are temporally and spatially averaged during the photo-integration time period of each detector element, to reduce the speckle-noise pattern observed at the image detection array.","In general, various types of spatial light modulation techniques can be used to carry out the third generalized method including, for example: junction-current control techniques for periodically inducing VLDs into a mode of frequency hopping, using thermal feedback; and multi-mode visible laser diodes (VLDs) operated just above their lasing threshold. Several of these temporal frequency modulation mechanisms will be described in detail below.","Electro-Optical Apparatus of the Present Invention for Temporal Frequency Modulating the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) Prior to Target Object Illumination Employing Drive-Current Modulated Visible Laser Diodes (VLDs)","In FIGS. IA and IB, there is shown an optical assembly  for use in any PLIIM-based system of the present invention. As shown, the optical assembly  comprises a stationary cylindrical lens array  (e.g. operating according to refractive, diffractive and\/or reflective principles), supported in a frame  and mounted in front of a PLIA A, B embodying a plurality of drive-current modulated visible laser diodes (VLDs) . In accordance with the second generalized method of the present invention, each VLD  is driven in a non-linear manner by an electrical time-varying current produced by a high-speed VLD drive current modulation circuit , In the illustrative embodiment, the VLD drive current modulation circuit  is supplied with DC power from a DC power source  and operated under the control of camera control computer . The VLD drive current supplied to each VLD effectively modulates the amplitude of the output laser beam . Preferably, the depth of amplitude modulation (AM) of each output laser beam will be close to 100% in order to increase the magnitude of the higher order spectral harmonics generated during the AM process. As mentioned above, increasing the rate of change of the amplitude modulation of the laser beam will result in higher order optical components in the composite PLIB.","In alternative embodiments, the high-speed VLD drive current modulation circuit  can be operated (under the control of camera control computer  or other programmed microprocessor) so that the VLD drive currents generated by VLD drive current modulation circuit  periodically induce \u201cspectral mode-hopping\u201d within each VLD numerous time during each photo-integration time interval of the PLIIM-based system. This will cause each VLD to generate multiple spectral components within each photo-integration time period of the image detection array.","Optionally, the optical assembly  may further comprise a VLD temperature controller , operably connected to the camera controller , and a plurality of temperature control elements  mounted to each VLD. The function of the temperature controller  is to control the junction temperature of each VLD. The camera control computer  can be programmed to control both VLD junction temperature and junction current so that each VLD is induced into modes of spectral hopping for a maximal percentage of time during the photo-integration time period of the image detector. The result of such spectral mode hopping is to cause temporal frequency modulation of the transmitted PLIB , thereby enabling the generation of numerous time-varying speckle-noise patterns at the image detection array, and the temporal and spatial averaging of these patterns during the photo-integration time period of the array to reduce the RMS power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detection array.","Notably, in some embodiments, it may be preferred that the cylindrical lens array  be realized using light diffractive optical materials so that each spectral component within the transmitted PLIB will be diffracted at slightly different angles dependent on its optical wavelength, causing the PLIB to undergo micro-movement during target illumination operations. In some applications, such as the one shown in FIGS. IM and IM, such wavelength dependent movement can be used to modulate the spatial phase of the PLIB wavefront along directions either within the plane of the PLIB or orthogonal thereto, depending on how the diffractive-type cylindrical lens array is designed. In such applications, both temporal frequency modulation and spatial phase modulation of the PLIB wavefront would occur, thereby creating a hybrid-type despeckling scheme.","Electro-Optical Apparatus of the Present Invention for Temporal Frequency Modulating the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) Prior to Target Object Illumination Employing Multi Mode Visible Laser Diodes (VLDs) Operated Just above Their Lasing Threshold","In FIGS.

Thus, if a particular imaging application at hand requites a very short photo-integration time period, then it is understood that the rate of repetition of the light transmission window of the TIMP (and thus the rate of switching\/gating electro-optical panel ) will necessarily become higher in order to generate sufficiently weighted spectral components on the time-frequency domain required to reduce the temporal coherence of the received PLIB falling incident at the image detection array.","In the case of the optical system of FIG. IC, the following parameters will influence the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise patterns generated at the image detection array during each photo-integration time period thereof: (i) the time duration of the light transmission window of the TIMF realized by temporal intensity modulation panel ; (ii) the rate of repetition of the light duration window of the TIMF; and (iii) the number of real laser illumination sources employed in each planar laser illumination array in the PLIIM-based system. Parameters (i) through (ii) will factor into the specification of the TIMF of this speckle-noise reduction subsystem design. In general, if the PLIIM-based system requires an increase in reduction in the RMS power of speckle-noise at its image detection array, then the system must generate more uncorrelated time-varying speckle-noise patterns for averaging over each photo-integration time period thereof. Adjustment of the above-described parameters should enable the designer to achieve the degree of speckle-noise power reduction desired in the application at hand.","For a desired reduction in speckle-noise pattern power in the system of FIG. IC, the number of substantially different time-varying speckle-noise pattern samples which need to be generated per each photo-integration time interval of the image detection array can be experimentally determined without undue experimentation. However, for a particular degree of speckle-noise power reduction, it is expected that the lower threshold for this sample number at the image detection array can be expressed mathematically in terms of (i) the time derivative of the temporal phase modulated PLIB, and (ii) the photo-integration time period of the image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","While the speckle-noise pattern reduction (i.e. despeckling) techniques described above have been described in conjunction with the system of  for purposes of illustration, it is understood that that any of these techniques can be used in conjunction with any of the PLIIM-based systems of the present invention, and are hereby embodied therein by reference thereto as if fully explained in conjunction with its structure, function and operation.","Eighth Generalized Method of Speckle-Noise Pattern Reduction and Particular Forms of Apparatus Therefor Applied at the Image Formation and Detection Subsystem of a Hand-Held (Linear or Area Type) PLIIM-Based Imager of the Present Invention, Based on Temporally Averaging Many Speckle-Pattern Noise Containing Images Captured Over Numerous Photo-Integration Time Periods","Referring to FIGS. ID through IH, the eighth generalized method of speckle-noise pattern reduction and particular forms of apparatus therefor will be described. This generalized method is illustrated in the flow chart of FIG. ID. As shown in the flow chart of FIG. ID, the method involves performing the following steps: at Block A, consecutively capturing and buffering a series of digital images of an object, containing speckle-pattern noise, over a series of consecutively different photo-integration time periods; at Block B, storing these digital images in buffer memory; and at Block C, additively combining and averaging spatially corresponding pixel data subsets defined over a small window in the captured digital images so as to produce spatially corresponding pixels data subsets in a reconstructed image of the object, containing speckle-pattern noise having a substantially reduced level of RMS power. This method can be practiced with any PLIIM-based system of the present invention including, for example, any of the hand-held (linear or area type) PLIIM-based imagers shown in FIGS. V, H, I, I, J, and E, as well as with conveyor, presentation, and other stationary-type PLIIM-based imagers. For purposes of illustration, this generalized method will be described in connection with a hand-held linear-type imager and also hand-held area-type imager of the present invention.","Speckle-Pattern Noise Reduction Method of FIG. ID, Carried Out within a Hand-Held Linear-Type PLIIM-Based Imager of the Present Invention","As illustrated at in FIG. IE the first step in the eighth generalized method involves sweeping a hand-held linear-type PLIIM-based imager over an object (e.g. 2-D bar code or other graphical indicia) to produce a series of consecutively captured digital 1-D (i.e. linear) images of an object over a series of photo-integration time periods of the PLIIM-Based Imager. Notably, each digital linear image of the object includes a substantially different speckle-noise pattern which is produced by natural oscillatory micro-motion of the human hand relative to the object during manual sweeping operations of the hand-held imager, and\/or the forced oscillatory micro-movement of the hand-held imager relative to the object during manual sweeping operations of the hand-held imager. Once captured, these digital images are stored in buffer memory within the hand-held linear imager.","Natural oscillatory micro-motion of the human hand relative to the object during manual sweeping operations of the hand-held imager will produce slight motion to the imager relative to the object. For example, when using a PLIIM-based imager having a linear image detector with 14 micron wide pixels, an angular movement of the hand-supported housing by an amount of 0.5 millirad will cause the image of the object to shift by approximately one pixel, although it is understood that this amount of shift may vary depending on the object distance. Similarly, displacement of the hand-held imager by 14 microns will cause the image of the object to shift by one pixel as well. By virtue of these small shifts at the image plane, an entirely different speckle pattern will be induced in each digital image. Therefore, even though the consecutively captured images will be equally noisy in terms of speckle, the noise that is produced will originate from speckle patterns that are statistically independent from one another.","Notably, forced oscillatory micro-movement of the hand-held imager shown in FIG. IE can also be used to produce are statistically independent speckle-noise patterns in consecutively generated images. Such forced oscillatory micro-movement can be achieved by providing within the housing of the hand-held imager, an electromechanical mechanism which is designed to cause the optical bench of the PLIIM-based engine therein to micro-oscillate in both x and y directions during imaging operations. The mechanism should be engineered so that the amplitude of such micro-oscillations cause each captured image to shift by one or more pixels, and the small shifts produced at the image plane induce an entirely different speckle pattern in each captured image.","As illustrated at FIG. IF, the third step in the eighth generalized method involves using a relatively small (e.g. 3\u00d73) windowed image processing filter to additively combine and average the pixel data in the series of consecutively captured digital linear images so as to produce a reconstructed digital linear image having a speckle noise pattern with reduced RMS power. As an alternative to the use of standard averaging techniques described above, one may use other pixel data filtering techniques based possibility on reiterative principles to generate the pixel data constituting the reconstructed digital linear image with reduced speckle-pattern noise power. Such pixel data filtering, techniques may be derived from or carried out using software-based speckle-noise reduction tools employed in conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ultrasonic image processing systems described, for example, in Chapter 6 of \u201cUnderstanding Synthetic Aperture Radar Images,\u201d by Chris Oliver and Shaun Quegan, published by Artech House Publishers, ISBN 0-89006-850-X, incorporated herein by reference.","Speckle-Pattern Noise Reduction Method of FIG. ID, Carried Out within a Hand-Held Area-Type PLIIM-Based Imager of the Present Invention","As illustrated at in FIG.

Notably, this generalized method can be practiced at the camera (i.e. IFD) subsystem of virtually any type PLIIM-based imager of the present invention, but will be as explained in detail hereinafter, is best applied in hand-supportable type PLIIM-based imagers as illustrated, for example, in FIGS. V, H, I, I, and J and .","As indicated at Block A in FIG. II, the first step in the ninth generalized method involves producing, during each photo-integration time period of a PLIIM-Based Imager, numerous substantially different spatially-varying speckle noise pattern elements (i.e. different speckle noise pattern elements located on different points) on each image detection element in the image detection array employed in the PLIIM-based Imager. Then at Block B in FIG. II, the second step of the method involves spatially (and temporally) averaging the numerous spatially-varying speckle-noise pattern elements over the entire available surface area of each image detection element during the photo-integration time period thereof, thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-pattern noise observed in said linear PLIIM-based Imager.","This generalized method is based on the principle of producing numerous spatially and temporally varying (random) speckle-noise patterns over each photo-integration time period of the image detection array (in the IFD subsystem), using any of the eight generalized methods described above. Then during each photo-integration time period, these spatially-varying (and temporally varying) speckle-noise patterns are spatially (and temporally) averaged over the surface area of each image detection element in the image detection array so that RMS power of observable speckle-noise patterns is significantly reduced, In general, this method can be used by itself, although it is expected that better results will be obtained when the method is practiced with other generalized methods of the present invention. Below, the theoretical principles underlying this generalized despeckling method will be described below.","In the case where the minimum speckle size is roughly equal to the typical speckle size in a PLIIM-based linear imaging system, the typical speckle size is given by the equation d=(1.22)(\u03bb)(F\/# of the IFD module). Based on this assumption, the speckle pattern noise process occurring in a linear-type PLIIM-based systems can be modeled by applying a one-dimensional analysis across the narrow dimension of each image detection element extending along the linear extent of a linear CCD image detection array. Using a simple sinusoidal approximation to the speckle intensity variation, a simple estimate of the Peak Speckle Noise Percentage is given by the equation: \n\n\nwhere H is the height of each detector element in the linear image detection array employed in the linear PLIIM-based imaging system. Notably, the accuracy of the above equation significantly decreases around or below the operating condition where H\/d=1, (i.e. where the size of the speckle noise pattern element is equal to the size of the detector element in the linear image detection array employed in the linear PLIIM-based imaging system). Thus, the above model best holds for the case where the size of each speckle noise pattern element is smaller than the size of each detector element in the linear image detection array.\n","From the above equation, it is important to note that the Peak Speckle Noise Percentage in a linear PLIIM-based imaging system equation is directly proportional to the F\/# of the IFD module (i.e. camera subsystem) and inversely proportional to the height of the detector elements H. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to reduce the peak speckle noise percentage (as well as the RMS value thereof) in linear type PLIIM-based imaging systems by (i) reducing the F\/# parameter of its IFD module (e.g. by increasing the camera aperture), or (ii) increasing the height H of each detector element in the linear image detection array employed in the PLIIM-based system. The effect of implementing such design criteria in a linear PLIIM-based system is that it will cause more individual speckles to occur on the same image detection element (corresponding to a particular image pixel) during each photo-integration time period of the linear PLIIM-based system, thereby enabling a significantly increased level of spatial averaging to occur in such systems employing image detection arrays having vertically-elongated image detection elements, as shown in  and elsewhere throughout the present disclosure. To further appreciate this discovery, several PLIIM-based system designs will be considered below.","For the case of a hand-supportable PLIIM-based linear imager as disclosed in  in particular, consider that the F\/# is 40 and laser illumination wavelength is 650 nm. In such system designs, the Peak Speckle Noise Percentage is 18% when the height H of the detector elements in the image detection array is 56 um. However, the Peak Speckle Noise Percentage is significantly reduced 5% when the height H of the detector elements in the image detection array is 200 um. While these speckle noise calculation figures have not yet been matched with empirical measurements (and may be difficult to verify due to other factors present), the relative differences in such speckle noise figures should hold.","For the case of an overhead-mounted conveyor belt PLIIM-based linear imager as disclosed in  in particular, consider using F\/7 and H\/d=1.26. In such system designs, the Peak Speckle Noise Percentage is 25% when the height H of the detector elements in the linear image detection array is 7 um. However, to reduce the Peak Speckle Noise Percentage 5% will require that the height H of the detector elements in the linear image detection array be increased to 35 microns, sacrificing a great deal of image resolution in the object-motion direction.","Thus, from this analysis, it appears that the spatial-averaging based despeckling method described above (involving elongation of the detector element height H in the linear image detection array) will be difficult to practice in high-speed overhead conveyor-type imaging applications where image resolution is a key requirement, but easy to practice in hand-supportable linear imaging applications described above.","In summary, when designing and constructing a linear-type PLIIM-based imaging system, the principles of the present invention disclosed herein teach choosing (i) a linear image detection array having the tallest possible image detection elements (i.e. having the greatest possible H value) and (ii) image formation optics in the IFD (i.e. camera) subsystem having the lowest possible F\/# that does not go so far as to increase the aberrations of the linear-type PLIIM-based imaging system to a point of diminishing returns by blurring the optical signal received thereby. Such design considerations will help to minimize the RMS power of speckle-pattern noise observable at the image detection array employed in PLIIM-based imaging systems. Notably, one advantage in using this despeckling technique in linear-type PLIIM-based systems is that increasing the height or vertical dimension of the image detection elements in the linear image detection array will not adversely effect the resolution of the PLIIM-based system. In contrast, when applying this despeckling technique in area (i.e. 2-D) type PLIIM-based imaging systems, increasing any one of the image detection element dimensions H and\/or W to reduce speckle-pattern noise (through spatial averaging) will reduce the image resolution achievable by the 2-D PLIIM-based imaging system.","In each of the hand-supportable PLIIM-based imaging systems shown in FIGS. IA through IN and described below, the ninth generalized (spatial-averaging) despeckling technique is applied by employing a linear image detection array with vertically-elongated detection elements having a height dimension H that results in a significant reduction in the speckle noise power. Also, an additional despeckling mechanism is embodied within each such PLIIM-based imaging system as will be described in greater detail below.","PLIIM-Based System with an Integrated Speckle-Pattern Noise Reduction Subsystem, Wherein a Micro-Oscillating Cylindrical Lens Array Micro-Oscillates a Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB Laterally Along its Planar Extent to Produce Spatial-Incoherent PLIB Components and Optically Combines and Projects Said Spatially-Incoherent PLIB Component Onto the Same Points on an Object to be Illuminated, and Wherein a Micro-Oscillating Light Reflecting Structure Micro-Oscillates the PLIB Components Transversely Along the Direction Orthogonal to Said Planar Extent, and a Linear (1D) CCD Image Detection Array with Vertically-Elongated Image Detection Elements Detects Time-Varying Speckle-Noise Patterns Produced by the Spatially Incoherence Components Reflected\/Scattered Off the Illuminated Object","In FIGS.

For example, using this technique, the PLIB  can be made to undergo micro-movement along the transverse direction (or planar extent of the PLIB) during target illumination operations. Therefore, such wavelength-dependent PLIB movement can be used to modulate the spatial phase of the PLIB wavefront along directions extending either within the plane of the PLIB or along a direction orthogonal thereto, depending on how the diffractive-type cylindrical lens array is designed. In such applications, both temporal frequency modulation as well as spatial phase modulation of the PLIB wavefront would occur, thereby creating a hybrid-type despeckling scheme.","Advantages of Using Linear Image Detection Arrays Having Vertically-Elongated Image Detection Elements","If the heights of the PLIB and the FOV of the linear image detection array are comparable in size in a PLIIM-based system, then only a slight misalignment of the PLIB and the FOV is required to displace the PLIB from the FOV, rendering a dark image at the image detector in the PLIIM-based system. To use this PLIB\/FOV alignment technique successfully, the mechanical parts required for positioning the CCD linear image sensor and the VLDs of the PLIA must be extremely rugged in construction, which implies additional size, weight, and cost of manufacture.","The PLIB\/FOV misalignment problem described above can be solved using the PLIIM-based imaging engine design shown in FIGS. IA through IN. In this novel design, the linear image detector  with its vertically-elongated image detection elements  is used in conjunction with a PLIB having a height that is substantially smaller than the height dimension of the magnified field of view (FOV) of each image detection element in the linear image detector . This condition between the PLIB and the FOV reduces the tolerance on the degree of alignment that must be maintained between the FOV of the linear image sensor and the plane of the PLIB during planar laser illumination and imaging operations. It also avoids the need to increase the output power of the VLDs in the PLIA, which might either cause problems from a safety and laser class standpoint, or require the use of more powerful VLDs which are expensive to procure and require larger heat sinks to operate properly. Thus, using the PLIIM-based imaging engine design shown in FIGS. IA through IN, the PLIB and FOV thereof can move slightly with respect to each other during system operation without \u201cloosing alignment\u201d because the FOV of the image detection elements spatially encompasses the entire PLIB, while providing significant spatial tolerances on either side of the PLIB. By the term \u201calignment\u201d, it is understood that the FOV of the image detection array and the principal plane of the PLIB sufficiently overlap over the entire width and depth of object space (i.e. working distance) such that the image obtained is bright enough to be useful in whatever application at hand (e.g. bar code decoding, OCR software processing, etc.).","A notable advantage derived when using this PLIB\/FOV alignment method is that no sacrifice in laser intensity is required. In fact, because the FOV is guaranteed to receive all of the laser light from the illuminating PLIB, whether stationary or moving relative to the target object, the total output power of the PLIB may be reduced if necessary or desired in particular applications.","In the illustrative embodiments described above, each PLIIM-based system is provided with an integrated despeckling mechanism, although it is clearly understood that the PLIB\/FOV alignment method described above can be practiced with or without such despeckling techniques.","In a first illustrative embodiment, the PLIB\/FOV alignment method may be practiced using a linear CCD image detection array (i.e. sensor) with, for example, 10 micron tall image detection elements (i.e. pixels) and image forming optics having a magnification factor of say, for example, 15\u00d7. In this first illustrative embodiment, the height of the FOV of the image detection elements on the target object would be about 150 microns. In order for the height of the PLIB to be significantly smaller than this FOV height dimension, e.g. by a factor of five, the height of the PLIB would have to be focused to about 30 microns.","In a second alternative embodiment, using a linear CCD image detector with image detection elements having a 200 micron height dimension and equivalent optics (having a magnification factor 15\u00d7), the height dimension for the FOV would be 3000 microns. In this second alternative embodiment, a PLIB focused to 750 microns (rather than 30 microns in the first illustrative embodiment above) would provide the same amount of return signal at the linear image detector, but with angular tolerances which are almost 20 times as large as those obtained in the first illustrative embodiment. In view of the fact that it can be quite difficult to focus a planarized laser beam to a few microns thickness over an extended depth of field, the second illustrative embodiment would be preferred over the first illustrative embodiment.","In view of the fact that linear CCD image detectors with 200 micron tall image detection elements are generally commercially available in lengths of only one or two thousand image detection elements (i.e. pixels), the PLIB\/FOV alignment method described above would be best applicable to PLIIM-based hand-held imaging applications as illustrated, for example, in FIGS. IA through IN. In view of the fact that most industrial-type imaging systems require linear image sensors having six to eight thousand image detection elements, the PLIB\/FOV alignment method illustrated in FIG. B would be best applicable to PLIIM-based conveyor-mounted\/industrial imaging systems as illustrated, for example, in . Depending on the optical path lengths required in the PLIIM-based POS imaging systems shown in , either of these PLIB\/FOV alignment methods may be used with excellent results.","Second Alternative Embodiment of the PLIIM-Based System of the Present Invention Shown in ","In FIG. Q, the second illustrative embodiment of the PLIIM-based system of , indicated by reference numeral B, is shown comprising: a 1-D type image formation and detection (IFD) module \u2032, as shown in FIG. B; and a pair of planar laser illumination arrays A and B. As shown, these arrays A and B are arranged in relation to the image formation and detection module  so that the field of view thereof is oriented in a direction that is coplanar with the planes of laser illumination produced by the planar illumination arrays, without using any laser beam or field of view folding mirrors.

B through U are ideal for applications in which there is little variation in the object distance, such as in a conveyor-type bottom scanner applications. As such scanning systems employ a fixed focal length imaging lens, the image resolution requirements of such applications must be examined carefully to determine that the image resolution obtained is suitable for the intended application. Because the object distance is approximately constant for a bottom scanner application (i.e. the bar code almost always is illuminated and imaged within the same object plane), the dpi resolution of acquired images will be approximately constant. As image resolution is not a concern in this type of scanning applications, variable focal length (zoom) control is unnecessary, and a fixed focal length imaging lens should suffice and enable good results.","A fixed focal distance PLIIM system generally takes up less space than a variable or dynamic focus model because more advanced focusing methods require more complicated optics and electronics, and additional components such as motors. For this reason, fixed focus PLIIM-based systems are good choices for handheld and presentation scanners as indicated in , wherein space and weight are always critical characteristics. In these applications, however, the object distance can vary over a range from several to a twelve or more inches, and so the designer must exercise care to ensure that the scanner's depth of field (DOF) alone will be sufficient to accommodate all possible variations in target object distance and orientation. Also, because a fixed focus imaging subsystem implies a fixed focal length camera lens, the variation in object distance implies that the dots per inch resolution of the image will vary as well. The focal length of the imaging lens must be chosen so that the angular width of the field of view (FOV) is narrow enough that the dpi image resolution will not fall below the minimum acceptable value anywhere within the range of object distances supported by the PLIIM-based system.","Second Generalized Embodiment of the Planar Laser Illumination and Electronic Imaging System of the Present Invention","The second generalized embodiment of the PLIIM-based system of the present invention  is illustrated in FIGS.

During system operation, laser illumination arrays A and B each produce a planar beam of laser illumination \u2032 which synchronously moves and is disposed substantially coplanar with the field of view (FOV) of the image formation and detection module \u2032, so as to scan a bar code symbol or other graphical structure  disposed stationary within a 3-D scanning region.","As shown in FIGS.

A disadvantage to this type of imaging lens is that the resolution of the image that is acquired, in terms of pixels or dots per inch, varies as a function of the distance from the target object to the imaging lens.

Preferably, the chassis assembly should provide for easy and secure alignment of all optical components employed in the planar laser illumination arrays A and B as well as the image formation and detection module \u2032, as well as be easy to manufacture, service and repair. Also, this generalized PLIIM-based system embodiment  employs the general \u201cplanar laser illumination\u201d and \u201cfocus beam at farthest object distance (FBAFOD)\u201d principles described above. Various illustrative embodiments of this generalized PLIIM-based system will be described below.","An image formation and detection (IFD) module  having an imaging lens with variable focal distance, as employed in the PLIIM-based system of , can adjust its image distance to compensate for a change in the target's object distance; thus, at least some of the component lens elements in the imaging subsystem are movable, and the depth of field of the imaging subsystems does not limit the ability of the imaging subsystem to accommodate possible object distances and orientations. A variable focus imaging subsystem is able to move its components in such a way as to change the image distance of the imaging lens to compensate for a change in the target's object distance, thus preserving good focus no matter where the target object might be located. Variable focus can be accomplished in several ways, namely: by moving lens elements; moving imager detector\/sensor; and dynamic focus. Each of these different methods will be summarized below for sake of convenience.","Use of Moving Lens Elements in the Image Formation and Detection Module","The imaging subsystem in this generalized PLIIM-based system embodiment can employ an imaging lens which is made up of several component lenses contained in a common lens barrel. A variable focus type imaging lens such as this can move one or more of its lens elements in order to change the effective distance between the lens and the image sensor, which remains stationary. This change in the image distance compensates for a change in the object distance of the target object and keeps the return light in focus. The position at which the focusing lens element(s) must be in order to image light returning from a target object at a given object distance is determined by consulting a lookup table, which must be constructed ahead of time, either experimentally or by design software, well known in the optics art.","Use of an Moving Image Detection Array in the Image Formation and Detection Module","The imaging subsystem in this generalized PLIIM-based system embodiment can be constructed so that all the lens elements remain stationary, with the imaging detector\/sensor array being movable relative to the imaging lens so as to change the image distance of the imaging subsystem. The position at which the image detector\/sensor must be located to image light returning from a target at a given object distance is determined by consulting a lookup table, which must be constructed ahead of time, either experimentally or by design software, well known in the art.","Use of Dynamic Focal Distance Control in the Image Formation and Detection Module","The imaging subsystem in this generalized PLIIM-based system embodiment can be designed to embody a \u201cdynamic\u201d form of variable focal distance (i.e. focus) control, which is an advanced form of variable focus control. In conventional variable focus control schemes, one focus (i.e. focal distance) setting is established in anticipation of a given target object. The object is imaged using that setting, then another setting is selected for the next object image, if necessary. However, depending on the shape and orientation of the target object, a single target object may exhibit enough variation in its distance from the imaging lens to make it impossible for a single focus setting to acquire a sharp image of the entire object. In this case, the imaging subsystem must change its focus setting while the object is being imaged. This adjustment does not have to be made continuously; rather, a few discrete focus settings will generally be sufficient. The exact number will depend on the shape and orientation of the package being imaged and the depth of field of the imaging subsystem used in the IFD module.","It should be noted that dynamic focus control is only used with a linear image detection\/sensor array, as used in the system embodiments shown in FIGS. A through J. The reason for this limitation is quite clear: an area-type image detection array captures an entire image after a rapid number of exposures to the planar laser illumination beam, and although changing the focus setting of the imaging subsystem might clear up the image in one part of the detector array, it would induce blurring in another region of the image, thus failing to improve the overall quality of the acquired image.","First Illustrative Embodiment of the PLIIM-Based System Shown in ","The first illustrative embodiment of the PLIIM-based system of , indicated by reference numeral A, is shown in FIG.

A zoom imaging lens is capable of changing its focal length, and therefore its angular field of view (FOV) by moving one or more of its component lens elements. The position at which the zooming lens element(s) must be in order to achieve a given focal length is determined by consulting a lookup table, which must be constructed ahead of time either experimentally or by design software, in a manner well known in the art. An advantage to using a zoom lens is that the resolution of the image that is acquired, in terms of pixels or dots per inch, remains constant no matter what the distance from the target object to the lens. However, a zoom camera lens is more difficult and more expensive to design and produce than the alternative, a fixed focal length camera lens.","The image formation and detection (IFD) module \u2033 in the PLIIM-based system of  also has an imaging lens B with variable focal distance, which can adjust its image distance to compensate for a change in the target's object distance. Thus, at least some of the component lens elements in the imaging subsystem B are movable, and the depth of field (DOF) of the imaging subsystem does not limit the ability of the imaging subsystem to accommodate possible object distances and orientations. This variable focus imaging subsystem B is able to move its components in such a way as to change the image distance of the imaging lens to compensate for a change in the target's object distance, thus preserving good image focus no matter where the target object might be located.

The second system of movable lenses  are designed to undergo relatively larger stepped movements relative to the first system of movable lenses  in automatic response to a second set of control signals D generated by the camera control computer  and transmitted to the second electrical motor .","Method of and Apparatus for Mounting a Linear Image Sensor Chip within a PLIIM-Based System to Prevent Misalignment between the Field of View (FOV) of Said Linear Image Sensor Chip and the Planar Laser Illumination Beam (PLIB) Used Therewith, in Response to Thermal Expansion or Cycling within Said PLIIM-Based System","When using a planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) to illuminate the narrow field of view (FOV) of a linear image detection array, even the smallest of misalignment errors between the FOV and the PLIB can cause severe errors in performance within the PLIIM-based system. Notably, as the working\/object distance of the PLIIM-based system is made longer, the sensitivity of the system to such FOV\/PLIB misalignment errors markedly increases. One of the major causes of such FOV\/PLIB misalignment errors is thermal cycling within the PLIIM-based system. As materials used within the PLIIM-based system expand and contract in response to increases and decreases in ambient temperature, the physical structures which serve to maintain alignment between the FOV and PLIB move in relation to each other. If the movement between such structures becomes significant, then the PLIB may not illuminate the narrow field of view (FOV) of the linear image detection array, causing dark levels to be produced in the images captured by the system without planar laser illumination. In order to mitigate such misalignment problems, the camera subsystem (i.e. IFD module) of the present invention is provided with a novel linear image sensor chip mounting arrangement which helps maintain precise alignment between the FOV of the linear image sensor chip and the PLIB used to illuminate the same. Details regarding this mounting arrangement will be described below with reference to FIGS. D through D.","As shown in FIG. D, the camera subsystem further comprises: heat sinking structure  to which the linear image sensor chip A and camera body  are rigidly mounted; a camera PC electronics board  for supporting a socket  into which the linear image sensor chip A is connected, and providing all of the necessary functions required to operate the linear CCD image sensor chip A, and capture high-resolution linear digital images therefrom for buffering, storage and processing.","As best illustrated in FIG. D, the package of the image sensor chip A is rigidly mounted and thermally coupled to the back plate  of the heat sinking structure  by a releasable image sensor chip fixture subassembly  which is integrated with the heat sinking structure . The primary function of this image sensor chip fixture subassembly  is to prevent relative movement between the image sensor chip A and the heat sinking structure  and camera body  during thermal cycling within the PLIIM-based system. At the same time, the image sensor chip fixture subassembly  enables the electrical connector pins  of the image sensor chip to pass freely through four sets of apertures A through D formed through the back plate  of the heat sinking structure, as shown in FIG. D, and establish secure electrical connection with electrical contacts  contained within a matched electrical socket  mounted on the camera PC electronics board , shown in greater detail in FIG. D. As shown in FIGS. D and D, the camera PC electronics board  is mounted to the heat sinking structure  in a manner which permits relative expansion and contraction between the camera PC electronics board  and heat sinking structure  during thermal cycling. Such mounting techniques may include the use of screws or other fastening devices known in the art.","As shown in FIG. D, the releasable image sensor chip fixture subassembly  comprises a number of subcomponents integrated on the heat sinking structure , namely: a set of chip fixture plates , mounted at about 45 degrees with respect to the back plate  of the heat sinking structure, adapted to clamp one side edge of the package of the linear image sensor chip A as it is pushed down into chip mounting slot  (provided by clearing away a rectangular volume of space otherwise occupied by heat exchanging fins  protruding from the back plate ), and permit the electrical connector pins  extending from the image sensor chip A to pass freely through apertures A through D formed through the back plate ; and a set of spring-biased chip clamping pins A and B, mounted opposite the chip fixture plates A and B, for releasably clamping the opposite side of the package of the linear image sensor chip A when it is pushed down into place within the chip mounting slot , and securely and rigidly fixing the package of the linear image sensor chip A (and thus image detection elements therewithin) relative to the heat sinking structure  and thus the camera body  and all of the optical lens components supported therewithin.","As shown in FIG. D, when the linear image sensor chip A is mounted within its chip mounting slot , in accordance with the principles of the present invention, the electrical connector pins  of the image sensor chip are freely passed through the four sets of apertures A through D formed in the back plate of the heat sinking structure, while the image sensor chip package A is rigidly fixed to the camera system body, via its heat sinking structure. When so mounted, the image sensor chip A is not permitted to undergo any significant relative movement with respect to the heat sinking structure and camera body  during thermal cycling. However, the camera PC electronics board  may move relative to the heat sinking structure and camera body , in response to thermal expansion and contraction during cycling. The result is that the image sensor chip mounting technique of the present invention prevents any misalignment between the field of view (FOV) of the image sensor chip and the PLIA produced by the PLIA within the camera subsystem, thereby improving the performance of the PLIIM-based system during planar laser illumination and imaging operations.","Method of Adjusting the Focal Characteristics of the Planar Laser Illumination Beams (PLIBs) Generated by Planar Laser Illumination Arrays (PLIAs) Used in Conjunction with Image Formation and Detection (IFD) Modules Employing Variable Focal Length (Zoom) Imaging Lenses","Unlike the fixed focal length imaging lens case, there occurs a significant a 1\/rdrop-off in laser return light intensity at the image detection array when using a zoom (variable focal length) imaging lens in the PLIIM-based system hereof. In PLIIM-based system employing an imaging subsystem having a variable focal length imaging lens, the area of the imaging subsystem's field of view (FOV) remains constant as the working distance increases. Such variable focal length control is used to ensure that each image formed and detected by the image formation and detection (IFD) module \u2033 has the same number of \u201cdots per inch\u201d (DPI) resolution, regardless of the distance of the target object from the IFD module \u2033. However, since module's field of view does not increase in size with the object distance, equation (8) must be rewritten as the equation (10) set forth below \n\n\n","Therefore, in summary, where a variable focal length (i.e. zoom) imaging subsystem is employed in the PLIIM-based system, the planar laser beam focusing technique of the present invention described above helps compensate for (i) decreases in the power density of the incident illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases for increasing distances away from the imaging subsystem, and (ii) any 1\/rtype losses that would typically occur when using the planar laser planar illumination beam of the present invention.","Second Illustrative Embodiment of the PLIIM-Based System of the Present Invention Shown in ","The second illustrative embodiment of the PLIIM-based system of , indicated by reference numeral B, is shown in FIG. E as comprising: an image formation and detection module \u2033 having an imaging subsystem B with a variable focal length imaging tens, a variable focal distance and a variable field of view, and a linear array of photo-electronic detectors A realized using CCD technology (e.g. Piranha Model Nos.

ID for current control purposes) and a microcontroller  being provided for controlling the output optical power thereof; a stationary cylindrical lens array  mounted in front of each PLIA (A, B) and ideally integrated therewith, for optically combining the individual PLIB components produced from the PLIMs constituting the PLIA, and projecting the combined PLIB components onto points along the surface of the object being illuminated; linear-type image formation and detection module A; a field of view folding mirror \u2032 for folding the field of view of the image formation and detection module \u2033; an image frame grabber  operably connected to the linear-type image formation and detection module \u2033, for accessing 1-D images (i.e. 1-D digital image data sets) therefrom and building a 2-D digital image of the object being illuminated by the planar laser illumination arrays A and B; an image data buffer (e.g. VRAM)  for buffering 2-D images received from the image frame grabber ; an image processing computer . operably connected to the image data buffer , for carrying out image processing algorithms (including bar code symbol decoding algorithms) and operators on digital images stored within the image data buffer; and a camera control computer  operably connected to the various components within the system for controlling the operation thereof in an orchestrated manner.","FIG. E illustrates in greater detail the structure of the IFD module \u2033 used in the PLIIM-based system of FIG. E. As shown, the IFD module \u2033 comprises a variable focus variable focal length imaging subsystem B\u2033 and a 1-D image detecting array A mounted along an optical bench D contained within a common lens barrel (not shown). In general, the imaging subsystem B\u2033 comprises: a first group of focal lens elements A mounted stationary relative to the image detecting array A; a second group of lens elements B, functioning as a focal lens assembly, movably mounted along the optical bench in front of the first group of stationary lens elements A; and a third group of lens elements B, functioning as a zoom lens assembly, movably mounted between the second group of focal lens elements and the first group of stationary focal lens elements B. In a non-customized application, focal distance control can also be provided by moving the second group of focal lens elements B back and forth with translator C in response to a first set of control signals E generated by the camera control computer , while the 1-D image detecting array A remains stationary. Alternatively, focal distance control can be provided by moving the 1-D image detecting array A back and forth along the optical axis with translator C in response to a first set of control signals E generated by the camera control computer , while the second group of focal lens elements B remain stationary. For zoom control (i.e. variable focal length control), the focal lens elements in the third group B are typically moved relative to each other with translator C in response to a second set of control signals E generated by the camera control computer .

E through E","Referring now to FIGS. E through E, an exemplary realization of the PLIIM-based system, indicated by reference numeral B, shown in FIGS. E through E will now be described in detail below.","As shown in FIGS. E and E, an exemplary realization of the PLIIM-based system B shown in FIGS. E-E is indicated by reference numeral \u2032 contained within a compact housing  having height, length and width dimensions of about 4.5\u2033, 21.7\u2033 and 19.7\u2033, respectively, to enable easy mounting above a conveyor belt structure or the like. As shown in FIGS. E, E and E, the PLIIM-based system comprises a linear image formation and detection module \u2033, a pair of planar laser illumination arrays A, and B, and a field of view (FOV) folding structure (e.g. mirror, refractive element, or diffractive element) . The function of the FOV folding mirror  is to fold the field of view (FOV)  of the image formation and detection module \u2033 in an imaging direction that is coplanar with the plane of laser illumination beams (PLIBs) A and B produced by the planar illumination arrays A and B. As shown, these components are fixedly mounted to an optical bench  supported within the compact housing  so that these optical components are forced to oscillate together. The linear CCD imaging array A can be realized using a variety of commercially available high-speed line-scan camera systems such as, for example, the Piranha Model Nos. CT-P4, or CL-P4 High-Speed CCD Line Scan Camera, from Dalsa, Inc. USA\u2014http:\/\/www.dalsa.com. Notably, image frame grabber , image data buffer (e.g. VRAM) , image processing computer , and camera control computer  are realized on one or more printed circuit (PC) boards contained within a camera and system electronic module  also mounted on the optical bench, or elsewhere in the system housing .","As shown in FIG. E, a stationary cylindrical lens array  is mounted in front of each PLIA (A, B) adjacent the illumination window formed within the optics bench  of the PLIIM-based system \u2032. The function performed by cylindrical lens array  is to optically combine the individual PLIB components produced from the PLIMs constituting the PLIA, and project the combined PLIB components onto points along the surface of the object being illuminated. By virtue of this inventive feature, each point on the object surface being imaged will be illuminated by different sources of laser illumination located at different points in space (i.e. spatially coherent-reduced laser illumination), thereby reducing the RMS power of speckle-pattern noise observable at the linear image detection array of the PLIIM-based system.","While this system design requires additional optical surfaces (i.e. planar laser beam folding mirrors) which complicates laser-beam\/FOV alignment, and attenuates slightly the intensity of collected laser return light, this system design will be beneficial when the FOV of the imaging subsystem cannot have a large apex angle, as defined as the angular aperture of the imaging lens (in the zoom lens assembly), due to the fact that the IFD module \u2033 must be mounted on the optical bench in a backed-off manner to the conveyor belt (or maximum object distance plane), and a longer focal length lens (or zoom lens with a range of longer focal lengths) is chosen.","One notable advantage of this system design is that it enables a construction having an ultra-low height profile suitable, for example, in unitary object identification and attribute acquisition systems of the type disclosed in , wherein the image-based bar code symbol reader needs to be installed within a compartment (or cavity) of a housing having relatively low height dimensions. Also, in this system design, there is a relatively high degree of freedom provided in where the image formation and detection module \u2033 can be mounted on the optical bench of the system, thus enabling the field of view (FOV) folding technique disclosed in FIG. L to be practiced in a relatively easy manner.","As shown in FIG. E, the compact housing  has a relatively long light transmission window  of elongated dimensions for the projecting the FOV  of the image formation and detection module \u2033 through the housing towards a predefined region of space outside thereof, within which objects can be illuminated and imaged by the system components on the optical bench. Also, the compact housing  has a pair of relatively short light transmission apertures A and B, closely disposed on opposite ends of light transmission window , with minimal spacing therebetween, as shown in FIG. E. Such spacing is to ensure that the FOV emerging from the housing  can spatially overlap in a coplanar manner with the substantially planar laser illumination beams projected through transmission windows A and B, as close to transmission window  as desired by the system designer, as shown in FIGS. E and E. Notably, in some applications, it is desired for such coplanar overlap between the FOV and planar laser illumination beams to occur very close to the light transmission windows , A and B (i.e. at short optical throw distances), but in other applications, for such coplanar overlap to occur at large optical throw distances.","In either event, each planar laser illumination array A and B is optically isolated from the FOV of the image formation and detection module \u2033 to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system. In the preferred embodiment, such optical isolation is achieved by providing a set of opaque wall structures A, B about each planar laser illumination array, extending from the optical bench  to its light transmission window A or B, respectively. Such optical isolation structures prevent the image formation and detection module \u2033 from detecting any laser light transmitted directly from the planar laser illumination arrays A and B within the interior of the housing. Instead, the image formation and detection module \u2033 can only receive planar laser illumination that has been reflected off an illuminated object, and focused through the imaging subsystem B\u2033 of the IFD module \u2033.","Notably, the linear image formation and detection module of the PLIIM-based system of FIG. E has an imaging subsystem B\u2033 with a variable focal length imaging lens, a variable focal distance, and a variable field of view. In FIG. E, the spatial limits for the FOV of the image formation and detection module are shown for two different scanning conditions, namely: when imaging the tallest package moving on a conveyor belt structure; and when imaging objects having height values close to the surface of the conveyor belt structure. In a PLIIM system having a variable focal length imaging lens and a variable focusing mechanism, the PLIIM system would be capable of imaging at either of the two conditions indicated above.","In order that PLLIM-based subsystem \u2032 can be readily interfaced to and an integrated (e.g. embedded) within various types of computer-based systems, as shown in , subsystem \u2032 also comprises an I\/O subsystem  operably connected to camera control computer  and image processing computer , and a network controller  for enabling high-speed data communication with others computers in a local or wide area network using packet-based networking protocols (e.g. Ethernet, AppleTalk, etc.) well known in the art.","Third Illustrative Embodiment of the PLIIM-Based System of the Present Invention Shown in ","The third illustrative embodiment of the PLIIM-based system of , indicated by reference numeral C, is shown in FIG. F as comprising: an image formation and detection module \u2033 having an imaging subsystem B\u2033 with a variable focal length imaging lens, a variable focal distance and a variable field of view, and a linear array of photo-electronic detectors A realized using CCD technology (e.g. Piranha Model Nos.

Also this system design requires a more complicated beam\/FOV adjustment scheme than the direct-viewing design shown in FIG. B. Thus, this system design can be best used when the planar laser illumination beams do not have large apex angles to provide sufficiently uniform illumination. Notably, in this system embodiment, the PLIMs are mounted on the optical bench as far back as possible from the beam folding mirrors A and B, and cylindrical lenses  with larger radiuses will be employed in the design of each PLIM A through P.","As shown in FIG.

Thus, the image detection array D is ideally suited for use in hold-under type scanning systems However, the fact that the entire image is captured in a single exposure implies that the technique of dynamic focus cannot be used with an arean image detector.","As shown in FIG.

A through C are ideal for applications in which there is little variation in the object distance, such as in a 2-D hold-under scanner application as shown in  fixed focal distance PLIIM-based system generally takes up less space than a variable or dynamic focus model because more advanced focusing methods require more complicated optics and electronics, and additional components such as motors. For this reason, fixed focus PLIIM systems are good choices for the hands-free presentation and hand-held scanners applications illustrated in , respectively, wherein space and weight are always critical characteristics. In these applications, however, the object distance can vary over a range from several to twelve or more inches, and so the designer must exercise care to ensure that the scanner's depth of field (DOF) alone will be sufficient to accommodate all possible variations in target object distance and orientation. Also, because a fixed focus imaging subsystem implies a fixed focal length imaging lens, the variation in object distance implies that the dpi resolution of acquired images will vary as well, and therefore image-based bar code symbol decode-processing techniques must address such variations in image resolution. The focal length of the imaging lens must be chosen so that the angular width of the field of view (FOV) is narrow enough that the dpi image resolution will not fall below the minimum acceptable value anywhere within the range of object distances supported by the PLIIM system.","Eighth Generalized Embodiment of the PLIIM System of the Present Invention","The eighth generalized embodiment of the PLIIM system of the present invention  is illustrated in FIG.

While possible, this system configuration would be difficult to use when packages are moving by on a high-speed conveyor belt, as the planar laser illumination beams would have to sweep across the package very quickly to avoid blurring of the acquired images due to the motion of the package while the image is being acquired.

An advantage of this hybrid PLIIM-based system design is that it also enables the generation of a 3-D image-based scanning volume having multiple depths of focus by virtue of its holographic-based variable focal length imaging subsystem.","Second Illustrative Embodiment of the Hybrid Holographic\/CCD PLIIM-Based System of the Present Invention","In , a second illustrative embodiment of the hybrid holographic\/CCD PLIIM-based system of the present invention \u2032 is shown, wherein a holographic-based imaging subsystem is used to produce a wide range of discrete field of views (FOVs), over which the system can acquire images of target objects using an area-type image detection array having a 3-D field of view (FOV) that is coplanar with a planar laser illumination beam in accordance with the principles of the present invention.

In such systems, the photo-integration time period associated with each row of image detection elements in its 2D image detection array, should be relatively short in relation to the total time duration of each image capture period associated with the entire 2-D image detection array. This ensures that all rows of linear image data will be faithfully captured and buffered, without creating motion blur and other artifacts.","Any of the first through eight generalized methods of despeckling described above can be applied to an area-type PLIIM-based system. Any wavefront control techniques applied to the PLIB in connection with the realization of a particular despeckling technique described herein will enable time and (possibly a little spatial) averaging across each row of image detection elements (in the area image detection array) which corresponds to each linear image captured by the PLIB as it is being swept over the object surface within the 3-D FOV of the PLIIM-based system. In turn, this will enable a reduction in speckle-pattern noise along the horizontal direction (i.e. width dimension) of the image detection elements in the area image detection array.","Also, vertically-directed sweeping action of the PLIB over the object surface during each image capture period will produce temporally and spatially varying speckle noise pattern elements along that direction which can be both temporally and spatially averaged to a certain degree during each photo-integration time period of the area-type PLIIM-based imaging system, thereby helping to reduce the RMS power of speckle-pattern noise observed at the area image detection array in the PLIIM-based imaging system.","By applying the above teachings, each and every area-type PLIIM-based imaging system can benefit from the generalized despeckling methods of the present invention.","First Illustrative Embodiment of the Unitary Object Identification and Attribute Acquisition System of the Present Invention Embodying a PLIIM-Based Object Identification Subsystem and a LADAR-Based Imaging, Detecting and Dimensioning Subsystem","Referring now to ,  and , a unitary object identification and attribute acquisition system of the first illustrated embodiment , installed above a conveyor belt structure in a tunnel system configuration, will now be described in detail.","As shown in , the unitary system  of the present invention comprises an integration of subsystems, contained within a single housing of compact construction supported above the conveyor belt of a high-speed conveyor subsystem , by way of a support frame or like structure.

In turn, the Ethernet hub is connected to the I\/O unit , shown in FIG. . In the illustrative embodiment, each object attribute producing subsystem indicated above will also have a network controller, and a dynamically or statically assigned IP address on the LAN in which unitary system  is connected, so that each such subsystem is capable of transporting data packets using TCP\/IP.","In addition, an optical filter (FO) network controller  may be provided within the unitary system  for supporting the Ethernet or other network protocol over a fiber optical cable communication medium. The advantage of fiber optical cable is that it can be run thousands of feet within and about an industrial work environment while supporting high information transfer rates (required for image lift and transfer operations) without information loss. The fiber-optic data communication interface supported by FO network controller  enables the tunnel-based system of  to be installed thousands of feet away from a keying station in a package routing hub (i.e. center), where lifted digital images and OCR (or barcode) data are simultaneously displayed on the display of a computer work station.

A particularly important inventive feature of this camera process is that it only needs to operate on one data set at time a time, obtained from the LDIP Subsystem , in order to perform its complex array of functions. Referring to  and B, the real-time camera control process of the illustrative embodiment will now be described with reference to the data structures illustrated in , and the data tables illustrated in .","Real-Time Camera Control Process of the Present Invention","In the illustrative embodiment, the Real-time Camera Control Process  illustrated in , B- and B is carried out within the camera control computer  of the PLIIM-based system  shown in FIG. . It is understood, however, that this control process can be carried out within any of the PLIIM-based systems disclosed herein, wherein there is a need to perform automated real-time object detection, dimensioning and identification operations.","This Real-time Camera Control Process provides each PLIIM-based camera subsystem of the present invention with the ability to intelligently zoom in and focus upon only the surfaces of a detected object (e.g. package) which might bear object identifying and\/or characterizing information that can be reliably captured and utilized by the system or network within which the camera subsystem is installed. This inventive feature of the present invention significantly reduces the amount of image data captured by the system which does not contain relevant information. In turn, this increases the package identification performance of the camera subsystem, while using less computational resources, thereby allowing the camera subsystem to perform more efficiently and productivity.","As illustrated in , B- and B, the camera control process of the present invention has multiple control threads that are carried out simultaneously during each data processing cycle (i.e. each time a new data set is received from the Real-Time Package Height Profiling And Edge Detection Processing Module  within the LDIP subsystem ). As illustrated in this flow chart, the data elements contained in each received data set are automatically processed within the camera control computer in the manner described in the flow chart, and at the end of each data set processing cycle, generates real-time camera control signals that drive the zoom and focus lens group translators powered by high-speed motors and quick-response linkage provided within high-speed auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem (i.e. the IFD module) \u2033 so that the camera subsystem \u2033 automatically captures digital images having (1) square pixels (i.e. 1:1 aspect ratio) independent of package height or velocity, (2) significantly reduced speckle-noise levels, and (3) constant image resolution measured in dots per inch (DPI) independent of package height or velocity. Details of this control process will be described below.","As indicated at Block A in , the camera control computer  receives a time-stamped hextuple data set from the LDIP subsystem  after each scan cycle completed by AM laser beams A and B. In the illustrative embodiment, this data set contains the following data elements: the coordinate of the left package edge (LPE); the current height value of the package (h); x coordinate subrange, and exhibit maximum intensity changes or variations (e.g. indicative of text or other graphic information markings) and the height values contained within said subrange; the coordinate of the right package edge (RPE); package velocity (V); and the time-stamp (nT). The data elements associated with each current data set are initially buffered in an input row (i.e. Row ) of the Package Data Buffer illustrated in FIG. . Notably, the Package Data Buffer shown in  functions like a six column first-in-first-out (FIFO) data element queue. As shown, each data element in the raw data set is assigned a fixed column index and (variable) row index which increments as the raw data set is shifted one index unit as each new incoming raw data set is received into the Package Data Buffer. In the illustrative embodiment, the Package Data Buffer has M number of rows, sufficient in size to determine the spatial boundaries of a package scanned by the LDIP subsystem using real-time sampling techniques which will be described in detail below.","As indicated at Block A in , in response to each Data Set received, the camera control computer  also performs the following operations: (i) computes the optical power (measured in milliwatts) which each VLD in the PLIIM-based system \u2033 (shown in FIGS. E through E) must produce in order that each digital image captured by the PLIIM-based system will have substantially the same \u201cwhite\u201d level, regardless of conveyor belt speed; and (2) transmits the computed VLD optical power value(s) to the microcontroller  associated with each PLIA in the PLIIM-based system. The primary motivation for capturing images having a substantially the same \u201cwhite\u201d level is that this information level condition greatly simplifies the software-based image processing operations to be subsequently carried out by the image processing computer subsystem. Notably, the flow chart shown in FIGS. C and C describes the steps of a method of computing the optical power which must be produced from each VLD in the PLIIM-based system, to ensure the capture of digital images having a substantially uniform \u201cwhite\u201d level, regardless of conveyor belt speed. This method will be described below.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. C, the camera control computer  computes the Line Rate of the linear CCD image detection array (i.e. sensor chip) A based on (i) the conveyor belt speed (computed by the LDIP subsystem ), and (ii) the constant image resolution (i.e. in dots per inch) desired, using the following formula: Line Rate=[Belt Velocity]\u00d7[Resolution].","As indicated at Block B in FIG. C, the camera control computer  then computes the photo-integration time period of the linear image detection array A required to produce digital images having a substantially uniform \u201cwhite\u201d level, regardless of conveyor belt speed. This step is carried out using the formula: Photo-Integration Time Period=1\/Line Rate.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. C, the camera control computer  then computes the optical power (e.g. milliwatts) which each VLD in the PLIIM-based system must illuminate in order to produce digital images having a substantially uniform \u201cwhite\u201d level, regardless of conveyor belt speed. This step is carried out using the formula: VLD Optical Power=Constant\/Photo\u2212Integration Time Period.","Once the VLD Optical Power is computed for each VLD in the system, the camera control computer  then transmits (i.e. broadcasts) this parameter value, as control data, to each PLIA microcontroller  associated with each PLIA, along with a global timing (i.e. synchronization) signal. The PLIA micro-controller  uses the global synchronization signal to determine when it should enable its associated VLDs to generate the particular level of optical power indicated by the currently received control data values. When the Optical Power value is received by the microcontroller , it automatically converts this value into a set of digital control signals which are then provided to the digitally-controlled potentimeters () associated with the VLDs so that the drive current running through the junction of each VLD is precisely controlled to produce the computed level of optical power to be used to illuminate the object (whose speed was factored into the VLD optical power calculation) during the subsequent image capture operations carried out by the PLIIM-based system.","In accordance with the principles of the present invention, as the speed of the conveyor belt and thus objects transported therealong will vary over time, the camera control process, running the control subroutine set forth in FIGS. C and C, will dynamically program each PLIA microcontroller  within the PLIIM-based system so that the VLDs in each PLIA illuminate at optical power levels which ensure that captured digital images will automatically have a substantially uniform \u201cwhite\u201d level, independent of conveyor belt speed.","Notably, the intensity control method of the present invention described above enables the electronic exposure control (EEC) capability provided on most linear CCD image sensors to be disabled during normal operation so that image sensor's nominal noise pattern, otherwise distorted by the EEC aboard the imager sensor, can be used to perform offset correction on captured image data.","Returning now to Block B in , the camera control computer  analyzes the height data in the Package Data Buffer and detects the occurrence of height discontinuities, and based on such detected height discontinuities, camera control computer  determines the corresponding coordinate positions of the leading package edges specified by the left-most and right-most coordinate values (LPE and RPE) contained in the data set in the Package Data Buffer at the which the detected height discontinuity occurred.","At Block C in , the camera control computer  determines the height of the package associated with the leading package edges determined at Block B above.","At Block D in , at this stage in the control process, the camera control computer  analyzes the height values (i.e. coordinates) buffered in the Package Data Buffer, and determines the current \u201cmedian\u201d height of the package. At this stage of the control process, numerous control \u201cthreads\u201d are started, each carrying out a different set of control operations in the process. As indicated in the flow chart of , B- and B, each control thread can only continue when the necessary parameters involved in its operation have been determined (e.g. computed), and thus the control process along a given control thread must wait until all involved parameters are available before resuming its ultimate operation (e.g. computation of a particular intermediate parameter, or generation of a particular control command), before ultimately returning to the start Block A, at which point the next time-stamped data set is received from the Real-Time Package Height Profiling And Edge Detection Processing Module . In the illustrative embodiment, such data set input operations are carried out every 5 milliseconds, and therefore updated camera commands are generated and provided to the auto-focus\/auto-zoom camera subsystem at substantially the same rate, to achieve real-time adaptive camera control performance required by demanding imaging applications.","As indicated at Blocks E, F, G, H, I, A in , B- and B, a first control thread runs from Block D to Block A so as to reposition the focus and zoom lens groups within the auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem each time a new data set is received from the Real-Time Package Height Profiling And Edge Detection Processing Module .","As indicated at Block E, the camera control computer  uses the Focus\/Zoom Lens Group Position Lookup Table in  to determine the focus and zoom lens group positions based which will capture focused digital images having constant dpi resolution, independent of detected package height. This operation requires using the median height value determined at Block D, and looking up the corresponding focus and zoom lens group positions listed in the Focus\/Zoom Lens Group Position Lookup Table of FIG. .","At Block F, the camera control computer  transmits the Lens Group Movement translates the focus and zoom lens group positions determined at Block E into Lens Group Movement Commands, which are then transmitted to the lens group position translators employed in the auto-focus\/auto-zoom camera subsystem (i.e. IFD Subsystem) \u2033.","At Block G, the IFD Subsystem \u2033 uses the Lens Group Movement Commands to move the groups of lenses to their target positions within the IFD Subsystem.","Then at Block H, the camera control computer  checks the resulting positions achieved by the lens group position translators, responding to the transmitted Lens Group Movement Commands. At Blocks I and J, the camera control computer  automatically corrects the lens group positions which are required to capture focused digital images having constant dpi resolution, independent of detected package height. As indicated at by the control loop formed by Blocks H, I, J, H, the camera control computer  corrects the lens group positions until focused images are captured with constant dpi resolution, independent of detected package height, and when so achieved, automatically returns this control thread to Block A as shown in FIG. A.","As indicated at Blocks D, K, L, M in , B- and B, a second control thread runs from Block D in order to determine and set the optimal photo-integration time period (\u0394T) parameter which will ensure that digital images captured by the auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem will have pixels of a square geometry (i.e. aspect ratio of 1:1) required by typical image-based bar code symbol decode processors and OCR processors. As indicated at Block K, the camera control computer analyzes the current median height value in the Data Package Buffer, and determines the speed of the package (V). At Block L, the camera control computer uses the computed values of average (i.e. median) package height, belt speed and Photo-Integration Time Look-Up Table in FIG. 22B, to determine the photo-integration time parameter (\u0394T) which will ensure that digital images captured by the auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem will have pixels of a \u201csquare\u201d geometry (i.e. aspect ratio of 1:1).","As indicated at Block I, the camera control computer  also uses (1) the computed belt speed\/velocity, (2) the prespecified image resolution desired or required (dpi), and (3) the computed slope of the laser scanned surface so as to compute the compensated line rate of the camera (i.e. IFD) subsystem which helps ensure that the captured linear images have substantially constant pixel resolution (dpi) independent of the angular arrangement of the package surface during surface profiling and imaging operations. As indicated in the flow chart set forth in , the above information elements (1), (2) and (3) defined above are used by the camera control computer  to dynamically adjust the Line Rate is of camera (i.e. IFD) subsystem in response to real-time measurements of the object surface gradient (i.e. slope) performed by the camera control computer  using object height data captured by the LDIP subsystem  and transmitted to the camera control computer .","Reference will now be made to FIG. D and E and E in order to explain the camera line rate compensation operation of the present invention carried out at Block L in  and B-. Notably, the primary purpose of this operation is to automatically compensate for viewing-angle distortion which would otherwise occur in images of object surfaces captured as the object surfaces move past the coplanar PLIB\/FOV of PLIIM-based linear \u2032 at skewed viewing angles, defined by slope angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 in FIGS. E and E for the cases of top scanning and side scanning, respectively.","As indicated at Block A in , the camera control computer  computes the Line Rate of the linear image detection array (dots\/second) based on the computed Belt Velocity (inches\/second) and the constant Image Resolution (dots\/inch) desired, using the equation: Line Rate=(Belt Velocity)(Image Resolution). As indicated at Block B in , the camera control computer  computes the Line Rate Compensation Factor, i.e. cosine (\u03b8\u2014or \u03c6), where \u03b8 and \u03c6 are defined in FIGS. E and E respectively, as the computed gradient or slope of the package surface laser scanned by the AM laser beams powered by the LDIP subsystem , and is computed at Block D in FIG. A. As indicated at Block C in , the camera control computer  computes the Compensated Line Rate for the IFD (i.e. camera) subsystem using the equation: Compensated Line Rate=(Line Rate)(Cos(\u03b8 or \u03c6).","In a PLIIM-based linear imaging system, configured above a conveyor belt structure as shown in FIG. E, the Line Rate of the linear image detection array in the camera subsystem will be dynamically adjusted in accordance with the principles of the present invention described above. In this case, the method employed at Block L in  and B- and detailed in  will provide a high level of compensation for viewing angle distortion presented when imaging (the plane of) a moving object surface disposed skewed at some slope angle \u03b8 measured relative to the planar surface of the conveyor belt. In this case, the difficulty will should not reside in line-rate compensation, but rather in dynamically focusing the image formation optics of the camera (IFD) subsystem in response to the geometrical characteristics of the top surfaces of packages measured by the LDIP subsystem (i.e. instrument)  on a real-time basis. For example, during illumination and imaging operations, a slanted or sloped top surface of a transported box or object must remain in focus under the camera subsystem. To achieve such focusing, the slope of the object's top surface should be within a certain value, across the entire conveyor belt. However, in the top scanning case, if the box is rotated along the direction of travel so that the slope of the top surface thereof is not substantially the same across the conveyor belt (i.e. the height values of the box vary across the width of the conveyor belt), then it will be difficult for the camera subsystem to focus on the entire top surface of the box, across the width of the conveyor belt. In such instances, the LDIP subsystem  in system  has the option (at Block L in  and B-) of providing only a single height value to the camera control computer  (e.g. the average value of the height values of the box measured across the conveyor belt), and for this average value to be used by the camera control computer  to adjustably control the camera's zoom and focus characteristics. Alternatively, the LDIP subsystem  can transmit to the camera control computer , data representative of the actual slope and shape of the top surface of the box, and such data can be used to control the focusing optics of the camera subsystem in a more complicated manner permitted by the image forming optics used in the linear PLIIM-based imaging system.","For the case of side scanning shown in FIG. E, the method of the present invention employed at Block L in  and B- and detailed in  will provide a high level of compensation for viewing angle distortion which will otherwise occur in images of object surfaces when viewing (the plane of) the moving object surface disposed skewed at some angle \u03c6 measured relative to the edge of the conveyor belt.","Referring back now to Block M in  and B-, it is noted that the camera control computer  generates a digital control signals for the parameters (1) Photo-integration Time Period (\u0394T) found in the Photo-Integration Time Look-Up Table set forth in , and (2) the Compensated Line Rate parameter computed using the procedure set forth in FIG. D. Thereafter, the camera control computer  transmits these digital control signals to the CCD image detection array employed in the auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem (i.e. the IFD Module). Thereafter, this control thread returns to Block A as indicated in FIG. A.","As indicated at Blocks D, N, O, P, R in , B- and B-, a third control thread runs from Block D in order to determine the pixel indices (i,j) of a selected portion of a captured image which defines the \u201cregion of interest\u201d (ROI) on a package bearing package identifying information (e.g. bar code label, textual information, graphics, etc.), and to use these pixel indices (i,j) to produce image cropping control commands which are sent to the image processing computer . In turn, these control commands are used by the image processing computer  to crop pixels in the ROI of captured images, transferred to image processing computer  for image-based bar code symbol decoding and\/or OCR-based image processing. This ROI cropping function serves to selectively identify for image processing only those image pixels within the Camera Pixel Buffer of  having pixel indices (i,j) which spatially correspond to the (row, column) indices in the Package Data Buffer of FIG. .","As indicated at Block N in , the camera control computer transforms the position of left and right package edge (LPE, RPE) coordinates (buffered in the row the Package Data Buffer at which the height value was found at Block D), from the local Cartesian coordinate reference system symbolically embedded within the LDIP subsystem shown in , to a global Cartesian coordinate reference system Rembedded, for example, within the center of the conveyor belt structure, beneath the LDIP subsystem , in the illustrative embodiment. Such coordinate frame conversions can be carried out using homogeneous transformations (HG) well known in the art.","At Block O  and B-, the camera control computer detects the x coordinates of the package boundaries based on the spatially transformed coordinate values of the left and right package edges (LPE,RPE) buffered in the Package Data Buffer, shown in FIG. .","At Block P in  and B-, the camera control computer  determines the corresponding pixel indices (i,j) which specifies the portion of the image frame (i.e. a slice of the region of interest), to be effectively cropped from the image to be subsequently captured by the auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem \u2033. This pixel indices specification operation involves using (i) the x coordinates of the detected package boundaries determined at Block O, and (ii) optionally, the subrange of x coordinates bounded within said detected package boundaries, over which maximum range \u201cintensity\u201d data variations have been detected by the module of FIG. . By using the x coordinate boundary information specified in item (i) above, the camera control computer  can determine which image pixels represent the overall detected package, whereas when using the x coordinate subrange information specified in item (ii) above, the camera control computer  can further determine which image pixels represent a bar code symbol label, hand-writing, typing, or other graphical indicia recorded on the surface of the detected package. Such additional information enables the camera control computer  to selectively crop only pixels representative of such information content, and inform the image processing computer  thereof, on a real-time scanline-by-scanline basis, thereby reducing the computational load on image processing computer  by use of such intelligent control operations.","Thereafter, this control thread dwells at Block R in  and B- until the other control threads terminating at Block Q have been executed, providing the necessary information to complete the operation specified at Block Q, and then proceed to Block R, as shown in  and B-.","As indicated at Block Q in  and B-, the camera control computer uses the package time stamp (nT) contained in the data set being currently processed by the camera control computer, as well as the package velocity (V) determined at Block K, to determine the \u201cStart Time\u201d of Image Frame Capture (STIC). The reference time is established by the package time stamp (nT). The Start Time when the image frame capture should begin is measured from the reference time, and is determined by (1) predetermining the distance \u0394z measured between (i) the local coordinate reference frame embedded in the LDIP subsystem and (ii) the local coordinate reference frame embedded within the auto-focus\/auto-zoom camera subsystem, and dividing this predetermined (constant) distance measure by the package velocity (V). Then at Block R, the camera control computer  (i) uses the Start Time of Image Frame Capture determined at Block Q to generate a command for starting image frame capture, and (ii) uses the pixel indices (i,j) determined at Block P to generate commands for cropping the corresponding slice (i.e. section) of the region of interest in the image to be or being captured and buffered in the Image Buffer within the IFD Subsystem (i.e. auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem).","Then at Block S, these real-time \u201cimage-cropping\u201d commands are transmitted to the IFD Subsystem (auto-focus\/auto-zoom digital camera subsystem) \u2033 and the control process returns to Block A to begin processing another incoming data set received from the Real-Time Package Height Profiling And Edge Detection Processing Module . This aspect of the inventive camera control process  effectively informs the image processing computer  to only process those cropped image pixels which the LDIP subsystem  has determined as representing graphical indicia containing information about either the identity, origin and\/or destination of the package moving along the conveyor belt.","Alternatively, camera control computer  can use computed ROI pixel information to crop pixel data in captured images within the camera control computer  and then transfer such cropped images to the image processing computer  for subsequent processing.","Also, any one of the numerous methods of and apparatus for speckle-pattern noise reduction described in great detail hereinabove can be embodied within the unitary system  to provide an ultra-compact, ultra-lightweight system capable of high performance image acquisition and processing operation, undaunted by speckle-pattern noise which seriously degrades the performance of prior art systems attempting to illuminate objects using solid-state VLD devices, as taught herein.","Method of and System for Performing Automatic Recognition of Graphical Forms of Intelligence Contained in 2-D Images Captured from Arbitrary 3-D Surfaces of Object Surfaces Moving Relative to Said System","As shown in , the PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition system  of the present invention further comprises a subprogram within its camera control computer . The subprogram enables the automated collection, processing and transmission (e.g. exportation) of data elements relating to the arbitrary 3-D surfaces of objects being transported beneath the light transmission apertures of the system . In the illustrative embodiment, such data elements include, for example: (i) linear 3-D surface profile maps captured by the LDIP subsystem  during each photo-integration time period of the PLIIM-based imager \u2032; (ii) high-resolution linear images captured by the PLIIM-based imager \u2032 during each photo-integration time period; (iii) object velocity measurements captured by the LDIP subsystem  during each photo-integration time period; and (iv) IFD (i.e. camera) subsystem parameters captured by the PLIIM-based imager \u2032 during each photo-integration time period. After each photo-integration time period, these data elements are automatically transmitted to the image processing computer  for use in modeling the following geometrical objects: (i) the arbitrary 3-D object surface using a 3-D polygon-mesh surface model comprising a plurality of polygon-surface patches, whose vertices are specified by the x,y,z coordinates measured by the LDIP subsystem ; (ii) each pixel in the high-resolution linear image thereof, using a pixel ray having vector representation; and (iii) the points of intersection between the pixel rays and particular polygon-surface patches at point of intersection (POI) coordinate locations p(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032). Once the points of intersection are computed, the pixel intensity value originally associated with each pixel is assigned to the newly computed point of intersection coordinates, so that when this newly computed set of pixel points are taken as a whole, they produce a high-resolution 3-D image of the object surface By the term \u201c3D image of the object surface\u201d, one means that each pixel in the high-resolution image is specified by a pixel intensity value I(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032) and three Cartesian coordinates x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032. This inventive feature provides the PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition system  (and ) of the present invention with the capacity to produce high-resolution 3-D images of three-dimensional surfaces of virtually any object including natural objects (e.g. human faces) and synthetic objects (e.g. manufactured parts).","Notably, depending on the particular application at hand, the image processing computer  associated with system  (or ) may be integrated into the system and contained within its housing  to provide a completely integrated solution. In other applications, it will be desirable that the image processing computer  is realized as a stand-alone computer, typically an image processing workstation, provided with sufficient computing and memory storage resources, and a graphical user interface (GUI).","In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the \u201ccomputed\u201d high-resolution 3-D images described above can be further processed in order to \u201cunwarp\u201d or \u201cundistort\u201d the effects which the object's arbitrary 3D surface characteristics may have had on any \u201cgraphical intelligence\u201d carried by the object, as an intelligence carrying substrate, so that conventional OCR and bar code symbol recognition methods can be carried out without error occasioned by surface distortion of graphical intelligence rendered to the object's arbitrary 3D surface characteristics. Notably, as used herein the term \u201cgraphical intelligence\u201d shall include symbolic character strings, bar code symbol structures, and like structures capable of carrying symbolic meaning or sense a natural or synthetic source of intelligence.","The 3-D image generation and graphical intelligence recognition capabilities of system  have been described in an overview manner above. It is appropriate at this juncture to now describe these inventive features in greater detail with reference to the method of graphical intelligence recognition shown in FIGS. A through C.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. C, the first step of method involves using the laser doppler imaging and profiling (LDIP) subsystem employed in the unitary PLIIM-based object imaging and profiling system, to (i) consecutively capture a series of linear 3-D surface profile maps on a targeted arbitrary (e.g. non-planar or planar) 3-D object surface bearing forms of graphical intelligence and (ii) measure the velocity of the arbitrary 3-D object surface. Notably, the polar coordinates of each point in the captured linear 3-D surface profile map are specified in a local polar coordinate system R, symbolically embedded within the LDIP subsystem.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. C, the second step of method involves using coordinate transforms to automatically convert the polar coordinates of each point p(\u03b1, R) in the captured linear 3-D surface profile map into x,y,z Cartesian coordinates specified as p(x,y,z) in a local Cartesian coordinate system R, symbolically embedded within the LDIP subsystem.","As indicated at Block C in FIG. C, the third step of method involves using the PLIIM-based imager \u2032 to consecutively capture high-resolution linear 2-D images of the arbitrary 3-D object surface bearing forms of graphical intelligence (e.g. symbol character strings). As shown in , (i) the x\u2032, y\u2032 coordinates of each pixel in each said captured high-resolution linear 2-D image is specified in local Cartesian coordinate system Rsymbolically embedded within the PLIIM-based imager, and (ii) the intensity value of the pixel I(x\u2032,y\u2032) is associated with the x\u2032, y\u2032 Cartesian coordinates of the image detection element in the linear image detection array at which the pixel is detected. Also, (iii) the planar laser illumination beam (PLIB) of the PLIIM-based imager is spaced from the amplitude modulated (AM) laser scanning beam of the LDIP subsystem is about D centimeters.","As indicated at Block D in FIG. C, the fourth step of method involves capturing and buffering (at the PLIIM-based object imaging and profiling subsystem) the camera (IFD) parameters used to form and detect each linear high-resolution 2-D image captured during the corresponding photo-integration time period \u0394T, by the PLIIM-based imager.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. C, the fifth step of method involves, at the end of each photo-integration time period \u0394T, using the unitary PLIIM-based object imaging and profiling system to transmit the following information elements to the Image Processing Computer for data storage and subsequent information processing:","(1) the converted coordinates x, y, z, of each point in the linear 3-D surface profile map of the arbitrary 3-D object surface captured during photo-integration time period \u0394T;","(2) the measured velocity(ies) of the arbitrary 3-D object surface during photo-integration time period \u0394T;","(3) the x\u2032, y\u2032 coordinates and intensity value I(x\u2032,y\u2032) of each pixel in each high-resolution linear 2-D image captured during photo-integration time period \u0394Tand specified in the local Cartesian coordinate system R; and","(4) the captured camera (IFD) parameters used to form and detect each linear high-resolution 2-D image captured during the photo-integration time period \u0394T.","As indicated at Block F in FIG. C, the sixth step of method involves receiving, at the Image Processing Computer, the data elements transmitted from the PLIIM-based profiling and imaging system during Step , buffer data elements (1) and (2) in a first FIFO buffer memory structure, and data elements (3) and (4) in a second FIFO buffer memory structure.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. C, the seventh step of method involves using at the Image Processing Computer, the x, y, z coordinates associated with a consecutively captured series of linear 3-D surface profile maps (i.e. stored in first FIFO memory storage structure) in order to construct a 3-D polygon-mesh surface representation of said arbitrary 3-D object surface, represented by S(x,y,z) and having (i) vertices specified by x,y,z in local coordinate reference system R, and (ii) planar polygon surface patches s(x,y,z) and being defined by a set of said vertices.","As indicated at Block H in FIG. C, the eighth step of method involves converting, at the Image Processing Computer, the x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032 coordinates of each vertex in the 3-D polygon-mesh surface representation into the local Cartesian coordinate reference system Rsymbolically embedded within the PLIIM-based imager.","As indicated at Block I in FIG. C, the ninth step of method of involves specifying at the Image Processing Computer, the x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032 coordinates of each i-th planar polygon surface patch s(x,y,z) represented in the local Cartesian coordinate reference system R, so as to produce a set of corresponding polygon surface patch {s(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032)} represented in system R.","As indicated at Block J in FIG. C, the tenth step of method involves, at the Image Processing Computer, for a selected linear high-resolution 2-D image captured at photo-integration time period \u0394Tand spatially corresponding to one of the linear 3-D surface profile maps employed at Block G, use the camera (IFD) parameters used and recorded (i.e. captured) during the corresponding photo-integration time period in order to construct a 3-D vector-based \u201cpixel ray\u201d model specifying the optical formation of each pixel in the linear 2-D image, wherein a pixel ray reflected off a point on the arbitrary 3-D object surface is focused through the camera's image formation optics (i.e. configured by the camera parameters) and is detected at the pixel's detection element in the linear image detection array of the IFD (camera) subsystem.","As indicated at Block K in FIG. C, the eleventh step of method involves performing at the Image Processing Computer, the following operation for each laser beam ray (producing one of the pixels in said selected linear 2-D image): (i) determining which polygon surface patch s(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032) the pixel ray intersects; (ii) computing the x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032 coordinates of the point of intersection (POI) between the pixel ray and the polygon surface patch represented in Cartesian coordinate reference system R; and (iii) designating the computed set of points of intersection as {p(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032)}.","As indicated at Block L in FIG. C, the twelfth step of method involves at the Image Processing Computer, for each laser beam ray passing through a determined polygon surface patch s(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032) at a computed point of intersection p(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032), assigning the intensity value I(x\u2032,y\u2032) of the pixel ray to the x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032 coordinates of the point of intersection. This produces a linear high-resolution 3-D image comprising a 2-D array of pixels, each said pixel having as its attributes (i) an Intensity value I(x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032) and (ii) coordinates x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032 specified in the local Cartesian coordinate reference system R.","As indicated at Block M in FIG. C, the thirteenth step of method involves putting the computed linear high-resolution 3-D image in a third FIFO memory storage structure in the image processing computer.","As indicated at Block N in FIG. C, the fourteenth step of method involves repeating steps one through six above to update the first and second FIFO data queues maintained in the image processing computer, and steps seven through thirteen to update the consecutively computed linear high-resolution 3-D image stored in the third FIFO memory storage structure.","As indicated at Block O in FIG. C, the fifteenth step of method involves assembling, in an image buffer in the image processing computer, a set of consecutively computed linear high-resolution 3-D images retrieved from the third FIFO data storage device so as to construct an \u201carea-type\u201d high-resolution 3-D image of said arbitrary 3-D object surface.","As indicated at Block P in FIG. C, the sixteenth step of method involves at the Image Processing Computer, mapping the intensity value I(x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032) of each pixel in the computed area-type 3-D image onto the x\u2032,y\u2032,z\u2032 coordinates of the points on a uniformly-spaced apart \u201cgrid\u201d positioned perpendicular to the optical axis of the camera subsystem (i.e. to model the 2-D planar substrate on which the forms of graphical intelligence was originally rendered). Here, the mapping process involves using an intensity weighing function based on the x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032 coordinate values of each pixel in the area-type high-resolution 3-D image. This produces an area-type high-resolution 2-D image of the 2-D planar substrate surface bearing said forms of graphical intelligence (e.g. symbol character strings).","As indicated at Block Q in FIG. C, the sixteenth step of the method involves at the Image Processing Computer, using said OCR algorithm to perform automated recognition of graphical intelligence contained in said area-type high-resolution 2-D image of said 2-D planar substrate surface so as to recognize said graphical intelligence and generate symbolic knowledge structures representative thereof.","As indicated at Block R in FIG. C, the seventeenth step of the method involves repeating steps one through seventeen described above as often as required to recognize changes in graphical intelligence on the arbitrary moving 3-D object surface. The process continues by the camera control computer  collecting and transmitting the above-described data elements to the image processing computer  each passage of a photo-integration time period, during which the received elements are buffered in their respective data queues prior to processing in accordance with the scheme depicted in FIG. B.","In applications where the time is not a critical factor at the image processing computer, large volumes of 3-D profile and high-resolution 1-D image data can be first collected from the arbitrary 3-D object surface and then buffered at the image processing computer so that data for the entire arbitrary 3-D object surface is first collected and buffered for use in a batch-type implementation of the high-resolution 3-D image reconstruction process of the present invention depicted in .","Alternatively, portions of the high-resolution 3-D image of an arbitrary 3-D object surface can be generated in an incremental manner as new data is collected and received at the image processing computer . In such cases, after each predetermined time period (which may be substantially larger than the photo-integration time period of the camera) the polygon-surface patch model and the pixel rays used during point of intersection analysis illustrated in , are automatically updated to reflect that a new part of the arbitrary 3-D object surface is being modeled and analyzed. In applications where graphical intelligence is recorded on planar substrates that have been physically distorted as a result of either (i) application of the graphical intelligence to an arbitrary 3-D object surface, or (ii) deformation of a 3-D object on which the graphical intelligence has been rendered, then the process steps illustrated at Blocks L through R in FIGS. C and C can be performed to \u201cundistort\u201d any distortions imparted to the graphical intelligence while being carried by the arbitrary 3-D object surface due to, for example, non-planar surface characteristics. By virtue of the present invention, graphical intelligence, originally formatted for application onto planar surfaces, can be applied to non-planar surfaces or otherwise to substrates having surface characteristics which differ from the surface characteristics for which the graphical intelligence was originally designed without spatial distortion. In practical terms, bar coded baggage identification tags as well as graphical character encoded labels which have been deformed, bent or otherwise distorted be easily recognized using the graphical intelligence recognition method of the present invention.","Second Illustrative Embodiment of the Unitary Object Identification and Attribute Acquisition System of the Present Invention Embodying a PLIIM-Based Subsystem of the Present Invention and a LADAR-Based Imaging, Detecting and Dimensioning\/Profiling (LDIP) Subsystem","Referring now to , , A, B, C and , a unitary PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition system of the second illustrated embodiment, indicated by reference numeral , will now be described in detail.","As shown in , the unitary PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition system  comprises an integration of subsystems, contained within a single housing of compact construction supported above the conveyor belt of a high-speed conveyor subsystem , by way of a support frame or like structure. In the illustrative embodiment, the conveyor subsystem  has a conveyor belt width of at least 48 inches to support one or more package transport lanes along the conveyor belt. As shown in , the unitary PLIIM-based system  comprises four primary subsystem components, namely: a LADAR-based (i.e. LIDAR-based) object imaging, detecting and dimensioning subsystem  capable of collecting range data from objects (e.g. packages) on the conveyor belt using a pair of multi-wavelength (i.e. containing visible and IR spectral components) laser scanning beams projected at different angular spacing as taught in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/327,756 filed Jun. 7, 1999, supra, and International PCT Application No. PCT\/US00\/15624 filed Dec. 7, 2000, incorporated herein by reference; a PLIIM-based bar code symbol reading subsystem \u2033, shown in FIGS. D through D, for producing a 3-D scanning volume above the conveyor belt, for scanning bar codes on packages transported therealong; an input\/output subsystem  for managing the inputs to and outputs from the unitary system; and a network controller  for connecting to a local or wide area IP network, and supporting one or more networking protocols, such as, for example, Ethernet, AppleTalk etc.","Notably, network communication controller  also enables the unitary system  to receive, using Ethernet or like networking protocols, data inputs from a number of object attribute input devices including, for example: a weighing-in-motion subsystem , as shown in , for weighing packages as they are transported along the conveyor belt; an RFID-tag reading (i.e. object identification) subsystem for reading RF tags on objects and identifying the same as such objects are transported along the conveyor belt; an externally-mounted belt tachometer for measuring the instant velocity of the belt and objects transported therealong; and various other types of \u201cobject attribute\u201d data producing subsystems such as, as for example, but not limited to: airport x-ray scanning systems; cargo x-ray scanners; PFNA-based explosive detection systems (EDS); and Quadrupole Resonance Analysis (QRA) based and\/or MRI-based screening systems for screening\/analyzing the interior of objects to detect the presence of contraband, explosive material, biological warfare agents, chemical warfare agents, and\/or dangerous or security threatening devices.","In the illustrative embodiment shown in , this array of Ethernet data input\/output ports is realized by a plurality of Ethernet connectors mounted on the exterior of the housing, and operably connected to an Ethernet hub mounted within the housing. In turn, the Ethernet hub is connected to the I\/O unit , shown in FIG. . In the illustrative embodiment, each object attribute producing subsystem indicated above will also have a network controller, and a dynamically or statically assigned IP address on the LAN in which unitary system  is connected, so that each such subsystem is capable of transporting data packets using TCP\/IP.","The unitary PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition system  further comprises: a high-speed fiber optic (FO) network controller  for connecting the subsystem  to a local or wide area IP network and supporting one or more networking protocols such as, for example, Ethernet, AppleTalk, etc.; and (4) a data management computer  with a graphical user interface (GUI) , for realizing a data element queuing, handling and processing subsystem , as well as other data and system management functions. As shown in , the package imaging, detecting and dimensioning subsystem  embodied within system  comprises the same integration of subsystems as shown in , and thus warrants no further discussion. It is understood, however, that other non-LADAR based package detection, imaging and dimensioning subsystems could be used to emulate the functionalities of the LDIP subsystem .","In the illustrative embodiment, the data management computer  employed in the object identification and attribute acquisition system  is realized as complete micro-computing system running operating system (OS) software (e.g. Microsoft NT, Unix, Solaris, Linux, or the like), and providing full support for various protocols, including: Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP); File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP); Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP); and Simple Message Transport Protocol (SMTP). The function of these protocols in the object identification and attribute acquisition system , and networks built using the same, will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to FIGS. A through D.","As shown in , unitary system  comprises a PLIIM-based camera subsystem \u2032\u2033 which includes a high-resolution 2D CCD camera subsystem \u2033 similar in many ways to the subsystem shown in FIGS. D through E, except that the 2-D COD camera's 3-D field of view is automatically steered over a large scanning field, as shown in FIG. E, in response to FOV steering control signals automatically generated by the camera control computer  as a low-resolution CCD area-type camera (640\u00d7640 pixels)  determines the x,y position coordinates of bar code labels on scanned packages. As shown in FIGS. B, C, B, and C, the components (A, B and ) associated with low-resolution CCD area-type camera  are easily integrated within the system architecture of PLIIM-based camera subsystems. In the illustrative embodiment, low-resolution camera  is controlled by a camera control process carried out within the camera control computer , by modifying the camera control process illustrated in , B- and B-. The major difference with this modified camera control process is that it will include subprocesses that generate FOV steering control signals, in addition to zoom and focus control signals, discussed in great detail hereinabove.","In the illustrative embodiment, when the low-resolution CCD image detection array A detects a bar code symbol on a package label, the camera control computer  automatically (i) triggers into operation a high-resolution CCD image detector A and the planar laser illumination arrays (PLIA) A and B operably associated therewith, and (ii) generates FOV steering control signals for steering the FOV of camera subsystem \u2032\u2033 and capturing 2-D images of packages within the 3-D field of view of the high-resolution image detection array A. The zoom and focal distance of the imaging subsystem employed in the high-resolution camera (i.e. IFD module) \u2032\u2033 are automatically controlled by the camera control process running within the camera control computer  using, for example, package height coordinate and velocity information acquired by the LDIP subsystem . High-resolution image frames (i.e. scan data) captured by the 2-D image detector A are then provided to the image processing computer  for decode processing of bar code symbols on the detected package label, or OCR processing of textual information represented therein. In all other respects, the PLIIM-based system  shown in  is similar to PLIIM-based system  shown in FIG. . By embodying PLIIM-based camera subsystem \u2033 and object detecting, tracking and dimensioning\/profiling (LDIP) subsystem  within a single housing , an ultra-compact device is provided that uses a low-resolution CCD imaging device to detect package labels and dimension, identify and track packages moving along the package conveyor, and then uses such detected label information to activate a high-resolution CCD imaging device to acquire high-resolution images of the detected label for high performance decode-based image processing.","Notably, any one of the numerous methods of and apparatus for speckle-pattern noise reduction described in great detail hereinabove can be embodied within the unitary system  to provide an ultra-compact, ultra-lightweight system capable of high performance image acquisition and processing operation, undaunted by speckle-noise patterns which seriously degrade the performance of prior art systems attempting to illuminate objects using coherent radiation.","Data-Element Queuing, Handling and Processing (Q, H & P) Subsystem Integrated within the PLIIM-Based Object Identification and Attribute Acquisition System of ","In , the Data-Element Queuing, Handling And Processing (QHP) Subsystem  employed in the PLIIM-based Object Identification and Attribute Acquisition System  of , is illustrated in greater detail. As shown, the data element QHP subsystem  comprises a Data Element Queuing, Handling, Processing And Linking Mechanism  which automatically receives object identity data element inputs  (e.g. from a bar code symbol reader, RFID-tag reader, or the like) and object attribute data element inputs  (e.g. object dimensions, object weight, x-ray images, Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (PFNA) image data captured by a PFNA scanner by Ancore, and QRA image data captured by a QRA scanner by Quantum Magnetics, Inc.) from the I\/O unit , as shown in FIG. .","The primary functions of the a Data Element Queuing, Handling, Processing And Linking Mechanism  are to queue, handle, process and link data elements (of information files)  and  supplied by the I\/O unit , and automatically generate as output, for each object identity data element supplied as input, a combined data element  comprising (i) an object identity data element, and (ii) one or more object attribute data elements (e.g. object dimensions, object weight, x-ray analysis, neutron beam analysis, etc.) collected by the I\/O unit of the unitary system  and supplied to the data element queuing, handling and processing subsystem  of the illustrative embodiment.","In the illustrative embodiment, each object identification data element is typically a complete information structure representative of a numeric or alphanumeric character string uniquely identifying the particular object under identification and analysis. Also, each object attribute data element is typically a complete information file associated, for example, with the information content of an optical, X-ray, PFNA or QRA image captured by an object attribute information producing subsystem. In the case where the size of the information content of a particular object attribute data element is substantially large, in comparison to the size of the data blocks transportable within the system, then each object attribute data element may be decomposed into one or -more object attribute data elements, for linking with its corresponding object identification data elements. In this case, each combined data element  will be transported to its intended data storage destination, where object attribute data elements corresponding to a particular object attribute (e.g. x-ray image) are reconstituted by a process of synthesis so that the entire object attribute data element can be stored in memory as a single data entity, and accessed for future analysis as required by the application at hand.","In general, Data Element Queuing, Handling, Processing And Linking Mechanism  employed in the PLIIM-based Object Identification and Attribute Acquisition System  of  is a programmable data element tracking and linking (i.e. indexing) module constructed from hardware and software components. Its primary function is to link (1) object identity data to (2) corresponding object attribute data (e.g. object dimension-related data, object-weight data, object-content data, object-interior data, etc.) in both singulated and non-singulated environments.

Alternatively, prior to shipment to the installation site, the compiled System Software Package can be installed on respective computing platforms within the appropriate unitary object identification and attribute acquisition systems, to simplify installation of the configured system or network in a plug-and-play, turn-key like manner.","As indicated at Block G in , the systems configuration manager program will automatically generate an easy-to-follow set of Installation Instructions for the configured system or network, guiding the technician through an easy to follow installation and set-up procedures making sure all of the necessary system and subsystem hardware components are properly installed, and system and network parameters set up for proper system operation and remote servicing.","As indicated at Block H in , once the hardware components of the system have been properly installed and configured, the set-up procedure properly completed, the technician is ready to operate and test the system for troubles it may experience, and diagnose the same with or without remote service assistance made available through the remote monitoring, configuring, and servicing system of the present invention, illustrated in FIGS. A through D.","Tunnel-Type Object Identification and Attribute Acquisition System of the Present Invention","The PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition systems and subsystems described hereinabove can be configured as building blocks to build more complex, more robust systems and networks designed for use in diverse types of object identification and attribute acquisition and management applications.","In , there is shown a four-sided tunnel-type object identification and attribute acquisition system  that has been constructed by (i) arranging, about a high-speed package conveyor belt subsystem , four PLIIM-based package identification and attribute acquisition (PID) units  of the type shown in , and (ii) integrating these PID units within a high-speed data communications network  having a suitable network topology and configuration, as illustrated, for example, in .","In this illustrative tunnel-type system, only the top PID unit  includes an LDIP subsystem  for object detection, tracking, velocity-detection and dimensioning\/profiling functions, as this PID unit functions as a master PID unit within the tunnel system , whereas the side and bottom PID units  are not provided with a LDIP subsystem  and function as slave PID units. As such, the side and bottom PID units \u2032 are programmed to receive object dimension data (e.g. height, length and width coordinates) from the master PID unit  on a real-time basis, and automatically convert (i.e. transform) these object dimension coordinates into their local coordinate reference frames in order to use the same to dynamically control the zoom and focus parameters of the camera subsystems employed in the tunnel system. This centralized method of object dimensioning offers numerous advantages over prior art systems and will be described in greater detail with reference to  through B.","As shown in , the camera field of view (FOV) of the bottom PID unit \u2032 of the tunnel system  is arranged to view packages through a small gap  provided between conveyor belt sections A and B. Notably, this arrangement is permissible by virtue of the fact that the camera's FOV and its coplanar PLIB jointly have thickness dimensions on the order of millimeters. As shown in , all of the PID units in the tunnel system are operably connected to an Ethernet control hub  (ideally contained in one of the slave PID units) associated with a local area network (LAN) embodied within the tunnel system. As shown, an external tachometer (i.e. encoder)  connected to the conveyor belt  provides tachometer input signals to each slave unit  and master unit , as a backup to the integrated object velocity detector provided within the LDIP subsystem . This is an optional feature which may have advantages in environments where, for example, the belt speed fluctuates frequently and by significant amounts in the case of conveyor-enabled tunnel systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1465","num":"1466"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 27"],"b":["575","120","120","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1466","num":"1467"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 27","FIG. 29"],"b":["575","577","576","577","575","28","580","570"]},"Real-Time Object Coordinate Data Driven Method of Camera Zoom and Focus Control in Accordance with the Principles of the Present Invention","In  through B, CCD camera-based tunnel system  of  is schematically illustrated employing a real-time method of automatic camera zoom and focus control in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As will be described in greater detail below, this real-time method is driven by object coordinate data and involves (i) dimensioning packages in a global coordinate reference system, (ii) producing object (e.g. package) coordinate data referenced to said global coordinate reference system, and (iii) distributing said object coordinate data to local coordinate references frames in the system for conversion of said object coordinate data to local coordinate reference frames and subsequent use automatic camera zoom and focus control operations upon said packages. This method of the present invention will now be described in greater detail below using the four-sided tunnel-based system  of , described above.","As shown in  through -, the four-sided tunnel-type camera-based object identification and attribute acquisition system of  comprises: a single master PID unit  embodying a LDIP subsystem , mounted above the conveyor belt structure ; three slave PID units \u2032, \u2032 and \u2032, mounted on the sides and bottom of the conveyor belt; and a high-speed data communications network  supporting a network protocol such as, for example, Ethernet protocol, and enabling high-speed packet-type data communications among the four PID units within the system. As shown, each PID unit is connected to the network communication medium of the network through its network controller  () in a mariner well known in the computer networking arts.","As schematically illustrated in  through , local coordinate reference systems are symbolically embodied within each of the PID units deployed in the tunnel-type system of , namely: local coordinate reference system Rsymbolically embodied within the master PID unit ; local coordinate reference system RSymbolically embodied within the first side PID unit \u2032; local coordinate reference system Rsymbolically embodied within the second side PID unit \u2032; and local coordinate reference system Rsymbolically embodied within the bottom PID unit \u2032. In turn, each of these local coordinate reference systems is \u201creferenced\u201d with respect to a global coordinate reference system Rsymbolically embodied within the conveyor belt structure. Object coordinate information specified (by vectors) in the global coordinate reference system can be readily converted to object coordinate information specified in any local coordinate reference system by way of a homogeneous transformation (HG) constructed for the global and the particular local coordinate reference system. Each homogeneous transformation can be constructed by specifying the point of origin and orientation of the x,y,z axes of the local coordinate reference system with respect to the point of origin and orientation of the x,y,z axes of the global coordinate reference system. Such details on homogeneous transformations are well known in the art.","To facilitate construction of each such homogeneous transformation between a particular local coordinate reference system (symbolically embedded within a particular slave PID unit \u2032) and the global coordinate reference system (symbolically embedded within the master PID unit ), the present invention further provides a novel method of and apparatus for measuring, in the field, the pitch and yaw angles of each slave PID unit \u2032 in the tunnel system, as well as the elevation (i.e. height) of the PID unit, that is relative to the local coordinate reference frame symbolically embedded within the local PID unit. In the illustrative embodiment, shown in , such apparatus is realized in the form of two different angle-measurement (e.g. protractor) devices A and B integrated within the structure of each slave and master PID housing and the support structure provided to support the same within the tunnel system. The purpose of such apparatus is to enable the taking of such field measurements (i.e. angle and height readings) so that the precise coordinate location of each local coordinate reference frame (symbolically embedded within each PID unit) can be precisely determined, relative to the master PID unit . Such coordinate information is then used to construct a set of \u201chomogeneous transformations\u201d which are used to convert globally acquired package dimension data at each local coordinate frame, into locally referenced object dimension data. In the illustrative embodiment, the master PID unit  is provided with an LDIP subsystem  for acquiring object dimension information on a real-time basis, and such information is broadcasted to each of the slave PID units \u2032 employed within the tunnel system. By providing such object dimension information to each PID unit in the system, and converting such information to the local coordinate reference system of each such PID unit, the optical parameters of the camera subsystem within each local PID unit are accurately controlled by its camera control computer  using such locally-referenced package dimension information, as will be described in greater detail below.","As illustrated in , each angle measurement device A and B is integrated into the structure of the PID unit \u2032 () by providing a pointer or indicating structure (e.g. arrow) A (B) on the surface of the housing of the PID unit, while mounting angle-measurement indicator A (A) on the corresponding support structure A (B) used to support the housing above the conveyor belt of the tunnel system. With this arrangement, to read the pitch or yaw angle, the technician only needs to see where the pointer A (or B) points against the angle-measurement indicator A (B), and then visually determine the angle measure at that location which is the angle measurement to be recorded for the particular PID unit under analysis. As the position and orientation of each angle-measurement indicator A (B) will be precisely mounted (e.g. welded) in place relative to the entire support system associated with the tunnel system, PID unit angle readings made against these indicators will be highly accurate and utilizable in computing the homogeneous transformations (e.g. during the set-up and calibration stage) and carried out at each slave PID unit \u2032 and possibly the master PID unit  if the LDIP subsystem  is not located within the master PID unit, which may be the case in some tunnel installations. To measure the elevation of each PID unit \u2032 (or ), an arrow-like pointer C is provided on the PID unit housing and is read against an elevation indicator C mounted on one of the support structures.","Once the PID units have been installed within a given tunnel system, such information must be ascertained to (i) properly construct the homogeneous transformation expression between each local coordinate reference system and the global coordinate reference system, and (ii) subsequently program this mathematical construction within camera control computer  within each PID unit  (\u2032). Preferably, a PID unit support framework installed about the conveyor belt structure, can be used in the tunnel system to simplify installation and configuration of the PID units at particular predetermined locations and orientations required by the scanning application at hand. In accordance with such a method, the predetermined location and orientation position of each PID unit can be premarked or bar coded. Then, once a particular PID unit \u2032 has been installed, the location\/orientation information of the PID unit can be quickly read in the field and programmed into the camera control computer  of each PID unit so that its homogeneous transformation (HG) expression can be readily constructed and programmed into the camera control compute for use during tunnel system operation. Notably, a hand-held bar code symbol reader, operably connected to the master PID unit, can be used in the field to quickly and accurately collect such unit position\/orientation information (e.g. by reading bar code symbols pre-encoded with unit position\/orientation information) and transmit the same to the master PID unit .","In addition,  through - illustrates that the LDIP subsystem  within the master unit  generates (i) package height, width, and length coordinate data and (ii) velocity data, referenced with respect to the global coordinate reference system R. These package dimension data elements are transmitted to each slave PID unit \u2032 on the data communication network, and once received, its camera control computer  converts there values into package height, width, and length coordinates referenced to its local coordinate reference system using its preprogrammable homogeneous transformation. The camera control computer  in each slave PID unit  uses the converted object dimension coordinates to generate real-time camera control signals which automatically drive its camera's automatic zoom and focus imaging optics in an intelligent, real-time manner in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The \u201cobject identification\u201d data elements generated by the slave PID unit are automatically transmitted to the master PID unit  for time-stamping, queuing, and processing to ensure accurate object identity and object attribute (e.g. dimension\/profile) data element linking operations in accordance with the principles of the present invention.","Referring to , the object-coordinate driven camera control method of the present invention will now be described in detail.","As indicated at Block A in , Step A of the camera control method involves the master PID unit (with LDIP subsystem ) generating an object dimension data element (e.g. containing height, width, length and velocity data {H,W,L,V}) for each object transported through tunnel system, and then using the system's data communications network, to transmit such object dimension data to each slave PID unit downstream the conveyor belt. Preferably, the coordinate information contained in each object dimension data element is referenced with respect to global coordinate reference system R, although it is understood that the local coordinate reference frame of the master PID unit may also be used as a central coordinate reference system in accordance with the principles of the present invention.","As indicated at Block B in , Step B of the camera control method involves each slave unit receiving the transmitted object height, width and length data {H,W,L,V}and converting this coordinate information into the slave unit's local coordinate reference system R, {H,W,L,V}.","As indicated at Block C in , Step C of the camera control method involves the camera control computer in each slave unit using the converted object height, width, length data {H,W,L}and package velocity data to generate camera control signals for driving the camera subsystem in the slave unit to zoom and focus in on the transported package as it moves by the slave unit, while ensuring that captured images having substantially constant d.p.i. resolution and 1:1 aspect ratio.","As indicated at Block D in , Step D of the camera control method involves each slave unit capturing images acquired by its intelligently controlled camera subsystem, buffering the same, and processing the images so as to decode bar code symbol identifiers represented in said images, and\/or to perform optical character recognition (OCR) thereupon.","As indicated at Block E in , Step E of the camera control method involves the slave unit, which decoded a bar code symbol in a processed image, to automatically transmit an object identification data element (containing symbol character data representative of the decoded bar code symbol) to the master unit (or other designated system control unit employing data element management functionalities) for object data element processing.","As indicated at Block F in , Step F of the camera control method involves the master unit time-stamping each received object identification data element, placing said data element in a data queue, and processing object identification data elements and time-stamped package dimension data elements in said queue so as to link each object identification data element with one said corresponding object dimension data element (i.e. object attribute data element).","The real-time camera zoom and focus control process described above has the advantage of requiring on only one LDIP object detection, tracking and dimensioning\/profiling subsystem , yet enabling (i) intelligent zoom and focus control within each camera subsystem in the system, and (ii) precise cropping of \u201cregions of interest\u201d (ROI) in captured images. Such inventive features enable intelligent filtering and processing of image data streams and thus substantially reduce data processing requirements in the system.","The Internet-Based Remote Monitoring, Configuration and Service (RMCS) System and Method of the Present Invention","In FIGS. A through D, an Internet-based remote monitoring, configuration and service (RMCS) system and associated method of the present invention  is schematically illustrated. The primary function of RMCS system and associated method  is to enable a systems or network engineer or service technician to use any Internet-enabled client computing machine to remotely monitor. configure and\/or service any PLIIM-based network, system or subsystem of the present invention in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner.","In , a plurality of different tunnel-based systems  and their underlying LANs are schematically illustrated as being operably connected to the infrastructure of the Internet. In this figure, a remotely situated Internet-enabled client computer  is shown having access to the infrastructure of the Internet by way of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Network Service Provider (NSP) as the case may be. As shown, each tunnel-based network (of systems)  comprises: a LAN router  with a SNMP agent; a LAN hub  with a SNMP agent; a LAN http\/Servlet Server , functioning as the SNMP management server; a Database  operably connected to the SNMP management server , and functioning as a central Management Information Base (MIB); a master-type object identification and attribute acquisition system  with TCP\/IP, FTP, HTTP, ETHERNET, SNMP, and SMTP dameons, and a local Management Information Base (MIB); and a plurality of \u201cslave-type\u201d object identification and attribute acquisition system, each indicated by reference number \u2032 and not provided with an LDIP subsystem  as described hereinabove, but provided with a TCP\/IP, FTP, HTTP, ETHERNET, SNMP, and SMTP dameons, and a local management information base (MIB).","In the illustrative embodiment shown in , RMCS system  is realized using the simple network management protocol (SNMP) that presently forms a key component to the Internet network management architecture used in the contemporary period. In the illustrative embodiment, SNMP is used to enable network management and communication between (i) SNMP agents, which are built into each node (i.e. object identification and attribute acquisition system , \u2032) in the tunnel-based LAN , and (ii) SNMP managers, which can be built into LAN http\/Servlet Server  as well as any Internet-enabled client computing machine  functioning as the network management station (NMS) or management console.","The SNMP-based RMCS system  contains two primary elements, namely: a manager and agents. The manager is the console (e.g. GUI-based API) through which the network\/system administrator performs network, system and subsystem management functions in each tunnel-based LAN installation, such as, for example: (1) checking configuration and performance statistics associated with the computing platform and the OS of each system , \u2032, as well as configuration and performance statistics associated with the LAN hub , and LAN router , and the LAN http\/Servlet Server ; (2) monitoring configuration parameters and performance statistics of the network, systems and subsystems of the tunnel-based LAN using the \u201cread\u201d capabilities of SNMP agents; (3) configuring services provided at the network, system and subsystem level of the tunnel-based LAN using the \u201cwrite\u201d capabilities of SNMP agents; and (4) providing other levels of remote servicing using the read and\/or write capabilities of SNMP agents built into each system  and \u2032, and other components of the tunnel-based LAN .","SNMP Agents are the entities that interface to the actual \u201cdevice\u201d being managed. Examples of managed \u201cdevices\u201d in a tunnel-based LAN which may contain managed \u201cobjects\u201d, include: network bridges; hubs; routers; network servers; Object Identification And Attribute Acquisition Systems , and \u2032; the PLIIM-Based Object Identification Subsystem \u2032; the IFD Module (i.e. Camera Subsystem); the Image Processing Computer; the Camera Control Computer; the RFID-Based Object Identification Subsystem; the Data Element Queuing, Handling And Processing (QHP) Subsystem ; the LDIP-Based Object Identification, Velocity-Measurement, And Dimensioning Subsystem; the Object Velocity Measurement Subsystem; the Object H\/W\/L Profiling Subsystem; the Object Detection subsystem; an X-ray scanning subsystem; a Neutron-beam scanning subsystem; and any other object attribute producing subsystem configured with a particular system may include an object attribute code indicating the attributes which it generates during its operation.","Managed \u201cobjects\u201d can include, for example: hardware and\/or software based systems, subsystems, modules, and\/or components thereof such as, for example, the PLIIM-based subsystem \u2032 and components therein (e.g. the linear image detection array in the IFD module), the LDIP subsystem  and components therein (e.g. the polygon scanning mechanism), PLIAs and PLIMs employed therein, the Camera Control Computer, and the like; configuration parameters at the network, system and subsystem level; performance statistics associated with the network, systems and subsystems employed therein; and other monitorable parameters (i.e. variables) that directly relate to the current operation of the device in question.","The managed objects are arranged in what is known as a virtual information database, called a Management Information Base (MIB). Such virtual information databases, or MIBs, can be maintained locally at each object identification and attribute acquisition system , \u2032, as well as centrally at a database server somewhere in the tunnel-based LAN, as shown in FIG. A. However, in each case, the MIB must be retrievable and modifiable. SNMP actually performs the data retrieval and modification operations. SNMP allows managers and agents to communicate for the purpose of accessing these objects whether they are stored locally or centrally.","The Structure of Management Information (SMI) in the manager\/agent paradigm described above, organizes, names and describes information so that logical access can occur. The SMI states that each managed object must have a name, a syntax, and an encoding. The name, an object identifier (OID), uniquely identifies or names the MIB object in an abstract tree with an unnamed root; individual data items make up the leaves of the tree, and while the MIB tree has standardized branches, containing objects grouped by protocol (including TCP, IP, UDP, SNMP and others) and other categories (including \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cinterfaces\u201d). The syntax defines the data type, such as an integer or string of octets. The encoding describes how the information associated with the managed objects is serialized for transmission between machines.","The MIB tree is extensible by virtue of experimental and private branches which vendors, such as Metrologic Instruments, Inc., assignee of the present application, can define to include instances of its own products. As will be explained in greater detail below, an unique OID will be created and assigned to each MIB object to be managed within a device in the tunnel-based LAN in order to uniquely identify the MIB object in the MIB tree.","Management Information Bases (MIBs) are a collection of definitions, which define the properties of the managed object within the device (e.g. system , \u2032) to be managed. Every managed device keeps a database of values for each of the definitions written in the MIB. Collections of related managed objects are defined in specific MIB modules. The MIB is not the actual database itself; it is implementation dependant. The definition of the MIB conforms the SMI. One can think of the MIB as an information warehouse which can be local as well as central.","Interactions between the remote network management system (NMS) , referred to as the RMCS management console, and managed devices in the tunnel-based LAN , can be any of the four different types of commands:\n\n","As shown in , the data management computer  employed within each object identification and attribute acquisition system , and \u2032 identification and attribute acquisition system  is realized as complete micro-computing system running operating system (OS) software (e.g. Microsoft NT, Unix, Solaris, Linux, or the like), and providing full support for various protocols, including: Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP); File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP); Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent; and Simple Message Transport Protocol (SMTP).","At the network level of a tunnel-based network, and thus of the RMCS system , there is a set of network level parameters which serve to describe the configuration and state of each LAN on the Internet. At the system level thereof, there is a set of system level parameters which serve to describe the configuration and state of each system within a given network on the Internet. Similarly, at the subsystem level, thereof there is a set of subsystem level parameters which serve to describe the configuration and state of each subsystem within any given system within any given network on the Internet.","In , the system and subsystem structure of an exemplary tunnel-based system  is schematically illustrated in greater detail to show the environment in which the RMCS system and associated method thereof operates. In , several object attribute data producing systems (e.g. neutron-based scanning subsystem and x-ray scanning subsystem) are shown as subsystems of the Object Identification And Attribute Acquisition System .","In , a table is presented listing the network configuration parameters of the tunnel-based system, its system configuration parameters, its performance statistics, and the monitorable performance parameters and configuration for each subsystem within each system in the tunnel-based system.","In accordance with the present invention, such parameters identified above are used to create a MIB OID for each SNMP \u201cobject\u201d within a \u201cdevice\u201d to be managed in each tunnel-based LAN .","As shown in , the network configuration parameters for each tunnel-based LAN  might typically include, for example: router IP address; the number of nodes (i.e. systems) in LAN; passwords, and LAN location; name of customer facility; name of technical contact; the phone number of the technical contact; the domain name assigned to the LAN; the object identity (i.e. identification) codes (OIC) assigned to subsystems (e.g. bar code readers and RFID readers) within the tunnel-based system capable of identifying objects, and inherited by the systems and networks employing said subsystems; object attribute acquisition codes (OAAC) assigned to subsystems within systems and networks, capable of acquiring object attributes (e.g. by either generation or collection processes) and object attribute data producing devices (e.g. X-ray scanners, PFNA scanners, QRA scanners, and the like).","As shown in , the system configuration parameters for each tunnel-based LAN  might typically include, for example: system IP address, passwords; object identity codes OIC); object attribute acquisition codes (OAAC); etc.","As shown in , each subsystem within each system in a specified tunnel-based LAN  will have one or more monitorable and\/or configurable parameters. For example, PLIIM-based object identification subsystem may include the following parameters: object identity code; and object attribute acquisition codes. The PLIM Subsystem may include the following parameters: VLD status; power VLD; TIM function; temperature, etc. The IFD module (Camera Subsystem) may include the parameter: Sensor Temperature. The Image Processing Computer may include the following parameters: processor load history; system up time; number of frames (pgs); bar code read rate; current line rate; etc. The Camera Control Computer may include the following parameters: number of frames dropped; number of focused zoom commands; number and kinds of motor control errors; etc. RFID-based object identification subsystem might include an object identity code as a parameter.","The data element queuing, handling and processing subsystem  might include object identity and attribute codes indicating the types of data elements which it is programmed to handle. The LDIP-based object identification, velocity-measurement, and dimensioning subsystem  might include the object identity codes indicating the types of object attributes which it generates during its operation. Object velocity measurement subsystem might include the following parameters: polygon RPM; polygon laser output X; channel X drift; channel X noise; trigger error events; instant lock reference drift; and temperature. The Object H\/W\/L profiling subsystem may include the object identity codes indicating the types of object attributes which it generates during its operation. The Object detection subsystem may include an object attribute code (e.g. non-singulation\/singulation code) indicating the attributes which it generates during its operation. Also, an X-ray scanning subsystem, a Neutron-beam scanning subsystem, and any other object attribute producing subsystem configured with a particular system may include an object attribute code indicating the attributes which it generates during its operation.","In general, the RMCS management console can be realized in a variety of ways, depending on the requirements of the application at hand.","For example, a SNMP management console  can be constructed so as to enable the querying of each SNMP agent in each device being managed in the network, as well as reading and writing variables associated with managed objects in the network. In this embodiment, the SNMP management console enables communication with each and every SNMP agent in the tunnel-based LAN in order to communicate for the purpose of accessing SNMP objects whether they are stored locally or centrally. One advantage of this object management technique is that it only depends on SNMP and its elements, and does not require the support of an http Server  to serve a RMCS management console (GUI) to the service engineer or technician. However, such an SNMP management console is generally limited in terms of providing diagnostic and trouble-shooting tools which can be integrated into the management console, and thus the service engineer or technician with a more advanced level of monitoring, control and service required in industrial applications of the PLIIM-based object identification and attribute acquisition systems and networks of the present invention.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the RMCS management console  is realized by a GUI generated by one or more HTML-documents served from the LAN http\/Servlet server  during the practice of the RMCS method of the present invention. Preferably, the HTML-enabled RCMS management console (GUI) has a plurality of servlet-tags embedded within each HTML-encoded document of the GUI. These servlet tags are located beneath textual labels and\/or graphical icons which identify particular \u201cdevices\u201d and \u201cobjects\u201d in a particular tunnel-based LAN which are to being managed by the RMCS system and method of the present invention. The compiled servlet code associated with each embedded servlet tag is loaded on the LAN http\/Servlet Server  in a manner well known in the Applet\/Servlet arts. When the network administrator selects a particular servlet-tag on the RMCS management console GUI, viewed using an Internet-enabled browser program , the browser program automatically executes (on the server side of the network) the servlet-code loaded on the Server  at the URL specified by the selected servlet-tag. The executed servlet-code on the Server  automatically invokes a method (i.e. process) which requests the SNMP agent on a particular system (or node) of the tunnel-based network to read or write variables at a particular SNMP MIB, or perform a transversal operation within a managed device.","In the illustrative embodiment, when executed by a servlet selected from the RMCS management console (GUI), a specified method may initiate one of three possible SNMP agent operations: (1) the RCMS management console sends a READ command to the SNMP agent enabling the reading of variables maintained within the MIB of any specified managed device in the tunnel-based LAN, in order to monitor the same; (2) the RCMS management console sends a WRITE command to the SNMP agent to write variables stored within the MIB of any managed device in the tunnel-based LAN, to control the same; (3) the RMCS management console sends a TRANSVERSAL OPERATION command to the SNMP agent to determine which variables a managed device supports and to sequentially gather information from variable tables (e.g. IP routing tables, bar code error rate tables, performance statistics tables, etc.) in any managed devices; and (4); and the RMCS management console sends a TRAP commands to the SNMP agent, requesting that the SNMP agent asynchronously report certain events to the RCMS management console (i.e. NMS).","Notably, there are several advantages to using servlets in an HTML-encoded RMCS management console to trigger SNMP agent operations within devices managed within the tunnel-based LAN. For example, a servlet embedded in the RMCS management console can simultaneously invoke multiple methods on the server side of the network, to monitor (i.e. read) particular variables (e.g. parameters) in each object identification and attribute acquisition subsystem , and \u2032, and then process these monitored parameters for subsequent storage in a central MIB in the  and\/or display. A servlet embedded in the RMCS management console can invoke a method on the server side of the network, to control (i.e. write) particular variables (e.g. parameters) in a particular device being managed within the tunnel-based LAN. A servlet embedded in the RMCS management console can invoke a method on the server side of the network, to control (i.e. write) particular variables (e.g. parameters) in a particular device being managed within the tunnel-based LAN. A servlet embedded in the RMCS management console can invoke a method on the server side of the network, to determine which variables a managed device supports and to sequentially gather information from variable tables for processing and storage in a central MIB in database . Also, a servlet embedded in the RMCS management console can invoke a method on the server side of the network, to detect and asynchronously report certain events to the RCMS management console.","Notably, each object identification and attribute acquisition subsystem , and \u2032 in the tunnel-based LAN has an http server daemon, as well as SNMP, FTP, and SMTP. As such, in an alternative embodiment of the RMCS system and method of the present invention, it is possible to eliminate the use of the separate stand-alone http\/Servlet server  and backend database , and instead designate one of the http servers on the subsystems  and \u2032 to serve as the LAN http\/Servlet server, from which the RMCS management console (GUI) with its embedded servlets is served to the network administrator or system configuration engineer or technician.","The FTP service provided on each subsystem , and \u2032 (as well as on subsystem , \u2032 as well) enables the uploading of system and application software from an FTP site, as well as downloading of diagnostic error tables maintained in, for example, a central MIB database .
