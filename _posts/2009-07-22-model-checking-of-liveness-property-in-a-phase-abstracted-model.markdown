title: Model checking of liveness property in a phase abstracted model
abstract: Phase abstraction may be utilized to increase efficiency of model checking techniques. A liveness property may be checked in respect to a phase abstracted model by modifying the liveness property in accordance with the phase abstracted model. A fairness property may be modified to ensure that the fairness property is held by the model checker. A counter-example produced by a model checker is modified to be in accordance to an original model. The counter-example comprises a repetitive behavior. The counter-example may be modified to shorten the repetitive behavior or to apply the repetitive behavior in an earlier cycle of the counter-example.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to formal verification in general, and to model checking of liveness properties in particular.","Computerized devices are an important part of the modern life. They control almost every aspect of our life\u2014from writing documents to controlling traffic lights. However, computerized devices are bug-prone, and thus require a testing phase in which the bugs should be discovered. The testing phase is considered one of the most difficult tasks in developing a computerized device. Many developers of computerized devices invest a significant portion, such as 70%, of the development cycle to discover erroneous behaviors of the computerized device, also referred to as a target computerized system. The target computerized system may comprise hardware, software, firmware, a combination thereof and the like.","During the testing phase formal verification techniques may be applied to verify that a predetermined property is held. Formal verification may utilize a model checker to verify that the predetermined property, also referred to as a specification, is held. A model, also referred to as a design, represents a set of Boolean variables and functions for determining their values depending on environment inputs and on a portion of the set of Boolean variables. The Boolean variables are also referred to as registers. The model therefore represents all possible behaviors of the target computerized system over discrete time, also referred to as cycles. A gate in a model represents a portion of the model having a value, such as a variable, an outcome of a function based on values of one or more variables and the like.","The predetermined property may be a safety properties, in case it may be refuted using a finite counter-example. The predetermined property may be a liveness property in case it may only be refuted using an infinite counter-example. For example, a safety property may state that a \u201cbad\u201d event never happens, and be refuted by showing an exemplary finite trace in which the last state comprises the \u201cbad\u201d event occurring; whereas a liveness property may state that a \u201cgood\u201d event eventually happens, for example, that \u201cProcess A eventually enters the critical section\u201d. A refutation of such liveness property may be provided by showing an infinite trace in which the \u201cgood\u201d event never occurs.","Some additional exemplary liveness properties may be \u201cstarvation freedom\u201d, e.g., ensuring that the progress is always made; termination, e.g. ensuring that the final instruction may always be completed; \u201cguaranteed service\u201d, e.g. a service may always be eventually serviced and the like.","A counter-example for a liveness property is a description of an infinite behavior of the target computerized system. The infinite behavior is described using a finite number of states which are divided to a prefix and a suffix. The suffix also referred to as a loop or a repetitive portion of the counter-example, represents a repetitive behavior of a finite number of states for which the first state occurs after the last state, and therefore describe an infinite behavior.","In order to insure an \u201cinteresting\u201d counter-example, the model may be required to comply with a fairness property. For example, in a model of a priority queue in which a message of high priority is passed before a message of low priority, a liveness property requiring that eventually every low priority message is removed from the queue may be refuted by a scenario in which in every cycle a new high priority message is received. An exemplary fairness property would require the input to provide both low priority and high priority messages.","In order to increase efficiency of the model checker, phase abstraction may be applied on an original model, producing a phase abstracted model. Phase abstraction is a technique that may reduce the size of a model by unfolding the transition relation function of the model, such that the transition relation function of the phase abstracted model represents more than one transitions in the model. Some may view a phase abstracted model as a model in which each cycle represents several cycles in the original model.","One exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computerized system comprising: a processor; an interface for receiving a phase abstracted model; an interface for receiving an original liveness property associated with the original model; and a property modifier for transforming the original liveness property to a phase abstracted liveness property.","Another exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a method comprising: retrieving a phase abstracted model, the phase abstracted model is a result of a phase abstraction on an original model; retrieving an original liveness property associated with the original model; and transforming the original liveness property to a phase abstracted liveness property; the transforming the original liveness property is performed using a processor; whereby the original liveness property is transformed to the phase abstracted liveness property that may be checked in respect to the phase abstracted model.","Yet another exemplary embodiment of the disclosed subject matter is a computer program product comprising: a computer readable medium; first program instruction for retrieving a phase abstracted model, the phase abstracted model is a result of a phase abstraction on an original model; second program instruction for retrieving an original liveness property associated with the original model; and third program instruction for transforming the original liveness property to a phase abstracted liveness property; wherein the first, second and third program instructions are stored on the computer readable medium.","The disclosed subject matter is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the subject matter. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions.

Yet another technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is to provide a counter-example relating to the original model. Yet another technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is to provide a minimized counter-example, such as that a repetitive portion of the counter-example comprises a relatively small number of cycles or that the repetitive portion begins in the counter-example in a relatively early cycle.","One technical solution is to determine a phase abstracted liveness property in respect to the original liveness property. Another technical solution is to conjunct gates in the phase abstracted model to determine a phase abstracted liveness property. Yet another technical solution is to determine a phase abstracted fairness property in respect to the original fairness property. Yet another technical solution is to disjunct gates in the phase abstracted model to determine a phase abstracted fairness property. Yet another technical solution is to determine a cycle in the original model associated with a cycle in the phase abstracted model in which a repetitive behavior may end. Yet another technical solution is to determine a cycle in the original model associated with a cycle in the phase abstracted model in which a repetitive behavior may begin. Yet another technical solution is to determine a second repetitive behavior associated with a first repetitive behavior; the second repetitive behavior comprises less cycles than the first repetitive behavior; the first and second repetitive behaviors are comprised by a counter-example. Yet another technical solution is to determine a deterministic counter-example based on a non-deterministic counter-example associated with a liveness property. Yet another technical solution is to determine a deterministic counter-example using a satisfiability solver.","One technical effect of utilizing the disclosed subject matter is transforming an original liveness property to a phase abstracted liveness property. Another technical effect of utilizing the disclosed subject matter is transforming an original fairness property to a phase abstracted fairness property. Yet another technical solution of utilizing the disclosed subject matter is determining a counter-example based on an original counter-example generated in respect to a liveness property and a phase abstracted model.","Referring now to  showing a computerized environment in which the disclosed subject matter is used, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the subject matter.","A computerized environment  may comprise a phase abstraction module  which may transform an original model  to a phase abstracted model . A cycle in the phase abstracted model , also referred to as a frame, is associated with a predetermined number of cycles in the original model , such as for example four cycles. For a first register in the original model  the phase abstracted model  may comprise several registers associated with the first register. The several registers may represent a value of the first register in a frame. For example, in case the frame is four cycles, there may be four registers associated with the value of the first register, each corresponding to a different cycle in the frame, such as the first cycle of every frame, the second cycle of every frame and the like. A gate in the phase abstracted model associated with another gate in the original model in a cycle of a frame is also referred to as an unfolded gate.","The computerized environment  may comprise a phase abstraction adapter  configured to adapt an original liveness property  in accordance with the phase abstracted model .

In some exemplary embodiments, the property modifier  may comprise a liveness gate identifier  configured to identify one or more unfolded gates in the phase abstracted model that are associated with the original liveness property. The one or more unfolded gates may be associated with a gate in the original model that is associated with the original liveness property.","In some exemplary embodiments, an original liveness property is refuted by exemplifying a behavior in which a value of a gate remains TRUE. The property modifier  may determine the phase abstracted liveness property to be a conjunction of the one or more unfolded gates in the phase abstracted model.","The phase abstraction adapter  may comprise a fairness property identification module  for identifying or otherwise determining an original fairness property. The fairness property identification module  may determine a definition in a model that defines a fairness property such as for example a fairness directive in PSL\/Sugar specification language.","The phase abstraction adapter  may comprise a fairness modification module  for modifying or otherwise transforming the original fairness property to a phase abstracted fairness property.

A counter-example manipulation module , such as  of , may be configured to transform an original counter-example to a modified counter-example. The original counter-example may be produced or otherwise determined by a model checker in respect to the phase abstracted model and the phase abstracted liveness property. The modified counter-example may be associated with the original model and the original liveness property.","The counter-example manipulation module  may comprise an interface , similar to  of .

The unfolding module  may perform an iterative process in which each a value of a gate is determined in each cycle to be the value of an unfolded gate. For example, in case a frame comprises four cycles, a value of a gate in cycle ten is set to a value of a third unfolded gate in the second cycle of the phase adapted model, as the second cycle of the phase adapted model represents cycles eight to eleven in the original model.","In some exemplary embodiments, the unfolding module  may truncate the modified counter-example such that the modified counter-example comprise a loop.

The original counter-example exemplifies a falsification of a phase abstracted liveness property by a phase abstracted model.","In step , the original counter-example is unfolded to an unfolded counter-example. The unfolded counter-example is associated with the original model. Step  may be performed by an unfolding module such as  of . In some exemplary embodiment, step  is performed by iterating over unfolded gates in the phase abstracted model associated with a gate in the original model and for each frame in the original counter-example copy the value of the M-th unfolded gate to the value of the gate at cycle M\u22121+I*K, where I is the frame and K is a number of cycles in a frame.

The last K cycles may be examined to determine which of the K states in the K cycles is a predecessor state of the first state of the repetitive portion of the unfolded counter-example. The determined predecessor state may be determined to be the last cycle of the unfolded counter-example. The cycles after the last cycle may be removed from the unfolded counter-example.","In step , a determination may be made whether the repetitive portion may start in an earlier cycle in the unfolded counter example. Step  may be performed by an early loop determination module such as  of . In some exemplary embodiments, some cycles before the repetitive portion are examined to determine if any of the some cycles is equal to the cycle beginning the repetitive portion. Alternatively, the some cycles may be examined to determine if they are the next state successive (according to the original model) to the state in the last cycle of the unfolded counter-example. If a cycle is identified, the unfolded counter-example may be modified such that the repetitive portion may begin in the cycle.","In step , a determination may be made whether the repetitive portion of the unfolded counter example may consist less cycles. Step  may be performed by a short loop determination module such as  of .
