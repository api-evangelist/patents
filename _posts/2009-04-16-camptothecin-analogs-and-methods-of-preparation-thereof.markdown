Topotecan (tpt) and CPT-11 are the first two members in the camptothecin family to gain Food and Drug Administration full approval status (topotecan in 1996 as second-line therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, topotecan again in 1998 for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, CPT-11 in 1998 as first-line therapy for colon cancer). Several other analogs of the camptothecin family such as GI-147211C, DX8951f, 9-aminocamptothecin (9-AC) and 9-nitrocamptothecin are in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. Each of the campothecins in clinical use undergoes relatively rapid hydrolysis in the bloodstream resulting in a marked loss of anticancer activity. It is the key \u03b1-hydroxylactone pharmacophore within clinically relevant camptothecins that hydrolyzes at physiological pH to yield a biologically-inactive and potentially toxic hydroxy carboxylate form.

G. \u201cReduced Albumin Binding Promotes the Stability and Activity of Topotecan in Human Blood\u201d, 34: 13722-13728 (1995), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Frequency-domain lifetime fluorometry experiments revealed that human serum albumin (HSA) preferentially binds camptothecin carboxylate with over a 100-fold higher affinity compared to camptothecin lactone. Mi, Z. and Burke, T. G. \u201cMarked Interspecies Variations Concerning the Interactions of Camptothecin with Serum Albumins: A Frequency-Domain Fluorescence Spectroscopic Study\u201d, 33: 12540-12545 (1994), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This differential binding of carboxylate over lactone results in camptothecin and 9-AC opening more rapidly and completely in the presence of HSA than in the absence of the protein. In human plasma, pH 7.4 and 37\u00b0 C., camptothecin and 9-AC both open rapidly and essentially completely to almost negligible 0.2% lactone levels at equilibrium. While the presence of HSA promotes lactone ring opening for camptothecin and 9-AC, red blood cells and lipid bilayers in general preferentially bind the electroneutral lactone forms of camptothecins over their respective negatively-charged carboxylate lactone forms.

The first involves the conversion of a standard camptothecin derivative to a homocamptothecin derivative by a series of steps involving disassembly of the normal lactone and reassembly of the homologated lactone. This route is limited because it requires an existing camptothecin to start. Furthermore, many existing camptothecin derivatives bear substituents that would not be expected to survive the harsh conditions of the refashioning of the lactone. This process requires reducing, oxidizing, strong acid, and strong base steps. The second route involves a total synthesis using a palladium catalyzed cyclization to form ring C. This route is limited by the availability of A-ring precursors and by the ability of the substituents thereon to survive the many subsequent steps of the synthesis. Furthermore, the synthesis does not appear to offer the possibility to introducing many B ring substituents, including the substituents described herein.","In contrast, the radical cascade synthetic schemes of the present invention are much more tolerant and flexible and can be used to make homocamptothecin derivatives with many A-, B-, or A\/B substitution patterns, as shown, for example, in . Generally, various reagents can be used in the radical cascade including, but not limited to, hexamethylditin, hexamethyldisilane, or tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane. The source of energy for this reaction can be a sun lamp or an ultraviolet lamp. The temperature is preferably set between approximately 25 and 150\u00b0 C. More preferably, the temperature is set at approximately 70\u00b0 C. There are generally no limitations upon the choice of solvent used other than inertness to the radical cascade. Preferred solvents include benzene, toluene, benzotrifluoride, acetonitrile, THF and tert-butanol. Also, there is very broad latitude in the choice of substituents on the alkyne (R) and the isonitrile (R-R) in the synthetic schemes of the present invention because of the mildness of the reaction conditions. In addition, in rare cases where suitable propargyl derivatives are not readily prepared, allyl derivatives can be substituted instead and the same final products are formed, albeit in lower yield.","The substituent on C20 (R) can also be widely varied since it derives from readily available allyl alcohols. Substituted esters can also be used in the Reformatsky reaction to provide compounds with substitutents on C20a (R). While the compounds of this invention might be used in racemic form for chemotherapy, it is more preferable to use samples that are exclusively or predominately the biologically active enantiomer at C20. Because of a change in priorities in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelogs Rules for assignment of absolute configuration, the C20 S enantiomer of a standard camptothecin generally has the same relative configuration as the C20 R enantiomer of the corresponding homocamptothecin. Racemic or enantiomerically enriched samples of homocamptothecin derivatives can be separated into their individual components by standard methods of liquid chromatography using commercially available chiral columns.

These interactions result in camptothecin opening more rapidly and completely in the presence of HSA than in the absence of the protein. In human plasma, pH 7.4 and 37\u00b0 C., camptothecin lactone opens rapidly and completely to the carboxylate form with a tvalue of 11 min and an almost negligible percentage of lactone at equilibrium value of 0.2%. In whole blood versus plasma, camptothecin displayed enhanced stability (tvalue of 22 min and a percentage of lactone at equilibrium value of 5.3%). The enhanced stability of camptothecin lactone in human blood was found to be a result of drug associations with the lipid bilayers of red blood cells. Camptothecin binds erythrocyte membranes, the drug localizes within the acyl chain region, and accordingly remains protected from hydrolysis.","The human blood stabilities of the several camptothecin analogs of clinical interest have also been compared. As was observed in the case of camptothecin, 9-aminocamptothecin (9-AC) was observed to hydrolyze almost completely (>99%) in PBS solution containing HSA. Although no attempt was made to spectroscopically quantify the relative binding affinities of the lactone and carboxylate forms of the 9-amino congener (because of the significantly reduced fluorescence quantum yields of 9-AC lactone and carboxylate species relative to camptothecin), HPLC data were consistent with HSA preferentially binding the carboxylate form of this agent over its lactone form. In plasma it was observed that >99.5% of the 9-amino analog of camptothecin converted to carboxylate, a finding which again closely parallels stability data obtained using camptothecin. In whole blood, <0.5% and 5.3% are the fractions of 9-aminocamptothecin and camptothecin, respectively, which remained in the lactone form at equilibrium. The approximately 10-fold higher level of lactone remaining at equilibrium for camptothecin relative to 9-aminocamptothecin may, in part, be accounted for by the enhanced lipophilicity and greater ability of camptothecin to transition from the aqueous environment and into erythrocyte membranes present in whole blood.","In contrast to the low levels of lactone remaining at equilibrium in whole human blood for camptothecin and 9-aminocamptothecin (<0.5% and 5.3%, respectively), topotecan (11.9%), CPT-11 (21.0%), and SN-38 (19.5%) all display improved blood stabilities. While lactone levels at equilibrium for topotecan are 20-fold greater than for 9-aminocamptothecin, the corresponding levels of lactone for CPT-11 and SN-38 are approximately 40-fold greater than in the case of 9-aminocamptothecin. The significant gains in the relative stabilities of topotecan, CPT-11, and SN-38 can be correlated to their favorable interactions with HSA. It is believed that structural substituents at the 7- and 9-positions hinder and prevent the preferential binding of the carboxylate drug forms by HSA. The technique of time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy has recently been used to demonstrate that, under experimental conditions where camptothecin carboxylate associates with HSA and tumbles in solution closely associated with the protein, the carboxylate forms of topotecan and CPT-11 do not associate with HSA. In the case of SN-38, direct spectroscopic evidence has been obtained which indicates that HSA preferentially binds the lactone form of this agent, thereby shifting the lactone-carboxylate equilibrium to the lactone.","These observations indicate that HSA plays an important role in determining the relative human blood stabilities of the camptothecins. In the cases of camptothecin and 9-aminocamptothecin, the protein acts as a sink for the carboxylate drug form, binding the opened ring species and thereby shifting the lactone-carboxylate equilibria to the right. However, in the cases of topotecan, CPT-11, and SN-38, no such preferential binding of the carboxylate drug form by HSA is observed. Opposite to the situation with camptothecin and its 9-amino analogue, HSA preferentially binds the lactone form of SN-38 which thereby promotes higher circulatory levels of this biologically active species.","The rapid and extensive loss of active drug that occurs with clinically relevant camptothecins indicates that it would be highly advantageous to identify camptothecins with improved human blood stabilities.","In the present studies we modified camptothecin in the A and B rings with the effect of: 1) reducing protein binding; 2) enhancing lipophilicity; and 3) producing both a concomitant reduction in carboxylate binding to human albumin while also enhancing lipophilicity. We also included an expanded E-ring in the design of the present compounds. Our studies have led to the design of novel A,B,E-ring modified camptothecins which are the most blood-stable and intrinsically potent camptothecin analogs yet to be identified, with blood stability parameters outcompeting the prior art compound homocamptothecin as well A,B-ring modified camptothecin analogs containing a conventional \u03b1-hydroxylactone functionality. The novel camptothecin analogs of the present invention display unique properties such as superior human blood stabilities in combination with high anticancer activities.","Fluorescence Anisotropy Titration Demonstrates that the Novel Homosilatecans of the Present Invention Display a Broad Range of Equilibrium Association Constants for Lipid Vesicles and that E-Ring Expansion Enhances the Lipophilicity of Silatecans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0096"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Fluorescence Spectral Parameters for Homosilatecans"},{"entry":"(DB-38, DB-81, DB-90, DB-91) in Solution and Bound to"},{"entry":"DMPC and DMPG SUVs."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Excitation",{}]},{"entry":[{},"(nm)","Emission (nm)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Compound (s)","PBS","PBS","DMPC","DMPG"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["DB-38","410","531","515","517"]},{"entry":["DB-81","380","452","443","442"]},{"entry":["DB-90","402","535","513","512"]},{"entry":["DB-91","394","554","441","426"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The intrinsic fluorescent nature of the lactone and carboxylate forms of homosilatecans allows for the sensitive method of steady-state fluorescence anisotropy titration to be employed to determine the strength of the binding interactions of the various analogs with lipid bilayers.","A steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (a) measurement is related to the rotational rate of the fluorescent molecule through the Perrin Equation:\n\n1+(\u03c4\/\u03c6)\n\nwhere ais the limiting fluorescence anisotropy in the absence of depolarizing rotations, \u03c4 is the excited-state lifetime, and \u03c6 is the rotational correlation time of the fluorophore.

Similarly, the lifetime value of camptothecin when associated with DMPC bilayers was measured at 37\u00b0 C., and the average value for membrane-bound drug was found to be 3.7 ns.","Thus the lifetime measurements described above indicate that the excited-state lifetime of camptothecin is relatively insensitive to alterations in microenvironment (for example, a change in solvent or fluorophore relocation from an aqueous milieu to a phospholipid membrane). For a fluorophore having a \u03c4 value that remains relatively constant during a transition which strongly impacts on its rotational motion (such as a change in solvent viscosity or fluorophore binding to large macromolecular assemblies such as liposomal particles), the Perrin equation indicates a direct relationship between a and \u03c6 values will exist (that is, as the \u03c6 value of the fluorescent compound increases, then so too does its steady-state anisotropy value).","It has been shown that the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy values of camptothecin analogs and novel homosilatecans are highly sensitive to solvent viscosity and to associations with small unilamellar lipid vesicles. For example, topotecan has an a value of 0.008 in PBS, but its a value increases 9-fold and 40-fold in the viscous solvents octanol and glycerol, respectively. A 21-fold enhancement in the a value of camptothecin is observed upon binding of drug to vesicles composed of either DMPC or DMPG. Because of the sensitivity of a of the camptothecin drugs to membrane associations, the method of fluorescence anisotropy titration was employed to study the equilibrium binding of camptothecin analogs with lipid bilayers. The experiment includes determining the a values for a set of samples where the drug concentration in each was held constant (typically 1 or 2 \u03bcM), while the lipid concentration among the members of a set was varied from 0 to 0.29 M.","As a consequence of the brilliant fluorescence emissions from the newly synthesized homosilatecans (a summary of the spectral parameters can be found in Table 1), the lipid bilayer adsorption isotherms summarized in  were relatively free from any background signal. The method of fluorescence anisotropy titration was used to construct the adsorption isotherms. The experiments were conducted at drug concentrations of 1 \u03bcM in PBS buffer (37\u00b0 C.). The anisotropy values of DB-38, DB-90 and DB-91 titrated much more rapidly than those of camptothecin or topotecan, indicating that the novel homosilatecans have much stronger interactions with these membranes than camptothecin and topotecan. Because of the potential of the lactone ring of the homosilatecans and camptothecins to hydrolyze in PBS, anisotropy values at each lipid concentration were determined immediately (approx. 1 min.) following the addition of the lactone form of each agent to the liposome suspension as to minimize any possibility of conversion to the carboxylate form. Using drug concentrations of 1 \u03bcM and long pass filters to isolate emitted light from background signal (that is, scattered exciting light and extraneous fluorescence signal resulting from the possible presence of impurities), signal levels from drugs dissolved in PBS buffer were typically 99.97% in the absence of membrane and greater than 98% in the presence of membrane. Adsorption isotherms were used to determine overall association constants for the homosilatecan, silatecan, and camptothecin drugs. Overall association constants are defined as:\n\n\n\nwhere [A] represents the concentration of bound drug, [A] represents the concentration of free drug, and [L] represents the total lipid concentration in the vesicle suspension. This equation is valid when the concentration of free lipid is approximately equal to the concentration of total lipid (that is, the concentration of free lipid is in significant excess over the concentration of bound drug). Provided this condition is satisfied, K may be determined from the inverse of the slope of a double reciprocal plot. In such a double reciprocal plot, 1\/fraction of the total drug bound is plotted vs. 1\/lipid concentration, with a y-intercept value of 1 (for a system displaying binding site homogeneity). Such double-reciprocal plots for the associations of the new homosilatecans analogs (both lactone and carboxylate forms) with DMPC and DMPG small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) preparations were linear with good correlation coefficients. The linearity of these plots, as well as the corresponding plots for drug associations with other types of membrane preparations, indicates that fluorophore binding at these lipid concentrations is adequately described by the above equation.\n","The studies summarized in Table 2 examine the structural basis of homosilatecan associations for lipid bilayers. Two types of membranes were included in these studies which were conducted under near physiological conditions of pH and temperature; these membranes include fluid-phase and electroneutral L-\u03b1-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC); and fluid-phase and negatively-charged L-\u03b1-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG).

The K values are subject to 10% uncertainty. One of the most striking features of the data contained in Table 2 is the strong modulation which can be achieved through the creation of A,B,E-ring modified camptothecins (for example, the homosilatecans known as DB-38, DB-90, and DB-91) or B,E-ring modified camptothecins (for example, the homosilatecan known as DB-81). Homosilatecans containing either a sole substitution at the 7 position or dual substitution at the 7 and 10 positions have been created and found to display very high lipophilicities. Included in Table 2 are camptothecin compounds (topotecan and camptothecin). For DB-81, the lipophilicity for DMPC membranes relative to corresponding value for topotecan increases over 1,400-fold. Data for these agents were included to show the highly lipophilic nature of the new homocamptothecins relative to compounds such as topotecan and camptothecin. From Table 2, it is clear that the compounds of the present invention are much more lipophilic than either camptothecin or topotecan.","Other interesting and unexpected findings are apparent upon inspection of the data contained in Table 2. Comparison of the Kvalues for two homosilatecan with their corresponding silatecan analogs (where the E-ring systems are \u03b2-hydroxylactone versus \u03b1-hydroxylactone moieties, respectively) indicate that the homocamptothecins display greater lipophilicity. For example, the Kvalues of the silatecan counterparts of DB-38 (CHJ-792, K=820 M) and DB-91 (DB-67, K=2,500 M) are approximately 2-fold to 3-fold less than for the corresponding homosilatecans. Thus, for DB-38 and DB-91 the expanded E-ring is a favorable consideration for membrane binding which, in turn, promotes drug stability in human blood.","Another surprising trend was observed for the homosilatecans when the carboxylate forms of the drugs were studied. A 3-fold decrease in the affinity for DMPC upon the opening of the lactone ring of camptothecin has previously been observed. Burke, T. G., Mishra, A. K., Wani, M. C. and Wall, M. E., \u201cLipid bilayer partitioning and stability of camptothecin drugs,\u201d 32: 5352-5364 (1993). For the DB-90 and DB-91 homocamptothecins, we observe a 10-fold decrease in DMPC binding upon ring opening. Hence, the homosilatecans not only display markedly enhanced lipophilicity but the levels of differential binding between the lactone and carboxylate forms appear to be significantly greater (10-fold versus 3-fold) relative to camptothecins containing \u03b1-hydroxylactone ring systems. The two considerations described above (high lipophilicity and higher differential binding of lactone over carboxylate forms) are contributing factors to the optimized blood stabilities which the homosilatecans display over camptothecin and homocamptothecin.","Direct Fluorescence Spectral Assessment of the Extensive Membrane Interactions of the DB-91 Homosilatecan with Red Blood Cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":["max ","max "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sup":"6 "},"The emission maxima for DB-91 in PBS is 554 nm. In the presence of red blood cells, a peak with a significantly lower \u03bbvalue is observed indicating that the agent is capable of partitioning into the red blood cell membranes. The membranes of the red blood cells provide a hydrophobic microenvironment where the protonated excited-state complexes can form and fluoresce from. Comparison of the emission spectra of DB-91 in the presence of human erythrocytes with that of clinically relevant 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), as illustrated in , indicate there is more extensive protonated excited-state complex formation in the case of DB-91. Similar to the studies of , the spectra of  were recorded in front-face cuvettes at 37\u00b0 C. using an SN-38 concentration of 10 \u03bcM and exciting light of 370 nm These findings corroborate model membrane studies indicating the membrane binding of SN-38 is significantly less than the extensive interactions noted for DB-91 (SN-38 displays a Kvalue of 300 Mwhereas DB-91 displays a Kvalue of 8,000 M). From our spectral studies we conclude the novel homosilatcan DB-91 is a more lipophilic, erythrocyte-interactive agent than the FDA-approved SN-38.","Homosilatecans Display Improved Stabilities in Aqueous Solution Relative to Camptothecins Containing \u03b1-hydroxylactone Pharmacophores.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIGS. 8 through 11"},"Although hydrolysis is observed at pH values of 7.4, 8.0, and 9.0, our data indicate that the lactone ring of homosilatecans is less labile (that is, significantly slower in undergoing hydrolysis) relative to both silatecans and camptothecins containing the conventional \u03b1-hydroxylactone ring moiety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"]},"In all cases, the agents containing the expanded E-ring or homosilatecan structures displayed markedly enhanced stability.

Thus, the present invention indicates that substitution of the A and B ring of homocamptothecin is a favorable factor with respect to blood stabilities. The likely explanation is that the unsubstituted homocamptothecin carboxylate, like camptothecin carboxylate, binds HSA preferentially in the carboxylate form and effectively shifts the lactone-carboxylate equilibria to the right.","Our results indicate that dramatically improved human plasma stability can be realized by combining the \u03b2-hydroxylactone pharmacophore with the following concomitant structural changes: 1) B-ring modification such as a silyl or an silylalkyl functionality at position 7 (e.g. DB-81); 2) A-ring modification such as the structural modifications contained in topotecan (water-solubilizing changes such as inclusion of 9-dimethylaminomethyl and 10-hydroxy functionalities disfavor carboxylate binding to HSA; and 3) combined substitution in both the A and the B ring that includes, for example, a silyl or silylalkyl substituent at position 7 (e.g. DB-90 and DB-91).

The drugs contain the lactone ring moiety which, at pH 7.4, hydrolyzes to yield biologically-inactive carboxylate forms. Comparison of drug stabilities for 9-aminocamptothecin reveals that ring opening occurred to a much greater extent in human blood than mouse blood (see Table 4). Camptothecin has been shown previously to behave in a similar manner. Burke, T. G. Munshi, C. B., Mi, Z., and Jiang, Y., \u201cThe Important Role of Albumin in Determining the Relative Human Blood Stabilities of the Camptothecin Anticancer Drugs,\u201d 84, 518-519 (1995); and Mi, Z. and Burke, T. G., \u201cMarked Interspecies Variations Concerning the Interactions of Camptothecin with Serum Albumins: A Frequency-Domain Fluorescence Spectroscopic Study,\u201d 33, 12540-12545 (1994). We have used the technique of multifrequency phase-modulation spectroscopic analyses of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of camptothecin lactone and carboxylate to provide a physical explanation for the extensive ring opening observed for camptothecin and 9-aminocamptothecin in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA). HSA exhibits a marked 200-fold binding preference for the carboxylate (K=1.2\u00d710M) relative to the lactone (K\u22485.5\u00d710M). Serum albumins from other species were found to bind camptothecin carboxylate not nearly as tightly as HSA. Due to the unique capacity of human albumin to bind camptothecin carboxylate and 9-aminocamptothecin carboxylate resulting in extensive conversion of the drug to its biologically inactive form, it appears that the success of these agents in eradicating cancer in animal models may be inherently more difficult to duplicate in humans.","The data for the novel homosilatecans of the current invention show essentially only minor variations between lactone levels in mouse blood versus human blood. The noted changes in mouse versus animal blood are very small relative to the 100-fold difference in lactone levels observed for 9-aminocamptothecin. In mouse blood experiments for DB-81 and DB-91, the lactone levels actually observed in human blood are modestly underestimated by values of 6% and 20%, respectively. However, for 9-aminocamptothecin mouse blood overestimates by 100-fold the lactone levels actually observed in human blood.

Small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) suspensions were prepared the day of an experiment by a methodology reported previously Burke and Tritton, Biochemistry 24 5972-5980 (1985); and Burke, T. G., Mishra, A. K., Wani, M. C. and Wall, M. E. \u201cLipid bilayer partitioning and stability of camptothecin drugs,\u201d 32: 5352-5364 (1993), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, stock lipid suspensions containing known amount of lipid (200 mg\/mL lipid or less) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) were prepared by Vortex mixing for 5-10 min above the Tof the lipid. The lipid dispersions were then sonicated using a bath-type sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Co., Hicksville, N.Y.) for 3-4 h until they became optically clear. A decrease in pH from 7.4 to 6.8 was observed for the SUV preparations of DMPG; therefore, the pH of these SUV suspensions was adjusted to 7.4 using small quantities of 2.5 M NaOH in PBS, followed by additional sonication. Each type of vesicle suspension was annealed for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. and then used in an experiment.","Fluorescence Instrumentation. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were obtained on a SLM Model 9850 spectrofluorometer with a thermostated cuvette compartment. This instrument was interfaced with an IBM PS\/2 model 55 SX computer. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded with an excitation resolution of 8 nm and an emission resolution of 4 nm. In all cases spectra were corrected for background fluorescence and scatter from unlabeled lipids or from solvents by subtraction of the spectrum of a blank. Steady-state fluorescence intensity measurements were made in the absence of polarizers. Steady-state anisotropy (a) measurements were determined with the instrument in the \u201cT-format\u201d for simultaneous measurement of two polarized intensities. The alignment of polarizers was checked routinely using a dilute suspension of 0.25 \u03bcm polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, Pa.) in water and anisotropy values of >0.99 were obtained. Alternatively, polarizer orientation was checked using a dilute solution of glycogen in water. The anisotropy was calculated from a=(I\u2212GI)\/(I+GI), where G=I\/Iand the subscripts refer to vertical and horizontal orientations of the excitation and emission polarizers, respectively.","Anisotropy measurements for homosilatecans and camptothecins were conducted using exciting light of 370 to 400 nm and long pass filters on each emission channel to isolate the drug's fluorescence signal from background scatter and\/or residual fluorescence. All emission filters were obtained from Oriel Corp (Stamford, Conn.). The combination of exciting light and emission filters allowed adequate separation of fluorescence from background signal. The contribution of background fluorescence, together with scattered light, was typically less than 1% of the total intensity. Since the lactone rings of camptothecin and related congeners undergo hydrolysis in aqueous medium with half-lives of approximately 20 min., all measurements were completed within the shortest possible time (ca. 0.5 to 1 min) after mixing the drug stock solution with thermally pre-equilibrated solutions such that the experiments were free of hydrolysis product. In fluorescence spectroscopic experiments designed to provide information concerning the interactions of homosilatecans and camptothecins with red blood cells, drug concentrations of 10 \u03bcM were used. Experiments with red blood cells were carried out in front-face quartz cuvettes to optimize fluorescence signal and minimize scattered light.","Determination of Equilibrium Binding Constants. The method of fluorescence anisotropy titration as reported by Burke, T. G., Mishra, A. K., Wani, M. C. and Wall, M. E. \u201cLipid bilayer partitioning and stability of camptothecin drugs,\u201d 32: 5352-5364 (1993), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, was employed to determine the concentrations of free and bound species of drug in liposome suspensions containing a total drug concentration of 1\u00d710M and varying lipid concentrations. All experiments were conducted in glass tubes. The overall association constants are defined as K=[A]\/[A][L] where [A] represents the concentration of bound drug, [A] represents the concentration of free drug, and [L] represents the total lipid concentration of the sample. Double-reciprocal plots of the binding isotherms {1\/(bound fraction of drug) vs. 1\/[lipid]} were linear and K values were determined from their slopes by the method of linear least squares analysis. A computer program based on the K=[A]\/[A][L] relationship was written to predict bound drug levels for specified values of K and total drug.","Kinetics of Lactone Ring Opening of Homosilatecans, Silatecans, and Camptothecins. The hydrolysis kinetics of camptothecins in the presence of different blood components were determined by a quantitative C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay modified from methodologies described previously in the literature cited above. The preparation of whole blood and fractionated blood samples was carried out as described previously. Crystallized HSA of high purity (>97%) from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, Mo.) was used. HSA stock solutions were prepared in PBS buffer with a final pH of 7.40\u00b10.05. HSA concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 278 nm using an extinction coefficient of 39,800 Mcm(Porter, 1992). All other agents were reagent grade and were used without further purification. High purity water provided by a Milli-Q UV PLUS purification system (Bedford, Mass.) was utilized in all experiments. HPLC solvents were from Fisher Scientific. Human plasma and red blood cells were obtained from Central Kentucky Blood Center. Whole blood was obtained from a male donor in heparinized tubes, stored at 5-10\u00b0 C. and used as soon as possible (typically within 1 week). Blood from mice was collected in heparinized tubes and stored at 5-10\u00b0 C. until use.","HPLC assays were performed either on a Waters Alliance 2690 HPLC system equipped with a temperature-controlled autosampler and Waters 474 scanning fluorescence detector. A second HPLC system was composed of a Waters HPLC system composed of 501 HPLC pumps, 717 Plus temperature-controlled autosampler and 470 scanning fluorescence detector. The HPLC assay procedures used for the homosilatecans are summarized below. Solvent A consisted of acetonitrile and Solvent B was 2% triethylammonium acetate, pH 5.5, with a flow rate of 1 ml\/min. For DB-38 an isocratic elution was used: 33% Solvent A; 67% Solvent B; \u03bb:345 nm and \u03bb:518 nm. For DB-81 an isocratic elution was used: 56% Solvent A; 44% Solvent B; and \u03bb:375 nm and \u03bb:444 nm. For DB-90 an isocratic elution was used: 41% Solvent A; 59% Solvent B; \u03bb:412 nm and \u03bb:526 nm. For DB-91 an isocratic elution of 42% Solvent A, 58% Solvent B, and \u03bb:392 nm and \u03bb:562 nm.","To determine the stabilities of homosilatecans in PBS, an aliquot of each of the homosilatecans in DMSO was added to phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 in a HPLC autosampler vial maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in a water bath to result in final drug concentration of 1 \u03bcM. The drug-containing vial was quickly transferred to the autosampler maintained at 37\u00b0 C. and aliquots analyzed at various time points. All the determinations were done in triplicate. The data was collected and analyzed using Waters Millennium software. The fraction of lactone was calculated using the peak area of lactone and carboxylate peak and using the lactone\/carboxylate ratio.","To determine drug stability in whole blood, whole blood was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min and pH determined. Blood pH was adjusted to 7.4+\/\u22120.5 using either 0.1 M KOH or 0.1 M HCl. Blood samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min and pH remeasured to ensure that it is within the range before an individual assay was started. Aliquots of blood (2 ml each) were removed and placed in three disposable glass test tubes and the tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. An aliquot of drug in DMSO was then added to the blood to result in a final drug concentration of 1 \u03bcM. Incubation at 37\u00b0 C. was continued and 150 \u03bcl aliquots were removed at different time points and added to 600 \u03bcl of cold methanol (\u221220\u00b0 C.) in an eppendorf tube. The tube was then vortexed for 10 sec and centrifuged in a table top microcentrifuge at 8000 rpm for 45 sec. The Supernatant was removed and placed in an autosampler vial and the vial quickly added to the autosampler maintained at 4\u00b0 C. The sample was analyzed immediately on the HPLC set-up.

Fluorescence emission data were recorded for homosilatecans in solutions of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and ethanol. Data were also acquired for the new agents in the presence of suspensions of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of either electroneutral dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in PBS or negatively-charged dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) in PBS. Lipid concentrations of 5 mM were used. For DB-38 all spectra were recorded using exciting light of 410 nm at 37\u00b0 C. The emission maxima for DB-38 in PBS is 531 nm and this value shifts to lower values in the presence of membranes (\u03bbof 515 nm in the presence of DMPC vesicles and \u03bbof 517 nm in the presence of DMPG vesicles). The spectral shifts of DB-38 which occur in the presence of membranes indicate that the agent is capable of binding both electroneutral and negatively-charged membranes. Spectral recordings were initiated and completed shortly after the addition of the lactone form of the agent to solution or suspension, thereby assuring that the detected signal originates predominantly from the lactone form of the agent (and not the ring-opened form).","Fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM 7-t-butyldimethylsilylhomocamptothecin (DB-81) were also examined. Lipid concentrations of 10 mM were used. All spectra were recorded using exciting light of 380 nm at 37\u00b0 C. The emission maxima for DB-81 in PBS buffer is 452 nm and this value shifts to lower values in the presence of membranes (\u03bbof 443 nm in the presence of DMPC vesicles and \u03bbof 442 nm in the presence of DMPG vesicles). The spectral shifts of DB-81 which occur in the presence of membranes indicate that the agent is capable of binding both electroneutral and negatively-charged membranes.","The fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-aminohomocamptothecin (DB-90) was also examined. All spectra were recorded using exciting light of 430 nm at 37\u00b0 C. The emission maxima for DB-90 in PBS is 535 nm and this value shifts to lower values in the presence of membranes (\u03bbof 513 nm in the presence of DMPC vesicles and \u03bbof 512 nm in the presence of DMPG vesicles).","The fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxy-homocamptothecin (DB-91) was also studied. Lipid concentrations of 10 mM were used. All spectra were recorded using exciting light of 394 nm at 37\u00b0 C. The emission maxima for DB-91 in PBS is 554 nm and this value shifts to lower values in the presence of membranes (\u03bbof 441 nm in the presence of DMPC vesicles and \u03bbof 434 nm in the presence of DMPG vesicles","The fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM of the carboxylate form of 7-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl-10-aminohomocamptothecin (DB90 carboxylate) was also studied. Lipid concentrations of 0.15 mm were used. The concentration of lipid used in these experiments was greater than in the experiments conducted using the corresponding lactone form of DB-90; the higher lipid concentrations were used because of the reduced membrane associations of the opened-ring form of the drug relative to the closed-ring lactone form of the drug. All spectra were recorded using exciting light of 430 nm at 37\u00b0 C. The emission maxima for DB-90 carboxylate in PBS is 529 nm and this value shifts to lower values in the presence of membranes (\u03bbof 512 nm in the presence of DMPC vesicles and \u03bbof 512 nm in the presence of DMPG vesicles","The fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM of the ring-opened or carboxylate form of 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxyhomocamptothecin (DB-91 carboxylate) were also acquired. Lipid concentrations of 0.15 M were used (the higher concentration of lipid required in these experiments to promote binding was necessitated by the reduced membrane associations of the opened-ring form of the agent relative to the closed-ring lactone form of the agent. The emission maxima for DB-91 carboxylate in PBS is 549 nm and this value shifts to lower values (\u03bbof 450 nm in the presence of DMPC vesicles and \u03bbof 446 nm in the presence of DMPG vesicles).","Normalized fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM of the lactone versus carboxylate forms of 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-aminohomocamptothecin (DB-90 and DB-90 carboxylate, respectively) in PBS at 37\u00b0 C. were studied. Fluorescence emission spectral data indicate that upon ring opening there is a slight shifting of the spectra to the shorter wavelength region (or shifting of the spectra more towards the blue region of light). The two spectra were recorded using exciting light of 402 nm.","Normalized fluorescence emission spectra of 1 \u03bcM of the lactone versus carboxylate forms of 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxylhomocamptothecin (DB-91 and DB-91 carboxylate, respectively) in PBS at 37\u00b0 C. were acquired. Fluorescence emission spectral data indicate that upon ring opening there is a slight shifting of the spectra to the shorter wavelength region (or shifting of the spectra more towards the blue region of light). The two spectra were recorded at 394 nm.","Direct Observation of Fluorescence Spectral Changes Upon Homosilatecan Partitioning in Red Blood Cells. Spectral recordings were initiated and completed shortly after the addition of the lactone form of the agent to solution, thereby assuring that the detected signal originates predominantly from the lactone form of the agent (and not the ring-opened form). The emission maxima for DB-91 in PBS is 554 nm but this value shifts significantly to a \u03bbof approximately 410 nm in anhydrous ethanol. Because DB-91 contains a 10-hydroxy functionality, the possibility exists that fluorescence can occur from two distinct species. In an aprotic solvent or non-aqueous microenvironment a protonated (with respect to the 10-hydroxy functionality) species predominates, while in protic solvents such as water a deprotonated excited-state complex predominates. The 554 nm peak is correlated with the deprotonated excited-state complex while the \u03bbof approximately 410 nm correlates with the protonated excited-state complex. The formation of the deprotonated excited-state complex is greatly facilitated by the presence of water; even at small amounts of water such as 1% a peak is apparent around 550 nm which correlates with the water-facilitated formation of the deprotonated excited-state complex. In  we study the extent of protonated excited-state complex formation and use this parameter as a relative measure of lipophilicity for two 7-modified campotothecins (DB-91 and SN-38) with each containing the 10-hydroxy functionality. Spectral recordings were initiated and completed shortly after the addition of the lactone form of the agent to solution, thereby assuring that the detected signal originates predominantly from the lactone form of the agent (and not the ring-opened form). The emission maxima for DB-91 in PBS is 554 nm. In the presence of red blood cells, a peak with a significantly lower \u03bbvalue is observed indicating that the agent is capable of partitioning into the red blood cell membranes. The membranes of the red blood cells provide a hydrophobic microenvironment from which the protonated excited-state complexes can form and fluoresce from. Comparison of the emission spectra of DB-91 in the presence of human erythrocytes with that of clinically relevant 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin () indicate there is more extensive protonated excited-state complex formation in the case of DB-91. These findings corroborate model membrane studies indicating the membrane binding of SN-38 is significantly less than the extensive interactions noted for DB-91 (SN-38 displays a Kvalue of 300 Mwhereas DB-91 displays a Kvalue of 8,000 M). The novel homosilatecan DB-91 is a more lipophilic, erythrocyte-interactive agent relative to the known compound 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38). The emission maxima for SN-38 in PBS is approximately 550 nm. The SN-38 agent, like DB-91, also contains a 10-hydroxy functionality and, as a consequence, SN-38 also displays fluorescence spectral characteristics which are sensitive to the presence of water. In the presence of red blood cells, a peak with a significantly lower \u03bbvalue (approximately 440 nm) is observed for SN-38 indicating that the agent is capable of partitioning into the red blood cell membranes. However, the peak at the lower \u03bbvalue is reduced for SN-38 relative to the situation observed for DB-91 (see ). These results indicate there is more extensive protonated excited-state complex formation in the case for DB-91, corroborating that the novel homosilatecan DB-91 is a more lipophilic, erythrocyte-interactive agent relative to the known compound 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38).","Anticancer Activities of Homosilatecans as Determined By In Vitro Cell Culture Experiments. Cytotoxicity measurements were conducted using MDA-MB-435 tumorigenic human breast cancer cells. The cells were exposed to a range of drug concentrations for 72 hr exposure periods and then viability was assessed using a sulphorrhodamine B (SRB) assay. The SRB measures the total protein levels in the living cells. Proteins from dead cells are lysed and removed in the washing step before TCA fixation. However, it is possible that cells in the early stage of death still have their membrane integrity and therefore retain the protein contents inside. As a result, the optical density at 490 nm can sometimes be overestimated and the cytotoxicity underestimated. To validate the SRB assay, a diverse range of chemotherapeutic agents have been tested across multiple panels of tumor cell lines, and close correlations have been found with standard tetrazolium (MIT) assay and clonogenic assays. The SRB assay is now a well regarded assay and was recently approved by NCI as a standard assay for anticancer drug screening. Using the SRB assay, the cytotoxicity values for cells exposed to our novel homosilatecans for 72 hrs. were determined. Cytotoxicities of homosilatecans and camptothecin against MDA-MB-435 tumorigenic metastatic human breast cancer cells in the absence and presence of human serum albumin were determined and are summarized in Table 5. Each ICvalue represents the average of three separate trials with each dosage level studied in triplicate.","To a round bottom flask was added N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (0.89 g, 7.6 mmol) followed by HO (10 mL) and t-BuOH (10 mL).
