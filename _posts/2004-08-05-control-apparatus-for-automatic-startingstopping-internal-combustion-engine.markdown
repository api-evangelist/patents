In such hybrid vehicles, a hybrid vehicle has been known that includes: an idle stop device which automatically stops the operation of the internal combustion engine when the vehicle is stopped due for example to the driver using the brakes, and automatically restarts the internal combustion engine when the internal combustion engine is stopped and it is detected that the driver has released the brakes; a flooding prevention device which prevents flooding of the exhaust pipes of the internal combustion engine; and a flooding removal device which removes water that has entered the exhaust pipe of the internal combustion engine (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H11-353995).","In this hybrid vehicle, the flooding prevention device includes, for example, a valve which blocks the exhaust pipe, and an actuator which changes an arrangement of the exhaust pipe. The flooding removal device includes, for example, a control device which starts the internal combustion engine so as to discharge water from the exhaust pipe by the exhaust pressure, or opens a drain valve equipped in the exhaust pipe.","If the water level outside the vehicle increases above a predetermined level and enters the exhaust system including a catalytic apparatus used for exhaust purification, it can negatively affect the exhaust system. The flooding prevention device is designed to prevent such an effect.","However, in the hybrid vehicle according to the example in the prior art above, the function of the flooding removal device is to prevent further flooding once it is detected that water has entered the exhaust pipe, and it does not necessarily obstruct water from entering the exhaust system.","The present invention takes the abovementioned situation into consideration with an object of providing a control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine which prevents water from entering the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine from the outside of the vehicle.","The present invention is a control apparatus for automatic for starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine which automatically stops or automatically starts an internal combustion engine provided as a driving source of a vehicle, depending on a driving state of the vehicle, including; a flooding determination device which determines whether there is a possibility of flooding into an exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not; and an automatic stop prohibiting device which prohibits the execution of automatic stopping of the internal combustion engine in a case where the flooding determination device determines that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine.","According to the present invention, if the determination is that there is a possibility of flooding occurring into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine, by prohibiting the automatic stopping of the internal combustion engine in an operating state, it is possible to maintain the desired exhaust pressure in the internal combustion engine, and to prevent water from entering the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine equipped with an exhaust gas purification apparatus and the like, from the outside of the vehicle.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided a starting device which automatically starts the internal combustion engine when in a stopped condition, in a case where the flooding determination device determines that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine.","According to the present invention, by automatically starting the internal combustion engine before reaching a condition where flooding occurs in the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine, it is possible to maintain a desired exhaust pressure in the internal combustion engine, and to prevent water from entering the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine equipped with an exhaust gas purification apparatus or the like, from the outside of the vehicle.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided a temperature sensor which detects an exhaust gas temperature or a quantity of state related to the temperature of the exhaust gas, and the flooding determination device determines whether there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not based on a detection value output from the temperature sensor.","According to the present invention, when an appropriate position of the exhaust system becomes flooded, the specific heat near this position increases. This results in, for example, a decrease in the response to temperature change near this position, with respect to a predetermined temperature change in the temperature of the exhaust gas or of the engine temperature of the internal combustion engine, and a decrease in the temperature change of this area. Due to this, it is possible to determine whether there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not, based on the detection value output from the temperature sensor installed inside the exhaust system.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping internal an combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided a plurality of the temperature sensors, and the flooding determination device determines whether there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not based on a difference between two detection values output from any two of the plurality of temperature sensors.","According to the present invention, the specific heat increases near the position where flooding occurs in the exhaust system. This results in, for example, a decrease in the response to temperature change near this position, with respect to a predetermined temperature change in the temperature of the exhaust gas or of the engine temperature of the internal combustion engine, and a decrease in the temperature change of this area. Due to this, the difference in the two detected values between a temperature sensor located in an area which is not flooded and a temperature sensor near the flooding area, compared to the difference in the detected values between two temperature sensors located in areas which are not flooded, increases above a predetermined temperature difference. As a result, based on the difference in the two detected values output from two temperature sensors chosen from a plurality of temperature sensors provided in the exhaust system, it is possible to determine whether there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided a liquid level sensor which is provided near an exhaust vent of the exhaust system in the internal combustion engine, and detects a liquid level position of liquid for detection, or a property related to the liquid level position, and the flooding determination device determines whether there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not based on a detection value output from the liquid level sensor.","According to the present invention, by using various types of liquid level sensors, for example, float type, optical type, and conduction type liquid level sensors, to detect the liquid level position near the exhaust vent of the exhaust system, such as the water level outside the vehicle, the quantity of state related to the liquid level position, and for example, whether the water level outside the vehicle has exceeded a predetermined water level or not, it is possible to determine whether there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine or not.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided an engine speed increasing device which increases a target engine speed for idle operation of the internal combustion engine by a predetermined amount, in a case where the flooding determination device determines that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine.","According to the present invention, in a case where it is determined that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine, by increasing the target engine speed for the idle operation of the internal combustion engine by a predetermined amount, it is possible to maintain the desired exhaust pressure in the internal combustion engine, and to prevent water from entering the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine equipped with an exhaust gas purification apparatus and the like, from the outside of the vehicle.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided a motor which is provided as a driving source for the vehicle separate to the internal combustion engine, and a prohibition device which prohibits execution of the automatic stopping operation of the internal combustion engine or prohibits the execution of an operation to drive the vehicle solely under the driving force from the motor, in a case where the flooding determination device determines that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine.","According to the present invention, in a case where it is determined that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine, by prohibiting the automatic stopping of the internal combustion engine in a operating state, it is possible to maintain the desired exhaust pressure of the internal combustion engine, and to prevent water from being sucked into the exhaust gas purification apparatus equipped in the internal combustion engine or the exhaust system. Furthermore, by prohibiting the execution of the operation of driving the vehicle solely under the driving force from the motor, it is possible continue the operation of the internal combustion engine in the driving state of the vehicle and maintain the desired exhaust pressure.","In the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine of the present invention, preferably there is provided a control device which switches from a state where the internal combustion engine in a stopped condition is automatically started, or where the vehicle is driven solely under the driving force from the motor, to a state where the vehicle is driven under the driving force from the internal combustion engine, in a case where the flooding determination device determines that there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine.","According to the present invention, by automatically starting the internal combustion engine before flooding occurs in the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine, it is possible to maintain the desired exhaust pressure in the internal combustion engine, and to prevent water from being sucked into the exhaust gas purification apparatus equipped in the internal combustion engine or the exhaust system.

Moreover, in a driving state of the vehicle, it is possible to prevent water from entering the exhaust system while maintaining a desired driving force.","Hereunder is a description of a control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine according to an embodiment of the present invention, with reference to the appended drawings.","The control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine  according to the present embodiment, for example as shown in , is installed in a four-wheel-drive type hybrid vehicle , wherein an internal combustion engine (ENG) , a front motor generator (F-M\/G)  and a transmission (T\/M)  are connected in series through a front differential DF to the front wheels Wf, and a rear motor generator (R-M\/G)  is connected through a rear differential DR to the rear wheels Wr. As shown in , the control apparatus includes; a main battery (BATT) , a front power drive unit (F-PDU) , a rear power drive unit (R-PDU) , a DC\u2014DC converter (DC\/DC) , an auxiliary battery , a battery ECU , a front motor ECU , a rear motor ECU , a FIECU , a T\/MECU  and a management ECU .","In the hybrid vehicle , the driving force from the internal combustion engine  and the front motor generator  is transferred from the transmission  such as an automatic transmission (AT), CVT, or a manual transmission (MT), through a clutch CF, to the front wheels Wf by the front differential DF which distributes the driving force between the left and right front wheels Wf.","The driving force from the rear motor generator  is transferred through a clutch CR, to the rear wheels Wr by the rear differential DR which distributes the driving force between the left and right rear wheels Wr.","Here, for example, if the clutch CF equipped in the front differential DF is engaged and the engagement of the clutch CR equipped in the rear differential DR is released, then only the front wheels Wf are driven creating a front wheel drive state. Furthermore, if the clutch CR is engaged, then both the front wheels Wf and the rear wheels Wr are driven creating a four-wheel-drive state. In this four-wheel-drive state, the distribution of driving force between the left and right rear wheels Wr is optionally controllable.","When the hybrid vehicle  is decelerating, if the driving force is transferred from the front wheels Wf to the front motor generator , and from the rear wheels Wr to the rear motor generator , the respective motor generators  and  function as generators which produce a so-called regenerative braking force, recovering the kinetic energy of the car body as electrical energy.","The driving and regeneration (power generation) operations of the respective motor generators  and  are performed by the respective power drive units  and  upon reception of control instructions from the respective motor ECUs  and .","To the power drive units  and  equipped for example with PWM inverters using pulse width modulation (PWM), is connected the main battery  of a high voltage system which performs transfer of electrical energy with the motor generators  and . This main battery  has a plurality of modules connected in series, where a module consists of a plurality of cells connected in series. Furthermore, to this main battery  is connected the 12-volt auxiliary battery  through the DC\u2014DC converter . This auxiliary battery  drives various auxiliary equipment.","The DC\u2014DC converter  which is controlled by the management ECU  charges the auxiliary battery  by stepping-down the terminal voltage of the main battery , or by stepping-down the voltage produced by the power generation of the respective motor generators  and  in the respective power drive units  and .","The respective power drive units  and  and the DC\u2014DC converter  are connected in parallel with respect to the main battery .","The battery ECU  not only protects the main battery , but also calculates the battery state of charge SOC and calculates the amount of discharge capable of being output from the main battery  and the amount of charge capable of being charged to the main battery . Furthermore, the battery ECU  can determine whether or not the main battery  is deteriorating according to the battery state of charge SOC, the detected values for the terminal voltage, the temperature, and the history of the change in the detected values for discharge current and charge current of the main battery . Therefore, to the battery ECU  is input a detection signal output from an electrical current sensor (not shown) which detects the input and output current of the main battery , and a detection signal output from an electrical voltage sensor (not shown) which detects the terminal voltages of the main battery .","The respective motor ECUs  and  control the driving and regeneration operations of the motor generators  and  in accordance with driving and regeneration torque instructions input from the management ECU .","The FIECU  controls the operating state of the internal combustion engine , such as the fuel supply amount from the fuel injection valve, the ignition timing of the igniter, and the operating state of the starter motor.","The T\/MECU  controls the speed-shifting operations of the transmission .","The management ECU  coordinatedly controls the respective operations of the battery ECU , the motor ECUs  and , the FIECU , the T\/MECU  and the DC\u2014DC converter.","The FIECU , as described later, controls the driving state of the vehicle. In particular, it controls the stopping and restarting of the idle operation of the internal combustion engine  according to the presence\/absence of flooding into the exhaust system or the possibility thereof. Here, the FIECU  determines the presence\/absence of flooding or the possibility of flooding, based for example on the temperature of the exhaust system.","For example, as shown in , an exhaust pipe  which is connected to the respective cylinders of the internal combustion engine  and constitutes an exhaust manifold is furnished with an exhaust purification apparatus  which purifies components such as HC, CO and NOx in the exhaust gas. This exhaust purification apparatus  is furnished with a CAT temperature sensor  which detects the temperature of the catalyst (catalyst temperature TCAT), and a detection signal output from the CAT temperature sensor  is input to the FIECU .","Furthermore, the exhaust pipe  is equipped with a muffler . Downstream from the muffler  is located an exhaust vent . Installed near this exhaust vent is an exhaust vent temperature sensor  which detects the temperature of the exhaust vent (exhaust vent temperature TEND). The detection signal output from the exhaust vent temperature sensor  is input to the FIECU .","For example, as shown in , if the internal combustion engine  is in the stopped condition for more than a predetermined time, and then is started at a time t, then after this time t the temperature of the exhaust gas introduced to the exhaust purification apparatus  (exhaust gas temperature, for example, equal to the catalyst temperature TCAT) rises with the increase in the engine temperature of the internal combustion engine .","For example, when driving normally in fine weather, and in a state where flooding into the exhaust vent does not occur, the exhaust vent temperature TEND (fine weather) is below that of the exhaust temperature for the catalyst atmosphere.","On the other hand, when driving normally in rainy weather, the exhaust vent temperature TEND (rainy weather) is below the corresponding exhaust vent temperature in fine weather TEND (fine weather). This is due to a relatively high humidity in the atmosphere.","Furthermore, when driving in a riverbed and the exhaust vent becomes flooded, then the exhaust vent temperature TEND (underwater) is below the corresponding exhaust vent temperature in rainy weather TEND (rainy weather) and also below a predetermined temperature.","Therefore, the temperature difference between the exhaust temperature and the exhaust vent temperature TEND (exhaust temperature-exhaust vent temperature TEND), as shown in , in a situation where flooding of the exhaust vent or the periphery of the exhaust vent occurs, increases over and above the predetermined temperature difference. Therefore, the FIECU  is able to distinguish between a state where flooding has occurred in the exhaust vent or in the periphery of the exhaust vent , and where flooding has not occurred in the exhaust vent or in the periphery of the exhaust vent (such as in fine weather and rainy weather), based on the temperature difference between different positions in the exhaust system.","Furthermore, for example, in a case where the internal combustion engine  is in a temporary idle stopped condition and then restarted, if the internal combustion engine  having a relatively high temperature is started, then as shown in , the temperature difference between the exhaust gas temperature of the catalyst atmosphere and the exhaust vent temperature TEND is above the predetermined temperature difference prior to starting the internal combustion engine at time t. Then, along with starting the internal combustion engine , high-temperature exhaust gas flows from the exhaust purification apparatus  to the exhaust vent . When the exhaust vent and the periphery of the exhaust vent are not flooded, the temperature difference between the exhaust gas temperature of the catalyst atmosphere and the exhaust vent temperature TEND declines below the predetermined temperature difference.","In this state, when driving in a riverbed and flooding of the exhaust vent or periphery of the exhaust vent occurs from time t onwards, the exhaust vent becomes cooled, resulting in an increase in the temperature difference between the exhaust gas temperature of the catalyst atmosphere and the exhaust vent temperature TEND, to above the predetermined temperature difference.","Therefore, based on the time-varying temperature difference between different positions in the exhaust system, the FIECU  is able to determine the presence\/absence of flooding into the exhaust system, and whether there is a possibility of flooding of the exhaust system or not.","If the FIECU  determines that flooding has occurred in the exhaust system, or there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system, execution of the idle stopping of the internal combustion engine  in a driving condition is prohibited, or the internal combustion engine  in an idle stopped condition is restarted, so as to prevent water from entering the exhaust system from the outside of the vehicle.","Moreover, when the FIECU  determines that flooding has occurred in the exhaust system, or there is a possibility of flooding into the exhaust system, execution of the operation to drive the vehicle solely under the driving force from the respective motor generators  and  is prohibited. Alternatively, the state may be switched from the state where the vehicle is driven solely under the driving force from the respective motor generators  and , to the state where the vehicle is driven under the driving force from the internal combustion engine .","At this point, the FIECU  increases the target engine speed for the idle operation of the internal combustion engine  by a predetermined speed, and increases the amount of exhaust gas, so as to prevent water from entering the exhaust system from the outside of the vehicle even further.","The control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine  according to the present embodiment includes the above construction. Next is a description with reference to the appended drawings, of an operation of this control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine , in particular, processing for; determining the presence\/absence of flooding into the exhaust system or the possibility thereof, based on the catalyst temperature TCAT output from the CAT temperature sensor , and the exhaust vent temperature TEND output from the exhaust vent temperature sensor , and determining whether it is possible to execute idle stopping of the internal combustion engine  or not according to the above determination, and whether it is possible to execute restarting of the internal combustion engine from an idle stopped condition.","Hereunder is a description of the processing for determining whether or not there is a possibility of flooding occurring into the internal combustion engine , with reference to . This processing is executed in the FIECU , being invoked at predetermined time intervals, for example every 10 msec, by a main routine (not shown).","First, in step S shown in , it is determined whether the catalyst temperature TCAT detected by the CAT temperature sensor  which is installed in the exhaust purification apparatus  and measures the temperature (TCAT) of the catalyst (CAT), is above a predetermined temperature TCAT, or not.","When the determination is \u201cYES\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S described later.","On the other hand, when the determination is \u201cNO\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S and the flag value of a flooding determination flag F_INUN is set to \u201c1\u201d. Subsequently the flow proceeds to step S, where the flag value of an idle rotation speed increase flag F_INEUP which indicates that the target engine speed in the idle operating state of the internal combustion engine  is increased by a predetermined rotation speed, is set to \u201c1\u201d. Once set, the series of processing is finished.","In step S, the temperature of the exhaust vent (TEND) of the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine  is detected by the exhaust vent temperature sensor , and the value obtained by subtracting the catalyst temperature TCAT from the exhaust vent temperature TEND is set to the temperature difference \u0394T.","Next, in step S, it is determined whether the temperature difference \u0394T is above a predetermined temperature difference \u0394T, or not.","When the determination of step S is \u201cYES\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S described above.","On the other hand, when the determination of step S is \u201cNO\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S.","In step S, the flag value of a flooding determination flag F_INUN is set to \u201c0\u201d, and the flow proceeds to step S.

This processing is executed in the FIECU  by being invoked at predetermined time intervals, for example 10 msec, by a main routine (not shown). Whether the idle stop will be executed or not is determined by the flag value of an idle stop execution determination flag F_FCMG When the value of the idle stop execution determination flag F_FCMG is \u201c1\u201d, then when returning to the main routine, idle stop control is executed. When the value of the idle stop execution determination flag F_FCMG is \u201c0\u201d, idle stop control is not executed.","Firstly, in step S shown in , it is determined whether the value of the idle stop execution determination flag F_FCMG is \u201c1\u201d or not.","When the determination is \u201cYES\u201d, then the series of processing is finished.","On the other hand, when the determination is \u201cNO\u201d, then the flow proceeds to step S.","In step S, it is determined whether the flag value of a flag F_MOTSTB which indicates that it is possible to start the internal combustion engine  by the driving force of the front motor generator , is \u201c1\u201d or not.","When the determination is \u201cNO\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S, shown in .

Furthermore, by prohibiting the execution of the operation to drive the vehicle solely under the driving force from the respective motor generators  and , it is possible to continue operating the internal combustion engine  in the driving state of the vehicle and maintain the desired exhaust pressure.","In addition, by automatically starting the internal combustion engine  before the exhaust system of the internal combustion engine  actually becomes flooded, it is possible to maintain the desired exhaust pressure of the internal combustion engine , and prevent water from entering the exhaust system equipped with an exhaust purification apparatus  and the like. Furthermore, by switching from a state where the vehicle is running solely under the driving force from the respective motor generators  and , to the state where the vehicle is running under the driving force from the internal combustion engine , it is possible to maintain the desired exhaust pressure in the internal combustion engine  while maintaining the desired driving force in the driving state of the vehicle.","In the present embodiment, the FIECU  determines the presence\/absence of flooding of the exhaust system, or whether there is a possibility of flooding occurring into the exhaust system or not, based on the change in the temperature difference over time between different positions in the exhaust system. However, the determination is not limited to this, and for example a liquid level detection apparatus may be installed near the exhaust vent of the exhaust pipe , and the presence\/absence of flooding into the exhaust system, or whether there is a possibility of flooding occurring into the exhaust system or not, may be determined according to a detection signal output from the liquid level detection apparatus.","It is possible to use various liquid level detection apparatus, for example float type, optical type, and conductive type liquid level detection apparatus.","For example, a float type liquid level detection apparatus  shown in  includes: a float switch; a cylindrical float guide ; a spherical float  which is movably accommodated along a central axis P inside the float guide ; and a lead switch  which is arranged at one end inside the float guide  on the central axis P. The float guide  has a plurality of openings , which introduce the liquid for detection to the interior, and discharge the liquid to the exterior. Inside the float  is installed a permanent magnet (not shown).","The float type liquid level detection apparatus  shown in  is set such that the central axis P is parallel to the vertical direction, with the end with the lead switch  positioned vertically above the other end. For example, when the level of the liquid for detection gradually rises in the vertical direction and enters the float guide , the float  rises in the vertical direction from its initial position F0 to an upper limit position F1. This results for example, in the contact points of the lead switch  which are set to be open (OFF state) under normal circumstances becoming closed (ON state) due to excitation from the permanent magnet installed in the float .","Moreover, an optical type liquid level detection apparatus  shown in  includes for example; a light transmitting material  composed of an optically transparent material such as a light transmitting resin, and a light emitting element  including for example a light emitting diode, and a photodetector  including for example a photodiode, arranged inside the light transmitting material . The construction is such that the light emitting element  is arranged so that a light beam La irradiated from the light emitting element  towards the outer surface A of the light transmitting material , is totally reflected on the outer surface A of the light transmitting material  which is exposed for example to the atmosphere, and a reflected light beam Lb due to this total reflection is transmitted through the light transmitting material  and reaches the photodetector .","Then, for example as shown in , the optical type liquid level detection apparatus  is arranged such that the orthogonal axis Q of the outer surface A of the light transmitting material  is parallel to the vertical direction. In this condition, in the case where the level of the liquid for detection gradually rises in the vertical direction so that the outer surface A of the light transmitting material  becomes immersed in the liquid, the refractive index is decreased, so that total reflection is no longer achieved, and the light beam La is transmitted through the liquid as a transmitted light beam Lc. Accordingly, compared to the normal state when the outer surface A of the light transmitting material  is exposed to the atmosphere (OFF state), the quantity of received light detected at the photodetector  when the outer surface A of the light transmitting material  is immersed in liquid (ON state) is lower.","Moreover, a conduction type liquid level detection apparatus  shown in  includes for example: a core wire  composed of conductors connected to a power source E; a first coating  which covers the core wire ; a shield wire  composed of an earthed wire, helically wound on the outer peripheral surface of the first coating  along a direction R in which the core wire  extends, up to a predetermined position; and a second coating  which covers the outer peripheral surface of the first coating  wound on the shield wire .","The first coating  includes a conductive part composed of a conductive fluororesin which covers one end of the core wire , and an insulator composed of an insulative fluororesin which covers all of the core wire  other than the end ","The second coating  includes a conductive part composed of conductive fluororesin which covers the outer peripheral surface of the first coating  including one end of the shield wire  near a predetermined position along the direction R in which the core wire  extends, and an insulator composed of an insulative fluororesin which covers the parts other than near the predetermined position along the direction R in which the core wire  extends.","Then, for example as shown in , the conduction type liquid level detection apparatus  is set so that the direction R in which the core wire  extends is parallel to the vertical direction, and the end of the core wire  is positioned vertically below the other end . In this state, if the level of the liquid for detection (for example, water), gradually rises in the vertical direction so that the conducting part of the first coating  and the conducting part of the second coating  become immersed in liquid, then an electric current flows between the conducting part and the conducting part  through this liquid. Accordingly, compared to the normal state when the conducting part of the first coating  and the conducting part of the second coating  are exposed to the atmosphere (OFF state), the electric current value detected by the current sensor connected to the shield wire  is higher when the conducting part of the first coating  and the conducting part of the second coating  are immersed in liquid (ON state).","In the operation of the control apparatus for automatic starting\/stopping an internal combustion engine  including a liquid level detection apparatus ,  or , in particular, in the processing in steps S to S for the determining whether there is a possibility of flooding occurring into the internal combustion engine  or not, the step S and step S may be omitted and as shown in , a step S may be executed instead of step S.","In step S, it is determined whether the detection result of the respective liquid level detection apparatus ,  or  is the ON state or not. That is, it is determined in the float type liquid level detection apparatus , whether the contact point of the lead switch  is in the closed state or not, in the optical type liquid level detection apparatus , whether the detected quantity of light by the photodetector  has decreased below a predetermined value or not, or in the conduction type liquid level detection apparatus , whether the electric current value detected by the current sensor has increased above a predetermined value or not.","When the determination is \u201cNO\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S described above.","On the other hand, when the determination is \u201cYES\u201d, the flow proceeds to step S described above.","While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and are not to be considered as limiting. Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the foregoing description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 15"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
