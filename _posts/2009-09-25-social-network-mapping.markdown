title: Social network mapping
abstract: Techniques for social network mapping are described. In an implementation, properties of a user's contacts with two services are analyzed to identify matching contacts. Contacts may be determined to correspond to the same user when sufficient common properties are found between the contacts. For unmatched contacts following the property analysis, additional processing may be conducted to identify contacts that the unmatched contacts have in common. A number of common contacts found through this processing may be used, alone or in combination, with information regarding common properties to determine when unmatched contacts correspond to the same user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The popularity of social networking via online networking sites is ever increasing. One way that people use social networking sites is to share information such as recommendations, pictures, videos, notes, discussions, and so forth on personal pages. However, some people maintain social networking accounts with multiple networking sites. Further, a person may wish to enable collaboration between their separate accounts.","Consequently, one challenge to enabling collaboration between multiple accounts of users is accurately correlating the users' contacts from different sites or services. Using a traditional approach, the person manually matched contact data between different sites and eliminated duplicate contacts. This manual correlation, though, may be quite inconvenient and disruptive for the user and therefore led to user frustration.","Techniques for social network mapping are described. In an implementation, properties of a user's contacts with two services are analyzed to identify matching contacts. Contacts may be determined to correspond to the same user when sufficient common properties are found between the contacts. For unmatched contacts following the property analysis, additional processing may be conducted to identify contacts that the unmatched contacts have in common. A number of common contacts found through this processing may be used, alone or in combination with information regarding common properties, to determine when unmatched contacts correspond to the same user.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Overview","Sometimes, a user may wish to enable collaboration between accounts used to access different services. One challenge to enabling collaboration between multiple accounts of a user is accurately correlating the user's contacts from different sites or services. Although the user could manually manage and update contacts with both services, this manual approach may be quite inconvenient and disruptive for the user which may even result in the user forgoing the functionality provided by the services due to user frustration.","Techniques for social network mapping are described. In an implementation, properties of a user's contacts with two services are analyzed via a mapping module to identify matching contacts. When sufficient common properties are found between two contacts, the contacts may be considered the same. Accordingly, the contacts may be merged into one contact entry for the user. In some embodiments, the two services may correspond to social network services from different providers. Although the following discussion describes some techniques in relation to social network services, the described techniques may also be employed with and among a variety services, including an email service, an instant messaging service, or other services for which users maintain contacts.","For unmatched contacts that are left after the property analysis, additional processing may be conducted to identify common contacts of the unmatched contacts. This may involve comparing properties of contacts associated with pairs of unmatched contacts to determine how many contacts the pair has in common. That is, the contacts of the user's contacts (e.g., friends of friends) are compared. The number of common contacts found for a particular pair of unmatched contacts through this processing may be used, alone or in combination with information regarding common properties, to determine when unmatched contacts correspond to the same user.","In the discussion that follows, a section entitled \u201cExample Environment\u201d describes an example environment and devices, which may be employed to provide social network mapping in various embodiments. Following this, a section entitled \u201cExample Procedures\u201d describes example techniques related to social network mapping in accordance with one or more embodiments. Last, a section entitled \u201cExample Devices\u201d is provided and describes example devices that can be used to implement one or more embodiments of techniques for social network mapping.","Example Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","108","108","108","108"]},"For the purposes of the following discussion, a referenced component, such as service provider , may refer to one or more entities, and therefore by convention reference may be made to a single entity (e.g., the service provider ) or multiple entities (e.g., the service providers , the plurality of service providers , and so on) using the same reference number.","The service provider  may have one or more processors  and memory . The service provider  is depicted as storing a service manager module  in the memory  that is executable via the one or more processors . The service manager module  represents functionality operable by the service provider  to manage various services  that may be made available over the network . For example, various services  may be provided via webpages , or other user interfaces, that are communicated over the network for output by the one or more clients . The service manager module  may manage access to the services , performance of the services , configuration of webpages  to provide the services , and so on.","Some examples of the services  include, but are not limited to, a search service, an email service to send and receive email, instant messaging service to provide instant messages between clients , and a social network service to facilitate connections and interactions between groups of users who share common interests and activities. The social network service may assist users in connecting to a group, provide a variety ways for users to interact (e.g., group email, website, blog, messaging) and provide recommendations to the groups based on shared interests and activities. In at least some embodiments, the social network service may also be configured to enable network mapping and collaboration between different social networks in accordance with techniques described herein. Additional examples of services  include a shopping service, a weblog service, productivity service, authentication service, a news service, and an advertisement service to name a few.","The authentication service may be provided by the service manager module  to authenticate clients to access various services  that may be provided by one or more of the service providers . For example, a client  may provide a username and password that is authenticated by the authentication service. When the authentication is successful, the authentication service may pass a token, or other suitable data, to enable access to corresponding services . Authentication of the client  to an account may provide access to a single corresponding service provider  and\/or service . Additionally or alternatively, a single authentication may correspond to many services , such that authentication to a single account provides access to many service providers  and\/or to an entire suite of services .","The service manager module  may also manage an accounts database  that may be configured to store a variety of data related to user accounts with the one or more service providers . By way of example and not limitation, accounts database  is depicted as storing account identifiers  that may be used for authentication and access control (e.g., unique account IDs, usernames, passwords, and so on), contact data  that may define user contacts and\/or social networks associated with accounts, and profile data  that may correspond to personal information and webpages accessible through a social network service and\/or other services . In the context of social networks, a user's contacts may be referred to as friends. A variety of other data  is also contemplated, including service authorizations, user preferences, program files such as documents, pictures, and spreadsheets maintained online, and other data typically associated with user accounts.","Service provider  is also depicted as storing a mapping module  in memory  that is executable via the one or more processors  to implement aspects of social network mapping described herein. In an embodiment, functionality represented by the mapping module  may be implemented as an application programming interface (API) that may be made accessible to the clients  over the network .","The one or more clients  are depicted as having one or more processors  and memory . Memory  is depicted as storing another mapping module  that may be deployed to the client  and is executable via the one or more processors  to implement \u201cclient-side\u201d aspects of social network mapping described herein. In an embodiment, functionality represented by the mapping module  may be implemented as a script that is included with a webpage  provided by the service provider .","Generally, mapping module  is configured to enable mapping of a user's contacts between accounts associated with different services  and\/or different providers. While some techniques are described herein in relation to social network service, the described techniques are applicable to a variety services . To determine when two contacts are the same, mapping module  may be configured to take into account common properties of the contacts, e.g., what properties and how many properties are the same, and also the number of common contacts. Further discussion regarding the operation and configuration of one or more mapping modules  in various embodiments may found in reference to the following figures.","To enable various communications over the network , the one or more clients  may also include a communication module . The communication module  is depicted as being stored in memory  and is also executable via the processor  to provide various interactions with service providers  and\/or services . Examples of such interaction include, but are not limited to, communicating one to another, navigating content, searching webpages, accessing services , interacting with a social networking site, performing searches, instant messaging, email, and so forth.","The communication module  may be implemented as a browser or other suitable application to obtain and output webpages  from the service provider  over the network . The communication module  may also represent a component of another application used to obtain one or more services  from the service providers . For example, the communication module  may be configured as a component of a desktop social networking application of a client .","As noted above, the mapping module  may be configured to map contacts between accounts associated with different services  and providers of the services . The mapping module  may be employed in conjunction with different services  from the same provider. The mapping module  may also be employed in conjunction with services provided by separate providers. The collaborative providers  illustrated in  may represent external providers with which a service provider  may collaborate and perform mapping. The one or more collaborative providers  may be configured in manner similar to the service providers  as discussed above.","In particular, the one or more collaborative providers  are depicted as having one or more processors  and memory . A variety of services  that may be configured in a manner similar to the services  are depicted as being stored in the memory . The collaborative provider  is also depicted as storing respective contact data  in the memory .

Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the example environment  of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","102","130","200","130","104","104","102"]},"Initiation of mapping between a user's contacts associated with two services is detected (block ). For example, a user may make a selection to import, sync, or otherwise combine sets of contacts that the user may have for interaction with different services . The services  may be provided by the same service provider  or by different providers. The selection may be detected by a mapping module  that is configured to perform the mapping.","Consider an example user Scott who has a user account with a service provider , such as the service provider  of . Scott may interact with a communication module  of a client  to obtain services  from a service provider . In at least some embodiments, Scott's interaction may involve using a social network service available from the service provider . Of course, Scott may interact with a variety of services  that may be available from the provider as discussed above, and for which mapping may be performed.","Scott may be presented with an option to sync his contacts between multiple services . For example, Scott may be able to sync contacts between a social network service and an email service with the service provider . In another example, Scott may be able to sync his contacts between one social network with the service provider  and another social network of Scott's with another provider, such as a collaborative provider  shown in . Other examples include syncing between multiple instant messaging services, between email service and instant messaging service, and\/or between contacts maintained locally on a client device of Scott's (e.g., a local contact database) and a service  from the service provider. Scott's may initiate the syncing on his own, such as by selecting a menu item or other suitable control exposed in a webpage output via the communication module . In an embodiment, an option to sync contacts may be presented to Scott automatically when Scott signs up with the service provider , when Scott activates one of the services , and\/or when Scott interacts with his contacts. In each of these scenarios, selection of the option by Scott initiates mapping between contacts associated with services used by Scott.","In response to the initiation, the procedure  may proceed to ascertain contacts associated with the two services that correspond to the same user (block ). This involves comparing properties of the user's contacts with the two services to derive matches (block ). For example a property-based comparison may occur for each contact of Scott's to identify properties that the contact has in common with other contacts of Scott's. In one example, properties that are compared may include at least account identifiers, user names, and locations. Based on this comparison, an assessment may be made as to whether certain contacts that Scott has with the different services correspond to the same user. The property-based comparison enables the number of unmatched contacts to be successively reduced.","For contacts that remain unmatched, a comparison is made between properties of contacts of the unmatched contacts (e.g., friends of friends) to identify additional matches (block ). This analysis of unmatched contacts may determine a number of common contacts that exist between two of the unmatched contacts. The number of common contacts may be used alone or in combination with common properties discovered in block  to determine when the unmatched contacts correspond to the same user. It should be appreciated that mapping of contacts may occur according to various matching techniques. Further details and examples regarding using properties to map contacts one to another are discussed in greater detail in relation to the example procedure depicted in .","Contacts are combined according to the matches (block ). One way this can occur is by creating updated contact data  that combines (e.g., merges) contacts determined to match. Unmatched contacts may be added as their own entries in the contact data . In an embodiment, unmatched contacts may be presented to a user to allow the user to engage in manual mapping of the unmatched contacts, delete the contacts, and so forth.","The combined contacts may be employed in conjunction with one or more services (block ). For example, the combined contacts may be used to send out communications (email, instant messaging, invites) to a user's contacts while reducing duplicates. The combined contacts may also facilitate collaborative interactions of services, such as cross communicating posts from one social network to another, content provisioning, sending status updates and suggestions, pushing content to the contacts, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","300","204"]},"In at least some embodiments, procedure  may be performed by a suitably configured device, such as a device configured to make use of a mapping module  described in relation to . The mapping module  may be implemented to perform mapping by way of both a client  and a service provider , individually and\/or in a distributed manner.","A representation of a user's friends with two social networks is obtained (block ). Consider, for example, a user Bob who has one social networking account with a service provider  and another social networking account with a collaborative provider . A different set of friends associated with Bob may be maintained by each of the providers. At least some of Bob's friends from the different social networks may relate to the same person. Moreover, people (e.g., Bob's friends) may use different user names and identifiers with different providers. Accordingly, simply matching user identifiers may be insufficient to determine which friends of Bob correspond to the same person. Yet, Bob may wish to sync his contacts between the multiple social networks for various reasons, such as to enable collaboration between the social networks.","Social network mapping techniques described herein may be employed to perform automatic mapping between Bob's social network in a user friendly and efficient manner. To do so, social network mapping techniques make use of various properties associated with Bob's friends.","In particular, initiation of mapping of Bob's friends in the two social networks may occur in various ways, such as those discussed previously in relation to procedure  of . The initiation may be detected by a mapping module . In response, the mapping module  may operate to perform the mapping.","To enable the mapping, the mapping module  may be configured to interact with both the service provider  and the collaborative provider  to obtain representations of Bob's friends with each provider. For instance, the mapping module  may obtain contact data  and contact data  that describes Bob's friends in social networks with the service provider  and the collaborative provider , respectively. The mapping module  may be configured to examine an account of Bob's to identify social networks corresponding to Bob. This may include identifying account ids, links, authentication information, and\/or other data that may enable mapping module  to obtain corresponding contact data.","In some cases, Bob may provide input to cause the mapping, such as by selection of a sync operation. Optionally, Bob may also upload files, input links to files, or otherwise designate particular files or locations of files that describe Bob's friend. The mapping module  may perform the mapping using the files that are designated by Bob.","In at least some embodiments, social network mapping techniques makes use of a common data format to represent contacts\/friends associated with different services and\/or providers. The common data format used for mapping may be configured in a variety of ways to represent contacts of a user. In general, the common data format describes a user's contacts corresponding to a particular service  and includes various properties that are associated with the contacts\/friends. By way of example and not limitation, the common data format may be implemented as a graphical representation, structured data, a relational database document, a mark-up language document, delimited documents, or other suitable representations of contacts.","In one or more embodiments, data employed for mapping may be pre-configured in a manner suitable for mapping. For instance, a service provider  and\/or a collaborative provider  may be configured to maintain contact data  and contact data  respectively in the common data format to facilitate mapping. In this example, the mapping module  may obtain data from one or more providers that is already in the common data format and may make use of the data directly for mapping.","Additionally or alternatively, the mapping module  may be configured to convert data to the common data format from other formats that may be used by various providers. For instance, different providers often may make use of different and\/or custom formats for respective contacts. Accordingly, the mapping module  may operate to determine whether contact data is in a compatible format and perform conversion to place data in a format suitable for mapping when data is not already in a suitable format.","Thus, in the example of Bob's friends, the mapping module  may obtain data describing Bob's network of friends from both the service provider  and the collaborative provider  and ascertain whether this friend data is in a suitable format for mapping to occur. The mapping module  may also perform conversion of the friend data to a suitable format when the friend data is not already in a suitable format. Having obtained data regarding Bob's friend, mapping module  may proceed to conduct mapping operations using the obtained data.","In particular, for each friend in one of the social networks, properties of the friend are compared to properties of friends in the other network to derive matches. (block ). A variety of different suitable techniques and algorithms may be employed by a mapping module  to derive matches between friends in two social networks. In general, procedure  may cycle through comparisons of a number of different properties for each friend to detect friends between the networks that match, e.g., friends who correspond to the same user.","A variety of properties are contemplated that may be compared by the mapping module  to derive matches. The common data format noted above may define a common set of properties to facilitate mapping. Providers that make use of the common data format may populate the common set of properties when a user registers and\/or when a user makes additions to their contacts. Further, conversion of data that is not in a suitable format into the common format may include populating the common set of properties.","The properties may include a variety of data typically employed in user profiles and contact information. As noted above, properties suitable to perform mapping may include account information such as account identifiers, user names, and location. Other example properties include, but are not limited to, names (initials, first name, last name, middle name, maiden name), email address, street address, telephone number, education information (degrees, high school, college), relationship status, age, sex, race, birthday, birth place and so forth. Naturally, properties may be employed in a manner consistent with a user's security settings. Thus, a user may enable or disable use of some or all of properties for mapping, as well as for other purposes.","One example property-based matching process involving successive comparisons of a set of properties for each of a user's friend is depicted and described just below in relation to blocks  to  of .","In particular, a current property is compared (block ). In the preceding example, this may involve comparing a particular friend of Bob's in his social network with the service provider  with each friend in his social network with the collaborative provider  until a match is determined. Moreover, after each property is compared for the particular friend, a determination is made regarding whether there is a sufficient match (block ). The sufficiency of a match may be determined in a number of ways. For example, a confidence threshold may be established and employed to determine when it may be said with confidence that contacts\/friends correspond to the same person.","Thus, the determination of block  may involve assessing whether the confidence threshold has been met. In an embodiment, the confidence threshold may be configured to define a number of matching properties in order to establish a match between contacts. In another example, the confidence threshold may be configured to define a percentage of matching properties (e.g., 70% or 5 of 10).","In yet another example, the confidence threshold may set an overall point score to be achieved to establish a match. In this example, different properties may be assigned different values. In this manner, the relative weight of different properties in the sufficiency determination may be configured by assigning values accordingly. For instance, a location property may be assigned a higher value than an age property. The values of matching properties may be summed and compared to the overall point score to determine when a match is sufficiently established.","When a match is determined from the property comparison, the matching friends are added to a list of matched friends (block ). On the other hand, when the comparison of properties has not resulted in a sufficient match, a determination is made regarding whether there is another property to check (block ). When additional properties exist that are to be compared, procedure  returns to block  to repeat the comparison for the particular friend and the next property. Thus, the comparison of block , match determination of block , and property determination of block  may be repeated for each property, until a match is made for a particular friend, or until the set of properties to be compared has been exhausted. If the set of properties is exhausted without a match, the friend remains as an unmatched friend (block ).","A determination is made as to whether there is another friend to analyze for matches (block ). If so, the property-based matching process of blocks  to block  just described is repeated for the other friend and for each property of the set of properties to be checked, or until a match is determined. Thus, the property-based matching process may be repeated for each friend of Bob's social network.","Although a successive process for matching is illustrated, alternatively matching depicted in relation to block  may occur using other techniques. For example, matching may be conducted concurrently for two or more friends by way of separate processing threads, modules, and\/or processors. In another example, multiple properties may be checked before the sufficiency of a match is determined as in block . In any event, mapping module  may conduct mapping in a manner suitable to identify matching friends and some friends that remain unmatched friends.","At this point, further processing may occur to find additional matches from the yet unmatched friends. In particular, for each unmatched friend, a friend of friend property comparison is conducted to discover additional matches (block ), and additional matches discovered by the friend of friend analysis are added to the list of matched friends (block ).","As noted, there may be some friends that remain unmatched friends following the property comparison described in relation to block . A friend of friend comparison may be considered a deeper level of mapping that is conducted using the yet unmatched friends of the two social networks. In general, the comparison is conducted to identify common friends associated with the unmatched friends. Specifically, friends corresponding to a pair of unmatched friends may be compared, e.g., one friend from each of the two social networks being mapped. This friend of friend comparison makes use of property-based comparisons similar to those described above. Such comparisons may be employed to determine if there are common friends between the pair of unmatched friends. The friend of friend comparison may repeat some or all of the mapping analysis described in relation to blocks  to , this time using the friends corresponding to a pair of unmatched friends. A determination of whether the unmatched friends correspond to the same person may be made based at least in part upon the number of common friends discovered. The greater the number of common friends, the greater the likelihood is that the unmatched friends correspond to the same person. This determination may also consider matching properties between the unmatched friends that may have been found through the previous matching process of block . In other words, the results of analysis described in relation to blocks  and  may be combined to discover additional matches among initially unmatched friends.","By way of example, assume that a friend Ken in Bob's social network with the service provider  and a friend Kenny in Bob's social network with the collaborative provider  are unmatched following the mapping analysis above. Perhaps some properties were matched between Ken and Kenny, but not a sufficient number of properties to confidently conclude that Ken and Kenny correspond to the same person or user. Assume for example that the property matching analysis found that a first name Kenneth and a location of Oregon were associated with both Ken and Kenny. These matched properties provide some indication that Ken and Kenny are the same, but may not be sufficient based on the confidence threshold.","Accordingly, a friend of friend comparison may be performed by the mapping module  to provide further information that may be used to assess whether or not Ken and Kenny are the same. In particular, friends in Ken's social network with service provider  may be compared to friends in Kenny's social network with collaborative provider  using property-based comparisons. Through this analysis, mapping module  may identify a number of friends that are common to Ken and Kenny.","The mapping module  may make use of the number of common friends in a variety of ways to determine whether that Ken and Kenny match. This may involve determining whether a defined threshold value for a number or percentage of common friends has been met. If the threshold is met, this may be sufficient to conclude that a pair of unmatched friends is the same. In the present example, the threshold may be configured such that identification of five common friends or more than 50% of common friends may be sufficient to conclude that Ken and Kenny are the same.","The number of common friends may be used alone or in combination with previously determined property matching information. For instance, a value may be assigned to the number of common friends that is added to an overall point score derived through property matching described above. In another example, the threshold value for the number of common friends may be adjusted based upon the number of common properties found through property matching. In general, a match between friends may be found with a fewer number of common friends as the number or value of common properties increases. For example, if only 4 common friends are identified between Ken and Kenny, this still may be sufficient to conclude that Ken and Kenny are the same considering that property matching determined that they share the name of Kenneth and the location of Oregon. Thus, mapping module  may be configured to take into account common properties, e.g., what properties and how many properties of Ken and Kenny are the same, and also the number of common friends they have.","Results of the mapping are output (block ). In at least some embodiments the results may be a list, or other suitable data, that merges matching friends into single list entries. For example, mapping module  may be configured to produce a combined friends list for Bob based on the foregoing analysis. The mapping module  may output the combined list for use by the user, service provider , and\/or collaborative provider. For example, the combined list may be used to update or replace Bob's contacts with the service provider  and\/or the collaborative provider . Further, the combined list may be used in conjunction with one or more services  provided by the service provider  and\/or the collaborative provider . The combined list may also be used to enable collaboration between the two social networks, such as to set content permissions, distribute updates, make friend suggestions, and so forth.","Referring to , a diagram  depicts an illustrative example of mapping that may occur for contacts with two services. In particular,  includes representations of contacts for a user Bob with Service A  and with Service B . As depicted, Bob uses the name \u201cBob\u201d with Service A  and \u201cRobert\u201d with Service B . Each of the services may correspond to an email account, instant messaging account, social network, or other service account of Bob's.","In the depicted example, the representations of Bob's contacts with each service are configured as graphical representations. Representations may be also configured in other suitable formats as described above. It just so happens that for this example graphical representations are employed. The mapping module  may be configured to construct such graphical representations, or other representation, using contact data for the services that is associated with Bob. In the depicted graphical representations, each of Bob's contacts is associated with a set of properties . The properties  that may be used to determine when Bob's contacts with Service A correspond to his contacts with Service B. In particular,  illustrates a mapping operation  that may occur using comparisons of the properties  to determine matches between Bob's contacts.","The mapping operation  may occur using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, techniques described above in relation to procedure  of  and procedure  of .","Generally, the mapping operation  involves analyzing properties to identify common properties among the contacts and determining matches based on the common properties. Mapping operation  may also involve processing to determine common contacts that exist between the contacts. In other words, contacts that are shared by two of Bob's contacts may be identified to assist in determining when the two contacts correspond to the same person. Matching contacts may be arrived at based on common properties alone, based upon common contacts alone, or based upon both common properties and common contacts that are shared by two of Bob's contacts.","The result of the mapping may be a combined representation of the contacts, such as the combined contacts  depicted in . The combined contacts  may include matched  contacts and unmatched  contacts. In the illustrated example, matches between Bob's contacts with Service A  and Service B  that are determined through mapping operation  include Ken to Kenny, Bob to Robert, Alice to Alice, and Amy to AmyA. Dave is entered into the combined contacts  as an unmatched  contact, since a contact corresponding to Dave does not exist in Bob's contacts with Service A .","Having considered examples procedures related to social network mapping, consider now example implementations of devices, modules, and user interfaces that may be employed to provide techniques for social network mapping in one or more embodiments.","Example Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","104","102","106"]},"Computing device  includes one or more processors or processing units , one or more memory and\/or storage components , one or more input\/output (I\/O) devices , and a bus  that allows the various components and devices to communicate one to another.

Such instructions may be executable by one or more articles of manufacture (for example, one or more computing device , and\/or processors ) to implement techniques for social network mapping, as well as other techniques. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the example procedures described herein. Thus, computer-readable storage media may be configured to store instructions that, when executed by one or more devices described herein, cause various techniques for social network mapping.","Computer-readable storage media includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in a method or technology suitable for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer-readable storage media can include, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, hard disks, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or another tangible media or article of manufacture suitable to store the desired information and which may be accessed by a computer.","Conclusion","Although the social network mapping techniques have been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the appended claims are not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the social network mapping techniques."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The detailed description is described with reference to the accompanying figures.
