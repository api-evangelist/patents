title: Winglet for the trailing end of towed flexible underwater lines
abstract: A winglet for mounting on a trailing end of a flexible line to be towed by an underwater vehicle includes an internal collar member for connection to an inside surface of the line at the trailing end thereof, an outer collar member for connection to an outside surface of the line outboard of the internal collar, and connection means for fixing the internal and outer collar members to the line trailing end. A plurality of fins are mounted on an outside surface of the outer collar member and extend outwardly from the outer collar member.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to the movement of towed underwater lines and is directed more particularly to a winglet for mounting on a trailing end of such lines and operating to improve stability of the line during towing.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Underwater vehicles, such as submarines and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), may be provided with a somewhat flexible line which can be paid out of the submerged vehicle and towed through the water by the vehicle. Typically, the line extends from a bow portion of the vehicle. The line is often provided with a multiplicity of acoustic sensor elements. While the line is somewhat flexible, it also exhibits some rigidity, such that when the line is being towed through the water, the line tends to bend rearwardly and well outwardly from the vehicle.","The vehicle is provided with a stabilizing tether which is paid out from the stern area of the vehicle and at its distal end is fastened to the towed line proximate the distal end thereof. The stabilizing tether is reeled in to bring the trailing end of the towed line in nearer the vehicle. The tether is under tension and provides some measure of stability to the towed line.","Nonetheless, the trailing end of the towed line is subject to substantial vibration which is unwanted inasmuch as the acoustic, or other measuring devices or sensors carried in the towed line, may be highly position dependent. That is, to gain the most from the measuring devices or sensors, it is required that the precise positions of the devices be known on a continuing basis. There is thus a need to diminish and limit the vibrational movement of the trailing end of the towed line.","An object of the invention is, therefore, to steady and stabilize the towed line so as to improve pin-pointing the positions of instruments carried in the line.","With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the invention is the provision of a winglet for mounting on a trailing end of a flexible line to be towed by an underwater vehicle. The winglet comprises an internal collar member for connection to an inside surface of the line at the trailing end thereof, and an outer collar member for connection to an outside surface of the line outboard of the internal collar. Connection means are provided for fixing the internal and outer collar members to the line trailing end, and a plurality of fins are mounted on an outside surface of the outer collar member and extend outwardly from the outer collar member.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , it will be seen that an underwater vehicle  is provided with a hollow line  extending from a bow area of the vehicle and in which are disposed a series of sensors or measuring devices , typically acoustic devices. A tether  extends from the stern area of the vehicle  and is connected to a trailing end  of the line  to stabilize the end , as described hereinabove.","To further stabilize the line  and the devices , and in accordance with the invention, there is provided a winglet device  for attachment to the trailing end  of the line .","Referring to , it will be seen that the winglet  includes a cylindrically shaped internal collar member  for connection to an inside surface  of the line  proximate the trailing end  thereof. The winglet  further includes a cylindrically shaped outer collar member  for connection to an outside surface  of the line  outboard of the internal collar member .","Connection means , usually fasteners, such as bolts, are provided for fixing the internal and outer collar members ,  to the line trailing and , as shown in . Alternatively, the winglet  may be adhesively bound to the line , or, depending upon the material from which the winglet is made, may be molded integrally with the line .","A plurality of fins  are mounted on an outside surface  of the outer collar member  and extend outwardly, or outboard, from the outer collar member .","While the winglet  may be molded of the same material as the line , it is presently preferred that the winglet be fabricated from a light-weight, corrosion-resistant metal, such as aluminum. Such a winglet, along with mechanical connection means , facilitate use of the winglet as an \u201cadd-on\u201d to lines  currently in use.","Referring to , it will be seen that an alternative embodiment of the outer collar member  includes a first component  having threads  at an after end thereof, and a second component  having threads  thereon engageable with the first component threads . The fins  are fixed to the second component , which may be threadedly attached to and removed from the first component  which, in turn, is fixed to the line .","The embodiment of  enables the quick and easy replacement of fins, either because of damage or because of the desirability of a particular fin configuration for a particular task.","There is thus provided a winglet which may be affixed to the trailing end of a line to be towed by an underwater vehicle to steady and stabilize the trailing end of the towed line, to improve positional accuracy of instruments carried in the line.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which are shown illustrative embodiments of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
