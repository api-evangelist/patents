{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates in general to computer systems and more specifically to an apparatus, system, and method for communicating with a target device.","Devices within computer systems typically communicate using a standard protocol that governs the communication between the devices. Among other requirements, protocols typically determine the type of error checking methods used, the type of data compression methods used, how the transmitting device indicates that a transmission has been completed, and how the receiving device indicates that a message has been received. Examples of some of the currently utilized protocols include SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics), Fibre Channel, and serial interface protocols. Numerous variations of the above-mentioned protocols, as well as other protocols, exist. Many protocols are defined by published standards allowing access to the details of the protocol to manufactures and others. Devices from different manufactures can communicate with each other if the devices comply with the published specification. In addition to the transmission and reception techniques and requirements, a particular protocol specification may indicate a standard convention for exchanging device information. The information exchange convention governs the format of the device information stored within the target device and the appropriate procedure and commands for accessing the device information. For example, the SCSI specification indicates a convention that specifies mode pages that include device information. The SCSI information exchange convention indicates the standard method to request, transmit, and format mode pages containing device information.","Although many protocols, such as SCSI, specify the standard information exchange convention, many devices that communicate using the particular protocol do not use the standard convention, incorrectly return information that was not requested, or return device information within a format that does not conform to the standard information exchange convention. Further, some device manufactures provide additional device information that is only accessible using a nonstandard information exchange conventions. For example, most SCSI devices do not fully comply with the SCSI information exchange convention. Many of the mode pages specified are not available with some SCSI devices. Further, additional nonstandard mode pages providing useful device information can not be accessed using the SCSI information exchange convention.","This limitation is particularly problematic in distributed computer systems that are managed by a network manger application. Distributed computer systems include a variety of interconnected devices and may include any number of networked devices such as computers, servers, and memory storage devices that are interconnected through a network that includes a combination of network devices. A network typically includes a combination of interconnected network devices such as hubs, switches, and routers. Many of the network devices and networked devices operate in accordance with a configuration that can be set and modified. The configuration is typically managed with the use of configuration objects that represent logical or virtual arrangements and relationships and define any number of structures, allocations, operational rules, priorities, preferences, or functions related to memory, data storage, bandwidth, communication paths, and communication protocols. Many conventional systems utilize a network manager such as a network management application running on a management sever to manage the distributed computer network. The network manager communicates with network devices and networked devices to exchange information and to change configurations settings in accordance with the management tasks. Often, these communications are performed within the same communication channels where data signals are transmitted and are, therefore, typically referred to as \u201cin-band\u201d communications. The in-band communications comply with the protocol used within the communication channel. The SCSI protocol is commonly used in distributed computer systems as well as in integrated collocated, \u201clocal\u201d, computer systems. Using the SCSI protocol, the management application exchanges queries, acknowledgements, control signals, configuration parameters, and data with a target device which may be any network device or networked device. Devices utilize software implementing an API (Application Programming Interface) to communicate using the channel protocol and to execute various instructions.","As discussed above, however, conventional techniques are limited in that the many devices in a computer system do not conform to the standard information exchange convention dictated by the particular published specification. As a result, conventional network management applications can not effectively communicate with many target devices. Often, basic information such as a serial number is not available to the network manager through an in-band connection. Further, more efficient techniques of managing the computer system may be unavailable to the network manager because useful device information is accessible only through a nonstandard information exchange convention.","One attempted solution to this problem includes configuring the network manager to include a device manager implementing an appropriate API for each device that will be managed by the network manager. This technique is limited in that the network manager must be modified or replaced when new devices are connected within the system that utilize new, non-standard APIs. Further, since the number of potential devices utilizing non-standard APIs is expansive and continually increasing, the requirements for a standard network manager approach unmanageable complexity and size.","Accordingly, there is a need for an apparatus, system, and method for establishing communication and exchanging device information with a target device within a computer system.","An apparatus, system, and method establish communication with a target device within a computer system. Based on identification information received from the target device, an information exchange convention (IEC) device manager utilizes a device specific handler to facilitate communication with the target device. In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager receives identification information from the target device in response to a request transmitted in accordance with a standard communication protocol and in accordance with a standard information exchange convention. A device class identifier is generated from the identification information that, in the exemplary embodiment, includes manufacturer and model information of the target device. Using the device class identifier, the IEC device manager locates and loads the appropriate target device handler for communicating with the target device. The target device handler is invoked to communicate with the target device allowing the IEC device manager to operate as a translator between the target device and device caller such as a network manager. The IEC device manager appears transparent to the network manager and, from the perspective of the network manager, the target device appears to be communicating using the standard information exchange convention. In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager communicates with the target device using the SCSI protocol and the handler facilitates communications by mapping device information within target device mode pages to device information within device caller mode pages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","102","106","104","104","106","104","104","104","102","106","106"]},"The IEC device manager  includes at least software code that facilitates communication with the target device . The IEC device manager  may be implemented solely as software running on a processor or may include any combination of software, hardware, and firmware. As discussed below in further detail, the IEC device manager  may be one of several device managers within a computer system that perform translation, conversion, or interface functions to allow the setting, modification, monitoring, or retrieving of identification or configuration parameters of devices.","The target device  is a device within the computer system that communicates in accordance with a standard protocol. In the exemplary embodiment, the target device  transmits and receives messages in accordance with the SCSI standard and may be a storage device, hub, switch, gateway, a module or device within a storage device, or other hardware device connected within the computer system.","A standard protocol is any protocol that is defined by a published protocol specification or is that generally accepted as a standard by the industry. A published specification defining the standard protocol typically also defines the information exchange convention. As explained above, information exchange conventions implemented in many target devices  are device specific conventions although the target devices  communicate using a standard protocol such as SCSI. The information exchange convention governs the format of the device information  stored within the target device  and the appropriate procedure and commands for accessing the device information . The device information  includes any data or information describing the configuration, performance, statistics, identity or other descriptive parameters of the target device . Examples of device information  include model numbers, manufacturer designators, serial numbers, storage capacity, speed, LUN (logical unit number), tape drive information and robot information. The information exchange convention, therefore, may be an application program interface (API) that regulates the exchange of device information  over the standard protocol. Where the standard protocol is SCSI, for example, the information exchange convention may indicate the appropriate mode page and the location within a mode page where particular device information  is stored as well as the format of the device information . For most target devices , much of the useful device information  stored within the target device  is not accessible using standard information exchange conventions. For example, some SCSI devices will not return a serial number within Mode Page 83H as required by the information exchange convention defined by the published SCSI specification.","The exemplary embodiment provides an apparatus and method for accessing device information  not available using the standard information exchange convention. After the target device  is discovered, the IEC device manager  requests identification information from the target device  using a standard information exchange convention. Using a generic handler , the IEC device manager  transmits the appropriate request (query) for the device identification information. The generic handler  is a routine, engine, class, or other software code that exchanges information using the standard information exchange convention. Where the standard protocol is SCSI, for example, the IEC device manager  transmits a request for Mode Page 83H which SCSI devices should recognize as a request for identification information. The target device  returns identification information that includes at least a manufacturer designation and a model number. A SCSI target device , for example, returns Mode Page 83H which includes at least the manufacturer designation and the model number, and, in some instances, also returns a serial number of the target device . Based on the device information  of the target device , the IEC device manager  identifies and loads the appropriate handler  to communicate with the target device . In the exemplary embodiment, the handler  is software code that exchanges information with the target device  in accordance with the information exchange convention used by the particular target device . The information exchange convention is often specified by the manufacturer of the target device  through literature, downloads, or other mechanisms. The information exchange convention is used to obtain, implement, or create the handler . In some circumstances, the handler  may be directly provided by the particular manufacturer. Further, where convention information from the manufacturer is limited, the target device handler  may be created based on the observed behavior of the particular target device .","In response to the identification information request, the target device  transmits the identification information to the IEC device manager . A class ID generator  within the IEC device manager  generates a class identifier (class ID) based on the manufacturer designation and the model number using a system defined format. The manufacturer designation is any character string or other representation of the manufacturer of the target device . In the exemplary embodiment, the class identifier (class ID) is a character string that represents a \u201cJava class\u201d for a target device handler  that applies to a target device  having a particular make and model number. The class ID, however, can be used to identify any dynamic link library (DLL), routine, engine or other code that at least partially forms the handler . Devices having the same manufacturer and model number will have the same class ID although the devices have different serial numbers. An example of a suitable method of forming the class ID includes using a defined algorithm or routine to combine at least a portion of the manufacturer designation and at least portion of the model number to form a character string that conforms to a consistent specified format recognized by the IEC device manager . The identifier generator , therefore, may be a module, routine, or other software code that parses and combines the incoming information to generate the class ID.","The IEC device manager  retrieves the handler  associated with the class ID from memory and loads the handler  into the IEC device manager . The device manger  invokes the handler  to gain access to the device information  stored within the target device . The handler  translates information between the non-standard information exchange convention and the standard information exchange convention. In the exemplary embodiment, the handler  maps device information from the nonstandard mode pages to the standard mode pages and vice versa.","Each target device  is identified using a unique identification (UID) that is based on unique device information that distinguishes the particular target device  from all other target devices (). When available, the serial number is used to generate the UID. The target device , however, may not return a serial number in some circumstances although the standard information exchange convention is used to retrieve the device information . For example, Mode Page 83H may return the manufacturer designation and the model number but not the serial number. Using the handler , the IEC device manager  retrieves the serial number, or other unique device information, from the target device  and creates the UID. For example, the IEC device manager , using the handler , may gain access to the serial number in a location or in a format other than prescribed by the standard information exchange convention and may use the retrieved information to generate the UID. For a SCSI target device, the IEC device manager  invokes the target device handler  that may access a mode page other than Mode Page 83H to obtain the serial number. Further, multiple devices may return the same serial number for Mode Page 83H. This may occur, for example, where a memory array includes several LUNs and each LUN is treated by the system as a separate device but the array assigns the same serial number to all the LUNs. The serial number may require modification or other processing to create the UID that will be recognized by a device caller . Other unique information may be used to create the UID where the serial is not available. For example, a Fibre Channel World Wide Name (WWN) may be used to create a UID. The UID is recognized as a serial number by the device caller  although the serial number identifier is not the actual serial number of the target device . Accordingly, the IEC device manager  allows the device caller  to identify and uniquely recognize the target device  where the target device  does not provide a serial number using the standard information exchange convention, the serial number does not exist, or the serial number is not unique.","A target device handler  is instantiated for each target device  in the exemplary embodiment. Therefore, if two target devices  have the same class ID, the target device handler  corresponding to the class ID is loaded and instantiated for each of the two target devices. Further, where a particular target device handler  applies to more than one type of target device , more than one class ID corresponds to the same target device handler .","The methods and apparatus of this invention may take the form, at least partially, of program logic or program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, random access or read only-memory, or any other machine-readable storage medium. When the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. The methods and apparatus of the present invention may also be embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any other form of transmission. When the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code combines with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates analogously to specific logic circuits.","In the exemplary embodiment, the logic for carrying out the method is embodied as part of the system  and management server  described with reference to . One aspect of the invention is embodied as a method that is described below with reference to . In the exemplary embodiment described herein, computer readable code stored in memory  is executed by the processor  within the management server . Other types and combinations of hardware, software and firmware may be used implement the functions described. For purposes of illustrating the present invention, therefore, the invention is described as embodied in a specific configuration, but one skilled in the art will appreciate that the apparatus is not limited to the specific configuration but rather only by the claims included with this specification.","The IEC device manager  may be implemented within a computer to manage internally connected target devices  where the target devices  communicate in accordance with SCSI, Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE), Fibre Channel protocol, serial interface or other standard. Further, the IEC device manager  may be implemented within a distributed computer system where a variety of devices, including target devices , are geographically distributed and are interconnected within a computer network. In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager  is implemented within a storage area network (SAN) and utilized by a network manager for communicating with target devices  to efficiently manage the SAN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","212","202","206","208","212","206","202","204","202","204","206","212","212"]},"The application server  may include any combination of processors and memory that perform the functions of a server computer that is suitable for running software applications. The applications may communicate with other networked devices  such as other application servers  and storage devices . In many situations, the application servers  may be accessed by work stations, personal computers, or other devices connected to the communication network .","In the exemplary embodiment, the storage devices  are mass storage devices such as disk drives or tape drives. Other types of storage devices  may be used in some circumstances. Some storage devices , for example, may include optical disks.","The communication network  includes network devices  that facilitate communication between networked devices  as well as other network devices . Examples of network devices  include hubs, routers, switches, gateways, and other hardware, infrastructure and software that facilitate the transmission of data, instructions and messages throughout the network . The network devices  may be interconnected using any of several known communication infrastructures and communication media such as wire, fiber optic cable, and wireless channels such as infrared, radio frequency (RF), microwave, satellite and optical communication channels. The various network devices such as switches and routers may operate using any protocol such (IP) (Internet Protocol), FC, and others.","Any combination of topologies can be used to implement the communication network  including topologies utilizing bus, star, and ring topology techniques. Further, the communication network  or portions of the communication network  may include any number of local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and storage area networks (SANs). The communication network  transmits data, signals, and messages using one or more protocols. Examples of suitable protocols are protocols utilized in Ethernet and Fibre Channel networks.","Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the various topologies, protocols, architectures, and implementations of the communication network  and the distributed computer system  that can be used based on these teachings and known techniques. The functions and operations of the blocks described in  may be implemented in any number of devices, circuits, or infrastructure. Two or more of the functional blocks may be integrated in a single device and the functions described as performed in any single device may be implemented over several devices. For example, a hardware component within the system  may operate as a networked device  as well as a network device  in some situations.","The management server  includes at least a processor  and a memory  for running system management software (network manager) and other software facilitating the overall functionality and operation of the management server . The processor  is any type of processor, processor arrangement, microprocessor, or computer configured to execute computer readable code and includes one or more processors or computers. At least a portion of the memory  includes a non-volatile memory medium suitable for storing the computer readable code such as a disk drive.","In the exemplary embodiment, the management server  is a server computer running system management software (network manager) that utilizes one or more device managers to communicate with the network devices  and networked devices  (, ) where at least one of the device managers is an information exchange convention device manager (IEC device manager) . The device managers include at least software code that performs translation, conversion or interface functions to allow the management server  to set, change, monitor or retrieve configuration parameters of a network device  or a networked device . In some circumstances, the implementation and operation of the device managers depend on the particular devices , ,  that are accessed, the information that is exchanged and other factors related to the distributed communication system  and the network manager . Depending on the particular device , , the device managers, or portions of the device managers, may be commercially available or may be specifically constructed based on the particular protocol and other requirements of the devices , . The functionality of the device managers may be implemented in a single manager or computer program or may be distributed over several hardware devices, programs, subprograms or subroutines.","As discussed above, the IEC device manager  dynamically loads and executes handlers  to establish in-band communication between the network manager  and a target device . In the exemplary embodiment, the target device  is any network device  or networked device  connected within the network  that is accessible by the network manager  through the communication network . Any of the networked devices  or network devices , therefore, may be a target device . For example, the target device  may be a mass storage device , a router, hub, switch, gateway, and or other hardware device. During operation, the network manager  communicates with the various networked devices  and network devices  to appropriately establish and modify the configuration of the distributed computer system . In order to effectively execute management tasks, the network manager  may require device information  characterizing the network devices  and networked devices . The network manager , for example, may require the capacity of a storage device  or a LUN number. In some situations, the network manager  communicates \u201cout-of-band\u201d with devices using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). Often, however, this communication technique is less than adequate for several reasons. For example, the infrastructure may not allow out-of-band communication between the network manager  and the particular target device . Further, it may not be possible to determine if the target device  is adequately connected within the system  when communicating with the target device  through an out-of-band communication link. Also, an out-of-band communication such as SNMP may not provide some of the useful device information  that is available through an in-band communication link.","During operation, the network manager  communicates in-band with the target device  through the IEC device manager . The communications between the IEC device manager  and the network manager  may use any protocol or communication standard. In the exemplary embodiment, the interface between the network manager  and the device manager is in accordance with an API, RMI (Remote Method Invocation) or RPC (Remote Procedure Call). The IEC device manager  establishes communications between the network manager  and the target device  by identifying and utilizing a target device handler  to communicate with the target device  and by using a standard information exchange convention to communicate with the network manager . As explained below in further detail, information obtained through the in-band link is reconciled with information that is received through an out-of-band link allowing the network manager  to establish an accurate representation of the computer system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["102","104","204","200","104","102","104"]},"In the exemplary embodiment, the network manager  is a software program running on the management server . The management server  includes any combination of processors  and memory  suitable for executing software code to facilitate the operation of the network manager  and the IEC device manager . In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager  is a program running on the management server  as part of the network manager  application. The IEC device manager , however, may be implemented on other hardware devices, computers, or servers that are either remotely located or co-located with the network manager .","Device information obtained by one or more device managers ,  is stored in a repository  and is associated with each target device  in the system . The repository manager  manages the repository  and resolves conflicts and correlates device information associated with each target device . The repository manager  generates a compiled representation from device information received from multiple sources. For any target device , device information may be obtained through multiple device managers , . For example, a device manger  may communicate with a particular target device  using an \u201cout-of-band\u201d communication link, such as a link using SNMP for example, and the IEC device manager  may communicate with the same target device  using an \u201cin-band\u201d communication link such as a link conforming to the SCSI protocol. A single UID is used to represent each target device  allowing the network manager  to obtain an accurate representation of the configuration of the system .","The device managers ,  run within a device manager service . The device manger service  provides an environment suitable for running the device managers ,  and provides support services to the device managers , . The device manager service  also provides an interface to other network manager functions .","A target device  may be discovered by a discovery engine  or by the device managers , . The discovery engine  reports to the device manager service  any device (, , ) (target device ), that has not yet been identified and provides information that identifies the newly discovered device . In response, the appropriate device manager (, ) is invoked to manage the device .","Therefore, the IEC device manager  is implemented within a computer system to provide access to device information  within target devices  that do not fully comply with the information exchange convention of the standard protocol that is followed within the computer system. The target device handler  corresponding to the nonstandard information exchange convention followed by the target device  provides translation functions between the nonstandard convention and a system accepted convention such as a standard information exchange convention. In some situations, the convention used by the system  may also be a nonstandard convention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["104","106","102","200"]},"At step , the target device  is discovered. In the exemplary embodiment, a device manager , using a host bus adapter (NBA), performs a query for all SCSI devices that can be accessed by the device manager . As is known, an HBA is an I\/O adapter that exchanges information with the Fibre Channel connection and manages transfer of information between the Fibre Channel and the device manager service. The query returns at least one target device . The information received from the query is limited to the discovery of the target devices .","At step , a request for identification information is transmitted in accordance with the standard information exchange convention. The request is a query for identification information transmitted to the target device . In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager  uses a generic handler  to transmit a \u201cuniversal\u201d command that requests the target device manufacturer designation and the target device model. As is known, such a universal, standard request will be recognized by nearly all devices that communicate using the SCSI protocol. In the exemplary embodiment, a request is transmitted for Mode Page 83H using the standard information exchange convention for SCSI.","At step , a response to the request for identification information is received from the target device . In the exemplary embodiment, the response either includes data or indicates that an error has occurred. If the response includes data, the data returned for the manufacturer designation and the model number is used as the identification information. In some circumstances, the returned data may not directly describe the device manufacturer or the model number. Since the data is unique to the type of target device, however, the data returned for the device manufacturer designation and the data returned for the device model number are used to identify the target device  even though the data may not indicate the actual manufacturer or model number. The data returned in the response to the request, therefore, is used as identification information. Where an error is returned, the target device  is ignored and is not supported as discussed below. In the exemplary embodiment, the response for Mode Page 83H is returned. In some situations, a serial number of the target device  may also be returned in response to the request.","At step , it is determined if an error is returned in response to the request for identification information. If an error is returned, the procedure continues at step  where the target device  is ignored. Otherwise, the procedure continues at step . Therefore, if an error is returned, it is determined that the target device  is not supported and the target device  is ignored. Otherwise, at least an attempt is made to support the device using the data returned representing the identification information.","At step , a class identifier (class ID) is created based on the identification information. In the exemplary embodiment, the class ID generator  generates a character string based on the manufacturer designation and the model number of the target device . The following example illustrates one of the numerous identifier generation procedures that can be performed in accordance with the exemplary embodiment. Assuming the target device  is an EMC Clariion CX500 network storage system, the IEC device manager  transmits the identification information request (such as a request for Mode Page 83H) to the target device  using the SCSI protocol. In response, the target device  returns identification information indicating that the target device is an EMC device and that the model of the target device  is CLARIION500. The IEC device manager  receives the information and generates the character string: \u201cEMCCLAR500\u201d. The class identifier, however, may be generated in other ways depending on the particular system  and system format. In some situations, the model number and the manufacturer designator may be returned as blank. In such situations, the generic handler is loaded to attempt to obtain data that uniquely identifies the type of target device . Accordingly, additional procedures may be invoked depending on the particular data returned in response to the identification request.","In the exemplary embodiment, several target devices  may be associated with the same class identifier (class ID) since devices within the system  having the same make and model will result in the generation of the same class identifier (class ID). As explained below, no two devices will have the same unique identifier (UID).","At step , the target device handler  is identified based on the class identifier (class ID). In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager  searches a database of handlers to locate the handler  that is associated with the same class identifier (class ID) as the target device .","At step , the IEC device manager  determines if the handler  is available. If the handler  is available, the procedure loads the target device handler  at step . Otherwise, the procedure continues at step  where the generic handler  is loaded.","At step , the target device handler  is loaded into the IEC device manager . The code corresponding to the target device handler  is retrieved and loaded into the appropriate location with the IEC device manager  in accordance with known techniques. In the exemplary embodiment, the IEC device manager  locates and loads the particular Java class corresponding to the class ID and loads the class (bytecode) into the IEC device manager . Where the IEC device manager  is implemented in a windows operating system, the dynamic link library (DLL) or shared library corresponding to the Class ID is loaded into the device manager . The target device handler  code, therefore, may be a Java Class, dynamic link library (DLL), subroutine, or other type of software code that when loaded into the device manager performs the functions of the device protocol adapter.","At step , the IEC device manager  uses the loaded handler  to communicate with the target device  and access the device information  within the target device . The IEC device manager  maps device information  received from the target device  to communication conforming to the standard information exchange convention to forward information to the device caller (network manager) . For example, if a communication is received from the device caller  requesting the serial number of the target device , the IEC device manager  uses the handler to obtain the serial number from the target device  and to place the serial number in a format in accordance with the standard information exchange convention. In some circumstances, the device information  may require modification prior to presenting the device information  to the device caller  in order place the device information in the format conforming to the standard information exchange convention. For example, if the target device  information exchange convention provides an expanded version of the serial number at Mode Page 85H, the handler  truncates the serial number to the appropriate size and provides Mode Page 83H with the serial number to the device caller (network manager) .","In the exemplary embodiment, the UID represents the serial number of the target device . In situations where the serial number can not be obtained, the IEC device manager  utilizes other unique device information to create a UID that will be interpreted by the device caller  as a legitimate serial number conforming to the standard information exchange convention. For example, the IEC device manager  may use a Fibre Channel WWN (World Wide Name) to create the UID in some circumstances.","The UID of the target device  is associated with the loaded target device handler . When a device caller  communicates with the particular target device , the associated handler  is invoked to provide the translation between the standard information exchange convention and the nonstandard information exchange convention used by the target device . Using the target device handler , the IEC device manager  can perform a variety of tasks and obtain device information  through an in-band connection that would not be possible using a standard information exchange convention. The custom target device handler  allows access to device information  that is located or formatted using non-standard techniques. Further, the target device handler  provides access to custom mode pages that are provided in addition to the standard mode pages specified by SCSI. Some examples of device information  that can be obtained using the custom target device handler  that otherwise may not be available for a specific target device  include the SCSI LUN Number, speed of the target device , tape drive information and robot information. Further the network manager  may perform tasks that would not be possible through an in-band connection without the custom target device handler  such as performing a \u201cping\u201d. As is known, a ping allows the network manager  to determine if a particular target device is available.","In the exemplary embodiment, the procedure described above with reference to  is repeated for each target device  that is discovered. In a computer system  having several different target devices , therefore, each device target device  is discovered and a handler  is loaded for each target device  to facilitate in-band communication with all of the target devices .","Therefore, to establish communication with a target device , the IEC device manager  transmits a request for identification information using a standard information exchange convention through the distributed computer system  to the target device . In response, the target device  transmits the identification information to the IEC device manager . In the exemplary embodiment, the identification information includes at least the name of the manufacturer and the model of the target device . The IEC device manager  generates a Class ID based on the identification information and retrieves the target device handler  corresponding to the target device  using the Class ID. The handler  is used to communicate with the target device  while a standard, or otherwise consistent, information exchange convention is used to communicate with the network manager . The IEC device manager  translates communications to allow the network manger  to communicate with each target device  using an in-band communication link. New devices added to the distributed computer system  are accommodated by loading the appropriate handlers  eliminating the need to modify the network manger .","Clearly, other embodiments and modifications of this invention will occur readily to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of these teachings. The above description is illustrative and not restrictive. This invention is to be limited only by the following claims, which include all such embodiments and modifications when viewed in conjunction with the above specification and accompanying drawings.
