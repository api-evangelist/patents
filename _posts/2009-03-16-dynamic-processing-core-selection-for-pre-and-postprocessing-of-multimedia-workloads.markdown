No. 61\/036,657, filed on Mar. 14, 2008, the disclosure thereof incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates generally to multimedia processing. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to pre-processing and post-processing of multimedia workloads.","As multimedia becomes more prevalent and pervasive on consumer electronic devices such as smart phones, personal digital players, portable multimedia players, digital picture frames, portable navigation devices, Internet media player and other such devices, the demand for processing and multimedia accelerators increases. Hence, in a typical system-on-a-chip (SoC), there are multiple processing cores for processing multimedia workloads. For example, the processing cores can include a central processing unit (CPU), a video accelerator, and a graphics accelerator.","According to conventional approaches, pre-processing and post-processing of multimedia workloads is performed by the CPU, regardless of which processing core processes the multimedia workloads.","The inventors have recognized that these pre-processing and post-processing tasks can be performed by processing cores other than the CPU, for example by video accelerators, graphics accelerators, and the like. One advantage of an allocation of a pre-processing or post-processing task to a processing core other than the CPU is a reduction in the workload of the CPU. Another advantage lies in the fact that a processing core other than the CPU can generally perform the task with much lower power consumption than the CPU.","In general, in one aspect, an embodiment features an apparatus comprising: a processing core performance monitoring module adapted to receive indications of performance levels of a plurality of processing cores, the plurality of processing cores comprising a central processing unit (CPU), a video accelerator, and a graphics accelerator; a video accelerator performance monitoring module adapted to receive an indication of a performance level of the video accelerator; a graphics accelerator performance monitoring module adapted to receive an indication of a performance level of the graphics accelerator; and a processor core management module adapted to dynamically allocate at least one of a pre-processing task and a post-processing task of a multimedia workload to any one of the video accelerator, the graphics accelerator, and the CPUprocessing cores based on the performance levels of the video accelerator, the graphics accelerator, and the CPU.","In general, in one aspect, an embodiment features a method comprising: receiving indications of performance levels of a plurality of processing cores, the plurality of processing cores comprising a central processing unit (CPU), a video accelerator, and a graphics accelerator; receiving an indication of a performance level of the CPU; receiving an indication of a performance level of the video accelerator; receiving an indication of a performance level of the graphics accelerator; and dynamically allocating at least one of a pre-processing task and a post-processing task of a multimedia workload to any one of the video accelerator, the graphics accelerator, and the CPUprocessing cores based on the performance levels of the video accelerator, the graphics accelerator, and the CPU.","In general, in one aspect, an embodiment features a computer program executable on a processing core of a computer comprising a plurality of the processing cores, the computer program comprising: instructions for receiving indications of performance levels of the processing cores; and instructions for dynamically allocating at least one of a pre-processing task and a post-processing task of a multimedia workload to one of the processing cores based on the performance levels.

Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","The leading digit(s) of each reference numeral used in this specification indicates the number of the drawing in which the reference numeral first appears.","Embodiments of the present disclosure provide elements of a method to dynamically detect each multimedia workload and appropriately select processing cores for pre-processing and post-processing of the multimedia workload.

Processor utilization can be measured by instructions per second, operating system idle threads, and the like.

For example, one indication of performance is whether a multimedia workload is processor-bound or memory bound, that is, whether the workload is limited by the processor or memory. Other indications are contemplated. Many of these indications can be reported and monitored dynamically, that is, at runtime. Other indications can only be reported and monitored statically, that is, not at runtime.

For example, the multimedia workloads can include video workloads, graphics workloads, speech recognition workloads, and the like, and encoding and decoding for those workloads. When a multimedia workload is detected, processor core management module  responds by dynamically allocating pre-processing tasks of the multimedia workload, post-processing tasks of the multimedia workload, or both, to one or more of processing cores  based on the reported performance levels (step ). That is, processor core management module  dynamically allocates each of the pre-processing and\/or post-processing tasks to CPU , video accelerator , or graphics accelerator  based on the performance levels. When CPU  has multiple cores, processor core management module  can dynamically allocate tasks to the cores individually.","The pre-processing tasks can include video stabilization, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, temporal filtering, and the like.
