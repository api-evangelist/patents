The play control data in the form of Play Lists enables the record and\/or playback device to reproduce the user data in a predetermined order. Apart from video data, the user data may contain for example audio data, and data giving information about the video and\/or audio data. The selection control data, in the form of Selection Lists enable the user to make a selection out of the available Play Lists by giving input to the apparatus. In addition the known apparatus can process variable control data by performing arithmetical operations and logical tests. The variable control data enables the apparatus a further way of controlling the playback of user data at the record carrier dependent of the history of user input.","In the known record carrier the variable control data comprises a Statement List which describes operations on variables and a Conditional List which describes conditional jumps.","It is a purpose of the invention to provide means which enable more simple variable control.","For this purpose the apparatus is characterized in that the apparatus is adapted to be controlled by variable control data which comprises instructions for conditional arithmetical operations.","For this purpose the record carrier is characterized in that the variable control data comprises at least one instruction for a conditional arithmetical operation.","For this purpose the method is characterized in that the variable control data comprises at least one instruction for a conditional arithmetical operation.","The invention is based on the insight that for interactive playback of audio\/visual data, the choice of what is to be played back depends on many parameters, such as the current user input, the history of user input, the region of playback etc. A plurality of the operations necessary for playback control is therefore performed conditionally. As the apparatus of the invention is adapted to be controlled by variable control data which comprises instructions for conditional arithmetical operations, the variable control data can be concise so that less memory space is required and variable control is simplified.","The conditional arithmetical operations are for example addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo calculation. Whether the arithmetic operations specified in the instruction are performed depends on the outcome of a logical test.","In the record carrier of the invention, the variable control data can be clearly structured. Operations which are to be performed conditionally can be arranged in the same sequence as other operations.","Such a way of control is very suitable for educational purposes: According to instructions in the variable control data the processor can evaluate the progress of the user, for example by evaluating results of user responses upon questions presented by the apparatus. Depending on the outcome of the evaluation the system can select an educational session to continue with.","In a favorable embodiment the record carrier is characterized in that, the instructions are embedded in Command Lists which further comprise a Command List Header which precedes the instruction and an unconditional goto which succeeds the instruction, and which refers to a next List (e.g. another Command List, a Play List or a Selection List).","It is preferred that each Command List comprises only one instruction apart from the unconditional goto.","This embodiment is advantageous if the record carrier is to be played by an apparatus of the invention in which the same processor which interprets the play control data and the selection control data also interprets the variable control data. The header enables the processor to recognize the type of control data. The unconditional goto instruction passes control to a next List, which may be either a Command List, or for example a Play List, which forms play control data or a Selection List which forms selection control data.","Otherwise the apparatus of the invention can have separate processors for interpreting the variable control data and the other control data. The processors can for example communicate with each other via variables which are stored in a common memory.","These and other aspects of the invention are described with reference to the drawing. Therein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","3","1","1","1"]},"This information is to be read out by use of an optical stylus  (known as such) which supplies the detected data to a decoding and error correcting means . The decoded and error corrected data are supplied to a processor , which cooperates with a ROM memory and a RAM memory to control and operate on the data flow received from decoding and error correcting means . A first task of the controller  is to provide control signals, such as velocity control tracking and focusing control signals to the servo system . The servo system  controls the angular velocity \u03c9 of the rotating disc  as well as the position of the optical stylus  with respect to the track of the optical disc , which has been shown by the dotted arrow r. Further the servo system  controls the focusing of the optical stylus, such that the bright bundle emitted by the laser is focused on the information layer of the optical disc (which has been shown by the dotted arrow f).","A second task of the processor  is to control the audio and video bit stream to the dedicated decoders , which decode the e.g. MPEG2 coded video and audio and supply the decoded video to a display  and the decoded audio to a speaker or speaker system  (e.g. a multi channel sound system).","The information to be reproduced by the display  and sound system  is selectable by user input, which is received e.g. by direct control of selection buttons  of the input means  of the optical disc player  or via a remote control device having selection buttons . Of course, other possibilities of control are available and adequate, such as but not limited to: voice control, control via a direct link to a personal computer or via a telephone modem etc.","The processor  of the shown embodiment can be a relatively low power microcontroller having 1 MIPS (million instructions per second) capacity. It is possible to have the video and audio MPEG2 decoding realized by a software controlled processor , which then should be a high speed high power process unit equipped with adequate amounts of RAM and ROM memory and ","The control data stored by the record carrier comprises at least play control data, here in the form of Play Lists, which defines user data items which are playable (also denoted as Play Items), for example a plurality of user data items which are playable in sequence. The control data further comprises selection control data, here in the form of Selection Lists, for enabling the user to select and control reproduction of user data items. The control data further comprises variable control data, in the form of Command Lists, defining operations on user and system variables. A more detailed description is given below. Therein hexadecimal numbers are preceded by a $ and binary numbers are preceded by a %.","The syntax of the Play List is shown in . The semantics of the entries therein are as follows:","The Play List Header is a code which identifies the beginning of the Play List, in this example having the value $10.","The Number Of Items (NOI) gives the number of Play Items in this Play List. The minimum value of NOI is 1.","The List ID gives the List ID Number. Preferably the List ID Number is unique among all Lists on the record carrier.","The Previous List Offset contains a reference to the List that is to be interpreted on execution of a \u201cPREVIOUS\u201d function. Preferably that List is the List which would be reproduced before the current Play List when reproducing the contents of the record carrier in default order, so that the effect of the \u201cPREVIOUS\u201d function corresponds to the intuitive notion that the user has of this function.\n\nThe Next List Offset contains a reference to the List that is to be interpreted after interpretation of the current Play List is completed. Interpretation of the List referred to in the Next List Offset may also be realized immediately by execution of the \u201cNEXT\u201d function.\n\nThe Return List Offset contains a reference to the List that is to be interpreted when a \u201cRETURN\u201d function is executed. The \u201cRETURN\u201d function gives the user control at a higher hierarchical level. The user may for example have selected the current Play List out of number of selections comprised in a Selection List (described below). In that case execution of the \u201cRETURN\u201d function during interpretation of the current Play List has the effect that control is passed to the said Selection List.\n\nPlaying Time defines the time to play from each Play Item of this Play List starting from the beginning of the Play Item. In practice the time to play can not exceed the duration of any Play Item. The value of this entry can be set to $0000 to achieve that the Play Items are played completely. The value of this entry may be modified during interpretation of the current Play List, so as to achieve that Play Items have a mutually different playing time.\n\nThe Play Item Wait Time defines the wait time after playing each Play Item. The wait may be interrupted by a user interaction function. The value of this entry may be modified during interpretation of the current Play List, so as to achieve different waiting times between the Play Items. The waits may be terminated by a user interaction function (e.g. the \u201cNEXT\u201d function).\n\nAuto Pause Wait Time is the wait time at Auto Pause. If a sector is played in which an Auto Pause flag is set, the wait time after play back of the Play Item is finished is the Auto Pause Wait Time instead of the Play Item Wait Time. Likewise this wait time may be interrupted by a user interaction.\n\nThe entry Play Item #n, represents the identification number of a Play Item. The said number may for example directly refer to a track containing a Play Item or to an entry in a table containing a reference to such a track. The Play Item is for example the whole or part of an MPEG Audio\/Video Track, or MPEG encoded Still Pictures with optional MPEG Audio, or MPEG audio without image data.\n","The syntax of the Selection List is shown in . The semantics of the entries are as follows:","The Selection List Header identifies the beginning of the Selection List and equals $18 in this example.","The 8-bit field Flags can contain a plurality of flags. In case each of the bits in the field represents a flag. One flag indicates for example whether Selection Area Fields are present. These Fields contain additional date for use with selection systems that use screen pointing devices. The additional data comprises e.g. coordinates of a rectangular region at the screen which is to be pointed at with the pointing device in order to execute a particular function or to select from a number of options.\n\nThe Number Of Selections (NOS) gives the number of selections which this List enables.\n\nThe Base Of Selection Number (BSN) indicates the first selection number of this List.\n\nThe definition of the List ID is analogous to that of the Play List.\n\nPrevious List Offset: See the definition of Previous List Offset of the Play List.\n\nThe Next List Offset is the reference to the List that is interpreted on execution of the NEXT function\n\nReturn List Offset: See the definition of Return List Offset of the Play List.\n\nThe field Default List Offset contains an offset to the List which is interpreted upon execution of a \u201cDefault Selection\u201d function. With this function the user may indicate that he has no preference for a particular selection for example by striking an arbitrary key not corresponding to a selection.\n\nTime-out List Offset gives a reference of a List that is interpreted after Time out i.e. if the wait-time has expired and no user interaction has taken place.\n\nWait Time for Time-out gives the duration for time-out.\n\nPlay Item Number defines the Play Item to be reproduced when the present Selection List is interpreted. The Play Item is for example a menu indicating the possible options.\n\nLoop Count & Jump Timing specifies the number of times that the Play Item specified in the field Play Item Number is to be repeated, and whether said replay of said Play Item should be interrupted immediately upon user interaction or not.\n\nThe fields Selection #BSN Offset until Selection #(BSN+NOS\u22121) Offset represent the reference to the List that is interpreted when the corresponding selection having a number in the range from BSN until BSN+NOS\u22121 is made.\n","The syntax of the Command List is shown in .","The semantics of the Command List are as follows:","Command List Header: This field identifies the start of a Command List. The value is $20.","Instruction Field This field defines the operations to be carried out by the processor. Possible instructions are set out in .","Next List Offset: This field defines the offset to the next List to execute or play.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 8"],"b":["001","5","7"]},"The second set has an opcode starting with the bits . This set of instructions comprises assignments. The instruction \u201c010 cond0 000\u201d provides for assignment of the value of variable V[l] to variable V[k] provided that condition cond0 is true. Likewise the instruction \u201c010 cond1 001\u201d provides for assignment of the value of the variable V[l] to variable V[k] if condition cond1 is true. The instruction \u201c010 cond0 010\u201d provides for assignment of the value of the constant dddd to variable V[j] if condition cond0 is true. The instruction \u201c010 00 110\u201d results in a block of variables being assigned the value dddd while the variable V[i] greater than or equal to 0. The variable currently being filled is indicated by index j+V[i]. After each assignment the variable V[i] is decreased by 1.","The third set comprises goto instructions. This set has an opcode starting with the bits . Opcodes \u201c100 cond0 000\u201d and \u201c100 cond0 001\u201d respectively effectuate a jump to the List at address \u201coffs\u201d if cond0 is true and if cond1 is true. Opcodes \u201c100 cond0 010\u201d effectuate a jump to the List at address stored in variable V[j] if cond0 is true. Opcodes \u201c100 cond0 100\u201d and \u201c100 cond1 101\u201d effectuate a jump to the address \u201coffs\u201d and a decrease of the value of variable V[i] by one if respectively cond0 and cond1 are true. The opcode \u201c100 cond0 110\u201d effectuates a jump to the address \u201coffs\u201d and a decrease of the variables V[i] and V[j] by one.","The fourth set, of which the opcode starts with the bits , comprises a wait and goto instruction. If this instruction \u201c110 cond0 000\u201d is performed the playback device will wait during V[j] seconds for user input. If no input is received within that time interval the control jumps to the list at address \u201coffs\u201d.","Apart from user variables, the command list interpreter can also access system variables. The system variables serve as an application programming interface between a so called virtual machine (VM) which processes the commands and the hardware of the reproducing apparatus. By acting on system variables, the instructions in the Command List can evaluate and\/or influence system variables, such as the status of an overlay graphics channel, the setting of the audio channels (mute, mono, stereo, etc.). Additionally the instructions can cause the processor to read other parameters, such as the current disc identification, the current track, the current playing time.","The following table gives an example of possible variables to be controlled by commands in the Command List. The variables are stored in an array of 256 16-bit registers. The array comprises 16 read\/write general purpose variables, having variable index 0-15. These variables are not initialized at the start of the Command List. In an embodiment of the apparatus of the invention the value of these variables is maintained when a record carrier is replaced by another record carrier, for example another record carrier belonging to the same album. The array further comprises 240 registers for system variables comprising reserved registers (variable index 16-207), player decoder registers (variable index 208-223), disc related registers (variable index 224-239), Play List related registers (variable index 240-251) and other system related registers (variable index 252-255).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Variable Array"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Type of",{}]},{"entry":["Variable index","register","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["User variables",{},{}]},{"entry":["0 . . . 15","R\/W","get\/set 16 bit general purpose variables"]},{"entry":"System variables"},{"entry":["16 . . . 207","\u2014","Reserved"]},{"entry":"Apparatus decoder"},{"entry":"registers"},{"entry":["208","R\/W","get\/set OGT_channel (0 . . . 3) status"]},{"entry":["209","R\/W","get\/Set Audio_mixing (0 . . . 3) status"]},{"entry":["210","R\/W","gel\/set Audio_stream (0 . . . 3) status"]},{"entry":["211 . . . 223","\u2014","reserved"]},{"entry":"Disc related registers"},{"entry":["224","R\/W","get\/set MPEG_PlayingTime"]},{"entry":["225","R\/W","get\/Set PlayItem_number (PIN)"]},{"entry":["226 . . . 239","\u2014","reserved"]},{"entry":"Play List related"},{"entry":"registers"},{"entry":["240","R\/W","get\/set List_Offset"]},{"entry":["241","R\/W","get\/set Exception_Error List_Offset"]},{"entry":["242","R\/W","get\/set User_input"]},{"entry":["243 . . . 251","\u2014","reserved"]},{"entry":"Other system related"},{"entry":"registers"},{"entry":["252","R\/W","get\/ set Timer"]},{"entry":["253","R\/W","get\/set Shuffle"]},{"entry":["254","R\/W","get\/set NV-RAM_block"]},{"entry":["255","Read","get Player Configuration status"]},{"entry":[{},"Only","flags"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The system variables comprised in the table above are now described in more detail.","OGT-channel: The VM may activate an overlay graphics and text channel by setting this system variable.
