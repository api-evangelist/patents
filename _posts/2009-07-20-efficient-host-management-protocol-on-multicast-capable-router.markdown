Specifically, embodiments of the invention relate to efficient management of host requests for source data over a multicast network.","The use of multicast protocols and the administration of networks implementing multicast protocols are expanding to support new technologies such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and on demand video. These networks utilize set top boxes (STBs), also referred to as hosts, which request data from a list of sources that are specified by the STBs. The sources are data sources that are available over a multicast network such as IPTV channels. These sources can be streamed using multicast to any number of hosts.","The STBs send their list of sources that they are requesting to receive through the multicast network via a host management protocol (HMP). HMPs incorporate or utilize Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discover (MLD). These protocols then communicate the requested list of sources to a multicast routing protocol (MRP) to establish the routing of each requested source to the respective hosts. The MRPs include Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM). In some instances the requested source interest list is transmitted through an L2 snooping device to a multicast router that executes the MRP.","The HMP communicates the entire list of requested sources to the MRP each time a source interest list is received from a host. This causes the MRP to reprocess sources that it has previously received from the HMP. There are two lists of sources that can be provided by the HMP to the MRP. One list of sources is a set of sources to be included (i.e., the host is requesting that these sources be sent to it) and the other list of source is a set of sources to be excluded (i.e., the host is requesting that these resources not be sent to it). Multiple hosts on each subnet send these source interest lists and the HMP constructs and aggregates a source state per subnet comprising the interested sources for all the hosts on that subnet. When any of these hosts sends a new source interest list, the entire aggregated state in the HMP is sent to the MRP.","In a network where a L2 snooping network element is present between the hosts and the multicast router, the HMP on the L2 network element processes the received source interest lists from the hosts to update the snooping state maintained by it and forwards the sources lists in their entirety to the router so that the MRP can update the routing. On the router, the MRP is assisted by a local HMP to process the received source interest lists and communicate the received source interests to the MRP.","The embodiments of the invention include a method for reducing computational and\/or bandwidth requirements of multicast routing by efficiently communicating required source state information. The method comprises the steps of receiving at a first network element, executing a modified host management protocol, a source interest list from a host over a network, the source interest list identifies at least one multicast source to be one of excluded from or included in routing to the host. The modified host management protocol identifies a difference between the source interest list and a source state maintained by the first network element, wherein the source state includes at least one of an exclude state that identifies at least one multicast source to exclude from a host or an include state that identifies at least one multicast source to provide to a host. The modified host management protocol communicates the difference between the source interest list and the source state if one exists, and not an entirety of the source interest list to a multicast routing protocol to alter the set of multicast sources to be routed to the host.","The embodiments of the invention include a host device to generate a source interest list based on user input and to transmit the source interest list over a network to a first network element, the source interest list to identify at least one multicast source to be one of excluded or included from routing to the host. The first network element is in communication with the host device over the network. The first network element executes a modified host management protocol, the modified host management protocol to identify any differences between the source interest list and a source state maintained by the first network element, wherein the source state includes at least one of an exclude state that identifies at least one multicast source to exclude from a host device and an include state that identifies at least one multicast source to provide to the host device. The modified host management protocol provides only the difference between the source interest list and the source state and not an entirety of the source interest list to a multicast routing protocol to alter the set of multicast sources to be provided to the host device.","The embodiments of the invention include a network element to reduce computational and\/or bandwidth requirements of multicast routing by efficiently communicating required source state information, the network element comprising a modified host management protocol component to receive a source interest list from a host over a network, wherein the source interest list identifies at least one multicast source to be one of excluded from or included in routing to the host. The modified host management protocol component identifies any differences between the source interest list and a source state maintained by the modified host management protocol component, wherein the source state includes at least one of an exclude state that identifies at least one multicast source to exclude from a host and an include state that identifies at least one multicast source to provide to the host. The modified host management protocol component communicates the difference between the source interest list and the source state to a multicast routing protocol to alter the set of multicast sources to be routed to the host.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description. It will be appreciated, however, by one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without such specific details. Those of ordinary skill in the art, with the included descriptions, will be able to implement appropriate functionality without undue experimentation.","The operations of the flow diagram will be described with reference to the exemplary embodiment of . However, it should be understood that the operations of the flow diagram can be performed by embodiments of the invention other than those discussed with reference to , and the embodiments discussed with reference to  can perform operations different than those discussed with reference to the flow diagrams.","The techniques shown in the figures can be implemented using code and data stored and executed on one or more electronic devices (e.g., an end station, a network element, etc.). Such electronic devices store and communicate (internally and\/or with other electronic devices over a network) code and data using machine-readable media, such as machine-readable storage media (e.g., magnetic disks; optical disks; random access memory; read only memory; flash memory devices; or phase-change memory). In addition, such electronic devices typically include a set of one or more processors coupled to one or more other components, such as one or more storage devices, user input\/output devices (e.g., a keyboard, a touch screen, and\/or a display), and network connections. The coupling of the set of processors and other components is typically through one or more busses and bridges (also termed as bus controllers). The storage device and signals carrying the network traffic respectively represent one or more machine-readable storage media and machine-readable communication media. Thus, the storage device of a given electronic device typically stores code and\/or data for execution on the set of one or more processors of that electronic device. Of course, one or more parts of an embodiment of the invention may be implemented using different combinations of software, firmware, and\/or hardware.","As used herein, a network element (e.g., a router, switch, bridge, etc.) is a piece of networking equipment, including hardware and software, that communicatively interconnects other equipment on the network (e.g., other network elements, end stations, etc.). Some network elements are \u201cmultiple services network elements\u201d that provide support for multiple networking functions (e.g., routing, bridging, switching, Layer 2 aggregation, session border control, and\/or subscriber management, multicast routing, IPTV), and\/or provide support for multiple application services (e.g., data, voice, and video). Subscriber end stations (e.g., servers, workstations, laptops, palm tops, mobile phones, smart phones, multimedia phones, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phones, portable media players, GPS units, gaming systems, set-top boxes (STBs), etc.) access content\/services provided over the Internet and\/or content\/services provided on virtual private networks (VPNs) overlaid on the Internet. The content and\/or services are typically provided by one or more end stations (e.g., server end stations) belonging to a service or content provider or end stations participating in a peer to peer service, and may include public web pages (free content, store fronts, search services, etc.), private web pages (e.g., username\/password accessed web pages providing email services, etc.), corporate networks over VPNs, IPTV channels or sources, etc. Typically, subscriber end stations are coupled (e.g., through customer premise equipment coupled to an access network (wired or wirelessly)) to edge network elements, which are coupled (e.g., through one or more core network elements to other edge network elements) to other end stations (e.g., server end stations).","The embodiments of the present invention provide a system, network and method for avoiding the disadvantages of the prior art including: duplication of information processing each time a host sends a message containing previously received sources, creation of two lists (i.e., include lists and exclude lists) when sending source information, poor scaling due to the large size of source lists, vulnerability to denial of service attacks by repeated sending of large source lists, slow processing time inducing delay in the system and longer \u2018zapping\u2019 times (i.e., time required to change between sources).","The embodiments of the invention overcome these disadvantages by identifying differences between source interest lists received from hosts and a source state at network element. Only the differences between the source interest list and the source state are provided to the multicast routing protocol. This provides the following advantages: more efficient processing due to avoiding processing and transmission or sharing of duplicate information, simplified processing for the multicast routing protocol by providing it only a single smaller source interest list to process, scalability due to only processing the differences between source state and source interest list information, enhanced security enabled by ignoring redundant source interest lists, improved zapping times due to overall network and system efficiency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","113","113","103","109","117","113","113","113","113","113","113"]},"The STBs  can be any type of host device for managing the delivery of source data to a user. An example of a STB is console device for delivering Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) to a user. STBs  can include console devices, gaming devices, desktops, workstations, digital video recorders (DVRs), optical disk playback devices (e.g., digital versatile disc (DVD) players), handheld devices, cellular phones and similar computing devices. These devices execute software or include hardware components that manage the user experience and generate requests for any number of data sources .","These STBs  or \u2018hosts\u2019 generate a list of sources that are of interest to a user or \u2018source interest lists\u2019 that are sent to network element  executing a modified host management protocol (HMP). In one embodiment, these source interest lists contain a full set of all sources that the STB  is requesting in the form of an include list or an exclude list. In another embodiment, the source interest lists received from a STB  may only reflect changes to its source interests. An include list is a set of sources that the STB  is requesting to be sent to the STB . An exclude list is a set of sources that the STB  is requesting not to be sent to the STB . Each time a list is sent by the STB  it may be list of new sources or a complete list reflecting all user input or settings received to that point. The format of the message can be in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) or Multicast Listener Discover (MLD) formats or any similar protocol used to convey host information to the Multicast network elements. These messages can be sent over the multicast sub network C to an L2 network element  or a multicast router .","The invention encompasses alternative embodiments including an embodiment where the STBs  communicate directly with a modified HMP  on a multicast router  or similar network element. In another embodiment, the invention includes at least one L2 network element  where a modified HMP  processes the source interest lists received from the STBs .","In the embodiment of the multicast network where an L2 network element  is present, a modified HMP  on the L2 network element  process each received message from each of the hosts and maintains a source state based on the source interest list for each STB . The processing of the messages received from the STBs  is discussed in greater detail herein below in reference to . The modified HMP  identifies the differences between the received source interest list and the maintained source state. The modified HMP  then provides this information to a multicast routing protocol (MRP) by generating a message to be sent through a remote modified HMP  to the remote MRP  or calls a function or method (e.g., of an application programming interface (API)) of a local MRP or local L2 snooper .","The message or call passes on only the difference in state or sources instead of the entire source interest list to minimize the computational resources and bandwidth required to update the multicast routing. The MRP updates the multicast routing from the various sources  in accordance with the received source interest list change. The MRP can be any multicast routing protocol including Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), PIM\u2014sparse mode and similar MRPs.","The modified HMP  and MRP or L2 snooper  present on the L2 network element , as well as, the modified HMP  and MRP  present on the multicast router  can be implemented as a software components in the form of instructions to be executed by line cards, control cards, network processors or similar processing components of the respective network elements , . In other embodiments, these elements are implemented as firmware or hardware components.","Source state information can be tracked as an aggregate of all STBs  connected to a network element on a multicast subnet C, as separate information for each STB or similarly tracked. Similarly, the source state information can be tracked as a set of source identifiers, source addresses or similar information sufficient for identifying a specific source in the multicast network. The source state can be implemented by separately tracking sources to exclude from each host, sources to include for each host or by complete tracking of either. The source state can also be tracked for both individual STBs  and multiple STBs in aggregate. In one embodiment, the source state is tracked in aggregate for a specific sub network C and any number of sub networks can be supported in this manner.","In multicast networks where an L2 network element  is present, but the MRP  is only present on a separate multicast router , the message with the identified source differences is sent over the multicast sub network B to a modified HMP  present on the multicast router . The message may be in a standard message format according to IGMP or MLD that is handled by a modified HMP local to the multicast router  or a modified message format. The modified HMP  processes the received message and calls (e.g., through a function or method of an API) the MRP  to provide it with the source interest list changes that were received. Upon receipt of the updated source interest list, the MRP updates its routing tables to provide the requested data from sources  to the STBs  over the multicast sub network A.","The L2 network element  can be any type of network element capable of executing a modified HMP and snooper or providing modified HMP or snooper implementation in firmware or hardware or any combination thereof. The L2 network element  can support any number of STBs  or hosts using any type of networking protocol. The multicast network can include any number of L2 network elements  that operate in parallel to service the STBs .","The multicast router  is a network element that implements multicast routing through the MRP. The multicast router  can be any type of networking element capable of implementing MRP  and a modified HMP . The multicast router  can support any number of STBs  or hosts, sources  or L2 network elements  using any type of networking protocol. The multicast system can include any number of multicast routers  that operate in parallel to service the STBs  and sources .","The sources  can be any type of data sources provided by any number of end station servers. The data sources  can be streaming or static data sources. The data provided can be IPTV data or similar sources suitable for multicasting. The servers providing these services can utilize any multicast routing protocol for transmitting these source data to the hosts over the multicast network including the multicast sub networks A-C. The servers providing the sources  can be any type of computing devices including dedicated server machines, desktops, workstations or similar computing devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"201"},"The source interest list is sent to the modified HMP implemented either at an L2 network element or at a multicast router. The modified HMP analyzes the source interest list to determine if it is an include list (i.e., a source interest list that indicates each of the sources that the host is requesting to be sent to the host) (block ). In other embodiments, source interest lists and source states may only be implemented as effective include lists or exclude lists. One skilled in the art would understand that these are subsets of the process described herein.","If the source interest list is not an include list, then it is known that the list is an exclude list (i.e., a source interest list that indicates each of the sources that the host does not want to receive). The modified HMP then compares the received source interest list with the exclude source state maintained by the modified HMP to determine whether there are any differences (block ). If there are not differences between the received exclude list and the maintained exclude state then no action is required and the process awaits the next received source interest list (block ).","However, if the comparison of the received exclude list and the exclude state maintained by the modified HMP reveals a differences, then the modified HMP determines whether the MRP is present on the same device as the modified HMP carrying out the comparison (block ). If the MRP is present on the same device, then the modified HMP sends the differences between the received exclude list and the current exclude state to the MRP via a function or method call or similar process (block ). The function or method call can be made through an application programming interface (API) or similar interface. Providing the changes to the MRP completes the handling of the source interest list in the process (block ) and the process awaits the reception of the next source interest list (block ).","If the MRP is not present on the same device as the modified HMP, then the modified HMP prepares a message to be sent to the MRP at the multicast router or similar location (block ). The message provides the differences between the received exclude list and the exclude state maintained by the modified HMP. In all cases, the modified HMP updates the maintained state to reflect the received exclude list. The HMP message can be a standard HMP or modified HMP message. After the message is sent, the processing of the received source interest list has completed (block ) and the process awaits the reception of the next source interest list (block ).","If the received source interest list is an include list (i.e., a source interest list that identifies those sources a host want to receive), then the modified HMP compares the received source interest list to the maintained include source state (block ). If there is no difference between the received source interest list and the include source state maintained by the modified HMP, then no action is taken and the process awaits the next source interest list to be received (block ).","If the comparison reveals differences between the received source interest list and the maintained include source state, then the modified HMP determines whether the MRP is present on the current network element (block ). If the MRP is present on the current network element, then the modified HMP sends the difference between the received source interest list and the maintained include source state through a function or method call (e.g., a method or function of an API) to the MRP or similar mechanism (block ). If the MRP is not present on the same network element as the modified HMP, then the modified HMP generates a message in a standard or modified HMP format. The HMP message is then sent to the multicast router (block ). After the differences are provided to the MRP the processing of the received source interest list ends (block ). The process then awaits the receipt of another source interest list (block ). The include source state is updated to reflect the changes of the received source interest list during the comparison of the two.","Thus, a method, system and apparatus for host protocol management have been described.
