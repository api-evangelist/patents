No. 61\/704,351, filed Sep. 21, 2012, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by this reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. W81XWH-07-1-0211 awarded by the Department of Defense (DOD) Orthopaedic Extremity Trauma Research Program, Grant Nos. DMR-0847711 and DMR-1006558 awarded by the National Science Foundation, and Grant Nos. R21EB012750 and R01AR056138 awarded by the National Institute of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to poly(thioketal-urethane) scaffolds. Embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter further relate to method of utilizing and synthesizing polythioketal scaffolds, including poly(thioketal-urethane) scaffolds.","Wound healing is also a universal problem, particularly given the increases in immobile aging, diabetic amputees, paralyzed patients afflicted with large chronic wounds and fistulas, and trauma victims with large cutaneous defects. These well known problems indicate a need for the development of injectable biomaterials to promote restoration of tissue integrity.","To attempt to meet some needs, biodegradable scaffolds made from synthetic polymers have been extensively investigated for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Examples include poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), polyanhydrides (PAA), and polyurethanes, all of which have a history of use in products approved by the FDA. These materials are applicable for a diverse range of regenerative applications because they offer a high degree of tunability, generate a minimal host inflammatory response, and degrade into non-cytotoxic components that are easily cleared from the body.","To attempt to overcome some of these known problems, polyurethane (PUR) (or poly(ester urethane) (PEUR)) scaffolds have been developed that can foam and cure in situ. Such polyurethane scaffolds can comprise polyesters that degrade hydrolytically, and have been shown to have promising properties for treating skin and bone. However, because degradation occurs primarily by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of ester bonds in the amorphous soft segment, hydroxyl and carboxylic acid end groups are formed. The residual carboxylic acids in the polymer reduce the local pH at later stages of degradation, thereby catalyzing further hydrolysis of the polymer.","This auto-catalytic degradation of the PEUR network driven by residual carboxylic acid groups can result in a mismatch in the rates of scaffold degradation and tissue in-growth that leads to resorption gaps and compromised tissue regeneration. Various strategies have been investigated to modify the degradation rates and decrease the accumulation of acidic by-products of polyester-based scaffolds. However, the initial rate of polyester hydrolysis is primarily dictated by the presence of water, is first order with respect to the concentration of ester bonds, and does not correlate to specific cellular activities. Thus, matching the rates of scaffold degradation and tissue ingrowth is challenging for polyester-based platforms.","Biomaterials that degrade by cell-mediated mechanisms, such as materials with protease-cleavable peptides, have been exposed as potential alternatives to polyester-based platforms. However, these peptide sequences are cleaved by specific enzymes that are upregulated in specific pathological environments, making it difficult to establish this approach as a generalizable tissue engineering platform. Also, manufacturing peptides on the scale necessary to regenerate sizable tissue sections is both relatively expensive and time-consuming.","Hence, there remains a need for tissue scaffolds that do not have the same problems associated with the composites and scaffolds discussed above. Additionally, there remains a need for scaffolds that treat tissue, including bone tissue and\/or skin tissue wounds, and has tunable and controlled degradation characteristics. It is also desirable to have scaffolds that are moldable, injectable, capable of implantation via minimally invasive techniques, capable of curing in situ, and\/or capable of flowing to fill contours or irregular shapes.","The presently-disclosed subject matter meets some or all of the above-identified needs, as will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of information provided in this document.","This Summary lists several embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments.

In particular, treatment methods can comprise contacting the tissue with an effective amount of a biodegradable scaffold that includes a plurality of polythioketal polymers and a plurality of polyisocyanates. The tissue can be skin, bone, or the like. The particular tissue being treated can be a wound site.","In some embodiments, in the contacting step described above, the polythioketal polymers and the polyisocyanates are contacted with the tissue in a fully-uncured (100% polyisocyanate and polythioketal polymer) or a partially-uncured state (partial conversion to polythioketal-urethane scaffold). The method for treating a subject can further comprise allowing the polythioketal polymers and the polyisocyanates to cure in contact with the tissue so that at least one polyisocyanate is linked to at least one polythioketal polymer to form the scaffold.

For example, bioactive agents may include, but are not limited to osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive agents, anti-HIV substances, anti-cancer substances, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-viral agents, enzyme inhibitors, neurotoxins, opioids, hypnotics, anti-histamines, lubricants, tranquilizers, anti-convulsants, muscle relaxants, anti-Parkinson agents, anti-spasmodics and muscle contractants including channel blockers, miotics and anti-cholinergics, anti-glaucoma compounds, anti-parasite agents, anti-protozoal agents, and\/or anti-fungal agents, modulators of cell-extracellular matrix interactions including cell growth inhibitors and anti-adhesion molecules, vasodilating agents, inhibitors of DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis, anti-hypertensives, analgesics, anti-pyretics, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-angiogenic factors, angiogenic factors, anti-secretory factors, anticoagulants and\/or antithrombotic agents, local anesthetics, ophthalmics, prostaglandins, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, targeting agents, chemotactic factors, receptors, neurotransmitters, proteins, cell response modifiers, cells, peptides, polynucleotides, viruses, and vaccines. In certain embodiments, the bioactive agent is a drug. In certain embodiments, the bioactive agent is a small molecule.","Antimicrobial used as bioactive agents in embodiments of the present invention may be selected from one that does little to no harm to the healing process. Clinically, antibiotics may be selected for their spectrum or ease of administration to the patient. When selecting an antibiotic for local delivery, the physical characteristics (charge and hydrophobicity) and state (liquid or powder) of the drug may also be considered. Additionally, antimicrobials' effects on eukaryotic cells may be considered when developing an embodiment of the present invention, including a dual-delivery scaffold embodiment. In vitro studies that evaluated the effect of eight concentrations (ranging from 0 to 5,000 mg\/ml) of 21 antibiotics on the viability and activity of osteoblasts found that vancomycin, a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic that is efficacious for treating infections caused by gram-positive bacteria such as , may have the least detrimental effects on osteoblast function. All other antibiotics in the study reduced the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at doses that were 10-50 times lower than that of vancomycin. Other studies also indicate that vancomycin has less adverse effects on osteoblasts than other commonly used antibiotics in vitro. Furthermore, vancomycin may not impede bone growth in fractures in vivo. Some embodiments comprise an antibiotic selected from the group consisting of clindamycin, cefazolin, oxacillin, rifampin, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, ceftazadime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, and imipenem.","A more complete listing of bioactive agents and specific drugs suitable for use in the present invention may be found in \u201cPharmaceutical Substances: Syntheses, Patents, Applications\u201d by Axel Kleemann and Jurgen Engel, Thieme Medical Publishing, 1999; the \u201cMerck Index: An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals\u201d, Edited by Susan Budavari et al., CRC Press, 1996, the United States Pharmacopeia-25\/National Formulary-20, published by the United States Pharmcopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville Md., 2001, and the \u201cPharmazeutische Wirkstoffe\u201d, edited by Von Keemann et al., Stuttgart\/New York, 1987, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Some degradation may occur due to the present of reactive oxygen species.","The term \u201cbiocompatible\u201d as used herein, is intended to describe materials that, upon administration in vivo, do not induce undesirable side effects. In some embodiments, the material does not induce irreversible, undesirable side effects. In certain embodiments, a material is biocompatible if it does not induce long term undesirable side effects. In certain embodiments, the risks and benefits of administering a material are weighed in order to determine whether a material is sufficiently biocompatible to be administered to a subject.","The term \u201cbiomolecules\u201d as used herein, refers to classes of molecules (e.g., proteins, amino acids, peptides, polynucleotides, nucleotides, carbohydrates, sugars, lipids, nucleoproteins, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, steroids, natural products, etc.) that are commonly found or produced in cells, whether the molecules themselves are naturally-occurring or artificially created (e.g., by synthetic or recombinant methods). For example, biomolecules include, but are not limited to, enzymes, receptors, glycosaminoglycans, neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, cell response modifiers such as growth factors and chemotactic factors, antibodies, vaccines, haptens, toxins, interferons, ribozymes, anti-sense agents, plasmids, DNA, and RNA. Exemplary growth factors include but are not limited to bone morphogenic proteins (BMP's) and their active fragments or subunits. In some embodiments, the biomolecule is a growth factor, chemotactic factor, cytokine, extracellular matrix molecule, or a fragment or derivative thereof, for example, a cell attachment sequence such as a peptide containing the sequence, RGD.","The term \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d as used herein, refers to a sugar or polymer of sugars. The terms \u201csaccharide\u201d, \u201cpolysaccharide\u201d, \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d, and \u201coligosaccharide\u201d, may be used interchangeably. Most carbohydrates are aldehydes or ketones with many hydroxyl groups, usually one on each carbon atom of the molecule. Carbohydrates generally have the molecular formula CHO. A carbohydrate may be a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, trisaccharide, oligosaccharide, or polysaccharide. The most basic carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, such as glucose, sucrose, galactose, mannose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, and fructose. Disaccharides are two joined monosaccharides. Exemplary disaccharides include sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, and lactose. Typically, an oligosaccharide includes between three and six monosaccharide units (e.g., raffinose, stachyose), and polysaccharides include six or more monosaccharide units. Exemplary polysaccharides include starch, glycogen, and cellulose. Carbohydrates may contain modified saccharide units such as 2\u2032-deoxyribose wherein a hydroxyl group is removed, 2\u2032-fluororibose wherein a hydroxyl group is replaced with a fluorine, or N-acetylglucosamine, a nitrogen-containing form of glucose (e.g., 2\u2032-fluororibose, deoxyribose, and hexose).

The composite may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. For example, a composite may be a combination of bone particles and a polymer; a combination of bone particles, polymers and antibiotics; or a combination of two different polymers. In certain embodiments, the composite has a particular orientation.","The term \u201ccontacting\u201d refers to any method of providing or delivering a scaffold on to or near tissue to be treated. Such methods are described throughout this document, and include injection of a biodegradable scaffold on to a tissue wound and\/or molding a biodegradable scaffold in a mold and then placing the molded scaffold on a tissue wound. In some embodiments contacting refers to completely covering a skin wound, and optionally the surrounding skin, with a biodegradable polyurethane scaffold. In some embodiments contacting refers to placing a biodegradable polyurethane scaffold between two or more bone fragments that have fractured. In various aspects, a scaffold can be contact an existing tissue wound, and in further various aspects a polyurethane scaffold can be contacted prophylactically; that is, to prevent a wound from forming on tissue.","The term \u201cflowable polymer material\u201d as used herein, refers to a flowable composition including one or more of monomers, pre-polymers, oligomers, low molecular weight polymers, uncross-linked polymers, partially cross-linked polymers, partially polymerized polymers, polymers, or combinations thereof that have been rendered formable. One skilled in the art will recognize that a flowable polymer material need not be a polymer but may be polymerizable. In some embodiments, flowable polymer materials include polymers that have been heated past their glass transition or melting point. Alternatively or in addition, a flowable polymer material may include partially polymerized polymer, telechelic polymer, or prepolymer. A pre-polymer is a low molecular weight oligomer typically produced through step growth polymerization. The pre-polymer is formed with an excess of one of the components to produce molecules that are all terminated with the same group. For example, a diol and an excess of a diisocyanate may be polymerized to produce isocyanate terminated prepolymer that may be combined with a diol to form a polyurethane. Alternatively or in addition, a flowable polymer material may be a polymer material\/solvent mixture that sets when the solvent is removed.","The term \u201cnontoxic\u201d is used herein to refer to substances which, upon ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin by a human or animal, do not cause, either acutely or chronically, damage to living tissue, impairment of the central nervous system, severe illness or death.","The term \u201costeoconductive\u201d as used herein, refers to the ability of a substance or material to provide surfaces which are receptive to the growth of new bone.","The term \u201costeogenic\u201d as used herein, refers to the ability of a substance or material that can induce bone formation.","The term \u201costeoinductive\u201d as used herein, refers to the quality of being able to recruit cells (e.g., osteoblasts) from the host that have the potential to stimulate new bone formation. In general, osteoinductive materials are capable of inducing heterotopic ossification, that is, bone formation in extraskeletal soft tissues (e.g., muscle).","The term \u201costeoimplant\u201d is used herein in its broadest sense and is not intended to be limited to any particular shapes, sizes, configurations, compositions, or applications. Osteoimplant refers to any device or material for implantation that aids or augments bone formation or healing. Osteoimplants are often applied at a bone defect site, e.g., one resulting from injury, defect brought about during the course of surgery, infection, malignancy, inflammation, or developmental malformation. Osteoimplants can be used in a variety of orthopedic, neurosurgical, dental, and oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures such as the repair of simple and compound fractures and non-unions, external, and internal fixations, joint reconstructions such as arthrodesis, general arthroplasty, deficit filling, disectomy, laminectomy, anterior cerival and thoracic operations, spinal fusions, etc.","The terms \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d, \u201cnucleic acid\u201d, or \u201coligonucleotide\u201d as used herein, refer to a polymer of nucleotides.

DNAs and RNAs are exemplary polynucleotides. The polymer may include natural nucleosides (i.e., adenosine, thymidine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine, deoxyadenosine, deoxythymidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine), nucleoside analogs (e.g., 2-aminoadenosine, 2-thithymidine, inosine, pyrrolo-pyrimidine, 3-methyl adenosine, C5-propynylcytidine, C5-propynyluridine, C5-bromouridine, C5-fluorouridine, C5-iodouridine, C5-methylcytidine, 7-deazaadenosine, 7-deazaguanosine, 8-oxoadenosine, 8-oxoguanosine, O(6)-methylguanine, and 2-thiocytidine), chemically modified bases, biologically modified bases (e.g., methylated bases), intercalated bases, modified sugars (e.g., 2\u2032-fluororibose, ribose, 2\u2032-deoxyriboses, arabinose, and hexose), or modified phosphate groups (e.g., phosphorothioates and 5\u2032-N-phosphoramidite linkages). The polymer may also be a short strand of nucleic acids such as RNAi, siRNA, or shRNA.","The terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d, \u201cpeptide\u201d, or \u201cprotein\u201d as used herein, include a string of at least three amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. The terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d, \u201cpeptide\u201d, and \u201cprotein\u201d, may be used interchangeably. In some embodiments, peptides may contain only natural amino acids, although non-natural amino acids (i.e., compounds that do not occur in nature but that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain) and\/or amino acid analogs as are known in the art may alternatively be employed. Also, one or more of the amino acids in a peptide may be modified, for example, by the addition of a chemical entity such as a carbohydrate group, a phosphate group, a farnesyl group, an isofarnesyl group, a fatty acid group, a linker for conjugation, functionalization, or other modification, etc. In one embodiment, the modifications of the peptide lead to a more stable peptide (e.g., greater half-life in vivo). These modifications may include cyclization of the peptide, the incorporation of D-amino acids, etc. None of the modifications should substantially interfere with the desired biological activity of the peptide.","The terms \u201cpolysaccharide\u201d or \u201coligosaccharide\u201d as used herein, refer to any polymer or oligomer of carbohydrate residues. Polymers or oligomers may consist of anywhere from two to hundreds to thousands of sugar units or more. \u201cOligosaccharide\u201d generally refers to a relatively low molecular weight polymer, while \u201cpolysaccharide\u201d typically refers to a higher molecular weight polymer. Polysaccharides may be purified from natural sources such as plants or may be synthesized de novo in the laboratory. Polysaccharides isolated from natural sources may be modified chemically to change their chemical or physical properties (e.g., reduced, oxidized, phosphorylated, cross-linked). Carbohydrate polymers or oligomers may include natural sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, etc.) and\/or modified sugars (e.g., 2\u2032-fluororibose, 2\u2032-deoxyribose, etc.). Polysaccharides may also be either straight or branched. They may contain both natural and\/or unnatural carbohydrate residues. The linkage between the residues may be the typical ether linkage found in nature or may be a linkage only available to synthetic chemists. Examples of polysaccharides include cellulose, maltin, maltose, starch, modified starch, dextran, poly(dextrose), and fructose. In some embodiments, glycosaminoglycans are considered polysaccharides. Sugar alcohol, as used herein, refers to any polyol such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, galactitol, erythritol, inositol, ribitol, dulcitol, adonitol, arabitol, dithioerythritol, dithiothreitol, glycerol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates.","The term \u201cporogen\u201d as used herein, refers to a chemical compound that may be part of the inventive composite and upon implantation\/injection or prior to implantation\/injection diffuses, dissolves, and\/or degrades to leave a pore in the osteoimplant composite. A porogen may be introduced into the composite during manufacture, during preparation of the composite (e.g., in the operating room), or after implantation\/injection. A porogen essentially reserves space in the composite while the composite is being molded but once the composite is implanted the porogen diffuses, dissolves, or degrades, thereby inducing porosity into the composite. In this way porogens provide latent pores. In certain embodiments, the porogen may be leached out of the composite before implantation\/injection. This resulting porosity of the implant generated during manufacture or after implantation\/injection (i.e., \u201clatent porosity\u201d) is thought to allow infiltration by cells, bone formation, bone remodeling, osteoinduction, osteoconduction, and\/or faster degradation of the osteoimplant. A porogen may be a gas (e.g., carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other inert gas), liquid (e.g., water, biological fluid), or solid. Porogens are typically water soluble such as salts, sugars (e.g., sugar alcohols), polysaccharides (e.g., dextran (poly(dextrose)), water soluble small molecules, etc. Porogens can also be natural or synthetic polymers, oligomers, or monomers that are water soluble or degrade quickly under physiological conditions. Exemplary polymers include polyethylene glycol, poly(vinylpyrollidone), pullulan, poly(glycolide), poly(lactide), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), other polyesters, and starches. In certain embodiments, bone particles utilized in provided composites or compositions may act as porogens. For example, osteoclasts resorb allograft and make pores in composites.","In some embodiments, porogens may refer to a blowing agent (i.e., an agent that participates in a chemical reaction to generate a gas). Water may act as such a blowing agent or porogen.","The term \u201cporosity\u201d as used herein, refers to the average amount of non-solid space contained in a material (e.g., a composite of the present invention). Such space is considered void of volume even if it contains a substance that is liquid at ambient or physiological temperature, e.g., 0.5\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. Porosity or void volume of a composite can be defined as the ratio of the total volume of the pores (i.e., void volume) in the material to the overall volume of composites. In some embodiments, porosity (c), defined as the volume fraction pores, can be calculated from composite foam density, which can be measured gravimetrically. Porosity may in certain embodiments refer to \u201clatent porosity\u201d wherein pores are only formed upon diffusion, dissolution, or degradation of a material occupying the pores. In such an instance, pores may be formed after implantation\/injection. It will be appreciated by these of ordinary skill in the art that the porosity of a provided composite or composition may change over time, in some embodiments, after implantation\/injection (e.g., after leaching of a porogen, when osteoclasts resorbing allograft bone, etc.). For the purpose of the present disclosure, implantation\/injection may be considered to be \u201ctime zero\u201d (T).

Remodeling also describes the process by which non-bony native tissue and tissue grafts are removed and replaced with new, cell-containing tissue in vivo. Remodeling also describes how inorganic materials (e.g., calcium-phosphate materials, such as \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate) are replaced with living bone.","The term \u201cscaffold\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that can be used to treat tissue and\/or a wound. In some embodiments the scaffold or graft is a foam that can be injected between fractured bone fragments to help heal the fracture.

Materials may be shaped into any shape, configuration, or size. For example, materials can be shaped as sheets, blocks, plates, disks, cones, pins, screws, tubes, teeth, bones, portions of bones, wedges, cylinders, threaded cylinders, and the like, as well as more complex geometric configurations.","The term \u201csmall molecule\u201d as used herein, is used to refer to molecules, whether naturally-occurring or artificially created (e.g., via chemical synthesis), that have a relatively low molecular weight. In some embodiments, small molecules have a molecular weight of less than about 2,500 g\/mol, for example, less than 1000 g\/mol. In certain embodiments, small molecules are biologically active in that they produce a local or systemic effect in animals, such as mammals, e.g., humans. In certain embodiments, a small molecule is a drug. In certain embodiments, though not necessarily, a drug is one that has already been deemed safe and effective for use by an appropriate governmental agency or body (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).","The terms \u201csubject\u201d or \u201csubject in need thereof\u201d refer to a target of administration, which optionally displays symptoms related to a particular disease, pathological condition, disorder, or the like. The subject of the herein disclosed methods can be a vertebrate, such as a mammal, a fish, a bird, a reptile, or an amphibian.

Removal of the material may be cell-mediated or accomplished through chemical processes, such as dissolution and hydrolysis.","The terms \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d refer to the medical management of a patient with the intent to heal, cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. For example, in some embodiments treatment refers to the healing bone tissue that is fractured and\/or healing wounded skin tissue.","The term \u201cwet compressive strength\u201d as used herein, refers to the compressive strength of an osteoimplant after being immersed in physiological saline (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), water containing 0.9 g NaCl\/100 ml water, etc.) for a minimum of 12 hours (e.g., 24 hours). Compressive strength and modulus are well-known measurements of mechanical properties and is measured using the procedure described herein","The term \u201cworking time\u201d as used herein, is defined in the ISO9917 standard as \u201cthe period of time, measured from the start of mixing, during which it is possible to manipulate a dental material without an adverse effect on its properties\u201d (Clarkin et al., 2009; 20:1563-1570). In some embodiments, the working time for a two-component polyurethane is determined by the gel point, the time at which the crosslink density of the polymer network is sufficiently high that the material gels and no longer flows. According to the present invention, the working time is measured by loading the syringe with the reactive composite and injecting <0.25 ml every 30 s. The working time is noted as the time at which the material was more difficult to inject, indicating a significant change in viscosity.","The term \u201cwound\u201d as used herein refers to any defect, injury, disorder, damage, or the like of tissue. In some embodiments a wound can be a bone fracture.

Modifications to embodiments described in this document, and other embodiments, will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the information provided in this document. The information provided in this document, and particularly the specific details of the described exemplary embodiments, is provided primarily for clearness of understanding and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. In case of conflict, the specification of this document, including definitions, will control.","Aspects of the presently-disclosed subject matter include biodegradable poly(thioketal-urethane) (PTK-UR) tissue scaffolds. In some embodiments the scaffolds comprise a polythioketal polymer and polyisocyanates. Exemplary scaffolds can be used to treat tissue. Other exemplary scaffolds can also be used as delivery systems for biologically active agents to promote tissue healing and regeneration.","The present inventors discovered a more ubiquitous cell-mediated signal for scaffold degradation. ROS are key mediators of cell function in both health and disease, especially at sites of inflammation and tissue healing. Utilizing these cell-generated molecules as triggers for selective polymer degradation, the present inventors conceived of a tissue scaffold with well-matched rates of tissue ingrowth and cell-mediated scaffold degradation. Novel poly(thioketal) polymers featuring tunable reactive end-chemistries, chain compositions, and ROS-mediated degradation rates have been developed towards this end. These PTK polymers can be incorporated into 3D porous tissue engineering scaffolds with more robust mechanical properties than similar constructs fabricated from standard polyesters. PTK-UR scaffolds can be selectively degraded by ROS and could be stable under aqueous conditions. Thus, embodiments of the present scaffolds exhibit biodegradability that is cell-mediated. Moreover, the oxidative degradation rates of the PTK-URs can follow first-order degradation kinetics and exhibit dose-dependent degradation with respect to ROS levels. PTK scaffolds can support cell growth, cell infiltration, and granulation tissue formation. PTK-URs represent a useful new class of biomaterials that provide a robust, cell-degradable substrate for guiding new tissue formation.","Some embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter relate to scaffolds that can be used in a large variety of clinical applications, for example, as bone void fillers, to repair or help healing of skeletal deficiencies resulting from trauma, tumors, surgery, iatrogenic, congenital, genetic, metabolic and degenerative or abnormal development, and inflammatory infection. In some embodiments, scaffolds promote cellular infiltration from adjacent osseous tissues, thus accelerating the remodeling process. In some embodiments scaffolds aid in the treatment of cutaneous wounds.","The presently-disclosed subject matter also provides methods of preparing and using inventive composites as well as kits for preparing and\/or administering inventive composites. Inventive porous composites may be prepared using any of a variety of methods. In some embodiments, inventive composites are prepared using a method that includes water as a blowing agent. In one embodiment, the scaffolds are injected, extruded, molded, or similarly delivered to a tissue site (e.g., bony defect or cutaneous wound) of a subject. Inventive composites are engineered to set in situ to form a solid composite that may have a desired or predetermined mechanical strength. In certain embodiments, the scaffolds may include monomers or pre-polymers.","I) Polymer Component","Synthetic polymers can be designed with properties targeted for a given clinical application. According to the present invention, polyurethanes (PUR) are a useful class of biomaterials due to the fact that they can be injectable or moldable as a reactive liquid that subsequently cures to form a porous composite. These materials also have tunable degradation rates, which are shown to be highly dependent on the choice of polyol and isocyanate components (Hafeman et al., 2008; 25(10):2387-99; Storey et al., 1994; 32:2345-63; Skarja et al., 2000; 75:1522-34). Polyurethanes have tunable mechanical properties, which can also be enhanced with the addition of bone particles and\/or other components (Adhikari et al., 2008; 29:3762-70; Gorna et al., 2003; 67A(3):813-27) and exhibit elastomeric rather than brittle mechanical properties. Polyurethanes can be made by reacting together the components of a two-component composition, one of which includes a polyisocyanate while the other includes a component having two or more hydroxyl groups (i.e., polyols) to react with the polyisocyanate. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,177, discloses a method for repairing a tissue site using polyurethanes, the content of which is incorporated by reference","It is to be understood that by \u201ca two-component composition\u201d it means a composition comprising two essential types of polymer components. In some embodiments, such a composition may additionally comprise one or more other optional components.","In some embodiments, polyurethane is a polymer that has been rendered formable through combination of two liquid components (i.e., a polythioketal polymer and a polyisocyanate). In some embodiments, a polyisocyanate or a polythioketal polymer may be a molecule with two or more isocyanate or hydroxyl groups respectively. In some embodiments, a polyisocyanate may have at least four isocyanate.","Synthesis of biodegradable scaffolds results from a reaction between a polythioketal (PTK) polymer and polyisocyanate. The PTK polymer itself can be made through a reaction between one or more different subunits (e.g., dithiols), as illustrated below in Scheme 1. An isocyanate can react with the terminal functional group (e.g., hydroxyl) of the PTK polymer. The relative rates of these reactions determine the scaffold morphology, working time, and setting time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"188.55mm","wi":"135.04mm","file":"US09463261-20161011-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The PTK-UR scaffolds described herein are the product of the reaction between at least two components, namely a polythioketal polymer, which can be a copolymer, and a polyisocyanate. In some embodiments, multiple different PTK and\/or PTK-URs (e.g., different structures, difference molecular weights) may be used in a composite\/composition of the present invention. In some embodiments, other biocompatible and\/or biodegradable polymers may be used with the present scaffolds.","The polythioketal polymer and polyisocyanate can be mixed in any proportion that results in a scaffolds having desired characteristics in terms of strength, flowability, and the like. For example, the scaffolds can comprise about 5 mol %, 10 mol %, 15 mol %, 20 mol %, 25 mol %, 30 mol %, 35 mol %, 40 mol %, 45 mol %, 50 mol %, 55 mol %, 60 mol %, 65 mol %, 70 mol %, 75 mol %, 80 mol %, 85 mol %, 90 mol %, 95 mol %, PTK polymer or polyisocyanate. Similarly to the PUR scaffolds discussed above, the ratio of PTK polymer to polyisocyanate can be optimized so there is a deficiency or an excess of the number of reactive groups of the PTK polymer in relation to the NCO equivalents on the polyisocyanate. On the other hand, in some embodiments there is an approximately stoichiometric ratio of PTK polymer functional groups to NCO groups on the polyisocyanates.","In some embodiments the reaction is balanced with use of an index. The index can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nINDEX=100\u00d7number of NCO equivalents\/number of OH,SH, or other equivalents.\n","Then, the relative amounts of isocyanate (e.g., HDIt) and PTK polymer can be selected so as to obtain a predetermined index. In some embodiments the index is in the range of approximately 80 to 150. In other embodiments the index is about 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, or 135.","Polyisocyanates and\/or PTK polymers can be selected to produce polymers having various physiochemical properties and morphologies including, for example, flexible foams, rigid foams, elastomers, coatings, adhesives, and sealants. The properties of scaffolds are controlled by choice of the raw materials and their relative concentrations. For example, PTK comprising a relatively high concentration of ether groups, for example from 2-mercaptoethylether (MEE) subunits, can degrade at relatively faster rates that other scaffolds. The molecular weights of the PTK polymer, the subunits of the PTK polymer, and\/or the polyisocyanates can also be varied to manipulate the degradability, density, and other characteristics of the scaffolds. In some embodiments the present scaffolds are comprised of a network of PTK polymers and polyisocyanates that are cross-linked (i.e., covalently bound) through a curing process. In some embodiments, pores in bone\/polyurethanes composites in the present invention are interconnected and have a diameter ranging from approximately 50 to approximately 1000 microns.","As discussed above, the density of the scaffolds can be varied depending on the components selected for its manufacture. In some embodiments scaffolds can comprise a density of about 50 mg\/m, about 75 mg\/m, about 100 mg\/m, about 125 mg\/m, about 150 mg\/m, about 175 mg\/m, about 200 mg\/m, about 225 mg\/m, or about 250 mg\/m. In some embodiments the scaffolds preferably will comprise a density of about 80 mg\/mto about 200 mg\/m, and even more preferably of about about 80 mg\/m, to about 150 mg\/m. In general, the density of a scaffold will increase as its porosity decreases.","Polyisocyanate.","Polyisocyanates or multi-isocyanate compounds for use in the present invention include aliphatic polyisocyanates. Exemplary aliphatic polyisocyanates include, but are not limited to, lysine diisocyanate, an alkyl ester of lysine diisocyanate (for example, the methyl ester or the ethyl ester), lysine triisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 4,4\u2032-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (HMDI), cyclohexyl diisocyanate, 2,2,4-(2,2,4)-trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate (TMDI), dimers prepared form aliphatic polyisocyanates, trimers prepared from aliphatic polyisocyanates and\/or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) trimer (HDIt) sold as Desmodur N3300A may be a polyisocyanate utilized in the present invention. In some embodiments, polyisocyanates used in the present invention includes approximately 10 to 55% NCO by weight (wt % NCO=100*(42\/Mw)). In some embodiments, polyisocyanates include approximately 15 to 50% NCO.","Polyisocyanates used herein also include aromatic polyisocyanates.","Polythioketal Polymer.","Some embodiments of the present invention, instead of polyester polyols, utilize a polythioketal (PTK) polymer. Any polythioketal can be used. In some embodiments the polythioketal has a molecular weight of about 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000, 12,000, 13,000, 14,000, 15,000, 16,000, 17,000, 18,000, 19,000, or 20,000 g\/mol. In some embodiments the PTK polymer preferably includes molecular weight of about 1,000 to about 10,000 g\/mol. As is understood by those in the art, polythioketal refers to a compound having a plurality of thioketal units, which are represented by the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"9.99mm","wi":"16.43mm","file":"US09463261-20161011-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Embodiments of scaffolds that are made from a PTK advantageously do not degrade hydrolytically or at a particular pH. Embodiments of scaffolds comprising PTK also do not autocatalytically degrade. Instead, exemplary PTK scaffolds can degrade by reactive oxygen species, which are a cell-created phenomenon. Thus, the degradation rate of PTK scaffolds depends on the conditions created by the cellular environment, and is not affected by a scaffold's own degradation products. Furthermore, this mechanism helps degradation of a scaffold comprising PTK to proceed from the scaffold's exterior, where it is exposed to a biological environment, rather than from its interior where degradation products may accumulate.","The tunable degradation rates of scaffolds can be varied depending on the particular environment that a scaffold comprising PTK is in. However, certain embodiments of scaffolds comprising PTK have half-lives in oxidative medium (i.e., 20 wt % hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 M cobalt chloride) of about 5 days, 10 day, 15 days, 20 days, 25 days, 30 days, 45 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 150 days, or 180 days. In other embodiments scaffolds comprising PTK have half-lives of one or more years. Preferably, for certain bone and skin treatment applications, the half-life of a scaffold comprising PTK is between 5 days and 120 days.","A further advantage of PTK scaffolds is that their degradation rates are tunable and controllable. For example, in some embodiments the degradation rate of a PTK scaffold is tuned to match the rate of cellular ingrowth and activity within the scaffold. This will allow PTK scaffolds to have superior mechanical integrity during the entire time period of tissue treatment, healing, and remodeling. Furthermore, unlike prior scaffolds, this can reduce or eliminate the extent to which gaps are formed between tissue that is growing and the scaffold that is degrading.","In some embodiments the polythioketal polymer comprises one or more ethylene glycol units, which optionally may be poly(ethylene glycol) units depending on the precursors chosen to synthesize the PTK. Thus, the PTK polymer can be a copolymer having thioketal units and ethylene glycol units, either of which may or may not be repeating in the copolymer. The polythioketal polymers can comprise any percentage of ethylene glycol units, and the scaffold may comprise about 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% ethylene glycol units. In some embodiments the percentage of ethylene glycol in a PTK polymer is calculated based on the percentage of units in a polymer that comprising ethylene glycol (e.g., 2-mercaptoethylether).","PTK polymers can be synthesized from any number of combinations of precursor compounds (subunits). Precursors include known dithiol monomers. Notably, some PTK and ethylene glycol copolymers are synthesized from a precursor comprising one or more ethylene glycol units, which may or may not be repeating (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) dithiols). Some PTK polymers are synthesized using precursors comprising one or more thiol groups, such as precursors that are a dithiol or, more specifically, a dithiol functional oligo-ethelyne gycol. In some embodiments a precursor can comprise one or more ketal groups. In some embodiments the precursor used to synthesize the PEG-PTK copolymer is a dithiol selected from the group consisting of 2-mercaptoethyl ether (di(ethylene glycol) dithiol), 2,2\u2032-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (tri(ethylene glycol) dithiol), 2,2\u2032-[2,2\u2032-oxybis(ethane-2,1-diyl)bis(oxy)]diethanethiol (tetra(ethylene glycol) dithiol), 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecane-1,17-dithiol, tetraethylene glycol di(ethanediol) (hexa(ethylene glycol) dithiol). Of course, by varying the types and proportions of precursors utilized, desired mechanical and degradation characteristics can be obtained.","Degradation properties can be tuned by, among other things, using precursors to modify the distance between thioketal linkers in a polythioketal polymers. In other embodiments degradation can be tuned by varying the concentration of other groups in the PTK polymer and\/or polyisocyanate. For example, scaffolds can degrade at a faster rate as the concentration of ether groups in the PTK polymer increases. Thus, the inclusion of poly(ethylene glycol) dithiols to a PTK polymer can increase the relatively degradation rate of the resulting PTK-UR scaffold.","In this regard, in some embodiments the present scaffolds comprise a PTK polymer that includes a poly(ethylene glycol) dithiol (e.g., di(ethylene glycol) dithiol) and another dithiol. The other dithiol can be an alkane dithiol. The alkane dithiol can have any suitable number of carbon atoms, and in some embodiments comprises 1 to 10 carbon atoms. An exemplary alkane dithiol includes 1,4-butanedithiol. Nevertheless, for PTK polymer comprise a di(ethylene glycol) dithiol and another dithiol, the molecular ratio of the di(ethylene glycol) dithiol to the other dithiol can be 100:0 (no other dithiol) to 0:100 (no di(ethylene glycol) dithiol). Thus, the resulting PTK polymer can comprise about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65. 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, or 95 mol % of the di(ethylene glycol) dithiol.","Furthermore, some embodiments the PTK polymers can have their functional groups modified. In specific embodiments the terminal functional groups, or the function groups at opposite ends of a polymer backbone and\/or branch, have modified functional groups. For example, in some embodiments the end-groups of the PTK polymer can be modified with hydroxyl or amine functional groups, rather than the sulfhydryl groups that result from the synthesis of a PTK polymer. In some embodiments the PTK polymers comprising terminal \u2014SH groups, including nonfunctionalized PTK polymers, have relatively higher reactivities than PTK polymers having hydroxyl terminal groups. Accordingly, in some embodiments comprising thiol terminal groups can utilize 0.001-5 pphp catalyst (e.g., triethylene diamine (TEDA)) and preferably 0.001-2 pphp TEDA, whereas embodiments comprising hydroxyl terminal groups can utilize 0.1-10 pphp TEDA and preferably 0.5-5 pphp. This different reactivity is caused by, among other things, what is known in the art as \u201cclick\u201d chemistry.

For example, when composites used in wound healing, solid fillers can help absorb excess moisture in the wounds from blood and serum and allow for proper foaming.","In certain embodiments, additional biocompatible polymers (e.g., PEG) or co-polymers can be used with compositions and composites in the present invention.","Water.","Water may be a blowing agent to generate porous polyurethane-based composites. Porosity of bone\/polymer composites increased with increasing water content, and biodegradation rate accelerated with decreasing polyester half-life, thereby yielding a family of materials with tunable properties that are useful in the present invention. See, Guelcher et al., Tissue Engineering, 13(9), 2007, pp 2321-2333, which is incorporated by reference.","In some embodiments, an amount of water is about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 parts per hundred parts (pphp) polyol. In some embodiments, water has an approximate range of any of such amounts.","In some embodiments, at least one catalyst is added to form reactive liquid mixture (i.e., two-component compositions). A catalyst, for example, can be non-toxic (in a concentration that may remain in the polymer).","Catalyst.","A catalyst can, for example, be present in two-component compositions in a concentration in the range of approximately 0.5 to 5 parts per hundred parts polyol (pphp) and, for example, in the range of approximately 0.5 to 2, or 2 to 3 pphp. A catalyst can, for example, be an amine compound. In some embodiments, catalyst may be an organometallic compound or a tertiary amine compound. In some embodiments the catalyst may be stannous octoate (an organobismuth compound), triethylene diamine optionally in solution with dipropyleneglycol, bis(dimethylaminoethyl)ether, dimethylethanolamine, dibutyltin dilaurate, and Coscat organometallic catalysts manufactured by Vertullus (a bismuth based catalyst), or any combination thereof.","Stabilizer.","In some embodiments, a stabilizer is nontoxic (in a concentration remaining in the polyurethane foam) and can include a non-ionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant or combinations thereof. For example, a stabilizer can be a polyethersiloxane, a salt of a fatty sulfonic acid or a salt of a fatty acid. In certain embodiments, a stabilizer is a polyethersiloxane, and the concentration of polyethersiloxane in a reactive liquid mixture can, for example, be in the range of approximately 0.25 to 4 parts per hundred polyol. In some embodiments, polyethersiloxane stabilizer is hydrolyzable.","In some embodiments, the stabilizer can be a salt of a fatty sulfonic acid. Concentration of a salt of the fatty sulfonic acid in a reactive liquid mixture can be in the range of approximately 0.5 to 5 parts per hundred polyol. Examples of suitable stabilizers include a sulfated castor oil or sodium ricinoleicsulfonate.","Stabilizers can be added to a reactive liquid mixture of the present invention to, for example, disperse prepolymers, polyols and other additional components, stabilize the rising carbon dioxide bubbles, and\/or control pore sizes of inventive composites. Although there has been a great deal of study of stabilizers, the operation of stabilizers during foaming is not completely understood. Without limitation to any mechanism of operation, it is believed that stabilizers preserve the thermodynamically unstable state of a polyurethane foam during the time of rising by surface forces until the foam is hardened. In that regard, foam stabilizers lower the surface tension of the mixture of starting materials and operate as emulsifiers for the system. Stabilizers, catalysts and other polyurethane reaction components are discussed, for example, in Oertel, G\u00fcnter, ed., , Hanser Gardner Publications, Inc. Cincinnati, Ohio, 99-108 (1994). A specific effect of stabilizers is believed to be the formation of surfactant monolayers at the interface of higher viscosity of bulk phase, thereby increasing the elasticity of surface and stabilizing expanding foam bubbles.","Chain Extender.","To prepare high-molecular-weight polymers, prepolymers are chain extended by adding a short-chain (e.g., <500 g\/mol) polyamine or polyol. In certain embodiments, water may act as a chain extender. In some embodiments, addition of chain extenders with a functionality of two (e.g., diols and diamines) yields linear alternating block copolymers.","Plasticizer.","In some embodiments, inventive compositions and\/or composites include one or more plasticizers. Plasticizers are typically compounds added to polymers or plastics to soften them or make them more pliable. According to the present invention, plasticizers soften, make workable, or otherwise improve the handling properties of polymers or composites. Plasticizers also allow inventive composites to be moldable at a lower temperature, thereby avoiding heat induced tissue necrosis during implantation. Plasticizer may evaporate or otherwise diffuse out of the composite over time, thereby allowing composites to harden or set. Without being bound to any theory, plasticizer are thought to work by embedding themselves between the chains of polymers. This forces polymer chains apart and thus lowers the glass transition temperature of polymers. In general, the more plasticizer added, the more flexible the resulting polymers or composites will be.","In some embodiments, plasticizers are based on an ester of a polycarboxylic acid with linear or branched aliphatic alcohols of moderate chain length. For example, some plasticizers are adipate-based. Examples of adipate-based plasticizers include bis(2-ethylhexyl)adipate (DOA), dimethyl adipate (DMAD), monomethyl adipate (MMAD), and dioctyl adipate (DOA). Other plasticizers are based on maleates, sebacates, or citrates such as bibutyl maleate (DBM), diisobutylmaleate (DIBM), dibutyl sebacate (DBS), triethyl citrate (TEC), acetyl triethyl citrate (ATEC), tributyl citrate (TBC), acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), trioctyl citrate (TOC), acetyl trioctyl citrate (ATOC), trihexyl citrate (THC), acetyl trihexyl citrate (ATHC), butyryl trihexyl citrate (BTHC), and trimethylcitrate (TMC). Other plasticizers are phthalate based. Examples of phthalate-based plasticizers are N-methyl phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), bis(n-butyl)phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), diisodecyl phthalate (DOP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and di-n-hexyl phthalate. Other suitable plasticizers include liquid polyhydroxy compounds such as glycerol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), triethylene glycol, sorbitol, monacetin, diacetin, and mixtures thereof. Other plasticizers include trimellitates (e.g., trimethyl trimellitate (TMTM), tri-(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM-MG), tri-(n-octyl,n-decyl) trimellitate (ATM), tri-(heptyl,nonyl) trimellitate (LTM), n-octyl trimellitate (OTM)), benzoates, epoxidized vegetable oils, sulfonamides (e.g., N-ethyl toluene sulfonamide (ETSA), N-(2-hydroxypropyl) benzene sulfonamide (HP BSA), N-(n-butyl) butyl sulfonamide (BBSA-NBBS)), organophosphates (e.g., tricresyl phosphate (TCP), tributyl phosphate (TBP)), glycols\/polyethers (e.g., triethylene glycol dihexanoate, tetraethylene glycol diheptanoate), and polymeric plasticizers. Other plasticizers are described in (G. Wypych, Ed., ChemTec Publishing, 2004), which is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, other polymers are added to the composite as plasticizers. In certain particular embodiments, polymers with the same chemical structure as those used in the composite are used but with lower molecular weights to soften the overall composite. In other embodiments, different polymers with lower melting points and\/or lower viscosities than those of the polymer component of the composite are used.","In some embodiments, polymers used as plasticizer are poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). PEG used as a plasticizer is typically a low molecular weight PEG such as those having an average molecular weight of 1000 to 10000 g\/mol, for example, from 4000 to 8000 g\/mol. In certain embodiments, PEG 4000, PEG 5000, PEG 6000, PEG 7000, PEG 8000 or combinations thereof are used in inventive composites. For example, plasticizer (PEG) is useful in making more moldable composites that include poly(lactide), poly(D,L-lactide), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), or poly(caprolactone). Plasticizer may comprise 1-40% of inventive composites by weight. In some embodiments, the plasticizer is 10-30% by weight. In some embodiments, the plasticizer is approximately 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% or 40% by weight. In other embodiments, a plasticizer is not used in the composite. For example, in some polycaprolactone-containing composites, a plasticizer is not used.","In some embodiments, inert plasticizers may be used. In some embodiments, a plasticizer may not be used in the present invention.","Porosity of inventive composites may be accomplished using any means known in the art. Exemplary methods of creating porosity in a composite include, but are not limited to, particular leaching processes, gas foaming processing, supercritical carbon dioxide processing, sintering, phase transformation, freeze-drying, cross-linking, molding, porogen melting, polymerization, melt-blowing, and salt fusion (Murphy et al., 8(1):43-52, 2002; incorporated herein by reference). For a review, see Karageorgiou et al., 26:5474-5491, 2005; incorporated herein by reference. Porosity may be a feature of inventive composites during manufacture or before implantation, or porosity may only be available after implantation. For example, an implanted composite may include latent pores. These latent pores may arise from including porogens in the composite.","Porogens may be any chemical compound that will reserve a space within the composite while the composite is being molded and will diffuse, dissolve, and\/or degrade prior to or after implantation or injection leaving a pore in the composite. Porogens may have the property of not being appreciably changed in shape and\/or size during the procedure to make the composite moldable. For example, a porogen should retain its shape during the heating of the composite to make it moldable. Therefore, a porogen does not melt upon heating of the composite to make it moldable. In certain embodiments, a porogen has a melting point greater than about 60\u00b0 C., greater than about 70\u00b0 C., greater than about 80\u00b0 C., greater than about 85\u00b0 C., or greater than about 90\u00b0 C.","Porogens may be of any shape or size. A porogen may be spheroidal, cuboidal, rectangular, elongated, tubular, fibrous, disc-shaped, platelet-shaped, polygonal, etc. In certain embodiments, the porogen is granular with a diameter ranging from approximately 100 microns to approximately 800 microns. In certain embodiments, a porogen is elongated, tubular, or fibrous. Such porogens provide increased connectivity of pores of inventive composite and\/or also allow for a lesser percentage of the porogen in the composite.","Amount of porogens may vary in inventive composite from 1% to 80% by weight. In certain embodiments, the plasticizer makes up from about 5% to about 80% by weight of the composite. In certain embodiments, a plasticizer makes up from about 10% to about 50% by weight of the composite. Pores in inventive composites are thought to improve the osteoinductivity or osteoconductivity of the composite by providing holes for cells such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, cells of the osteoblast lineage, stem cells, etc. Pores provide inventive composites with biological in growth capacity. Pores may also provide for easier degradation of inventive composites as bone is formed and\/or remodeled. In some embodiments, a porogen is biocompatible.","A porogen may be a gas, liquid, or solid. Exemplary gases that may act as porogens include carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, or air. Exemplary liquids include water, organic solvents, or biological fluids (e.g., blood, lymph, plasma). Gaseous or liquid porogen may diffuse out of the osteoimplant before or after implantation thereby providing pores for biological in-growth. Solid porogens may be crystalline or amorphous. Examples of possible solid porogens include water soluble compounds. Exemplary porogens include carbohydrates (e.g., sorbitol, dextran (poly(dextrose)), starch), salts, sugar alcohols, natural polymers, synthetic polymers, and small molecules.","In some embodiments, carbohydrates are used as porogens in inventive composites. A carbohydrate may be a monosaccharide, disaccharide, or polysaccharide. The carbohydrate may be a natural or synthetic carbohydrate. In some embodiments, the carbohydrate is a biocompatible, biodegradable carbohydrate. In certain embodiments, the carbohydrate is a polysaccharide. Exemplary polysaccharides include cellulose, starch, amylose, dextran, poly(dextrose), glycogen, etc.","In certain embodiments, a polysaccharide is dextran. Very high molecular weight dextran has been found particularly useful as a porogen. For example, the molecular weight of the dextran may range from about 500,000 g\/mol to about 10,000,000 g\/mol, preferably from about 1,000,000 g\/mol to about 3,000,000 g\/mol. In certain embodiments, the dextran has a molecular weight of approximately 2,000,000 g\/mol. Dextrans with a molecular weight higher than 10,000,000 g\/mol may also be used as porogens. Dextran may be used in any form (e.g., particles, granules, fibers, elongated fibers) as a porogen. In certain embodiments, fibers or elongated fibers of dextran are used as a porogen in inventive composites. Fibers of dextran may be formed using any known method including extrusion and precipitation. Fibers may be prepared by precipitation by adding an aqueous solution of dextran (e.g., 5-25% dextran) to a less polar solvent such as a 90-100% alcohol (e.g., ethanol) solution. The dextran precipitates out in fibers that are particularly useful as porogens in the inventive composite. Once the composite with dextran as a porogen is implanted into a subject, the dextran dissolves away very quickly. Within approximately 24 hours, substantially all of dextran is out of composites leaving behind pores in the osteoimplant composite. An advantage of using dextran in a composite is that dextran exhibits a hemostatic property in extravascular space. Therefore, dextran in a composite can decrease bleeding at or near the site of implantation.","Small molecules including pharmaceutical agents may also be used as porogens in the inventive composites. Examples of polymers that may be used as plasticizers include poly(vinyl pyrollidone), pullulan, poly(glycolide), poly(lactide), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide). Typically low molecular weight polymers are used as porogens. In certain embodiments, a porogen is poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) or a derivative thereof. Plasticizers that are removed faster than the surrounding composite can also be considered porogens.","II) Components to Deliver","Alternatively or additionally, composites of the present invention may have one or more components to deliver when implanted, including biomolecules, small molecules, bioactive agents, cells, etc., to promote tissue regeneration, growth, and healing. Examples of materials that can be incorporated include chemotactic factors, angiogenic factors, bone cell inducers and stimulators, including the general class of cytokines such as the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily of bone growth factors, the family of bone morphogenic proteins, osteoinductors, and\/or bone marrow or bone forming precursor cells, isolated using standard techniques. Sources and amounts of such materials that can be included are known to those skilled in the art.","Biologically active materials, comprising biomolecules, small molecules, and bioactive agents may also be included in inventive composites to, for example, stimulate particular metabolic functions, recruit cells, or reduce inflammation. For example, nucleic acid vectors, including plasmids and viral vectors, that will be introduced into the patient's cells and cause the production of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins may be included in a composite. Biologically active agents include, but are not limited to, antiviral agent, antimicrobial agent, antibiotic agent, amino acid, peptide, protein, glycoprotein, lipoprotein, antibody, steroidal compound, antibiotic, antimycotic, cytokine, vitamin, carbohydrate, lipid, extracellular matrix, extracellular matrix component, chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, growth factor, anti-rejection agent, analgesic, anti-inflammatory agent, viral vector, protein synthesis co-factor, hormone, endocrine tissue, synthesizer, enzyme, polymer-cell scaffolding agent with parenchymal cells, angiogenic drug, collagen lattice, antigenic agent, cytoskeletal agent, mesenchymal stem cells, bone digester, antitumor agent, cellular attractant, fibronectin, growth hormone cellular attachment agent, immunosuppressant, nucleic acid, surface active agent, hydroxyapatite, and penetraction enhancer. Additional exemplary substances include chemotactic factors, angiogenic factors, analgesics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, bone morphogenic proteins, and other growth factors that promote cell-directed degradation or remodeling of the polymer phase of the composite and\/or development of new tissue (e.g., bone). RNAi or other technologies may also be used to reduce the production of various factors.","In some embodiments, inventive composites include antibiotics. Antibiotics may be bacteriocidial or bacteriostatic. An anti-microbial agent may be included in composites. For example, anti-viral agents, anti-protazoal agents, anti-parasitic agents, etc. may be include in composites. Other suitable biostatic\/biocidal agents include antibiotics, povidone, sugars, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary antibiotics include, but not limit to, Amikacin, Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Neomycin, Netilmicin, Streptomycin, Tobramycin, Paromomycin, Geldanamycin, Herbimycin, Loravabef, etc. (See, 1999).","Inventive composites may also be seeded with cells. In some embodiments, a patient's own cells are obtained and used in inventive composites. Certain types of cells (e.g., osteoblasts, fibroblasts, stem cells, cells of the osteoblast lineage, etc.) may be selected for use in the composite. Cells may be harvested from marrow, blood, fat, bone, muscle, connective tissue, skin, or other tissues or organs. In some embodiments, a patient's own cells may be harvested, optionally selected, expanded, and used in the inventive composite. In other embodiments, a patient's cells may be harvested, selected without expansion, and used in the inventive composite. Alternatively, exogenous cells may be employed. Exemplary cells for use with the invention include mesenchymal stem cells and connective tissue cells, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, preosteoblasts, and partially differentiated cells of the osteoblast lineage. Cells may be genetically engineered. For example, cells may be engineered to produce a bone morphogenic protein.","In some embodiments, inventive composites may include a composite material comprising a component to deliver. For example, a composite materials can be a biomolecule (e.g., a protein) encapsulated in a polymeric microsphere or nanoparticles. In certain embodiments, BMP-2 encapsulated in PLGA microspheres may be embedded in a bone\/polyurethane composite used in accordance with the present invention. Sustained release of BMP-2 can be achieved due to the diffusional barriers presented by both the PLGA and Polyurethane of the inventive composite. Thus, release kinetics of growth factors (e.g., BMP-2) can be tuned by varying size of PLGA microspheres and porosity of polyurethane composite.","To enhance biodegradation in vivo, composites of the present invention can also include different enzymes. Examples of suitable enzymes or similar reagents are proteases or hydrolases with ester-hydrolyzing capabilities. Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, proteinase K, bromelaine, pronase E, cellulase, dextranase, elastase, plasmin streptokinase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, chymopapain, collagenase, subtilisin, chlostridopeptidase A, ficin, carboxypeptidase A, pectinase, pectinesterase, an oxireductase, an oxidase, or the like. The inclusion of an appropriate amount of such a degradation enhancing agent can be used to regulate implant duration.","Components to deliver may not be covalently bonded to a component of the composite. In some embodiments, components may be selectively distributed on or near the surface of inventive composites using the layering techniques described above. While surface of inventive composite will be mixed somewhat as the composite is manipulated in implant site, thickness of the surface layer will ensure that at least a portion of the surface layer of the composite remains at surface of the implant. Alternatively or in addition, biologically active components may be covalently linked to the bone particles before combination with the polymer. As discussed above, for example, silane coupling agents having amine, carboxyl, hydroxyl, or mercapto groups may be attached to the bone particles through the silane and then to reactive groups on a biomolecule, small molecule, or bioactive agent.","III) Preparation of Scaffold","In general, inventive scaffolds are prepared by combining two or more polymers, compounds, particles, and\/or any additional components. To form inventive scaffolds, a poly(thioketal) polymer and a polyisocyanate, as discussed herein, may be combined with a reactive liquid (i.e., a two-component composition) thereby forming a naturally injectable or moldable scaffold or a scaffold that can be made injectable or moldable. Alternatively, components to be delivered may be combined with polyisocyanate or PTK polymer first and then combined with other components.","In some embodiments, particles may be combined first with a hardener that includes a PTK polymer and, optionally, one or more of water, a catalyst, a solvent, a diluent, a stabilizer, a porogen, a plasticizer, etc., and then the hardener is combined with a polyisocyanate. In some embodiments, a hardener (e.g., a PTK polymer, water and a catalyst) may be mixed with components to be delivered (e.g., biologically active agents) or components that are to be incorporated into the scaffold (e.g., porogens, bone powder, etc.). In some embodiments, in order to enhance storage stability of two-component compositions, the two (liquid) component process may be modified to an alternative three (liquid)-component process wherein a catalyst and water may be dissolved in a solution separating from reactive PTK polymers. For example, PTK polymers may be first mixed with a solution of a catalyst and water, followed by addition of polyisocynates. The polyisocyanates described herein include various NCO-terminated compounds.","In some embodiments, additional components or components to be delivered may be combined with a reactive liquid prior to injection. In some embodiments, they may be combined with one of precursors (i.e., polyisocyanate and PTK polymers) prior to mixing the precursors in forming of a reactive liquid\/paste.","Porous scaffolds can be prepared by incorporating a small amount (e.g., <5 wt %) of water which reacts with prepolymers to form carbon dioxide, a biocompativle blowing agent. Resulting reactive liquid\/paste may be injectable through a 12-ga syringe needle or the like into molds or targeted site to set in situ. In some embodiments, gel time is great than 3 min, 4 min, 5 min, 6 min, 7 min, or 8 min. In some embodiments, cure time is less than 20 min, 18 min, 16 min, 14 min, 12 min, or 10 min.","In some embodiments, catalysts can be used to assist forming porous composites. In general, the more blowing catalyst used, the high porosity of inventive composites may be achieved","The precursors may be combined by any method known to those skilled in the art. For example, a homogenous mixture of precursors (e.g., PTK polymer, polyisocyanate, etc.) and particles may be pressed together at ambient or elevated temperatures. At elevated temperatures, a process may also be accomplished without pressure. In some embodiments, precursors are not held at a temperature of greater than approximately 60\u00b0 C. for a significant time during mixing to prevent thermal damage to any biological component (e.g., growth factors or cells) of a scaffold. In some embodiments, temperature is not a concern because precursors used in the present invention have a low reaction exotherm.","Alternatively or in addition, components may be mixed or folded into a scaffold softened by heat or a solvent. Alternatively, a moldable scaffold may be formed into a sheet that is then covered with a layer of components to be delivered and or carried in the scaffold. Such components may then be forced into the scaffold sheet using pressure. In another embodiment, components are individually coated with scaffolds or scaffold precursors, for example, using a tumbler, spray coater, or a fluidized bed, before being mixed with a larger quantity of polymer. This facilitates even coating of the particles and improves integration of the particles and polymer component of the scaffold.","Polymers (e.g., polyisocyanate, PTK polymers, combinations thereof) may be further modified by further cross-linking or polymerization to form a scaffold in which the polymer is covalently linked to the incorporated components.","In some embodiments, an inventive scaffold is produced with an injectable composition and then set in situ. For example, cross-link density of a low molecular weight polymer may be increased by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation (e.g., UV light) or an alternative energy source. Alternatively or additionally, a photoactive cross-linking agent, chemical cross-linking agent, additional monomer, or combinations thereof may be mixed into inventive composites. Exposure to UV light after a composition is injected into an implant site will increase one or both of molecular weight and cross-link density, stiffening polymers (i.e., polyurethanes) and thereby a composite. Polymer components of inventive scaffold used in the present invention may be softened by a solvent, e.g., ethanol.","In some embodiments, it may be desirable to infiltrate a polymer or polymer precursor into vascular and\/or interstitial structure of bone particles or into bone-derived tissues. Vascular structure of bone includes such structures such as osteocyte lacunae, Haversian canals, Volksmann's canals, canaliculi and similar structures. Interstitial structure of bone particles includes spaces between trabeculae and similar features. Many of monomers and precursors (e.g., polyisocyanate, PTK polymers and subunits thereof) suggested for use with the invention are sufficiently flowable to penetrate through the channels and pores of trabecular bone. Some may even penetrate into trabeculae or into mineralized fibrils of cortical bone. Thus, it may be necessary to incubate bone particles in precursors for a period of time to accomplish infiltration. In certain embodiments, the scaffold as a reactive mixture is itself sufficiently flowable that it can penetrate channels and pores of bone. In certain embodiments, scaffolds may also be heated or combined with a solvent to make it more flowable for this purpose. Other ceramic materials and\/or other bone-substitute materials employed as a particulate phase may also include porosity that can be infiltrated as described herein.","Inventive scaffolds of the present invention can exhibit high degrees of porosity over a wide range of effective pore sizes. Thus, scaffolds may have, at once, macroporosity, mesoporosity and microporosity. Macroporosity is characterized by pore diameters greater than about 100 microns. Mesoporosity is characterized by pore diameters between about 100 microns about 10 microns; and microporosity occurs when pores have diameters below about 10 microns. In some embodiments, the scaffold has a porosity of at least about 30%. For example, in certain embodiments, the scaffold has a porosity of more than about 50%, more than about 60%, more than about 70%, more than about 80%, or more than about 90%. In some embodiments, inventive scaffolds have a porosity in a range of about 10%-20%, 20%-30%, 30%-40%, 40%-50%, 50%-60%, 60%-70%, 70%-80%, 80%-90%, or 90%-99%. Advantages of a porous scaffold over non-porous scaffold include, but are not limited to, more extensive cellular and tissue in-growth into the composite, more continuous supply of nutrients, more thorough infiltration of therapeutics, and enhanced revascularization, allowing tissue growth and repair to take place more efficiently. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the porosity of the scaffold may be used to load the scaffold with biologically active agents such as drugs, small molecules, cells, cells that are encapsulated in, for example, gel beads, peptides, polynucleotides, growth factors, osteogenic factors, etc, for delivery at the implant site. Porosity may also render certain composites of the present invention compressible.","In some embodiments, pores of inventive scaffolds may be over 100 microns wide for the invasion of cells and bony in-growth (Klaitwatter et al., 2:161, 1971; which is incorporated herein by reference). In certain embodiments, the pore size may be in a ranges of approximately 50 microns to approximately 750 microns, for example, of approximately 100 microns to approximately 500 microns.","After implantation, inventive composites are allowed to remain at the site and can provide the strength desired and promote healing of the tissue and\/or tissue growth. The scaffolds may be degraded or be resorbed as new tissue is formed at the implantation site. Polymer may be resorbed over approximately 1 week to approximately 1 years. Scaffolds may start to be remodeled in as little as a week as the composite is infiltrated with cells or new bone in-growth. A remodeling process may continue for weeks, months, or years. For example, scaffolds used in accordance with the present invention may be resorbed within about 4-8 weeks, 2-6 months, or 6-12 months. A degradation rate is defined as the mass loss as a function of time, and it can be measured by immersing the sample in phosphate buffered saline or medium and measuring the sample mass as a function of time.","One skilled in the art will recognize that standard experimental techniques may be used to test these properties for a range of compositions to optimize a composite for a desired application.","IV) Use and Application of Composite","As discussed above, polymers or polymer precursors, and other components may be supplied separately, e.g., in a kit, and mixed immediately prior to implantation, injection or molding. A surgeon or other health care professional may also combine components in a kit with autologous tissue derived during surgery or biopsy. For example, a surgeon may want to include autogenous tissue or cells, e.g., bone marrow or bone shavings generated while preparing a implant site, into a composite (see more details in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,291,345 and U.S. Ser. No. 11\/625,119 published under No. 2007-0191963; both of which are incorporated herein by reference).","In some embodiments a method for treating tissue in a subject in need thereof is provided. The method can comprise providing a biodegradable scaffold, including on that includes a polythioketal polymer and a polyisocyanate, and then contacting the tissue with the scaffold. In some embodiments the tissue is wound site. More specifically, in some embodiments the tissue can be bone, skin, or the like.","Scaffolds of the present invention may be used in a wide variety of clinical applications. A method of preparing and using scaffolds for orthopedic applications utilized may include the steps of providing a curable scaffolds composition (e.g., reactive mixture), mixing parts of a composition, and curing a composition in a tissue site wherein a composition is sufficiently flowable to permit injection by minimally invasive techniques. In some embodiments, a flowable composition to inject may be pressed by hand or machine. In some embodiments, a moldable composition may be pre-molded and implanted into a target site. Injectable or moldable compositions utilized in the present invention may be processed (e.g., mixed, pressed, molded, etc.) by hand or machine.","Inventive scaffolds and\/or compositions may be used as injectable materials with or without exhibiting high mechanical strength (i.e., load-bearing or non-load bearing, respectively). In some embodiments, inventive scaffolds and\/or compositions may be used as moldable materials. For example, compositions (e.g., PTK polymer, monomers, reactive liquids\/pastes, polymers, bone particles, additional components, etc.) in the present invention can be pre-molded into pre-determined shapes. Upon implantation, the pre-molded composite may further cure in situ and provide mechanical strength (i.e., load-bearing). A few examples of potential applications are discussed in more detail below.","In some embodiments, compositions and\/or scaffolds may be used as a bone void filler. Bone fractures and defects, which result from trauma, injury, infection, malignancy or developmental malformation can be difficult to heal in certain circumstances. If a defect or gap is larger than a certain critical size, natural bone is unable to bridge or fill the defect or gap. These are several deficiencies that may be associated with the presence of a void in a bone. Bone void may compromise mechanical integrity of bone, making bone potentially susceptible to fracture until void becomes ingrown with native bone. Accordingly, it is of interest to fill such voids with a substance which helps voids to eventually fill with naturally grown bone. Open fractures and defects in practically any bone may be filled with composites according to various embodiments without the need for periosteal flap or other material for retaining a composite in fracture or defect. Even where a composite is not required to bear weight, physiological forces will tend to encourage remodeling of a composite to a shape reminiscent of original tissues.","Many orthopedic, periodontal, neurosurgical, oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures require drilling or cutting into bone in order to harvest autologous implants used in procedures or to create openings for the insertion of implants. In either case voids are created in bones. In addition to all the deficiencies associated with bone void mentioned above, surgically created bone voids may provide an opportunity for incubation and proliferation of any infective agents that are introduced during a surgical procedure. Another common side effect of any surgery is ecchymosis in surrounding tissues which results from bleeding of the traumatized tissues. Finally, surgical trauma to bone and surrounding tissues is known to be a significant source of post-operative pain and inflammation. Surgical bone voids are sometimes filled by the surgeon with autologous bone chips that are generated during trimming of bony ends of a graft to accommodate graft placement, thus accelerating healing. However, the volume of these chips is typically not sufficient to completely fill the void. Scaffolds and\/or compositions of the present invention, for example scaffolds comprising anti-infective and\/or anti-inflammatory agents, may be used to fill surgically created bone voids.","Similarly, the present scaffolds can be useful for treating skin tissue. Skin tissue that is damaged, injured, or the like can be difficult to heal, particularly if the damage or injury covers a wide area. The present scaffolds can serve to replace or supplement the need to add other tissue grafts (e.g., autolougous tissue) to help treat such tissue. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill upon reviewing the present paper, the present scaffolds can be utilized to treat a variety of tissue types, conditions, injuries, and the like.","Inventive scaffolds may be administered to a subject in need thereof using any technique known in the art. A subject is typically a patient with a disorder or disease related to bone. In certain embodiments, a subject has a bony defect such as a fracture. Any bone disease or disorder may be treated using inventive composites\/compositions including genetic diseases, congenital abnormalities, fractures, iatrogenic defects, bone cancer, bone metastases, inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, and degenerative bone disease (e.g., osteoarthritis). In certain embodiments, inventive osteoimplant composites are formulated for repair of a simple fracture, compound fracture, or non-union; as an external fixation device or internal fixation device; for joint reconstruction, arthrodesis, arthroplasty, or cup arthroplasty of hips; for femoral or humeral head replacement; for femoral head surface replacement or total joint replacement; for repair of vertebral column, spinal fusion or internal vertebral fixation; for tumor surgery; for deficit filling; for discectomy; for laminectomy; for excision of spinal tumors; for an anterior cervical or thoracic operation; for the repairs of a spinal injury; for scoliosis, for lordosis or kyphosis treatment; for intermaxillary fixation of a fracture; for mentoplasty; for temporomandibular joint replacement; for alveolar ridge augmentation and reconstruction; as an inlay osteoimplant; for implant placement and revision; for sinus lift; for a cosmetic procedure; and, for the repair or replacement of the ethmoid, frontal, nasal, occipital, parietal, temporal, mandible, maxilla, zygomatic, cervical vertebra, thoracic vertebra, lumbar vertebra, sacrum, rib, sternum, clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius, ulna, carpal bones, metacarpal bones, phalanges, ilium, ischium, pubis, femur, tibia, fibula, patella, calcaneus, tarsal bones, or metatarsal bones, and for repair of bone surrounding cysts and tumors.","Scaffolds and\/or compositions of the present invention can be used as bone void fillers either alone or in combination with one or more other conventional devices, for example, to fill the space between a device and bone. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, bone fixation plates (e.g., cranofacial, maxillofacial, orthopedic, skeletal, and the like); screws, tacks, clips, staples, nails, pins or rods, anchors (e.g., for suture, bone, and the like), scaffolds, scents, meshes (e.g., rigid, expandable, woven, knitted, weaved, etc), sponges, implants for cell encapsulation or tissue engineering, drug delivery (e.g., carriers, bone ingrowth induction catalysts such as bone morphogenic proteins, growth factors (e.g., PDGF, VEGF and BMP-2), peptides, antivirals, antibiotics, etc), monofilament or multifilament structures, sheets, coatings, membranes (e.g. porous, microporous, resorbable, etc), foams (e.g., open cell or close cell), screw augmentation, cranial, reconstruction, and\/or combinations thereof.","In some embodiments porous scaffolds are synthesized and used by a one-shot foaming process, allowing for time to manipulate and inject the polymer, followed by rapid foaming and setting. Injectable embodiments can be advantageous because they can offer minimally invasive surgical techniques and\/or increase the capacity for customization of a scaffold at the point of care. Certain embodiments can be customized to an individual patient and type of injury.","The presently-disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples. Some examples are prophetic. Some examples may include compilations of data that are representative of data gathered at various times during the course of development and experimentation related to the presently-disclosed subject matter.","This Example describes the synthesis and characterization of embodiments of the present PTK-UR scaffolds. All data is reported as the mean and standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc comparison tests, with p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.","PTK Polymer Synthesis and Characterization","All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis., USA) except the following. 2-mercaptoethyl ether (MEE), glutaraldehyde, and cobalt chloride were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.), and the tertiary amine catalyst (TEGOAMIN33) was obtained from Goldschmidt (Hopewell, Va.). Glycolide and D,L-lactide were obtained from Polysciences (Warrington, Pa.). Coscat83, an organobismuth urethane catalyst, was supplied by ChasChem, Inc. (Rutherford, N.J.). Hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDIt, Desmodur N3300A) was received from Bayer Material Science (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Cell culture reagents, including Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin\/streptomycin were supplied by Gibco Cell Culture (Carlsbad, Calif.). All materials were used as received unless otherwise indicated.","A condensation polymerization protocol was utilized to synthesize the PTK prepolymer (Scheme 1). Briefly, p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate (PTSA) was added to a tri-necked boiling flask equipped with an attached addition funnel. The vessels were placed under vacuum for 15 minutes before being purged with nitrogen. The boiling flask was charged with anhydrous acetonitrile and batch-specific amounts of 2-mercaptoethyl ether (MEE) (x molar eq) and 1,4 butanedithiol (BDT) (1-x molar eq) where x=1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 for the different synthesized PTKs. The addition funnel was also charged with anhydrous acetonitrile and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP) (0.83 molar eq). Both the addition funnel and boiling flask's solutions were purged with flowing nitrogen for 30 min before submerging the boiling flask into an oil bath at 80\u00b0 C. After 15 min of temperature equilibration, the addition funnel stopcock was set so that the acetonitrile-DMP solution was added drop-wise into the continuously stirring boiling flask over a period of 16 h. Post synthesis, the acetonitrile was removed by rotary evaporation and the resultant PTKs were isolated by precipitation into cold ethanol and dried under vacuum. The five synthesized copolymers with varying percent molar composition of MEE and BDT are each designated by its relative mol % MEE.","To evaluate polymer compositions, samples of the respective PTKs were dissolved in deuterated chloroform (CDCl) and analyzed with H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker 400 MHz Spectrometer). H NMR chemical shifts were reported as \u03b4 values in ppm relative to the deuterated CDCl(\u03b47.26). Multiplicities are reported as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), and m (multiplet). The number of protons (n) for a given resonance is indicated as nH and is based on integration values.

Briefly, PTK dithiol polymers were transferred to a boiling flask, placed under vacuum, and then exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask was charged with dichloromethane (DCM) before adding a 10\u00d7 molar excess of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to the solution. This solution was stirred continuously at room temperature to reduce any disulfide bonds and recover the reactive thiol end groups. After 3 h of stirring, the DCM was evaporated off under vacuum before restoring nitrogen to the vessel, and the residue was washed three times in cold ethanol to remove residual (3-mercaptoethanol. The reduced PTK polymers were dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) before adding a 10\u00d7 molar excess of cesium carbonate (CsCO) under nitrogen and stirring for 30 min at room temperature. A 5\u00d7 molar excess of 2-bromoethanol was next added to the solution and stirred for 18 hours under nitrogen at room temperature. After mixing, the solution was added to a separation funnel with an excess of deionized water to effectively separate the PTK-solubilizing THF layer from the water-soluble CsCOcatalyst. The hydroxyl-functionalized PTKs were extracted in THF before removing the solvent by rotary evaporation and the polymer residues were precipitated three times in cold ethanol before vacuum drying for 24 h.","Hydroxyl-functionalization was first confirmed by H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl): \u03b4 2.74 (t, 4H). Molecular weights and polydispersities of the five synthesized PTK diols were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Agilent Technologies, Dover, Del.) using a mobile phase of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with 100 mM LiBr and were quantified using a calibration curve generated from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) standards (400-4000 g mol). PTK chain end-conversions from homobifunctional thiol groups to hydroxyl groups was confirmed with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR; Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR, Billerica, Mass.). Thiol-terminated and hydroxyl-terminated PTK polymers were placed in contact with a ZnSe ATR crystal to quantify absorbance at 2550 cmand 3400 cm, which correspond to absorbance peaks of free thiol and free hydroxyl groups, respectively. The hydroxyl (OH) numbers of the different PTK diols were determined by titration (Metrohm 798 MPT Titrino) according to ASTM E1899-08. Eq (1) was used to relate the molecular weight to the hydroxyl number of each titrated PTK:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0184"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["M","n"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"56100","mo":"\u2062","mi":"f"},{"mi":["OH","number"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"n "},"The thiol absorbance peak at 2550 cmwas apparent in the thiol-terminated, parent PTKs but did not appear with the hydroxyl-terminated polymers, which generated a characteristic ATR-FTIR hydroxyl peak at 3400 cm().

The experimental OH numbers trended higher than theoretical values.","PTK-UR Scaffold Formation","PTK-UR scaffolds were successfully synthesized from the PTK diols and hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDIt), yielding porous, mechanically robust 3D constructs as shown in . Specifically, the PTK-UR and PEUR (control) scaffolds were prepared using two-component reactive liquid molding of: (a) hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDIt), and (b) a hardener component comprising the PTK diol, 0.5-1.5 parts per hundred parts polyol (pphp) water, 10.0 pphp TEGOAMIN33 catalyst, 0.5-3.0 pphp sulfated castor oil stabilizer, and 4.0 pphp calcium stearate pore opener. The makeup of the hardener components for the different respective PTK diols was individually optimized to yield scaffolds with mechanical integrity and an intact porous structure. The hardener component elements were first mixed for 30 s at 3300 revolutions per min (rpm) in a Hauschild DAC 150 FVZ-K SpeedMixer (FlackTek, Inc., Landrum, S.C.) before adding the HDIt and mixing for an additional 30 s. This reactive liquid mixture was allowed to rise freely for 10-20 min for complete setting and hardening. The targeted index (ratio of NCO to OH equivalents times 100) was 115, where the number of OH equivalents is calculated from the respective PTK's experimentally measured OH Number.","The PEUR scaffolds were formulated from a commercially available 900 g molpolyester triol, a synthesized 1000 g molpolyester diol, and a synthesized 1500 g molpolyester triol to serve as hydrolytically-degradable controls. These scaffolds are designated 900t-PEUR, 1000d-PEUR, and 1500t-PEUR, respectively. The commercially available 900t-PEUR represents a biological control that has been successfully used for in vivo applications, while the 1000d-PEUR and 1500t-PEUR were synthesized for a more direct material comparison to the PTK-URs because they yield PEUR scaffolds with similar crosslink densities to the PTK-UR scaffolds. To synthesize the trifunctional polyol, glycerol was vacuum dried for 48 hours at 80\u00b0 C. and then added to a 100 mL three neck flask. \u03b5-caprolactone, glycolide and D,L-lactide were added to the glycerol starter along with a stannous octoate catalyst. To obtain the bifunctional polyol, vacuum dried 1,4 butane diol was utilized as the starter.","Physical Properties","The core densities of PTK-UR and PEUR scaffolds were determined by measuring the mass and volume of cylindrical porous scaffold core samples, with the core porosities being subsequently calculated from these density values. The porous morphologies of the different PTK-UR scaffolds were qualitatively assessed by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4200 SEM, Finchampstead, UK). The amount of unreacted components (sol fraction) in the cross-linked network was measured from the mass loss of dried scaffold cylinders (25 mm\u00d712 mm) previously incubated in DCM for 24 h. To measure the molecular weight between crosslinks (M), scaffold samples (n=3) were weighed dry and then incubated in DCM for 24 h. After incubation, samples were gently blotted to remove excess DCM and then the samples' swollen mass was measured. These values, along with the solvent parameters, were used in the Flory-Rhener equation to determine M. For measuring scaffold hydrophilicity, PTK-UR films of 100%, 50%, and 0% MEE-PTK diols were synthesized using an index of 105 and the gelling catalyst Coscat83 at 1000 ppm. After mixing the catalyst and PTK diol for 30 s at 3300 rpm, HDIt was added and mixed for an additional 30 s. The mixtures were cast into Teflon compression molds and allowed to cure for 18 h at 60\u00b0 C. The contact angle of water on these PTK-UR films was measured using a Rame-Hart (Mountain Lakes, N.J.) Model A-100 contact angle goniometer. A 4 \u03bcL water drop was added to the film surface, and the contact angle was immediately measured. After 10 min, an equilibrium contact angle was also measured due to the molecular surface reorganization which increased the hydrophilicity at the contact site.","The PTK-UR and PEUR formulations yield scaffolds with similar sol fraction and porosity, as seen in Error! Reference source not found. The molecular weight between crosslinks (M) for 1000d- and 1500t-PEUR was statistically equal to all of the PTK-UR scaffolds, while the 900t-PEURs had a significantly lower M(p<0.05) relative to all other formulations except for the 100% and 0% MEE-PTK-UR materials (Error! Reference source not found.). The relatively low sol fraction values indicate that the isocyanates and diols are well matched for scaffold formation, while the \u02dc90% porosity verifies that the PTK scaffolds are similar in structure to PEURs and possess an appropriate level of porosity for promoting cellular in-growth, nutrient exchange, and neo-vascularization in tissue engineering applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0192"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Physical properties of PTK-UR and PEUR scaffolds."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Core",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Sol Fraction","Porosity","M"]},{"entry":[{},"Scaffold","(%)","(vol. %)","(kg mol)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"100% MEE","6.9% \u00b1 1.6%","90.9% \u00b1 0.4%","7.6 \u00b1 4.2"]},{"entry":[{},"PTK-UR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"75% MEE","8.4% \u00b1 1.4%","89.0% \u00b1 1.2%","10.1 \u00b1 4.9\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"PTK-UR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"50% MEE","9.7% \u00b1 6.1%","86.9% \u00b1 1.4%","13.8 \u00b1 6.5\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"PTK-UR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"25% MEE","9.1% \u00b1 2.7%","90.6% \u00b1 2.7%","9.0 \u00b1 5.0"]},{"entry":[{},"PTK-UR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"0% MEE","8.3% \u00b1 3.2%","88.8% \u00b1 1.4%","9.0 \u00b1 5.8"]},{"entry":[{},"PTK-UR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"900t","4.1% \u00b1 1.6%","89.8% \u00b1 1.2%","2.5 \u00b1 1.6"]},{"entry":[{},"PEUR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"1500t","4.7% \u00b1 0.1%","91.3% \u00b1 0.2%","13.2 \u00b1 5.4\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"PEUR",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"1000d","7.7% \u00b1 0.1%","92.7% \u00b1 0.7%","7.7 \u00b1 2.8"]},{"entry":[{},"PEUR"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The relative surface hydrophilicity of the 100%, 50%, and 0% MEE-PTK-UR materials was assessed using contact angle measurements on PTK-UR films.

Cylindrical 6\u00d76 mm scaffold samples were tested after incubation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 7 days at 37\u00b0 C. (wet conditions). Using a preload force of 0.1 N, samples were compressed along the longitudinal axis at a strain rate of 10%\/min until 60% compressive strain was achieved. The Young's modulus for each sample was calculated from the slope of the initial linear region of each respective stress-strain curve after toe-in.","The wet compressive moduli of the PTK-UR samples ranged from 100-250 kPa, and the PEUR moduli ranged from 20-100 kPa (). Although the 1500t-PEUR, 1000d-PEUR, and PTK-UR scaffolds had similar Mvalues, all of the PTK-UR formulations had significantly higher modulus values than the 1500t-PEUR and 1000d-PEUR materials. However, there was no consistent trend between PTK-UR scaffold composition and modulus. Due to its higher crosslink density, the 900t-PEUR achieved stiffness values closer to the PTK-UR samples, though even this formulation was significantly less stiff than the 100% and 0% MEE-PTK-UR materials. Because of the more closely matched mechanical properties and the established precedent for their use, the 900t-PEUR scaffolds were used as a control for comparison to PTK-UR scaffolds in subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies.","In Vitro Degradation Under Aqueous and Oxidative Conditions","Long-term hydrolytic stability of PTK-UR and PEUR scaffolds was determined by incubating\u02dc10 mg samples in PBS at 37\u00b0 C. on a shaker and measuring the mass loss at each time point (n=3). Before beginning the experiment, scaffolds were soaked in an excess of DCM for 24 h to remove any unreacted components before vacuum drying for 24 h. Scaffold samples were removed from the buffer at each time point, rinsed in deionized water, vacuum dried for 48 h, and weighed. The buffer medium was not changed between time points. Short term oxidative degradation rates of PTK-UR scaffolds were similarly assessed using an oxidative degradation medium that simulates in vivo oxidative degradation at an accelerated rate. This oxidative medium comprised 20 wt % hydrogen peroxide (HO) in 0.1 M cobalt chloride (CoCl), with the HOand cobalt ion reacting to stimulate oxidative radical formation. As with the long-term study, triplicate samples were pre-soaked in DCM for 24 h before vacuum drying and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in the oxidative medium on a shaker. At specified time points over 10 d, samples were removed, rinsed with deionized water, vacuum dried, and weighed. The oxidative medium was replaced every 3 days, and the morphology of both PBS-incubated and HO-incubated scaffolds was qualitatively assessed with SEM.","The effect of radical concentration on PTK-UR scaffold degradation kinetics was also explored. The original 20% HOin 0.1 M CoCldegradation medium was diluted ten and one-hundred fold to yield a 2% HOin 0.01 M CoClsolution and a 0.2% HOin 0.001 M CoClsolution. These two diluted degradation media were used to incubate 100%, 50%, and 0% MEE-PTK-UR scaffolds along with 900t-PEUR control samples, with material preparation steps and incubation conditions being the same as previously described.","The oxidative degradation medium comprising HOand CoCl, which produces hydroxyl radicals, destabilize the TK bond, leading to chain scission and breakdown into the original constitutive monomers (MEE and BDT) and acetone. The hypothesized degradation mechanism is seen in Scheme 2, and it is predicted that these small byproducts will be rapidly cleared in an in vivo environment. Furthermore, these thiolated monomers have been shown to cause limited in vitro cytotoxicity and a minimal host inflammatory response in vivo when incorporated into a similar polyurethane system. The isocyanate HDIt was utilized in these studies because it is stable, allowing more specific study of the degradation behavior of the polyol component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0205"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"123.70mm","wi":"123.27mm","file":"US09463261-20161011-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The PTK-UR scaffolds were stable over a long-term, 25-week study in PBS at 37\u00b0 C., while the 900t-PEUR scaffolds underwent significant hydrolytic degradation over this time period (). Conversely, the PTK-URs rapidly degraded under accelerated oxidative conditions (20% HOin 0.1 M CoCl) as seen in . Furthermore, there was a relationship between the PTK composition and degradation rate, as the scaffolds with higher MEE content in the PTK polyol degraded faster (). Ethers are stable in aqueous media but that oxidative radicals can degrade them in vitro and in vivo. Thus, without being bound by theory or mechanism, it is hypothesized that the faster ROS-dependent degradation seen in both the 100% and 50% MEE-PTK-UR materials may result from a combination of oxidative degradation of both TKs and ethers, while the 0% MEE-PTK-UR scaffolds are degraded solely by TK scission. These results indicate that scaffold degradation rates can be tuned by the composition of the PTK polyol. The degradation profiles of all PTK-UR formulations in the 20% HOmedia are seen in . SEM images of PTK-UR scaffolds after 10 days of incubation in oxidative media illustrated loss of the porous architecture and surface pitting (), while these morphological changes in scaffold architecture were not apparent following PTK-UR scaffold incubation in PBS for 14 days ().","Mathematical Model of ROS-Dependent PTK-UR Scaffold Degradation","To further elucidate the relationship between ROS concentration and the degradation rates of the different PTK-UR scaffold formulations, scaffold degradation was measured in oxidative degradation media comprising 20%, 2%, and 0.2% HOcontaining 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 M CoCl, respectively. The degradation rates of selected PTK-UR scaffold formulations tested were dependent on the concentration of HO(). The degradation behavior of the PTK-UR scaffold formulations were fit to first-order decay kinetics equation to create a mathematical model of scaffold degradation with respect to HOconcentration. The first-order degradation model is given in Eq 2.\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In this equation, Mis the scaffold mass remaining at time t, Mis the initial scaffold mass, and k is the degradation rate constant. Non-linear regression was used to fit this modified first order degradation model to the experimentally determined degradation data. This method was used to determine the rate constant k for each scaffold's decay profile in the respective HOoxidative medium. The fitted degradation profiles are concurrently shown with the respective experimental data as dotted lines in . Agreement between the model and experimental data confirm that the PTK-UR scaffolds degrade by first-order kinetics with respect to ROS concentration. The degradation rate constants derived from the non-linear regression fitting of the experimental data gathered in 20% HOmedia () also illustrate the relationship between degradation rate and the % MEE-PTK polyol used in PTK-UR scaffold fabrication. This trend is also seen in the PTK-UR samples incubated in 2% HOmedia, though to a lesser magnitude. The degradation rate constants were significantly higher for all PTK-UR scaffolds than PEUR scaffolds in the 0.2% HOmedia, but there was no trend between the different PTK-UR scaffolds at this dose. Contrary to the PTK-UR scaffolds, the 900t-PEUR samples incubated in these same oxidative media did not display HOdose-dependent degradation (). These collective data confirm that thioketal-based polyols are selectively broken down by ROS and that their rate of degradation is first order with respect to the concentration of radical species in the local environment.","Cell-Mediated PTK-UR Degradation In Vitro","RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin until the cell population reached confluence. 100% and 0% MEE-PTK-UR scaffolds were cut into 6.5\u00d71-mm discs, sterilized by UV-radiation for 1 h (30 min per side), placed into 96-well plates, and incubated with culture medium for 30 min. Macrophages were seeded onto the scaffolds at a density of 2.5\u00d710cells\/scaffold. The cells were allowed to adhere to the scaffolds for 3 h, at which point the old media were removed and the cells were treated with either fresh culture media or media containing 5 mg mLlipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 1000 U mLIFN-\u03b3 to promote classical macrophage activation and enhanced ROS productions. Cells were incubated on the scaffolds for 3 d with fresh culture media being applied daily. After the 3 d incubation, the scaffolds were fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h followed by 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. These fixed scaffolds were dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol before being vacuum dried and imaged with SEM to evaluate surface pitting. SEM imaging of scaffolds after three days illustrated surface pitting by activated macrophages, while cell-mediated remodeling of the scaffold surface was less apparent for the control cells (), indicating that physiologic concentrations of ROS can degrade PTK-UR materials.","Biocompatibility of PTK-UR Scaffolds In Vitro and In Vivo","NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter gene were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin until the cell population reached confluence. 100% MEE-PTK-UR, 0% MEE-PTK-UR, and 900t-PEUR scaffolds were cut into 6.5\u00d71-mm discs, sterilized by UV-radiation for 1 h (30 min per side), placed into a black-walled 96-well plate, and incubated with culture medium for 30 min. Fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 5.0\u00d710cells\/scaffold on n=3 scaffolds and allowed to grow for 0, 1, and 3 days in 200 \u03bcL of culture media per well (changed every two days). On the final day of seeding, the day 0 cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h before culture media containing a luciferin substrate was added to all cell-seeded scaffolds. After 10 min, the scaffolds were imaged with an IVIS 100 (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.) luminescent imaging system with an exposure time of 2 min to quantify the luciferase-based luminescent cell signal from each scaffold. All readings were normalized to day 0 luminescent signal values. Stably transfected NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts remained viable on 100% MEE-PTK-UR, 0% MEE-PTK-UR, and 900t-PEUR scaffolds over 3 days of culture in vitro (), and none of the scaffold formulations displayed a significant difference in cell number over time or relative to each other. These data indicate that PTK-UR scaffolds achieved cellular viability levels analogous to PEUR scaffolds that are cytocompatible and have been successfully utilized in vivo.","Also, 100% MEE-PTK-UR and 900t-PEUR scaffolds were fabricated as previously described. 2.5\u00d710 mm discs were cut and sterilized with ethylene oxide prior to implantation into ventral subcutaneous sites in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Scaffolds were excised at day 21 to evaluate new tissue formation in the implants. The tissues were fixed in formalin for 48 h followed by incubation in 70% ethanol for 48 h, embedding in paraffin, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin & eosin. Histological sections were evaluated with Metamorph Imaging Software (Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale Calif.) to evaluate wound size and new tissue growth. All surgical procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The PTK-UR scaffolds supported robust cell infiltration and granulation tissue formation, while eliciting a minimal inflammatory response ().","Although all implanted scaffold samples were cut to the same thickness pre-implantation (2.5 mm), PTK-UR scaffolds extracted 21 days after subcutaneous implantation had better maintenance of their original thickness relative to the PEUR scaffolds, which suffered from partial collapse of the pore structure following implantation in vivo (). Though both formulations support new tissue growth into the scaffold interior, the PTK-UR samples were more mechanically resilient and more effectively stented the wound. This effect can be potentially attributed to both the significantly higher moduli of the 100% MEE-PTK-UR scaffolds relative to the 900t-PEUR formulation () and also to the 900t-PEUR Tvalue (34.4\u00b0 C.), which is close to body temperature (Table 3). This relatively high Tis predicted to make this PEUR scaffold less mechanically resilient at body temperature because it will be in its glassy transition viscoelastic region. The stenting effect seen in these PTK-UR scaffolds is advantageous for maximizing cell infiltration and new tissue formation and could potentially decrease scarring in clinical applications.","This Examples describes additional studied conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats using the scaffolds. described in Example 1. Unless stated otherwise, the materials and method described in Example 1 were implemented in this Example as well.","Briefly, pre-formed porous 100% and 0% MEE-PTK-UR scaffolds along with PEUR control scaffolds were implanted into ventral subcutaneous sites in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 7, 21, and 35 days. As shown in , the 100% MEE-PTK-UR and PEUR scaffolds demonstrated tissue in-growth into the scaffold interiors by day 21, and both the 100% MEE-PTK-UR and PEUR scaffolds significantly degraded over the 35 day time frame. However, the PTK-UR scaffold formulations appeared to be more resilient materials in vivo as the PEUR scaffolds were significantly compressed from their initial thickness. None of the tested scaffolds led to an excessive immune response.","To test the ability of the scaffolds to treat tissue wounds in diabetic subjects, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (45 mg\/kg) to induce diabetes. One week post injection, the rats' blood glucose was measured and compared to previously measured baseline glucose levels to confirm diabetes development. The 100% MEE-PTK-UR formulation was chosen as the exemplary PTK-UR for implantation. Therefore, the diabetic rats were implanted with 100% MEE-PTK-UR and PEUR scaffolds and sacrificed at days 7, 21, 35, and 49 post scaffold implantation.","As diabetic rodent models have been shown to produce higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), given the previous results, it was predicted that the PTK-UR scaffolds would degrade faster in the diabetic animals. Indeed, the PTK-UR scaffolds were significantly more degraded in the diabetic animals over all time points when compared to samples implanted in non-diabetic rats ().","Throughout this application, various publications are referenced.
