{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/423,947 filed Dec. 16, 2010 by Ravi Ravindran et al. and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus to Create and Manage Virtual Private Groups in a Content Oriented Network,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","In a content-oriented network (CON) or information-centric network (ICN), a content router is responsible for routing user requests and content to proper recipients. In the CON, a domain-wide unique name is assigned to each entity that is part of a content delivery framework. The entities may comprise data content, such as video clips or web pages, and\/or infrastructure elements, such as routers, switches, or servers. The content router uses name prefixes, which can be full content names or proper prefixes of content names instead of network addresses, to route content packets within the content network. In CONs, content delivery including publishing, requesting, managing (e.g., modification, deletion, etc.) may be based on content name and not content location. One aspect of CONs that may be different from traditional Internet Protocol (IP) networks is the ability of CONs to interconnect multiple geographical points and cache content temporarily or store content on a more persistent basis. This may allow content to be served from the network instead of an original server, and thus may substantially improve user experience. The caching\/storing may be used for real time data that is fetched by the user or for persistent data that belongs to the user or to a content provider, e.g., a third party provider.","In one embodiment, the disclosure includes a content router for managing content for virtual private groups in a content oriented network, the content router comprising storage configured to cache a content from a customer in a content oriented network (CON), and a transmitter coupled to the storage and configured to forward the content upon request, wherein the content is signed by the user, wherein the CON provides different security levels for different users in a plurality of users, and wherein the plurality of users correspond to a plurality of user classes.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a content oriented network (CON) system comprising a cache configured to receive a signed content from one of a plurality of Virtual Private Groups (VPGs), cache the signed content, and forward the cached signed content upon request, a first component coupled to the cache and configured to receive the signed content from a publisher and send the signed content to the cache, and a second content coupled to the cache and configured to receive the signed content from the cache and send the signed content to a subscriber that verifies the signed content, wherein the CON provides different security levels for different one of the plurality of VPGs.","In a third aspect, the disclosure includes a network apparatus implemented method comprising receiving at a receiver first content from a first publisher and second content from second publisher, wherein the first content has been signed using a signature of the first publisher, and wherein the second content has been signed using a signature of the second publisher, encrypting with a processor the first and second content, storing the first and second content in a content oriented network (CON), and enforcing a first security policy for the first content and enforcing a second security policy for the second content, wherein the first security policy is different from the second security policy.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","The caching\/storing feature of a CON may have several implications to the user in terms of management, performance, security, and reliability of handled data. The implications may depend on the service level agreements (SLAs) between the CON and the user. In some scenarios, the user may entrust the CON to manage all its data. In other scenarios, the CON may only provide a best effort service, such as giving priority to the preferred user, during the content dissemination process. There may be a need to provide differential treatment to users using a CON as different users may have different requirements, e.g., in terms of content dissemination requirements in terms performance, reliability and security.","Disclosed herein are systems and methods for serving different users or user groups that may have different preferences and requirements. A group of users (mostly affiliated to a common entity, may have grouped in an ad hoc manner) and that may have a common set of preferences in terms of the requirements for how its content is to be managed by the CON SP is referred to herein as a VPG (We use the term VPG as a more general term instead of VPN, as traditionally VPN has been used to indicate an Enterprise instance over a shared infrastructure. In our context VPG could be a VPN or any group of users\/entities trying to achieve a common objective). The group may be virtual in the sense that the members of the group may be geographically dispersed and logically overlaid over a CON infrastructure. The group may also be private in the sense that the CON may allow the group to preserve VPG attributes (in terms of content being disseminated) similar to the case if the content dissemination is managed by the VPG themselves. A VPG may be any set of users that are bound by common properties on aspects related to membership, resource (e.g., informational resource and network facility resource), performance, security, reliability, or combinations thereof. For example, a VPG may be an Enterprise, a content creator\/distributor (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, etc.), or an online retailer (Amazon, Walmart, etc.) with facilities that may be geographically distributed and whose SLA requirements may be stringent with respect to performance, security, and\/or reliability. Alternatively, the VPG may be a form of a social network (e.g., Facebook, Youtube, etc.), which may bind users by their common interests.","Based on the systems and methods, the CON may support security issues for VPG users, such as privacy and confidentiality of shared data and associated network resource. Additionally, each VPG may have corresponding application requirements, e.g., to improve content dissemination among the VPG's users. Such application layer support may be extended in the CON to each VPG. The CON may be based on a framework, e.g., a infrastructure, that allows VPGs of different requirements to coexist on the CON. The framework may allow the CON to formulate specific policies for each of the VPGs, offer customized treatment and realize the policies using building blocks to support VPGs in the CON. The framework may span various elements of the content plane and other planes in the CON to allow VPG creation and operation, as described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","112","110","112"]},"The customer nodes\/sites  may be nodes, devices, or components configured to deliver content to and receive content requests from the users or user applications. For instance, the customer nodes may be fixed or mobile user-oriented devices, such as desktop computers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or cellular telephones. Alternatively, the customer nodes may be connectivity devices at customer premises, such as modems or set-top boxes. The customer nodes may also comprise customer equipment (not shown) that may be configured to receive content from the CON , e.g., via access networks, and distribute the content to a plurality of customers . For instance, the customer nodes may comprise optical network terminals (ONUs) and\/or very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) transceiver units at residential locations (VTU-Rs). The access networks may be any networks that provide access to the content in the CON , such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).","The CON  may provide a plurality of services to the customer nodes\/sites , including content publishing\/subscribing or requesting, content cashing\/storing, customer mobility support, security, and\/or other content oriented services. The CON  may also be referred to herein as an Information Centric Network (ICN). The CON  may comprise a plurality of network nodes , which may be coupled to each other via network links, e.g., fixed connections. The network nodes  may be any nodes, devices, or components that support transportation of traffic, e.g., frames and\/or packets, through the CON . The network nodes  may pass the traffic onto or receive the traffic from other nodes in the CON . The network nodes  may comprise a plurality of content servers that store or cache content, which may be provided to users or subscribers, e.g., upon demand. For example, the network nodes  may be routers, switches, or bridges, such as backbone core bridges (BCBs), provider core bridges (PCBs), or label switch routers (LSRs).","Additionally, the network nodes  may comprise content routers that forward content based on content name prefixes. The content routers may be configured to route, cache, and\/or store content. Some of the content routers, e.g., edge nodes, may be coupled to the customer nodes\/sites , e.g., via a plurality of access networks, wired links, or wireless links. The content routers may be edge nodes and possibly core nodes in the CON  that forward content traffic to the customer nodes\/sites  based on a customer request or demand. The content routers may also receive content requests from the customer nodes\/sites . For example, the content routers are enhanced versions of traditional routers or bridges, such as backbone edge bridges (BEBs), provider edge bridges (PEBs), or label edge routers (LERs) that forward content based on content name prefixes, from a transport perspective the roles of these nodes could be the same (even for backward compatibility), but more importantly they are enabled for content distribution through features like dynamic\/persistent caching, and application level assistance. These content routers could also be fully functional CCN routers or content routers based on other proposals, in which case the goal of content dissemination is ingrained in the transportation layer. The network could be a combination of these pure content routers, traditional router\/switches or a combination thereof considering the case of deployment of these futuristic technologies.","In the CON architecture , the CON  may have a CON plane infrastructure  that handles providing different services to the customer nodes\/sites . The CON plane infrastructure  comprise a plurality of operation planes that support the different services for the customer nodes\/sites . For instance, the CON plane infrastructure  comprise a management plane, a storage and computing plane, a control plane, a content plane (also referred to as content data plane), a transport plane. The different planes may handle different aspects of the CON operations and resources related to content, services, and customer nodes\/sites , such as management, storage, control, and transport. Typically, each of the planes may treat the customer nodes\/sites  and their corresponding content and support the services for the different customer nodes\/sites , e.g., in terms of performance, security, and reliability, substantially in a similar or flat manner. However, the customer nodes\/sites  may belong to different groups, e.g., different VPGs, which may have different requirements (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) requirements), SLAs, and\/or other policies. Typically, the flat plane behavior of the planes in the CON plane infrastructure  does not consider the different requirements of the VPGs, which may cause reduced network efficiency and waste of network resources. For example, disseminating content for different VPGs that have different SLAs in a similar manner may prevent effective load balancing in the CON .","In an embodiment, the CON  may be an ICN, where the cached content may have one or more owners that may be associated with one or more customer nodes\/sites . The owners may rely on the ICN service provider (SP) to deliver the content to authorized users (e.g., also associated with customer nodes\/sites ). Thus, the ICN may be configured to provide the different content of the different owners to their corresponding users based on different requirements associated with the different owners. The requirements may be related to performance (e.g., storage, computing, and\/or bandwidth), availability, reliability, security, or combinations thereof. Specifically, the users of the different owned content and owners may be separated into a plurality of VPGs. As such, the different planes in the CON plane infrastructure  may be virtualized, e.g., configured or provisioned, to handle and service a plurality of VPG instances that correspond to the VPGs, as described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","200"]},"The operation planes in the CON plane infrastructure  may comprise a VPG content plane , a VPG control plane , a VPG storage and computing plane  (also referred to as resource management plane), a VPG transport plane , and a VPG management plane  for supporting the different VPG instances and public access based on their corresponding policies. The VPG content plane  may be configured to support the different security SLAs of the VPG instances and public access and handle policy enforcement. The VPG control plane  may be configured to handle routing and resolution for the different VPG instances and public access. The VPG storage and computing plane  may be configured to handle storage and computing for the different VPG instances and public access. The VPG transport plane  may be configured to handle data forwarding and resource management for the different VPG instances and public access. The VPG management plane  may allow interaction between the different VPG users  and the different planes of the CON plane infrastructure , e.g., via VPG service application programming interfaces (APIs) . The VPG service APIs may be configured to support ICN service primitives and\/or application customizations for the different VPG instances. The service APIs may comprise different information, including type, a VPG, user, and\/or service identifier (VPG-ID), security information, content, action information, and\/or other information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","200","300","300","300","330","340","340"]},"The VPG state  may be implemented at a plurality of operation planes, including a management plane, a content plane, a control plane, and a transport plane. For instance, the VPG state  may implement at a VPG content plane  a plurality of functions for handling content routing. The content plane functions may be implemented using a VPG application processing logic  that may process the content and a VPG forwarding decision  that may decide proper routing based on content information. The VPG state  may also implement at a VPG control plane  a plurality of functions for supporting content routing. The control plane functions may be implemented using a VPG content routing protocol , a VPG service\/management API , a VPG resolution protocol , and\/or a VPG signaling protocol . Additionally, the VPG state  may implement at a VPG transport plane a plurality of functions for forwarding the content in the CON. The transport plane functions may be implemented using virtualized forwarding , e.g., established for the VPG instance, based on corresponding virtualized transport resources  (e.g., QOS resources) for the VPG instance.","A plurality of VPG states  at one or more content routers may enable a content router and the CON to provide private treatment for data or content, e.g., for a plurality of VPGs (e.g., content owners), in a public or shared CON infrastructure. This may also enable the VPGs to negotiate different SLAs with a CON or an ICN SP to meet the VPGs' requirements. Thus, the ICN SP may use its resources more effectively, for instance by multiplexing resources among multiple VPGs. The ICN SP may also handle a plurality of users with different requirements by prioritizing failure reactions, such as service restoration in case of failures, based on customer priority.","The VPG SLA requirements may comprise security requirements, accessibility requirements, availability requirements, reliability requirements, QoS requirements, application customization requirements, or combinations thereof. The security requirements may comprise aspects related to authentication\/authorization, user privacy, confidentiality, data Integrity, trust management, or combinations thereof. The security requirements may be classified into two security levels, a VPG security level and a VPG member security level. At the VPG security level, the VPG may require a level or amount of security assurance on a plurality of interactions and on VPG content that may be stored in the CON.","The CON may also use a group level security paradigm to implement VPG level security policies across multiple or all members of the CON. At the VPG member security level, the CON may or may not be involved. If the CON is involved, then the CON may enforce finer grained security policy control features in comparison to the VPG level, e.g., as required by the VPG for its members. The CON may also allow the members to define their own security policy in the context of the VPG. A plurality of per-user security level functions may be used and handled exclusively by the VPG customer itself, in which case the CON may not be involved in any security related tasks. Alternatively, the CON may take over the responsibility of delivering all the security related assurances to the members of a VPG. See, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/226,605, filed Sep. 7, 2011 and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus to Create and Manage a Differentiated Security Framework for Content Oriented Networks.\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference. The ideas presented in this patent application could be a type of service a CON provider may provide as a choice to the VPG. In another alternative, a hybrid model may be used where the per-user security level functions may be split between the VPG and the CON. The hybrid model may be a suitable tradeoff from both a complexity and a business model perspective.","One of the reasons a CON customer may be interested in VPG service may be the efficiency the CON provider may offer the customer with respect to disseminating the content to its VPG members. This efficiency may be achieved due to the CON spanning substantially vast geography, and hence covering significant user base, and due to the CON's possible connections with other access\/metro\/core service providers. In addition to content dissemination efficiency, the VPG may also demand assurance in terms of accessibility, availability, and\/or reliability of the VPG's content.","The accessibility requirements may comprise assurance that a member of a VPG is able to access the data in the CON, from a third party network, and\/or from anywhere irrespective of whether the member is mobile or has a fixed or less frequently changing location. The availability requirements may comprise assurance with respect to the degree of availability of a piece of content published to the network by the VPG. Availability may be ensured by replicating the content at multiple locations. Replication may be required to make the VPG content dissemination process more efficient, where more replication of data may translate into better QoS to the VPG members. Additionally, replication may be needed to account for failures, such as content router or a link failure which may cause network entities to be disconnected from the network. In this case, replication may allow the accessibility of a copy of the content with improved probability. The reliability requirements may comprise service level assurance with respect to downtime, fail-over, hot standbys, and\/or protection switching policies, for instance considering failure of storage or network resources and\/or vulnerability of the locations where the CON infrastructure hosts the VPG. The availability factors above may be dependent on the reliability of the infrastructure.","The QoS requirements, e.g., from a content plane perspective, may translate into metrics that matter to the members of the VPG. The QoS requirements may also vary with the type of applications. The mapping of user Quality of Experience (QoE) to network level QoS requirements is well documented in several related standards. For example, in the case of real time services, end-to-end delay and jitter may be more sensitive parameters, where streaming and browsing services are sensitive to response time and packet losses. These performance metrics may be obtained by breaking the end-to-end QoS budgets into control and data plane functions in the content plane. This form of granular budgeting may be the first step to enforce and engineer QoS requirements that may be met in practice. Further, several applications may use the content layer at the users end to publish or retrieve their corresponding content. The content plane interactions may be at the level of an application layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Allowing the VPG to have an instance of the application in the CON may allow the VPG to disseminate content efficiently to its members and also enhance the member's QoE accordingly, e.g., to ensure the application customization requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","400","100","410","412","410","412","412","420","420","1","2","3","412","300","200"]},"A VPG instance in a content router  may enforce the VPG SLA requirements described at the control, management, and the transport planes related to content dissemination. This may require configuration, storage\/transport resource reservation, policy enforcement, and control\/data protocol instantiation for each VPG. The VPG instantiation  may address where one or more VPGs may be instantiated or established in the CON  using a group of content routers  for each VPG. The VPG instantiation  may also address the amount of resources to be allocated to meet the SLA requirements agreed upon between the VPG and the CON. Theses aspects may be addressed by considering a plurality of factors, including: 1) the geographical spread of the VPG users; 2) the user behavior from which the user request and resulting traffic demand may be predicted for the members of the VPG at a site; 3) the application requirements and type of content requested by the users; and 4) the user expectations in terms of the SLA parameters.","Following the traditional model of provisioning VPNS VPG can be instantiated achieved along the edge nodes without any VPG state in the core of the CONs or ICNs. However, it may be advantageous to leverage the ICN core to improve content delivery. Based on the VPG instantiation scheme , both the edge and the core of the CON  may be used to establish the VPG instance. However, some but not necessarily all the content routers  in the CON  may establish VPG states. Any of the content routers  in the CON  may be capable of caching and hence serving content. Instantiating the VPGs only at the edge nodes may be easier to implement, e.g., in terms of management, but may not provide an optimal or efficient solution for the VPG in terms of content-dissemination. Alternatively, deploying a VPG instance at all or every content router  may not be scalable and may substantially increase network overhead. A preferred approach to overcome the limitations of both solutions may be to select a subset of the content routers , which may be a compromise of both approaches. As such, a subset of content routers  that may be used in the CON  may comprise both edge nodes, which may proxy the user requests, and core nodes, which may ensure the VPG SLA requirements.","The VPG instantiation  may be implemented for a plurality of VPGs based on a plurality of inputs, including the expected content demand, e.g., geography, user population, number of sites, user behavior, traffic profile, work loads, or combinations thereof. The inputs may also comprise SLA requirements (e.g., in terms of availability and replication), performance (e.g., in terms of throughput and QoE\/QoS), reliability (e.g., in terms of downtime, failures, and\/or hot-standby)). The inputs may also comprise network aspects, e.g., in terms of storage, computing, and bandwidth resources, and economic considerations, e.g., in terms of service storage\/bandwidth\/computation cost and resource limitations. The VPG instantiation  may be based on an optimization objective, e.g., ICN objectives in terms of reducing resource usage, increasing user QoE, and\/or increasing revenues. The VPG instantiation  may provide a plurality of outputs, including the subset of content routers  where a VPG is to be instantiated, the virtualized or provisioned resources (e.g., for storage and computing) on each selected content router , and the bandwidth resources required to ensure performance, availability, and reliability. The outputs may also comprise predetermining the routing over the bandwidth resources or adapting the routing to the VPG requirements. The security of the instantiated VPG instance may be based on the security scheme described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/226,605 filed Sep. 7, 2011 by Xinwen Zhang et al. and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus to Create and Manage a Differentiated Security Framework for Content Oriented Networks\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","One of the considered resources during VPG instantiation is the allocation of the storage resource to the user. This storage may comprise storage space to cache content objects based on the real time needs of the VPG members and persistent storage. Based on the distributed caching scheme that is used, the VPG instances on the content routers  may be indexed into local storage (locally in the content routers ) and\/or remote storage (in remote content routers ). A plurality of collaborative schemes may be applied to improve distributed VPG storage, such as in terms of deciding to cache content locally or use the collaborative model to distribute VPG content based on storage space constraints. The tradeoff between the two approaches may be the efficiency of caching versus the control traffic overhead needed to maintain the cache state of the VPG instances in the content routers .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","512","514","516","514","516","514","512","516","520","514","516"]},"The VPG addressing and access  may be used to ensure appropriate association of the VPG sourced interaction (e.g., at the management, control, and data planes) to the VPG instance on the content routers . This may require the identification of the publish\/request and data flows pertaining to the VPG instance at each content router  associated with the VPG instance. This may be achieved by associating a plurality of VPG IDs to the corresponding VPG instances at the content routers . For the further control of the service access, the VPG-ID may be concatenated with user or member IDs associated with the VPG users, e.g., the customer nodes  and\/or customer sites . This level of control may allow setting up Access Control Lists (ACLs) per VPG instance. Additionally, other network level IDs may be used by the CON operator to distinguish between the VPG instances. Such IDs may be required for control plane and data plane operation within the CON's context.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","612","614","616","620","614","616","614","620","614","616","612","600","614","616"]},"Policy management may comprise differentiating policies with respect to privileges awarded to the member of VPG versus the customer side operator of the VPG. The management related interaction with the VPG may be authorized by appropriate security policies taking the privileges into consideration. The member related management privileges may be initially set by the customer operator. For member related interaction, the first step of authorization may be implemented by the customer, which may allow fine grained privilege differentiation among the members of the VPG. This first step of management interaction may be authorized by the VPG customer and subsequently by the CON. The customer operator may be capable of defining policies within the bounds of the SLA parameters that are agreed between the VPG and the service provider. Any policy defined by the operator may be applied to all the VPG instances in the CON. This may be achieved using a centralized entity  or a decentralized mechanism.","In a centralized approach, the VPG customer, e.g., a customer node , may trigger policy changes by interacting with the first hop CON proxy, e.g., a content router  at the edge of the CON. The customer node  may send one or more policies, actions required, VPG IDs and operator IDs (for the customer operators or the customer sites ) or Member IDs (for the customer nodes ) to the CON proxy to trigger policy changes. The CON proxy may then forward a request to the centralized entity  that may be a CON end VPG manager to identify the VPG instances in the CON and apply the related policies consistently across all the VPG instances. The centralized approach may be further extended for member interactions, where the member defined policies (e.g. policies of a group within the VPG) may be applied across all the VPG instances. Alternatively, a decentralized approach may be implemented where the VPN's control plane may be leveraged to propagate and synchronize the policies across all the VPG instances.","The SLA management may handle the policies related to measuring and monitoring the VPG statistics and comparing the policies with existing SLAs, e.g., to decide if the CON SP is abiding by the agreed SLAs. The monitoring of VPG statistics may be achieved between the VPG sites, e.g., by monitoring the members traffic and response statistics. In some scenarios, the monitoring of VPG statistics may also be achieved by collaboration with the CON. In such scenarios, the CON may share some of the VPG statistics collected at its edges with the VPG customer.","The VPG management plane virtualization  may comprise per-VPG level management functions, such as for VPG addressing, provisioning, and VPG management. VPG addressing may use unique global identifiers, which may comprise a plurality of verifiable VPG IDs for the VPG instances and additional identifiers, e.g., at the user\/service level, such as the customer operator ID and\/or Member ID, which may be needed based on the VPG service definition and VPG content addressing. VPG addressing may be in line with naming semantics or any other flat naming constructs. As such, the interactions with the VPG may be tagged to virtually or physically separate the VPG interactions in the ICN SLA policy management, e.g., static or dynamic negotiation and enforcement. VPG addressing may be used in security features for user privacy (e.g., handling personal and confidential data), user authentication, data integrity, operator policy, access authentication\/authorization, content plane resource (e.g., storage and computation), availability (e.g., replication), and reliability (e.g., downtime, fail-over\/protection switching policies, hot standby). VPG addressing may be used in configuring transport plane resources associated with QoS (e.g., response time and bandwidth), point of local repair (PLR), and\/or latency. VPG addressing may also be used for service API reliability (e.g., publish, request, modify, and\/or delete operations). Provisioning may comprise VPG instantiation, e.g., to fulfill VPG requirements and optimization objective as described above, and accounting operations, e.g., to obtain user traffic statistics and charging for services. VPG management may comprise managing user versus VPG operator versus ICN SP privileges, and service APIs, which may be controlled by a user network interface (UNI) to trigger changes in the VPG. The VPG service may be centrally managed by the ICN SP. In one embodiment, VPG management may be based on a business model where the instantiated instances may be controlled by the corresponding VPGs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","712","714","720"]},"In the VPG storage and computing plane virtualization , storage and computation may be distributed in the CON according to how the corresponding VPGs were instantiated. Each content router  that comprises a VPG state may have its provisioned or virtualized private storage and computing resource for that VPG. However, the content storing and computation may not be required in all the VPG instances on all the content routers . For example, content for one VPG (VPG-A) may be distributed based on computation and sorted at the edge content routers  but not the core content routers . Further policies may be applied over the storage and computing resources to prioritize their usage among the VPGs' content and applications. Based on the control plan intelligence, user requests to publish\/subscribe content (e.g., using VPG IDs) may leverage or make use of the availability of the distributed storage and computation resource to maximize or improve content dissemination efficiency. A centralized mode of content resolution, e.g., at a centralized CON entity, may depend on VPG repositories, e.g., local stores\/caches at the content routers , to store\/cache and retrieve distributed content portions or chunks across the content routers . Such distributed content resolution scheme may be optimized for static content. In this case, dynamic content may be staged before being retrieved. Alternatively, a decentralized mode may explore the VPG instances to resolve the content and treat all content as dynamic content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","810","810","812","814","800","812","812","812","840","850","860"]},"The VPG control plane virtualization  may be used to manage the control plane protocol exchange between the same VPG instance distributed across the CON , e.g., across the content routers . The message exchange may comprise a plurality of functions related to managing the VPG policies, cache resources, name resolution management, content forwarding table, replication, and data consistency management in the context of a VPG. As such, multiple replicated control plane instances (at multiple content routers ) may be used for each VPG, which may ensure substantially complete isolation between the VPG instances and exchanges and relatively easy provisioning but may lead to excessive overhead. For example, the VPG control plane virtualization  may use a Distributed Hashed Table (DHT) for each VPG instance to handle user publish\/request actions that require appropriate content indexing and name resolution. Using such a per-VPG control plane approach, multiple instances of the DHT may be created per VPG. In this case, each VPG-DHT instance may operate independent of one another. The disadvantage of this approach is the overhead associated with multiple instances of the DHT protocol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","910","910","912","914","900","912","912","940","912"]},"Similar to VPG control plane virtualization , the VPG control plane virtualization  may be used to manage the control plane protocol exchange between the same VPG instance distributed across the CON , e.g., across the content routers . However, the VPG control plane virtualization  may use a single instance of the control plane and associate appropriate demultiplexing properties, e.g., using filter attributes to control plane messages and map the messages to the proper VPG instance. The VPG control plane virtualization  may use a single DHT for all the VPG instances to handle user publish\/request actions that require appropriate content indexing and name resolution.

The content routers  may establish a virtual forwarding information base (VFIB) for each VPG instance to handle the forwarding of the packets for each instance. In some embodiments, the content router  may also use algorithms for content routing, name resolution and\/or server selection for each VPG instance that meet the corresponding VPG requirements.

Such meta-data may be used to map the received data to appropriate VPG instances. The VPG data entering the CON  boundary may be identified by the content router  as it is tagged, demultiplexed, and processed in the corresponding VPG instance. The resolution of content request to location and forwarding decision may also be taken in the context of the VPG instance.

This level of virtualization may allow multiple VPNs to be configured and managed by the VPN service provider. The features provided by such a service may comprise virtual separation of the control and data transport among the hosted VPNs, customized Traffic Engineering (TE) and QoS to meet the individual needs of the VPNs, and security of data traversing between the VPN sites. VPN virtualization may be supported at layer three (L3) and layer two (L2) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The content plane virtualization may be logically connected to the transport plane virtualization, as described above, so that the customization may be extended to all layers of the OSI model. In this case, in addition to content dissemination customization, the VPG may also negotiate SLAs for transport plane connectivity property at the transport plane. The SLA parameters may comprise VPN topology\/connectivity and QoS properties based on the traffic offered between the sites. This coupling between the content plane and the transport plane may enable the scope for customized joint TE and SS optimization within a VPG's context.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1400","1400","1410"]},"The CON security  may support one or more VPGs across multiple domains using the notion of exchange points or by extending inter-domain protocols such as External-Border Gateway Protocol (E-BGP) to work across the peering points with appropriate extensions to handle VPG specific information. This also may require appropriate SLA negotiation to meet the requirements of the VPG. The control protocols may be extended to exchange published information from the VPG members across domain boundaries. Thus, the information obtained from another domain may also be associated with certain policies before announcing the information in a local domain. This may allow making content dissemination decisions with the knowledge that VPG instances exists outside the local CON domain.
