As is understood by those skilled in the art, modem CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video-on-demand, and information services.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory, and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The remote control device  may include a biometric input module . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . The middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  may format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, the \u201cin band\u201d signaling space operates at a relative high frequency, e.g., between 54 and 860 megahertz. The signaling space is generally divided into channels in which may be transmitted a single analog signal or a greater number (e.g., ten) of digital signals. At any given time, such analog signals represent programs provided via the channels. Herein, the terms channels and programs may sometimes be used interchangeably.","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range is generally at a lower frequency than \u201cin band\u201d signaling. For example, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range may be between zero and 54 megahertz. Data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box .","According to one embodiment, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments, swaps may be processed via the set-top box . Media devices such as tablets, PC, laptops, smart devices  and  are able to download the application to enable swap functionality with the set-top box . Each of these devices can be flexibly connected to the Internet  or to the service provider's HFC network solution . Personalized mosaic information is sent to a server . The server  will then be able to directly communicate with the devices  and , as well as with computer .","According to embodiments, the application server  obtains customer support services data, including billing data, information on customer work order status, answers to frequently asked questions, services provider contact information, and the like from data services  for provision to the customer via an interactive television session. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer.","A billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. According to embodiments, the billing system  may also include billing data for services and products subscribed to by the customer for bill processing billing presentment and payment receipt.","A customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number, and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database  may also include information on pending work orders for services or products ordered by the customer. The customer information database  may also include general customer information such as answers to frequently asked customer questions and contact information for various service provider offices\/departments. As should be understood, this information may be stored in a variety of disparate databases operated by the cable services provider. In addition, an authentication system  may use data from billing system , customer information database , etc. to authenticate a subscriber.","Referring still to , web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments, web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services  or from network storage . According to embodiments, when the application server  requires customer services data from one or more of the data services , the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any required data for a requesting customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer data. The customer data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"Embodiments allow customers to personalize their mosaic viewing experiences by tiling and swapping different channels between the TV and other media devices. The user is able to swap audio as well as video. Thus a program on the TV and a program on another supported device both have audio the user can listen to. Accordingly, embodiments enable the display of programs to move across devices. For mosaics, the customer may move one from a channel or a mosaic from a device to another device. The dimensions of tiling may be increased by not tiling on one device, but tiling on multiple devices and then swapping between these devices. Thus, the customer has multiple devices with multiple audios being received, and the customer moves the tiles to hear different audio. An application may be downloaded to the devices to provide the swapping functionality . Thus the user may download the application to register as a user , as well as the devices associated with the user  communicating this information back to the server. Swap setup information  including parameters to control the operation are defined via a user interface screen. So using UI the user can set the mosaic, name it, specify channels and personalize the setup by choosing programs to be mosaiced together. Thus, the customer can preset which device the mosaic is to be displayed on and may specify the number of channels to display on a certain device. Once the customer chooses the device(s) and what channels are to be displayed in the mosaics, this information is sent to the server . The user tiles or swaps channels according to their specifications .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","320","320","322","310","320","310","320","340","344","310","340","342","344"]},"The user can synchronize the favorite channels between the TV or the set-top box and the tablet devices. The user is able to navigate through these channels on the TV and the tablet device. One of the options is to navigate through all these favorites channels on the TV first and then on the tablet or allow the user to move one of these channels to watch on the tablet while scrolling through the channels on the TV. This will allow the user to swap channels to the tablet. Additionally, the customer is able to assign how the \u2018favorites\u2019 channels are displayed on the TV and the tablets. For example, the customer might choose the first 3 of \u2018favorites\u2019 channels shown on the TV and the rest shown on the Tablet.","Swapping channels between devices could occur because the tuners are busy, the user chooses to do the swap manually, or the channel to be swapped is one of the \u2018favorites\u2019 channels that are synchronized between the TV and the other devices (could be mobile devices).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","410","420","430","440","442","450","420","10","3","3","450","10","470","460","422","420","462","460"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","520","530","510","1","520","3","530","540","3","560","1","570","1","3","550"]},"Additionally, if the user is recording multiple programs and chooses to watch a program on the tablet, the user will be able to swap the viewing from the TV to the tablet and continue the recording on the device.
