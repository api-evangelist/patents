{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention is related to the field of funds comparison tools, and in particular to a funds comparison tool allowing advisors and clients access to comprehensive research and visualize fund comparison data.","The rapid growth and expansion of network and Internet technologies have facilitated electronic commerce transactions, particularly in the area of funds management. Taking advantage of the widespread availability of the Internet, numerous investment houses have gone online with finds management sites on the World Wide Web (web). These sites allow consumers to evaluate easily and conveniently from the comfort of their homes and offices their respective funds. However, there is a lacking of a hinds comparison tool allowing both advisors as well as consumers the ability to visualize and compare using up to date information on the performance of various funds so as to determine what funds are appropriate to which consumers.","According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a funds comparison tool. The funds comparison tool includes a presentation tier that provides a plurality of interfaces for interacting with a plurality of client applications. The presentation tier allows the client applications to send requests for a plurality of analytics to be performed regarding comparing the performance of one or more funds or portfolios as well allowing mobile-based client applications and web-based client applications to communicate with the funds comparison tool. An application tier processes the requests sent by the client applications by providing the data used by the client applications, storing and retrieving of session data, and an interface for the analytics information captured during sessions so as to allow a visualization of the analytics used in the comparison of the one or more funds or portfolios.","According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of performing comparison analysis of one or more funds or portfolios in a network environment using a funds comparison tool. The method includes providing a plurality of interfaces for interacting with a plurality of client applications using a presentation tier. Also, the method includes allowing the client applications to send requests for a plurality of analytics to be performed regarding comparing the performance of the one or more funds or portfolios as well as allowing mobile-based client applications and web-based client applications to communicate with the funds comparison tool. Furthermore, the method includes processing the requests sent by the client applications using an application tier by providing the data used by the client applications, storing and retrieving session data, and an interface for the analytics information captured during sessions so as to allow a visualization of the analytics used in the comparison of the one or more funds or portfolios.","The invention is a funds comparison tool that provides financial advisors and clients with a modern experience to comprehensively research and more clearly visualize mutual fund comparison data. The invention is an open-architecture analytical tool, optimized for iPad, mobile phones\/devices, and desktop usage, that enables in-depth evaluations of thousands investment choices in real time, using a plurality of selection criteria.","In particular, the funds comparison tool is a dynamic tool allowing for visually compelling, side-by-side comparisons of funds, across all categories, including electronic transfer funds (ETFs). Fund-to-fund comparisons or comparisons of portfolios of funds using data points related to performance, risk, and other crucial factors, and obtain a prospectus for any fund can be accomplished using the invention. Moreover, the information provided can be visualized in a context friendly fashion that is easily understood by both advisors and clients.","The invention can be used either on a desktop or mobile devices, such as the iPad, Android-based devices, and other mobile platforms. The software package that defines the invention is platform independent and can be stored and executed by a processor that lie within the various mobile devices as well as a computer systems used in accordance with the invention. Moreover, the invention operates in a client-server network environment that includes a plurality of computer systems or mobile devices intercommunicating with the other. Also, the various mobile devices and computer systems associated with the network can have different operating system executing on their respective platforms. The invention is platform independent and therefore does not require specific operating system platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","2","26","28","30","2"]},"The presentation tier  includes various client interfaces , ,  for the funds comparison tool , including a Mobile component , a Web component , and the Session Management tools component . The true client applications (either the mobile app or web-based tool) interact with the application tier  components exclusively through the Web Services component . The web-based tool also interacts directly with the NetInsight interface; the web analytics endpoint provided by the Web Services component  is used exclusively by the mobile app.","The application tier  includes a Spring Framework . In addition to implementing the Web Services component  and Session Management tools component , the application tier  provides the container for the iPad application. The invention can include a monolithic application for all of these components or can split these components into separate applications.","The application tier  relies on a dedicated Oracle database  to provide fund data imported from the Morningstar data source , and the advisor address book or RMD territory database  can act as the repository of session data.","The funds comparison tool  also relies on the Spring framework  for authentication and authorization for the services for the mobile app. The web-based tool uses the access controls of the host web site to determine user information and access levels.","The Mobile component  is a web-deployed, offline-capable HTML5 application optimized for deployment on the Apple iPad or other mobile platforms. The Mobile component  is intended for use by various retail sales team (RMDs), and provides RMDs with tools for presenting fund-to-fund comparisons and portfolio models in real time. The primary use case for the Mobile component  is as an informational tool for use during a meeting with a financial advisor.","In addition to presenting fund and portfolio data, the Mobile component  captures \u201csnapshots\u201d of data during a given session and transmits the snapshots to a backend repository via the Web Services component . Captured sessions can be used for reporting purposes and can be retrieved and viewed by the Web component .","The Mobile component  also captures session-oriented analytical information for business intelligence and usage pattern analysis. This data is sent to the Web Services component , which is provided to the Putnam Netlnsight Web analytics suite.","As an HTML5 application, this component can be modified for use on other platforms.","The Web component  is a Flash-based web application. The Web component  is targeted for use by financial advisors outside of Putnam. Like the Mobile component , the Web component  provides an interface for creating fund comparisons and portfolio models directly and is also able to display sessions captured on the mobile version and stored in the system.","The core of the funds comparison tool  is the Web Services component . The Web Services component  provides the data used by the clients, such as the Mobile component  and the Web component , data storage and retrieval for session data and an interface for the analytics information captured during sessions. The Web Services component  provides an interface for the client components of the system. The interface is composed of discrete HTTP URLs, each of which is responsible for a particular functional aspect of the funds comparison tool .","The Session Management tools component  includes a Reporting Tools component that is a web-based interface for interacting with sessions generated by RMDs on the Mobile component . The Reporting Tools component provides tools for managing some of the metadata associated with sessions, re-sending sessions emails to advisors and linking to the session views in the Web component .","In addition, the Session Management tools component  provides a system administration interface intended for use for use by system administrators. The administration interface is a web-based user interface for managing the data import process for the system. The administration interface integrates with the Reporting Tools component and administrators can use the interface for looking up session information for troubleshooting purposes.","The Spring Framework  addresses the enterprise concern of taking the classes, model objects , and services that are to compose an application, by providing a formalized means of composing these various disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework  takes best practices that have been proven over the years in numerous applications and formalized as design patterns, and actually codifies these patterns as first class objects that one can take away and integrate into various application(s). The Spring Framework  includes a Spring ORM module , a JDBC module , and a Spring Security module . The Spring ORM module  is a package that provides integration layers for model objects  using popular object-relational mapping application programming interfaces (APIs), including JPA, JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis. Using the Spring ORM module , one can use all those OIR-mappers in combination with all the other features Spring Framework  offers in relations to various model objects . The JDBC module  provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that removes the need to do tedious JDBC coding and parsing of database-vendor specific error codes. In this case, the JDBC module  provides a JDBC-abstraction layer to the Morning Star database  and RMD territory database . Also, the JDBC module  is a JDBC package providing a way to do programmatic as well as declarative transaction management, not only for classes implementing special interfaces, but for all POJOs (plain old Java objects).","The Spring Security module  provides comprehensive security services for J2EE-based enterprise software applications used by the funds comparison tool . There are two major areas of application security are \u201cauthentication\u201d and \u201cauthorization\u201d (or \u201caccess-control\u201d). These are the two main areas that Spring Security module  targets. \u201cAuthentication\u201d is the process of establishing a principal is who they claim to be (a \u201cprincipal\u201d generally means a user, device or some other system which can perform an action in your application). \u201cAuthorization\u201d refers to the process of deciding whether a principal is allowed to perform an action within your application. To arrive at the point where an authorization decision is needed, the identity of the principal has already been established by the authentication process using the Sun Access Manager.  These concepts are common, and not at all specific to Spring Security.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2","40","42","42","44","46","44","46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["54","2","60","62","56","58","56","58","56","58","56","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["68","68","70","72","70","72","74","68"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["84","84","88","86","2","86","88","84","90"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["68","68","112","118","2","110","114","110","114","116"]},"Although the present invention has been shown and described with respect to several preferred embodiments thereof, various changes, omissions and additions to the form and detail thereof, may be made therein, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
