{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/780,316 filed on Feb. 9, 2001, now abandoned, which claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/181,577 filed on Feb. 10, 2000, and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/944,529 filed Oct. 7, 1997, now abandoned. The contents of all related applications listed above are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to control systems for programmable devices and, more particularly, to the generation and distribution of control commands that control the operation of programmable devices.","A wide variety of devices contain a combination of software and hardware that control the operation of the device. These devices will be referred to herein as programmable devices. Programmable devices include a wide variety of items such as toys, industrial motion control systems, exercise equipment, medical devices, household appliances, HVAC systems, and the like.","A common characteristic of such programmable devices is that they are programmed to perform a limited number of predetermined tasks. For example, a toy may be programmed to speak, move, or react to external stimulation in a predetermined manner. An industrial motion control system is programmed to assemble parts in a precise, repetitive manner. A household appliance may be programmed to perform one or more cooking or cleaning tasks. An HVAC system will be programmed to control a heating element and heat distribution systems to obtain a desired air temperature.","Some programmable devices contain means for allowing the end user to control the functionality of the system to a limited degree. In the context of a toy, the end user may operate a switch or joystick to select a manner of movement. An HVAC system will normally allow the end user to set the desired temperature. In most cases, however, the input of the end user is limited to changing variables or selecting from among a plurality of stand-alone programs.","Programmable devices thus take many forms but have certain common characteristics. A programmable device includes some form of memory for storing control commands that define a predetermined command program. The command program may accept input from the user or contain discrete sub-programs from which the end user may select, but the end user may not modify the command program.","A programmable device further comprises a processor capable of executing the command program and generating control signals. To reduce manufacturing costs, the processor is normally an inexpensive dedicated processor with relatively limited capabilities and resources.","A programmable device will also comprise control hardware that performs a desired task as defined by the control signals. The control hardware can be as simple as an LED or speaker that generates light or sound or as complicated as a multi-axis industrial motion control device that performs a complex welding procedure.","The relevance of the present invention is particularly significant given the varying degrees of technical skill possessed by the various patient end users involved in the design, manufacturing, and use of a typical programmable device. The user of a programmable device must be assumed to have little or no capability to create the command programs necessary to operate a programmable device. Certainly a typical child using a toy will not have the skills necessary to create command program for that toy. Even a highly trained technician operating an industrial motion control system typically will likely not have the skill to program the system to perform a desired task.","Accordingly, in this application the term \u201cend user\u201d will refer to a person who uses a programmable device but cannot be assumed to have the expertise to create a command program for that programmable device.","In contrast, the term \u201cprogrammer\u201d will be used herein to refer to a person having the expertise to create a command program for a particular programmable device. The skill level and background of the programmer will vary depending upon the specific programmable device; the term programmer is thus not intended to define a particular level of expertise, but is instead defined in relation to the specific programmable device.","With some programmable devices, the programmer has no direct contact with the end user. For example, a programmer of a toy or household appliance will typically not have direct contact with the end user. A programmer of an HVAC system or industrial motion control system may, on the other hand, have contact with the end user.","Without direct contact with the end user, the programmer must anticipate what task the end user will desire of the programmable device. Even with direct contact, the programmer may not fully comprehend the desired task, or the desired task may change after the command program has been created. In either case, obtaining the services of the programmer to modify the command program is likely to be difficult and expensive, if not impossible.","In general, while the end user may not be able to create a command program, the end user will be able to define the desired task. A technician operating an industrial motion control system will likely be able to observe that a change in the operation of the system will increase product yield or speed up the manufacturing process. Even a child might be able to determine that a doll that walks should also be able to jump.","The term \u201cend user\u201d may include any other person involved with a programmable device without the technical expertise to qualify as a programmer of that device. For example, a medical device may be used by a patient and controlled by a caregiver, neither of which would have the expertise to be considered a programmer; both the patient and the caregiver would be considered end users in the present application.","The purpose of the present invention is to facilitate the generation and distribution of command programs for programmable devices. In particular, the present invention is designed to allow an end user of a particular programmable device to define a desired task, interact with a remote computer over a communications network to generate a command program, and then download the command program into the programmable device over the communications network.","The present invention may be embodied as a system for controlling a motion device. A motion control system comprises a motion control device, and a first user is associated with the motion control system. An output system is arranged to generate motion signals that may be perceived by the first user. A motion server system comprises a plurality of motion scripts associated with messages to be transmitted to the first user and a motion program web page. A processing system comprises a browser program compatible with the motion program web page. A communications system transfers data between the various systems. A second user controls the server system to form a motion message corresponding to a desired motion signal based on the at least one motion script stored by the server system. The motion control system causes the output system to generate the desired motion signal based on the motion message.","The present invention may be embodied in any programmable device. The present invention will be described below in the context of a toy that may be programmed to speak or move in a desired fashion. The present invention has application to other programmable devices, and the scope of the present invention should be determined by the claims appended hereto and not the following discussion.","The invention may be embodied as a networked system including one or more programmable toys that can be controlled to perform a desired task such as move and\/or communicate messages to end users. In contrast to conventional programmable toys whose desired task is programmed during manufacture or through the insertion of external media, the programmable toys of the present invention are programmed remotely through the use of script programs. The script programs allow flexible and dynamic updating of the movement of or messages delivered by the toys, as well as convenient tailoring of toy movement and\/or the communicated messages to the needs of particular end users.","In an example embodiment of the invention disclosed below, the end users as described above are patients and healthcare providers, and the programmable toys are remotely programmed to encourage healthy behavior in the patients. The terms \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201chealth care provider\u201d will be used below interchangeably with the term end user.","In the present exemplary embodiment, the programmable toys may be programmed to encourage children to take their medicine or to tolerate difficult healthcare regimens. The encouragement can take the form of a request audibly delivered to the patient in the form of speech and feedback in the form of movement when the request is followed.","As generally discussed throughout this application, the system of the present invention is equally well suited for purposes other than healthcare, such as industrial motion control systems, exercise equipment, HVAC systems, advertising, home appliances, education, entertainment, or any other application which involves the control of programmable devices to perform a desired task for an end user.","The preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in .

The data includes the end user's unique identification code which modem  transmits to the server, as well as assigned script programs which modem  receives from the server. Modem  is preferably a complete 28.8 K modem commercially available from Cermetek, although any suitable modem may be used.","Toy  further includes a speaker  and a microphone . Audio processor chip  has built in speech synthesis functionality for audibly communicating messages and prompts to an end user through speaker . For speech synthesis, chip  includes a digital to analog converter (DAC)  and an amplifier . DAC  and amplifier  drive speaker  under the control of microcontroller  to communicate the messages and prompts.","Audio processor chip  also has built in speech recognition functionality for recognizing responses spoken into microphone . Audio signals received through microphone  are converted to electrical signals and sent to a preamp and gain control circuit . Circuit  is controlled by an automatic gain control circuit , which is in turn controlled by microcontroller . After being amplified by preamp , the electrical signals enter chip  and pass to through a multiplexer  and an analog to digital converter (ADC) .

Referring again to , the speech commands are preferably separated by delay commands which instruct microcontroller  to pause for a number of seconds between statements. The number of seconds is selected to allow the user sufficient time to absorb each statement. Alternatively, the user may be prompted to acknowledge each statement before a subsequent statement is synthesized. For example, the script program may include commands which instruct microcontroller  to synthesize the phrase \u201cSAY \u2018OK\u2019 WHEN YOU ARE READY TO HEAR THE NEXT STATEMENT.\u201d Upon recognizing the reply \u2018OK\u2019, microcontroller  proceeds to the next speech command in the script program.

Of course, various combinations of these applications are also possible. For example, messages from multiple sources may be combined to generate script programs which contain a combination of health-related messages, advertisements, or educational messages. Further, the system may include any number of remote interfaces for entering and assigning script programs, and any number of programmable toys for delivering messages.","More generally, the programmable device need not be a toy.","For example, the programmable device may be a handheld computing device adapted to control and monitor an athlete end user's performance during athletic training. The device may monitor the athlete end user's heart rate and lactose levels. The device may be remotely programmed by a trainer end user or automated system with instructions for training for a specific athletic event based on data collected by the handheld device.","The programmable device may be a house hold appliance such as a refrigerator that monitors its contents. A remote end user such as a service that delivers groceries could reprogram the refrigerator as necessary to reflect delivered goods.","The programmable device may also be an industrial motion control system such as a robotic welding machine. An engineer in charge of the product being welded may change its design and remotely generate a new command program for the robotic welding machine in response to the design changes.","The programmable device may be an HVAC system that communicates with a remote weather monitoring system that generates a new command program for the HVAC system in response to changes in the weather.","The embodiments of the present invention disclosed above are merely an illustrative, and not exhaustive, list of the environments in which the present invention may be applied. Therefore, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the examples given, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 17"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
