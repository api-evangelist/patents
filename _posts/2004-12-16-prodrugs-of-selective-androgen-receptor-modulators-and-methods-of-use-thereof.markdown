No. 60\/529,573, filed Dec. 16, 2003. This application is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.","This invention was made in whole or in part with government support under grant number R29 CA068096 awarded by the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health, and under grant number R15 HD35329, awarded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Health. The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present invention provides prodrugs of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), and their use in treating or reducing the incidence of osteoporosis, a variety of hormone-related conditions, conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM); conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), and muscular wasting conditions, obesity, dry eye conditions, and prostate cancer. The prodrugs are also useful in oral androgen replacement therapy and male contraception.","The androgen receptor (\u201cAR\u201d) is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids that are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair pattern. The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (\u201cDHT\u201d). Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions. Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function, the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.","Administration of the male sex steroids (e.g., testosterone and its derivatives) has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin-suppressing and androgen-substituting properties of these compounds (Steinberger et al., Fertility and Sterility 28: 1320-28, 1977). Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production (azoospermia) or reduces it to a very low level (oligospermia).","A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect. Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception, it has several drawbacks, including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection","Non-steroidal ligands that bind the AR and act as androgens or as antiandrogens have not been reported. For this reason, research on AR agonists and antagonists has focused on steroidal compounds.","New innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to develop compounds which are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with ADAM, such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with ADIF, such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and\/or prevention of acute and\/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and\/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and\/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer","This invention provides prodrugs of SARM compounds. Several of the parent SARM compounds have androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. The parent SARM compounds, either alone or as a composition, are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and\/or prevention of acute and\/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and\/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; and\/or h) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell.","Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a prodrug of a SARM compound, wherein the SARM compound is represented by a structure of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.52mm","wi":"66.21mm","file":"US07595402-20090929-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein\n        \n        "}}}},"In one embodiment, G in compound I is O.

This section describes properties of the parent SARM compounds from which prodrugs are derived. The prodrugs are designed, in one embodiment, to be biologically processed to yield the parent SARM compound, or another SARM compound with AR binding activity, in the subject.","As used herein, receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are collectively referred to as \u201ccell signaling receptors\u201d. Many cell signaling receptors are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface; when they bind an extracellular signaling molecule (i.e., a ligand), they become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast, in some cases, the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them; these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell","Steroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse directly across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily (or steroid-hormone receptor superfamily). Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, glueocorticoid receptors, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.","In addition to ligand binding to the receptors, the receptors can be blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor, the three-dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three-dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration. The better the ball fits into the socket, the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone, it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more frequently. Once bound, signals may be sent through the receptor into the cell, causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is called activation. On activation, the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes, other than affinity, in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases, this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor, which is enough to begin the activation process (called signal transduction).","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to prodrugs of SARM compounds that are agonist compounds. A receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and activating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the agonist compounds of the present invention is an agonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compounds has high affinity for the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the agonist also has anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the present invention provides prodrugs of SARM compounds that have agonistic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal compounds for the androgen receptor.","In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to prodrugs of SARM compounds that are antagonist compounds. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention bind and inactivate steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the antagonist compounds of the present invention is an antagonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compounds has high affinity for the androgen receptor.","In yet another embodiment, the parent SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist\/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as inhibitors at the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.","Assays to determine whether the parent SARM compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and\/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the parent SARM compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.","As shown in Examples 3-6, SARM compounds stimulate the AR and have selective anabolic and, in some cases, androgenic activity. Thus, administration of SARM prodrugs that are converted in the subject to SARM compounds is an effective strategy for treating conditions disclosed herein.","The compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to an AR. In one embodiment, the AR is an AR of a mammal. In another embodiment, the AR is an AR of a human. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the AR of a mammal, for example a human. Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means, in one embodiment, that the compound can detach from the receptor after binding.","In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (e.g. affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the SARM compounds are alkylating agents that bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone. An \u201calkylating agent\u201d is defined herein as an agent that alkylates (forms a covalent bond) with a cellular component, such as DNA, RNA or enzyme. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with nucleophilic moieties in cellular components.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for binding the SARM compounds of the present invention to an androgen receptor by contacting the receptor with a SARM prodrug and\/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, polymorph, crystal or any combination thereof, under conditions effective to cause the SARM compounds to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the SARM compounds to the androgen receptor enables the prodrugs of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds bind to and inactivate the androgen receptor.","Androgen-dependent conditions which may be treated according to the present invention include those conditions which are associated with aging, such as hypogonadism, sarcopenia, erythropoiesis, osteoporosis, and any other conditions determined to be dependent upon low androgen (e.g., testosterone) levels.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a a method of inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell, comprising the step of contacting the cell with with the selective androgen receptor modulator compound of the present invention and\/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, prodrug, polymorph, crystal or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to induce apoptosis in said cancer cell.","As defined herein, \u201ccontacting\u201d means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a sample containing the enzyme in a test tube, flask, tissue cultureor CHip, array, plate, microplate, capillary, or the like, and incubated at a temperature and time sufficient to permit binding of the SARM to the enzyme. Methods for contacting the samples with the SARM or other specific binding components are known to those skilled in the art and may be selected depending on the type of assay protocol to be run. Incubation methods are also standard and are known to those skilled in the art.","In another embodiment, the term \u201ccontacting\u201d means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a subject receiving treatment, and the SARM compound is allowed to come in contact with the androgen receptor in vivo.","\u201cOsteoporosis\u201d refers, in one embodiment, to a thinning of the bones with reduction in bone mass due to depletion of calcium and bone protein. In another embodiment, osteoporosis predisposes a person to fractures, which are often slow to heal and heal poorly. Unchecked osteoporosis can lead to changes in posture, physical abnormality, and decreased mobility.","\u201cBPH (benign prostate hyperplasia)\u201d is, in one embodiment, a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland, and is the most common non-malignant proliferative abnormality found in any internal organ and the major cause of morbidity in the adult male. BPH occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade. BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra which traverses the prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experience a frequent urge to urinate because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination. The obstruction of urinary flow can also lead to a general lack of control over urination, including difficulty initiating urination when desired, as well as difficulty in preventing urinary flow because of the inability to empty urine from the bladder, a condition known as overflow urinary incontinence, which can lead to urinary obstruction and to urinary failure.","The term \u201cdepression\u201d refers to an illness that involves the body, mood and thoughts, that affects the way a person eats, sleeps and the way one feels about oneself, and thinks about things. The signs and symptoms of depression include loss of interest in activities, loss of appetite or overeating, loss of emotional expression, an empty mood, feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, guilt or helplessness, social withdrawal, fatigue, sleep disturbances, trouble concentrating, remembering, or making decisions, restlessness, irritability, headaches, digestive disorders or chronic pain.","The term \u201chair loss\u201d, medically known as alopecia, refers, in one embodiment, a common type of male-pattern baldness. Baldness typically begins with patch hair loss on the scalp and sometimes progresses to complete baldness and even loss of body hair. Hair loss affects both males and females.","\u201cAnemia\u201d refers to the condition of having less than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, therefore, decreased. Persons with anemia may feel tired and fatigue easily, appear pale, develop palpitations and become usually short of breath. Anemia is caused by four basic factors: a) hemorrhage (bleeding); b) hemolysis (excessive destruction of red blood cells); c) underproduction of red blood cells; and d) not enough normal hemoglobin. There are many forms of anemia, including aplastic anemia, benzene poisoning, Fanconi anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, hereditary spherocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, osteopetrosis, pernicious anemia, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and a variety of bone marrow diseases. As contemplated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and\/or treating any one or more of the above-listed forms of anemia.","\u201cObesity\u201d refers to the state of being well above one's normal weight. Traditionally, a person is considered to be obese if they are more than 20 percent over their ideal weight. Obesity is defined, in another embodiment, as having a Body to Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or above. Obesity is often multifactorial, based on both genetic and behavioral factors. Overweight due to obesity is a significant contributor to health problems. It increases the risk of developing a number of diseases including: Type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes; high blood pressure (hypertension); stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA); heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI); heart failure (congestive heart failure); cancer (certain forms such as cancer of the prostate and cancer of the colon and rectum); gallstones and gallbladder disease (cholecystitis); Gout and gouty arthritis; osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) of the knees, hips, and the lower back; sleep apnea (failure to breath normally during sleep, lowering blood oxygen); and Pickwickian syndrome (obesity, red face, underventilation and drowsiness). As contemplated herein, the term \u201cobesity\u201d includes any one of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases. Thus the prodrugs of SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and\/or treating obesity and any one or more of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases.","Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators:","The SARM compounds of the present invention are, in one embodiment, a novel class of AR targeting agents that demonstrate androgenic or anti-androgenic and anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are a novel class of non-steroidal ligands for the AR.","In another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention may be categorized into subgroups depending on their biological activity. For example, several SARM compounds have an agonistic effect on muscle or bone, whereas others have an antagonistic effect.","The AR is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens (male sex hormones). The androgens (e.g. DHT and testosterone) are steroids that are produced in the body by the testis and the cortex of the adrenal gland. Thus, in one embodiment, SARMS are AR ligands that differ from previously known AR ligands in that SARMS are non-steroidal.","A receptor agonist is, in one embodiment, a substance that binds a receptor and activates it. A receptor partial agonist is, in one embodiment, a substance that binds a receptor and partially activates it. A receptor antagonist is, in one embodiment, a substance that binds a receptor and inactivates it. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention have a tissue-selective effect, wherein one agent may be an agonist, partial agonist and\/or antagonist, depending on the tissue. For example, the SARM compound may stimulate muscle tissue and at the same time inhibit prostate tissue. In one embodiment, the SARMs of the present invention are AR agonists. In another embodiment, the SARMs are AR antagonists. Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and\/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.","In another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist\/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, causing increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as competitive inhibitors of testosterone and\/or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens. Each type of SARM represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.","In one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention bind reversibly to the AR. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the AR. The compounds of the present invention may, in one embodiment, contain a functional group (affinity label) that allows alkylation of the AR (i.e. covalent bond formation).

Acetonitrile (MeCN) and methylene chloride (CHCl) were dried by distillation from PO.","Materials. Compound XI and its phosphate ester and phosphate diethyl ester are synthesized as described in Examples 1-2. Testosterone propionate (TP), polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300, reagent grade), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo.).","Animal. Male CD-1 mice at approximately 6 weeks of age weighing 20-27 g are purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, Mass.). The animals are maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.","Study Design. Mice are weighed and randomly distributed into twelve (12) groups, with 7 animals per group. Treatment groups are depicted in Table 4. On day one of the drug treatment, animals in all groups are individually removed from the cage and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine\/xylazine (87\/13 mg\/kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e. no response to toe pinch), the animals' ears are marked for identification purposes. Animals are then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol. In groups 2-12, the testes are removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile clips used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site is closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and antibiotic ointment is applied to the incision site. The animals in group 1 received sham surgery (midline incision with subsequent closure of the skin).","After completion of the castration, the appropriate dose is administered by oral gavage or subcutaneous injection. Dosing continues once daily for ten days, after which the mice are anesthetized with ketamine\/xylazine and then euthanized by exsanguination. A portion of the blood is centrifuged at 3,000\u00d7g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer is removed and frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscles are removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, and weighed.","The organ weights are normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle are used as indexes to evaluate androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate anabolic activity.","SARM prodrugs are found to have anabolic and androgenic activity in a similar ratio to the parent SARM compounds. This initial experiment is not designed to measure the exact potency of the SARM prodrugs, but rather to establish that they exhibit biological activity similar to the parent compounds.","Concentrations of Compound XI and its phosphate ester and phosphate diethyl ester are measured in plasma samples from the animals from the preceding Example at various time points before and after sacrifice. Administration of each of the above compounds results in significant levels of the parent SARM compound in plasma.","The affinities of Compound XI and its phosphate ester and phosphate diethyl ester for the androgen receptor (AR) are assessed in comparative binding studies, performed as described (Marheflca C A, J Med Chem 47(4): 993-8, 2004). The parent SARM compound is found to have significantly greater affinity for the AR than either of the prodrugs. Thus, the parent compound is likely to be the biologically active compound.","Aqueous solubility of SARM prodrugs shown to have biological activity are ascertained and compared to the parent SARM compounds. The prodrug modifications are found to alter solubility. In some cases, increased aqueous solubility is advantageous for bioavailability because it increases dissolution of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract. In other cases, decreased aqueous solubility increases bioavailability by increasing penetration of the drug through mucous membranes such as the gastrointestinal epithelium.","The experiment described in Example 7 is repeated, this time using 6 different concentrations of each compound. The results show that the prodrug modifications confer increased potency to the drugs. In some cases, the modifications improve potency by improving the bioavailabililty of the drugs. In other cases, the modifications increase the half-life of the compounds. In other cases, the modifications foster concentration of the compound in tissues where its biological activity is needed; i.e. bone tissue, muscle tissue, accessory sexual organs, etc.","Enzymatic studies are conducted to determine the mechanism of conversion of the phosphate ester and phosphate diethyl ester of Compound XI to the parent compound. The prodrugs are found to be de-phosphorylated by liver enzymes (for example alkyl phosphatases) into the parent compound, fostering intra-hepatic reabsorption and thus increasing the biological half life of the drugs. Thus, an explanation is provided for the increased potency of the prodrugs relative to the parent compounds.","It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove.
