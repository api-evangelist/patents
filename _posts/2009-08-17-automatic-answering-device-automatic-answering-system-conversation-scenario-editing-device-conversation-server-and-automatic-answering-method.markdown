Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an automatic answering device, a conversation scenario editing device, a conversation server, an automatic answering system, and an automatic answering method. More specifically, the present invention relates to: an automatic answering device, an automatic answering system and an automatic answering method which are capable of automatically outputting an answer in response to an utterance of a user in accordance with a conversation scenario and thereby establishing a conversation with the user; a conversation scenario editing device for generating and editing a conversation scenario used by the automatic answering device and the automatic answering system; and a conversation server for the automatic answering device and the automatic answering system.","2. Description of the Related Art Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-366190 discloses an automatic conversion device configured to output an answer corresponding to a content of an utterance upon receipt of the utterance from a user. This related automatic conversation device generally adopts a method of outputting an answer corresponding to an utterance of a user by using, or more specifically searching, a database in which each of utterances of users and an answer corresponding to the utterance are stored as a pair.","However, in the method adopted by the related automatic conversion device to output the answer corresponding to the utterance of the user on the basis of a one-to-one relationship, it is difficult to establish a natural conversation about a certain topic between the user and the automatic conversation device, or to realize a situation in which a content with a certain story prepared in advance (such as explanation of a structure of a system or description of emergency care) is spoken little by little to the user by using the automatic conversation device.","As a technique for establishing such natural conversations, there has been disclosed a technique using a scenario which enables conversations to proceed in accordance with a previously prepared course of conversations while answering utterances from a user. However, only a KB (knowledge-base) engineer with expertise is able to produce such a scenario.","Meanwhile, the distribution of commodities and services through networks has been expanded with diffusion and development of communication networks and network communication devices.

The conversation server  transmits a reply sentence to the user utterance and operation control information attached thereto to the user terminal device , or namely the conversation controller . The operation control information to be attached to this reply sentence has a content to instruct the IP telephone unit  to start a call addressed to a telephone number of the opponent. Then the handset  of the opponent answers the outgoing call, the conversation controller  acquires an answering voice signal of the opponent through the IP telephone unit , replaces a voice signal with an inputted sentence by means of voice recognition, and requests the conversation server  to provide a reply sentence in response thereto. The conversation server  determines a reply sentence in response to this inputted sentence and transmits the reply sentence together with operation control information to the user terminal device , or namely the conversation controller . When the inputted sentence acknowledges that it is a response from the opponent requested by the user, the operation control information to be attached to the reply sentence has a content to instruct the IP telephone unit  to hold the call.","When there is an incoming call from a certain opponent to the user, the IP telephone unit  establishes a call with the opponent and passes a voice signal from the opponent to the conversation controller . The conversation controller  converts the voice signal into an inputted sentence and request the conversation server  to provide a reply sentence in response thereto. The conversation server  transmits the reply sentence, which inquires whether or not the user wishes to answer the call from the opponent, to the user terminal device , or namely the conversation controller  as the reply to the inputted sentence. The conversation controller  causes the output unit  to output the reply sentence in order to urge a subsequent user utterance. When there is the user utterance, the conversation controller  requests the conversation server  to provide a reply sentence in response to the user utterance. If the user utterance has a content indicating that the user wishes to answer the call, the conversation server  transmits a reply sentence provided with operation control information having a content to instruct the IP telephone unit  to start the call between the user and the opponent to the user terminal device , or namely the conversation controller . The conversation controller , or namely the operation controller , instructs the IP telephone unit  to start the call between the user and the opponent.","On the other hand, if the user utterance has a content indicating that the user does not wish to answer the call, the conversation server  transmits a reply sentence provided with operation control information having a content to instruct the IP telephone unit  to terminate the call between the user and the opponent to the user terminal device , or namely the conversation controller . The conversation controller , or namely the operation controller , instructs the IP telephone unit  to disconnect the call from the opponent.","The voice input unit  is the constituent that converts a voice into an electric signal, which is typically a microphone, for example. The voice output unit  is the constituent that converts an electric signal into a voice, which is typically a loudspeaker, for example.","(7.1.
