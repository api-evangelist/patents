title: System and method to establish and maintain conditional trust by stating signal of distrust
abstract: A system and method is provided that establishes and maintains conditional trust by stating a signal of distrust from a trustee's computing platform to a trustor's computing platform. The trustor attests a trustee at a given time and also sends trust conditions to the trustee upon which the trustor trusts the trustee for some intended purpose. The trust conditions may include restrictions on hardware or software components and any status changes to the hardware or software components. The trustee then monitors the hardware and software components in relation to the trust conditions and reports distrust signals when the trustee's hardware and software configuration no longer matches the trust conditions.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to trusted platforms, and more particularly, to trusted platforms capable of generating distrust signals when the trusted platform's current configuration state does not match a set of trusted conditions.","Trust is a crucial aspect in e-commerce, communications, and related applications. Since e-commerce is implemented using both mobile and land based computing platforms, enhancing trust in these computing platforms is a fundamental issue and is of growing importance in the computing industry.","The Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA) formed in 1999 by Intel, HP\/Compaq, IBM, Microsoft, and other companies, proposes a new computing platform for this century that will initially provide improved trust in the Personal Computer (PC) platform with eventual trust provided by the Trusted Mobile Computing Platform (TMCP). The TCPA promotes the concept of a trusted subsystem and chains of trust between such subsystems, so as to provide the basic building blocks for e-Commerce.","Originating from the TCPA, the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) focuses on open standards to enhance the overall security and trustworthiness of a variety of computing devices. One such standard is the Trusted Mobile Computing Platform (TMCP) that includes standards for trusted computing using mobile terminals. Ongoing efforts by the TCG continue to focus on the impact of TCPA on mobile commerce because the TCPA was initially intended for land based computing systems such as the PC.","The Trusted Platform (TP), as defined by the TCPA, is a platform that behaves the way it is expected to behave for its intended purpose. The TCPA definition of a trusted system is a system that always behaves in the expected manner for the intended purpose. The trust of a TCPA computing platform is built upon a root trust, which is convinced by sound existing technologies, including both hardware and software technologies. The root trust is realized through the TCPA subsystem, which typically consists of a root of trust for measuring integrity metrics; a Trusted Platform Module (TPM); and other Trusted Support Systems (TSS). The TCPA subsystem supports two roots of trust: the root of trust for measuring integrity metrics and the root of trust for storing and reporting integrity metrics, which is realized by the TPM.","The way in which a remote computing platform can be trusted is as follows. First, integrity metrics are queried from the platform, which are digitally signed by the trusted component of that platform. Second, the integrity metrics are compared with expected values that represent components that are trusted enough to perform the intended purpose. Third, if the compared values match the expected values, trusted interaction with the remote computing platform may be commenced. Anomalous metrics indicate that the platform is not operating as expected and further correspondence with the platform should be considered very carefully.","The TCPA strives to provide authenticity, integrity, and privacy so that: 1.) users are confident that they know to whom and to what entity they are communicating; 2.) transfer of information occurs accurately; and 3.) potential snoopers cannot invade the privacy of the system, message, or transaction. Trust, however, has several complicated and multi-dimensional concepts associated with it. Trust, for example, is dynamic because the level of trust that is considered sufficient varies for each individual and it varies over time. Trust is affected by many factors that are both subjective and objective, making a correct evaluation of trust difficult indeed.","Additionally, trust is not always transitive, meaning that: if entity A trusts entity B; and entity B trusts entity C; trust between entity A and C is not always conferred, although it may be in certain situations. Trust has varying degrees and scope, where entities typically develop trust for each other for their intended purpose, but that trust is not always transferred to other interactions between the entities.","Since trust is dynamic, it is impossible to provide a static\/absolute trust solution. Accordingly, one disadvantage of the current TCPA paradigm, is that it does not provide a dynamic solution and is thus unable to tailor its protection for the changeable trust component. The static nature of the current TCPA solution, therefore, may cause a waste of resources and unnecessary attestation when the trust level is actually very high, while failing to satisfy security requirements for transactions when the trust level is actually very low.","Through checking of the integrity metrics, the root trust may trust the Basic Input Output System (BIOS), the BIOS may trust the Operating System (OS), the OS may trust the software application, and the software application may trust other remote systems. The chain of trust, however, does not necessarily remain intact for an extended length of time, nor does it remain in tact after hardware or software configuration changes. Accordingly, the trust chain is built up during system boot, which means that the OS can only verify its trust for previously identified configurations, thus failing to verify trust for any newly added hardware or software components.","Generally speaking, the TCPA fails to provide a model whereby integrity metrics may be trusted remotely. In particular, software applications may be able to record the challenge requests and their corresponding correct integrity metrics and thus may be able to replay the integrity metrics during subsequent integrity metrics requests. Once the recordings are complete, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks may also be implemented whereby TCPA compliant systems may be inundated with challenge requests and effectively crippled due to the sheer quantity of processing required by the challenge requests. One possible solution for these attacks is to time stamp the integrity metrics, however, a remote challenge procedure is easily simulated whereby signed integrity metrics may be obtained with a valid time stamp and subsequently replayed. Other solutions involve using serial numbers to identify the signed integrity metrics, the use of short-life cycle certificates or frequent polled metric checks, but each method is either non-economic, non-feasible, or provides limited attack protection.","Another area of deficiency within the trusted computing environment is exhibited by Java-2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME) applications. Although certain security provisions are provided by the security and trust services Application Programming Interface (API) for J2ME, i.e., Java Specification Request (JSR) 177, it fails in many respects to provide adequately trusted operations.","In order to perform trusted operations, J2ME applications need to rely on the security services provided in a security element to ensure that, for example, the cryptographic keys are stored securely and that the cryptographic computations are performed securely. The proposed JSR 177 APIs establish a Java programming model for accessing the features of a security element, however, the trusted operation issue cannot be solved by JSR 177 because it simply focuses on MIDlet interaction with the security element, such as a smart card. The JSR 177 defines a collection of APIs that provide security services to J2ME enabled devices, i.e., it provides an access model that enables applications running on J2ME enabled devices to communicate with a smart card inserted in the device, but it fails to consider that the mobile code may be modified from its original state and may no longer be trusted. Digital signatures and Digital Rights Management (DRM) procedures are currently unable to solve the problem.","Accordingly, there is a need in the computing\/communications industry for a system and method that implements trust based on the current TCPA\/TCG technology while improving upon its propensity to counteract spoofing attacks and its ability to maintain trust.","Additionally, there is a need to provide a self-regulating mechanism that maintains trust without the need for unnecessary communication and computation.","To overcome limitations in the prior art, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a system and method for establishing and maintaining conditional trust between a trustee and a trustor by stating distrust signals from a trustee's terminal to a trustor's terminal.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method for establishing and maintaining conditional trust between a trustee and a trustor is provided. The method comprises generating metrics by a trustor that represents a trusted condition, comparing the generated metrics to current metrics of a trustee, and issuing a distrust signal by the trustee in response to a mismatch between the generated metrics of the trustor and the current metrics of the trustee.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a trusted computing system is provided. The trusted computing system comprises a trustor terminal coupled to provide a trust condition to define a configuration state, and a trustee terminal coupled to receive the trust condition and coupled to provide attestation of the configuration state. The trustee terminal provides a distrust signal to the trustor terminal when the configuration state does not match the trusted condition.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a mobile terminal wirelessly coupled to a network which includes a network element capable of providing a trusted condition is provided. The mobile terminal comprises a memory capable of storing at least a distrust signal module and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) engine, a processor coupled to the memory and configured by the TPM engine to enable a configuration attestation with the network element, and a transceiver configured to facilitate a trusted condition exchange with the network element. The processor is configured by the distrust signal module to provide a distrust signal when the configuration does not match the trusted condition.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon which are executable by a mobile terminal for maintaining a trusted system configuration is provided. The instructions perform steps comprising receiving trusted conditions representing a required system configuration of the mobile terminal, generating integrity metrics representative of a current system configuration of the mobile terminal, and supplying a distrust signal representative of a difference between the required system configuration and the current system configuration.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a server within a network used to establish a trusted exchange with a mobile terminal is provided. The server comprises means for providing a trusted condition to define a configuration state of the mobile terminal, and means for receiving a distrust signal from the mobile terminal. The distrust signal is indicative of a difference between a current configuration state of the mobile terminal and the trusted condition.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon which are executable by a server for facilitating trusted network computing is provided. The instructions perform steps comprising providing a trusted condition to define a configuration state of a trustee terminal, and receiving a distrust signal from the trustee terminal. The distrust signal is indicative of a difference between a current configuration state of the trustee terminal and the trusted condition.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a distrust signal reporting system is provided. The distrust signal reporting system comprises a computing platform CAN configured to receive trust conditions from a trustor that defines a trusted configuration state, and an information monitor coupled to the computing platform CAN and configured to monitor configuration and status signals from a trustee platform and to report a configuration state of the trustee platform to the computing platform. The computing platform CAN generates a distrust signal when the configuration state of the trustee platform does not match the trusted configuration state.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a trusted platform system is provided. The trusted platform system comprises a trustee computing platform configured to provide configuration and status signals relating to the trustee computing platform, a Root of Trust (ROT) measurement module coupled to the trustee computing platform and configured to measure integrity metrics associated with the trustee computing platform in response to the configuration and status signals, a ROT store module coupled to receive the integrity measurement metrics from the ROT measurement module, and a Trusted Platform Agent (TPA) coupled to receive trust conditions and challenges from a trustor and coupled to provide measurement data in response to the challenges. The trusted platform system further comprises a distrust signal reporting module. The distrust signal reporting module includes a computing platform CAN coupled to the TPA to receive the trust conditions, where the trust conditions define a trusted configuration state, and an information monitor coupled to the computing platform CAN and configured to monitor the configuration and status signals from the trustee computing platform and to report a configuration state of the trustee computing platform to the computing platform CAN. The computing platform CAN checks the trust conditions against the configuration state of the trustee computing platform and generates a distrust signal to the TPA when the configuration state of the trustee platform does not match the trusted configuration state. The TPA is further responsible for the delivery of the distrust signal to the trustor's platform.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of providing conditional trust between a MIDlet provider and a Mobile Information Device (MID) is provided. The method comprises attaching trust conditions to a MIDlet suite contained within the MIDlet provider, downloading the MIDlet suite and attached trust conditions to the MID, checking the trust conditions against a configuration of the MID to determine a difference between the trust conditions and the configuration, and reporting the difference to the MIDlet provider.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for establishing and maintaining conditional trust between a trustee and a trustor is provided. The method comprises generating metrics by the trustor that represents a trusted condition, sending the trusted condition to the trustee for a conditional trust reference, generating metrics by the trustee according to the conditional trust reference at the trust attestation stage for an intended purpose, registering the conditional trust reference at a trusted computing platform CAN within the trustee, checking the trustee generated metrics against current metrics of the trustee according to the conditional trust reference, and issuing a distrust signal by the trustee in response to a mismatch between the conditional trust reference and the current metrics of the trustee.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of providing conditional trust between a content provider and a device is provided. The method comprises attaching trust conditions to content contained within the content provider, downloading the content and attached trust conditions to the device, checking the trust conditions against a configuration of the device to determine a difference between the trust conditions and the configuration, and reporting the difference to the content provider.","These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with greater particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of a system and method in accordance with the invention.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the reproduction of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights and associated copyright ownership privileges.","In the following description of the exemplary embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, as structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Generally, the present invention is directed to a method and system that defends against any malicious behavior occurring between a trustor and a trustee after the trustee has gained the trust of the trustor. The present invention matches up trust characteristics completely by establishing and maintaining the trust to the trustee in terms of some intended purpose under preferred conditions specified by the trustor ahead of time. In so doing, the fundamental characteristic of trust may be supported.","Open platforms are general purpose computing platforms where there is no a priori trust established between the hardware of the platform and a third party that could be used to prove the functionality of the platform. Examples of open platforms include workstations, mainframes, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), and PCs. Open platforms possess many practical benefits over closed platforms, but unfortunately, a remote party cannot make any assumptions about how that platform will behave or misbehave.","Closed platforms are special purpose computing devices that interact with the user via a restricted interface, e.g., automated tellers, game consoles, and satellite receivers. Closed platforms contain mechanisms that restrict modifications to its software. A closed platform can authenticate itself as an authorized platform to a remote party using a secret key embedded in the platform during manufacturing. Closed platforms rely on hardware tamper resistance to protect the embedded secret key and ensure well-behaved operation, but severely limit flexibility of applications.","Trusted platforms, on the other hand, provide the best properties of open and closed platforms. As with open platforms, trusted platforms allow applications from many different sources to run on the same platform. As with a closed platform, remote parties can determine what software is running on a platform and thus determine whether to expect the platform to be well behaved.","Trusted Platform Subsystem (TPS)  according to the prior art is illustrated in . TPS , among other things, enables an entity to determine the state of the hardware and software environment in TPS  and to seal data to a particular configuration within TPS . The entity deduces whether the state of the computing environment in TPS  is acceptable and performs some transaction with TPS . If the transaction involves sensitive data that must be stored on TPS , the entity can ensure that the data is held in a confidential format unless the state of the computing environment in TPS  is acceptable to the entity.","TSS  provides mechanisms for cryptographically reporting the current hardware and software configuration of computing platform  to local and remote challengers. TSS  also provides a limited protected storage capability, which allows the owner of TPS  to store an acceptable platform configuration, biometric data, or other data that is available early during system boot. System firmware or other software may use this storage capability to name users who are qualified to log on, or to store acceptable boot configurations. TSS  also provides a facility whereby platform software or firmware may store secrets that are accessible only when the platform is in a defined configuration, a mechanism known as sealing.","TPS  provides reliable information via signal MEASUREMENT DATA to enable the challenging entity to deduce the hardware\/software environment in TPS . At the same time, TPS  provides a means to encrypt cryptographic keys and to state the software environment that must be in place before the keys can be encrypted. Both functions of TPS  require integrity metrics, which consist of data reflecting the integrity of the configured state of TPS . Both functions require two roots of trust: Root of Trust (ROT)  for measuring integrity metrics; and ROT  for storing and reporting integrity metrics. ROT  measures certain platform characteristics, logs the measurement data into measurement store , and stores the final result in ROT .","When an integrity challenge, e.g., CHALLENGE, is received, Trusted Platform Agent (TPA)  gathers the final results from ROT , the log of measurement data from trusted platform measurement store , and Trusted Computing Group (TCG) validation data  that states the values that the measurements should produce in a platform that is working correctly. TPA  then sends the gathered data, e.g., MEASUREMENT DATA, to the challenging entity, who then uses the data to check that it is consistent with the final results and then compares the data with the TCG validation data. This comparison allows the challenging entity to deduce the configured state of TPS  and consequently decide whether it is satisfied to trust TPS  for its intended purpose.","Once the challenging entity has determined that TPS  can be trusted, the challenging entity can use TPM  to store keys alongside stated values of integrity metrics, such that TPM  will not release the keys unless the current measured values of integrity metric match the stated values of integrity metric. Both ROT  and  and Trusted Platform Support Services (TSS)  are implemented in ways that enable confidence in their correct operation in all circumstances of interest. The implementation of ROT  typically varies depending upon the type of platform that it resides upon, e.g., PC, server, or mobile terminal. TPM  is defined as the set of all trusted capabilities aside from ROT  because these are independent of the type of platform used.","Each entry in the log inside measurement store  of TPM  contains a description of a measured entity plus an appropriate integrity metric that has been recorded inside TPM . The log can be used to reproduce the value of each sequence of integrity metrics inside TPM . If the log and the TPM are consistent and if the TPM is trustworthy, the log can also be trusted. If the values derived from the log and the values reported by the TPM are the same, the log is presumed to be an accurate record of the steps involved in building the software environment on computing platform . Any difference between the values derived from the log and the values reported by the TPM indicate an undesirable inconsistency in the configuration state of computing platform .","A large number of integrity metrics may be measured that reflect the configuration state of computing platform , whereby a particular metric may change with time, thus requiring a new value to be stored. TPS  provides a way to store sequences of integrity metrics, rather than overwrite old metric values with newly computed values. Values of integrity metrics are not stored within TPS , but are rather appended to a sequence. The new value of an integrity metric is concatenated to the existing value of the sequence, a digest is computed for the concatenation, and the digest is then used as the new representation of the sequence. In this way, one or more sequences may be used to represent an arbitrary number of integrity metrics and their updates.","An entity seeking to know the state of the computing environment inside TPS  depends critically on the value of the integrity metrics. The integrity metrics enable an entity to determine the consistency of the measurement information and to compare the actual and expected status of the platform. The integrity metrics themselves, therefore, must be reported by a trusted mechanism, i.e., TPM . TPM  proclaims its trustworthiness by signing data using one of its identities and conventional cryptographic techniques. The signature key is known only to TPM  and is the private key of a key pair. The corresponding public key is an identity key, since it is a cryptographic value by which TPM  is known, therefore, the public key is part of an identity of TPM .","TCPA compliant system  of  illustrates an exemplary network of trusted platforms and challenging entities according to the present invention. Layers - of workstation  represent a trust chain that is specified by the TCPA. The TCPA provides stronger authentication of platforms, e.g., workstations  and , and enhances the integrity of internal and external networks, such as for example, Enterprise TCPA compliant system  and e-Business TCPA compliant system .","Root trust  is realized through the TCPA subsystem, which typically consists of a root trust for measuring integrity metrics, a TPM, and a TSS. The integrity metrics consists of data that reflects the integrity of the hardware\/software state of the trusted platform. The TPM is generally implemented using an Integrated Circuit (IC) that is internal to workstations  and . When power is applied, the TPM IC takes charge by first checking the boot Read Only Memory (ROM) that it expects, executes it, and then measures the state of the machine against a known safe metric to establish BIOS trust . Once BIOS trust  has been verified, Operating System (OS) trust  is established by first checking the OS loader, which is responsible for loading system Software (SW) executables and then checks the OS kernel to establish OS trust . The OS kernel then checks a list of legitimate SW to create SW trust , which then uses the OS resources to authenticate local and remote data. As can be seen, the TCPA extends the trust based on root trust  by setting up trust chain -. Once the TPM IC knows the metric of one item, it can expand the list of trusted items by checking the metric of each layer. In this way, the TPM IC can expand its trust boundary on verified hardware and software. The TCPA makes use of integrity metrics to inspect the trust chain by its previous chain and detects the misbehavior of the chain after root trust  to include the behavior of remote parties.","The process of dynamically establishing that a platform conforms to the specification expected by a remote party is done through a process called attestation. Attestation consists of several steps of cryptographic authentication by which the specification for each layer of the platform is checked from the hardware up to the operating system and application code. Attestation is then extended to remote workstations, PCs, and other network entities to expand the trust boundary. At a high level, the steps of attestation are as follows.","A hardware platform, e.g., workstation , has a signing key, K, and a public key certificate, C, for this key that is issued by, for example, integrity certificate generator  via path . When an application, e.g., application A, is executed on workstation  for example, it generates a public\/private key pair, PK\/SK. Next, the application requests the workstation to certify its public key PK, to which the workstation uses its signing key Kto generate a certificate for PK, which is denoted C. Along with standard certificate fields, the certificate Ccontains the hash of the executable image of the application A. The signed certificate Cis then returned to the application.","When the application wants to attest its validity to a remote server, e.g., Enterprise TCPA compliant system  or e-Business TCPA compliant system , it sends the integrity metrics, e.g., certificate chain (C,C), to the remote server as part of the response to the challenge depicted in path . The server then checks two things: the signatures on both certificates are valid and that Cis not revoked; and that the application hash embedded in Cis on the server's list of applications it trusts. At this point, the server is assured that Ccomes from an application that it trusts. The application is now able to authenticate itself by proving its knowledge of private key SK.","TCPA compliant system  adds special value such as authentication, integrity and privacy to a Business-to-Business (B2B) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployment. In a buyer\/supplier model, for example, TCPA capability enables a buyer and a supplier to issue a challenge, e.g., , to the buyer\/supplier platform to determine that it is a trusted system. After convincing the mutual trust between the supplier and the buyer, both of the transaction parties can conduct business remotely. TCPA compliant system  may also support an Enterprise virtual private network, in order to enable access by employees located in remote sites. The trust is built by obtaining integrity metrics in the remote platform, securely storing these metrics in the remote platform, and then ensuring the report of metrics from the remote platform is secure through attestation.","Attestation, however, only allows a remote party to ascertain what configuration was launched on a particular platform and establishes a session key for future interaction with that configuration on that particular platform. This does not provide trustworthiness in the usual sense because a software component could be buggy and produce incorrect results. Additionally, attestation provides no information about the current state of the running system, such as a software component that has been compromised by a buffer overflow attack, infected by a virus, replaced by a newer version of code, etc.","Message flow  of  illustrates an exemplary message flow diagram according to the present invention that provides signalling of an altered software or hardware component after attestation has taken place between a trustor and a trustee. The altered component(s) is(are) identified by the trustee and the appropriate signalling is then generated by the trustee to the trustor.","Message flows  and  represents the initial attestation between trustor and trustee that allows the trustor to establish a trust relationship with the trustee as discussed above. The trustee's platform change may be monitored, compared, and reported according to the pre-defined trust conditions specified by the trustor for the intended purpose. These trust conditions are confirmed by the trustee during the trust attestation. Message flows  and  represents further attestation between trustor and trustee that establishes trust conditions for a special purpose. For example, the trustor wishes to bootstrap the trustee as to the particular software applications that may be executed on the computing platform of the trustee. Once the trustee has agreed to the bootstrap, confirmation  is generated by the trustee to guarantee to the trustor that the bootstrap will be adhered to and transactions  between the trustor and trustee may then proceed.","After some amount of time has transpired, condition changes  within the trustee's computing platform pose a threat to the trust gained by the trustor through confirmation . For example, a software update may have occurred on one or more of the software applications that was included in the bootstrap requested by the trustor causing the integrity metrics to change. Alternately, a hardware change or a hardware status change may have occurred within the trustee's computing platform to cause the integrity metrics to change. In any event, the trustee gathers all information relating to the integrity change taking place within its computing platform and signals the change to trustor via message . Message  may be delivered to the trustor via any pre-negotiated mechanism that is compatible to both trustee and trustor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","302","310","430","314","428"]},"Referring to , mobile terminals  and  communicate with Base Transceiver Station (BTS)  and , respectively, via an air interface.

SGSN  and  are responsible for the delivery of data packets to and from mobile terminals  and , respectively, within the service area, and performs packet routing and transfer, mobility management, logical link management, authentication, charging functions, etc. In the exemplary GPRS embodiment shown in , the location register of SGSN  stores location information such as the current cell and Visiting Location Register (VLR) associated with mobile terminal , as well as user profiles such as the International Mobile Subscriber Identity Number (IMSI) of all GPRS users registered with SGSN . SGSN  performs similar functions relating to mobile terminal . SGSN  and  are ultimately coupled to MMSC  in connection with the presently described embodiment. While GSM forms the underlying technology, SGSN  and  described above are network elements introduced through GPRS technology. Another network element introduced in the GPRS context is the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) , which acts as a gateway between the GPRS network  and WAP gateway .","Multimedia Messaging Service Center (MMSC)  provides messaging capabilities for the delivery of multimedia messages composed of text, photographs, video, and other media types. The messaging capabilities include mobile originated messages sent to other mobile terminals or applications and application originated messages sent to mobile terminals or other applications. MMSC  is responsible for storing incoming and outgoing MMS messages, as well as the transfer of messages between different messaging systems.","With the aforementioned network system described as a representative network environment, a trusted messaging scenario is now described in which a WAP Push Framework is utilized to deliver the distrust signalling according to the principles of the present invention. Dashed line  represents, for example, the messaging path used for transfer of messages - of . Dashed line  represents the source multimedia message from mobile terminal , which is ultimately posted to MMSC . Mobile terminal  is acting as a mobile server to trustor , whereby trusted content is transferred via path  until such time that a configuration change within mobile terminal  causes distrust signalling to report the configuration change. The distrust signalling is received by trustor  via MMSC  from mobile terminal , in which case trustor  must decide which action to take next.","The WAP protocol suite is used as the data transport mechanism because WAP provides data transport services that are optimized for mobile networks. WAP also provides uniform transport services regardless of the underlying network. In particular, the Wireless Session Protocol (WSP) layer supplies the basis of the transport mechanism. Distrust signalling via, for example, an MMS message is sent by mobile terminal  for delivery to trustor  via an M-Send.req Protocol Data Unit (PDU) which contains the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) encapsulated MMS message content.

WAP gateway  provides the necessary functionality required to support HTTP encapsulation as required to support multimedia messaging to MMSC . It should be noted that although MMS is illustrated in  as the distrust signalling transport, alternate methods of transport may be used, such as the Short Messaging Service (SMS). In other embodiments, proximity communications using Bluetooth or Infrared (IR), for example, may be used to communicate the distrust signalling. Wired communications may also be used for distrust signalling transport such as specified by the RS232 or RS432 standards, and also may include differential data transmission formats such as specified by the RS422 or RS485 standards. Other wired implementations for higher bandwidth considerations may use the Universal Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire, specifications for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502"]},"Computing platform CAN  receives the trust conditions  and checks them against sign-in information monitor  of the trustee. Contributing to sign-in information monitor  are software (SW) updates , hardware (HW) updates , HW status , and other , which are combined by sign-in information monitor  to calculate a configuration image that represents the current execution state of the trustee. HW status  may represent a change in the operational state of the trustee's hardware indicating, for example, that a Universal Serial Bus (USB) is non-functional, or that a memory check has failed. SW updates  may occur when upgrading to a more recent version of an application executing on the trustee. HW update  may occur, for example, when expanding the Random Access Memory (RAM) allocation for the trustee.

In another embodiment according to the present invention, a detection mechanism may be employed to detect any of configuration changes - to cause a recalculation of integrity metrics. Computing platform CAN  checks trust conditions  received from the corresponding trustor against sign-in information monitor  to detect any differences. All differences are then formulated into distrust signal  and then communicated to the trustor. The trustor then must decide the next step to take in response to the distrust signal.","The invention is a modular invention, whereby processing functions within either a TPM enabled mobile terminal or server may be utilized to implement the present invention.

For example, desktop computing devices similarly include a processor, memory, a user interface, and data communication circuitry. Thus, the present invention is applicable in any known computing structure where data may be communicated via a network.","Using the description provided herein, the invention may be implemented as a machine, process, or article of manufacture by using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce programming software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof. Any resulting program(s), having computer-readable program code, may be embodied on one or more computer-usable media, such as disks, optical disks, removable memory devices, semiconductor memories such as RAM, ROM, PROMS, etc. Articles of manufacture encompassing code to carry out functions associated with the present invention are intended to encompass a computer program that exists permanently or temporarily on any computer-usable medium or in any transmitting medium which transmits such a program.

From the description provided herein, those skilled in the art will be readily able to combine software created as described with appropriate general purpose or special purpose computer hardware to create a trusted computing system and method in accordance with the present invention.","The trusted servers or other systems for providing trusted computing functions in connection with the present invention may be any type of computing device capable of processing and communicating digital information. The trusted servers utilize computing systems to control and manage the computing activity. An example of a representative computing system capable of carrying out operations in accordance with the invention is illustrated in . Hardware, firmware, software or a combination thereof may be used to perform the various trusted functions and operations described herein. The computing structure  of  is an example computing structure that can be used in connection with such a trusted system.","The example computing arrangement  suitable for performing the trusted computing activity in accordance with the present invention includes trusted server , which includes a central processor (CPU)  coupled to random access memory (RAM) , read-only memory (ROM) , and TPM chip . It should be noted that functions in accordance with the present invention may be imbedded within TPM chip , processor , or alternately separated from both of them and provided elsewhere. The ROM  may also be other types of storage media to store programs, such as programmable ROM (PROM), erasable PROM (EPROM), etc. The processor  may communicate with other internal and external components through input\/output (I\/O) circuitry  and bussing , to provide control signals and the like.

The server may be part of a larger network configuration as in a global area network (GAN) such as the Internet , which allows ultimate connection to the various landline and\/or mobile client\/watcher devices.","A method according to the present invention that may be implemented by any trusted platform, e.g., mobile terminal or server, acting as a trustee in a trusted exchange with a trustor is exemplified by procedure  of . Procedure  provides a solution to establish and maintain conditional trust by stating distrust signals from a trustee's computing platform. In step , attestation of trust is established between a trustee and a trustor. The trustee operates TPS  as illustrated in , but in addition, also operates a distrust signal reporting system structure as depicted in .","In step , the trustor generates a set of integrity metrics that define the execution state of the trustee that is required in order for the trustor to maintain its trust in the trustee during the intended purpose. The trustee monitors sign-in information monitor  for any changes caused by influences - as in step . If an influence has occurred, it is detected in step  and sign-in information monitor  generates new integrity metrics in step  to include the effects of the influence. It should be noted, that influence monitor step  may be conducted according to the trust conditions. In other words, only those influences that pertain to the trust conditions are monitored, where the trust conditions may be used as a filter by influence monitor step  in order to reduce costs. The new integrity metrics are then delivered to computing platform CAN  whereby computing platform CAN  measures the difference between trust conditions  and the new integrity metrics. Any differences between trust conditions  and the newly generated sign-in information monitor  are detected in step  and reported by computing platform CAN  in the form of distrust signal  as in step .","An improvement to the prior art trusted platform subsystem of  is exemplified by improved TPS  of  in accordance with the present invention. The operation of Distrust Signal Reporting (DSR) module  has been generally discussed above in relation to . Trust conditions  are received by DSR  via path  from TPA . Hardware and software monitor signals are received from computing platform  via path , whereby sign-in information monitor  receives them and computes the image that reflects the configuration of computing platform . Computing platform CAN  then checks the computed configuration against trust conditions  and stores the result in ROT  via path . If the check does not yield a match, the distrust signal  is generated and sent to TPA  via path . TPA  then transmits the distrust signal to the trustor so that the appropriate action may be taken by the trustor.","Another application where the advantages of the present invention are beneficial is associated with software applications that conform to the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), e.g., MIDlets. MIDP is a set of APIs that define how software applications interface with, for example, mobile terminals and two-way pagers. J2ME is a highly optimized Java runtime environment, where J2ME technology specifically addresses the vast consumer space, which covers the range of extremely tiny commodities such as smart cards or a pager all the way up to the set-top box, an appliance almost as powerful as a computer.","The J2ME architecture defines configurations, profiles, and optional packages as elements for building complete Java runtime environments that meet the requirements for a broad range of devices and target markets. Each combination is optimized for the memory, processing power, and Input\/Output (I\/O) capabilities of a related category of devices. The result is common J2ME platform  as illustrated in  that fully leverages each type of Mobile Information Device (MID)  to deliver a richer user experience. MID  may comprise any one of a mobile phone , PDA , laptop computer , or other device , such as a two-way pager, for example.","Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC)  is a J2ME configuration that is comprised of a virtual machine and a minimal set of class libraries. CLDC  provides the base functionality for a particular range of devices that share similar characteristics, such as network connectivity and memory footprint. CLDC  is designed for MIDs , that operate with intermittent network connections, slow processors, or limited memory.","MIDP  offers the core application functionality required for mobile applications, including the user interface, network connectivity, local data storage, and application management. Combined with CLDC , MIDP  provides a complete Java runtime environment that leverages the capabilities of handheld devices and minimizes both memory and power consumption. J2ME platform  is further extended by combining optional packages  with CLDC  to provide standard APIs for using both existing and emerging technologies, such as Bluetooth, Web Services, wireless messaging, multimedia, and database connectivity.","Kilo Virtual Machine (KVM)  is a complete Java virtual machine that maintains all the aspects of the Java programming language, but runs in a resource constrained device having only a few hundred kilobytes (kB) of memory budget. Several usage models are available for KVM . For example, KVM  may be used on an existing native software stack to give the device the ability to download and run dynamic, interactive, and secure Java content on the device. Alternately, KVM  is used at a lower level to implement the lower level system software and applications of the device in the Java programming language.","MIDP applications, i.e., MIDlet suites, that execute on MID  may be deployed Over the Air (OTA), or conversely, via wired networks to MIDs distributed throughout the network. Mechanisms are provided within the MIDs that allow users to discover MIDlet suites that can be downloaded into the MID. In some cases, discovery of the MIDlet suite is conducted via the MID's resident browser and in other cases, a resident application written specifically to identify MIDlet suites is used.","MIDlet suite discovery and download scenario  is presented in  that depicts MIDlet suite provider  having MIDlet suite  available for download to MID  via network . MID  is a trusted platform design in accordance with the present invention, in which Root Trust (RT) module  of MID  attests Operating System Trust (OST)  to establish the first trust chain link. OST  attests the KVM Trust (KVMT) , CLDC Trust (CLDCT)  and java profile to set up the next trust chain link and complete the trusted Java running platform at MID .","Transfer of MIDlet suite  and its associated Application Descriptor (AD) file to MID  is conducted via path  using, for example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or a session protocol that implements the HTTP functionality including the header and entity fields. Security challenges may be issued by MIDlet suite provider  using, for example, 401 UNAUTHORIZED or 407 PROXY AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED messages, in response to a MIDlet suite request issued by MID  via path . The challenge response, including username and password credentials, may be transmitted by MID  via path  by re-sending the HTTP request with the credentials supplied in the appropriate header fields. Paths  and  may be implemented using wire, e.g., USB, FireWire, or wireless, e.g., WAP, Bluetooth, IR, communication mediums.","In order to install or update the MIDlet suite onto MID , a Java Archive (JAR) file should be created and transmitted by MIDlet suite provider  to MID . The JAR file contains the class files, a manifest file, and any resource files used by the MIDlet suite. In addition according to the present invention, Trust Condition (TC) file  may be included with the JAR file, so that MID  may extract, verify, and register Midlet suite  with the trusted Java platform trust chain - of MID . The registrations of trust conditions may be understood by referring back to , where trust condition , e.g., TC file , is registered with computing platform CAN , residing within MID . The trust conditions are then checked against the current configuration of MID  to ultimately complete the trust chain link to MIDlet Trust (MT)  and MIDlet Provider Trust (MPT) , since any difference between the trusted conditions and the current configuration are reported to MIDlet provider . The TC file  may alternately be included with the AD file, which is provided to the Application Management Software (AMS) executing within MID  for AMS verification as to the MIDlet suite's configuration, such as the MIDlet suite's status, settings, changes, operations on it, etc.","TC file  is preferably described by eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and may be protected by any security measures used for XML if the TC file is expressed in XML.

In step , MID  checks its current trusted configuration state and determines in step  whether a MIDlet installation or upgrade has commenced. If so, then TC  is extracted from MIDlet suite  in step  and registered with computing platform CAN, e.g., , residing within MID  as in step . The computing platform CAN monitors the HW and SW operation at the underlying MID platform in step  and checks it against the trust conditions extracted in step . If a change is detected , MIDlet provider  is notified  via path  according to a provider preferred method. A change may be detected, for example, if after the installation or upgrade of the MIDlet suite, the user of MID  modifies the MIDlet suite for his own purposes, such that the restrictions imposed upon the MIDlet suite by elements \u201cRestrict\u201d in TC file , for example, are violated.","It can be seen, therefore, that the trust chain between MID , e.g., -, and MIDlet provider , e.g., , can be extended through use of the present invention. If, for example, the user of MID  modifies the newly installed MIDlet suite, then through operation of the computing platform CAN , the change is detected and signalled back to the MIDlet provider via the auto warn method exemplified in . In this way, even if the user modifies the MIDlet suite using the provider's correct data for subsequent attestation, the change may be detected and reported back to the MIDlet supplier so that the MIDlet supplier may take the appropriate action.","The above example may be extended to any content provider and its associated content. That is to say that content providers offering any form of software\/digital data such as images, video streams, executables, source code, ring tones, games, etc., that may be provided to any other consumption device may establish conditional trust between the consumption device and the provided content. A trust condition file may be generated by the content provider and provided to a computing platform CAN within the consumption device, such that distrust signals may be generated by the consumption device under distrust conditions. In other words, whenever the consumption device detects, for example, any one of a software status change, a hardware status change, a software setting change, a hardware setting change, a software change, a hardware change, a hardware operation change, an Input\/Output (I\/O) change, and\/or a software operation change with respect to the trusted condition file, the consumption device provides a distrust signal to the content provider, so that the content provider may take the appropriate action.","The foregoing description of the various embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Thus, it is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not with this detailed description, but rather determined from the claims appended hereto."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is described in connection with the embodiments illustrated in the following diagrams.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
