As used herein, \u201cvascular\u201d comprises cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and combinations thereof. The compositions, combinations and treatments of the present invention can be administered by any suitable means which produce contact of these compounds with the site of action in the body, for example in the plasma, liver, small intestine, or brain (e.g., hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia) of a subject (mammal or human or other animal). Such administration includes co-administration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single tablet or capsule having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each therapeutic agent. Also, such administration includes the administration of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment using the combination therapy will provide beneficial effects in treating the condition. A potential advantage of the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a reduction in the required amount of an individual therapeutic compound or the overall total amount of therapeutic compounds that are effective in treating the condition. By using a combination of therapeutic agents, the side effects of the individual compounds can be reduced as compared to a monotherapy, which can improve patient compliance. Also, therapeutic agents can be selected to provide a broader range of complimentary effects or complimentary modes of action.","As discussed above, the compositions, pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention comprise: (a) one or more compounds according to Formula (I) of the present invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or esters thereof; and (b) one or more cholesterol lowering agents.

After the top plate was washed with MeCN (0.5 mL\/well), the plate was removed, the bottom microtiter plate was sealed and then shaken at 25\u00b0 C. for 16 h. The solutions were filtered through a polypropylene frit into a 96-well collection plate. The wells of the top plate were then washed with MeCN (0.5 mL\/well), and the plate removed. The resultant solutions in the collection plate were transferred into vials and the solvent removed in vacuo using a SPEEDVAC. The resulting samples were evaluated by LCMS and those that were >70% pure are shown above.","Table III: Carboxylic Acids Used to Prepare Examples 155-170 and

Non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM CP55,940. For saturation studies, concentrations of H-CP55,940 ranging from 0.1-5 nM were incubated with membranes in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM CP55,940. Assays were terminated after incubation for 1\u00bd hours by rapid filtration onto 0.3% polyethylenamine treated GF\/C filterplates using a BRANDEL cell harvester. The plates were dried and MICROSCINT scintillation cocktail was added, after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a TOPCOUNT scintillation counter.","The dissociation constant (K) of H-CP55,940 at the CBand CBreceptor were determined by plotting specific binding at each concentration of radioligand, and analysis by non-linear regression. For competition studies, the concentration of each drug that inhibited 50 percent of H-CP55,940 binding (IC) was determined by non-linear regression analysis of the radioligand displacement curves. Affinity constants (K) were calculated using the equation derived by Cheng and Prusoff (1973), defined as: IC\/1+[conc. ligand\/K].","GTP\u03b3S Binding Protocol","The functional efficacy of compounds to activate second messengers within the cell was determined utilizing the GTP\u03b3S binding assay. Guanine nucleotides are phosphorylated within the plasma membrane of the cell following binding and activation by agonists. A radiolabelled derivative of guanine triphosphate (GTP) is utilized in this assay as it cannot be dephosphorylated and therefore accumulates following agonist binding. The simultaneous presence of an antagonist into this system will shift the agonist concentration curve to the right, with increasing concentrations of antagonist producing a greater rightward shift in the dose-response curve of the agonist.","Commercially purchased membranes were incubated with 10 mM GDP to allow sufficient substrate for phosphorylation in the presence of agonist. The membranes were then pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound for 30 minutes to determine if they were capable of stimulating phosphorylation alone. Increasing concentrations of the non-selective cannabinoid agonist WIN55,122 were then added in the presence or absence of each concentration of test compound. The assay was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To complete the assay, S-GTP\u03b3S was added and the assay incubated for another 30 minutes. Assays were terminated by rapid filtration onto 10 mM sodium phosphate-treated GF\/C filterplates using a Brandel cell harvester. The plates were dried and Microscint scintillation cocktail was added, after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a Topcount scintillation counter.","The stimulation of S-GTP\u03b3S binding as a function of the concentration of the agonist WIN55,122, in the absence and presence of test compound, was plotted and the ECdetermined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software.
