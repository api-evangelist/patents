{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention relate generally to computing devices and systems, software, computer programs, applications, and user interfaces for identifying acoustic patterns, and more particularly, to determining equivalent portions of audio using spectral characteristics to, for example, synchronize audio and\/or video captured at multiple cameras or different intervals of time.","When editing audio and video captured either by multiple cameras or in multiple takes of the same scene (e.g., with a single audio-video capture device), traditional media editing applications typically operate on the premise that audio portions captured at different cameras angles are coextensive with the captured video, and, thus, align at a common point in time. But this is often not the case. In practice, audio in multiple takes vary due slight variances in delivery, volume, word usage, utterances, etc. For example, the actors can ostensibly deliver the same lines in each take, but they might inevitably differ somewhat in timing. Sometimes they will actually say slightly different things as well, which varies the audio from take to take. Whereas, in multiple camera applications, the spatial arrangement of the cameras, as well as the environment, can also contribute to deviations in audio relative to some point in time. These deviations, which can be as small as a fraction of a second, can lead to two or more captured audio portions being out of synchronization as perceived, for example, by a human listener. Further, the efforts to edit audio and video captured in digitized form are usually exacerbated by the amounts of raw audio and video requiring editing. Specifically, editors typically expend much effort, usually manually, to search through significant amounts of content to find audio that can be synchronized for use in a final product.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","108","102","102","102","1","2","3","110","1","2","3","108","100","104","102"],"i":["a","b","c","a"]},"One common technique for identifying similar video captured at capture devices , , and is to implement time codes associated with each video (or otherwise use some sort of global synchronization signal) to synchronize both the video and audio portions. In particular, a user is usually required to manually adjust the different videos to bring their time codes into agreement. A time code normally describes the relative progression of a video images in terms of an hour, minute, second, and frame (e.g., HH:MM:SS:FR). But a drawback to using time codes to identify similar audio (e.g., to synchronize audio) requires the user to identify different video portions to a particular frame before synchronizing the audio portions. The effort to identify similar audio portions is further hindered due to the number of samples of audio sound that is captured relative to the number of video frames. Typically, for each frame of video (e.g., 30 frames per second), there are 1,600 samples of audio (e.g., 48,000 samples per second). As such, audio portions for capture devices , , and are typically synchronized based on the video portions and their time codes, which can contribute to undesired sound delays and echoing effects. Another common technique for synchronizing the audio (and the video) captured at capture devices , , and is to use a clapper to generate a distinctive sound during the capture of the audio and video. A clapper creates an audible sound\u2014as a reference sound\u2014to synchronize audio during the capture of the audio. The clapper sound is used for editing purposes and would otherwise be discarded during editing. The time codes and clapper sounds thus require effort to ensure their removal as they are intended for editing purposes and are distracting to an audience if time codes remain visible or clapper sounds remain audible in the final product. A drawback to using a clapper as noise  to synchronize audio is that the distance from noise and capture devices , , and can cause delays that hinder synchronization of the audio relating to scene .","It would be desirable to provide improved computing devices and systems, software, computer programs, applications, and user interfaces that minimize one or more of the drawbacks associated with conventional techniques for identifying acoustic patterns to, for example, synchronize either audio or video, or both.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings. Note that most of the reference numerals include one or two left-most digits that generally identify the figure that first introduces that reference number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","210","202","212","222","206","216","226","204","214","224","221","210","211","208","218","228","210","213","213","213","202","212","222","213","213","213","206","216","226","204","214","224","210","208","218","228","208","218","228","206","216","226","210"],"i":["a","b","c ","a","b","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["250","260","262","260","264","264","262","213","213","213","272","274","276","1","280","2","282","3","284","264","273","290","272","274","276","264","204","214","224","272","274","276","260","204","1","208","218","228","2","214","3","224"],"i":["a","b","c "]},"In view of the foregoing, acoustic pattern identifiers  and  of , respectively, can implement spectral characteristics to identify matching audio portions for a variety of applications, including, but not limited to, synchronizing audio and video for producing media, such as movies or videos. In various embodiments, a spectral characteristic can be resistant to additive noise and amplitude variations for audio waveforms that include speech. As such, an acoustic pattern identifier in accordance with at least one embodiment can match audio having different amplitudes due to, for example, different audio being captured at different angles of multiple cameras. The different audio can be affected by differences in tone, background noise, volume, and the like. A spectral characteristic can also facilitate matching audio that can include speech that is spoken at different rates, for example, over multiple takes of the same scene, or with some variants in speech. For example, actors might deliver their lines at different speeds over multiple takes, and they might say different things as well. An actor might say \u201chi dude\u201d in one take, but might say \u201cyeah, hi dude\u201d in another take, with the latter including a variant in speech (i.e., the word \u201cyeah\u201d). As such, an acoustic pattern identifier of at least one embodiment can match audio that includes speech spoken with either different cadences used by an actor over multiple takes of the same scene, or with additions or omissions of utterances and\/or words, such as \u201cuh\u201d spoken in one scene and \u201cah-uh\u201d in another. Further, the use of spectral characteristics reduces the necessity to find similar parts of audio by using either strings of words (e.g., by matching text), or phonemes, which are basic distinctive units of speech sounds that constitute intelligible speech, including words. The computational overhead to implement word-based matching in a speech recognition processes, as well as deviations from the spoken script (e.g., actors deviating from the script and in delivery for each of multiple takes of a scene), can affect the matching of words. Matching phonemes usually require matching phonetic labels or other values representing similar sounds, such as \u201cuh,\u201d \u201coh,\u201d and the like. Phonetic labeling may not provide a sufficient number of possible phonemes, especially when multiple persons speak either serially or concurrently. In addition, the implementation of acoustic pattern identifiers  and  can conserve resources and computational overhead by reducing the need to implement speech recognition hardware and\/or software processes to match words and\/or phonemes for the purposes of finding matching audio portions. Also, the implementation of acoustic pattern identifiers  and  can synchronize at least two portions of the after the two portions of audio are captured.","As used herein, the term \u201cspectral characteristic\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to an attribute characteristic, property, quality or state, of audio (or a portion thereof) that can be used to determine whether two or more portions of audio are either equivalent or are not equivalent. A spectral characteristic can be numeric or otherwise, and can describe\u2014in whole or in part\u2014a portion of audio in terms of, or based on, frequency and\/or power distribution (e.g., over frequencies). In one embodiment, the determination of a spectral characteristic can be either a sufficient step or an intermediary step for generating a spectral signature. In some examples, spectral characteristics can relate to a shape (or pattern) of frequency spectra (e.g., in terms of amplitude and frequency), or can be spectral coefficients. As used herein, the term \u201cspectral signature\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to a sample of a portion of audio that can be expressed in terms of a spectral characteristic, such as a spectral coefficient. In various embodiments, a degree of correlation for spectral signatures among different audio portions can be calculated to determine the similarity between samples of audio portions. As used herein, the term \u201cspectral coefficient\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to a representation of amplitude (e.g., a value indicating acoustic energy) at a specific frequency. Examples of spectral coefficients include Fourier series coefficients, layered (or low energy) coefficients, auto-correlation coefficients, linear prediction coefficients, and the like, as well as cepstral coefficients, such as linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients (\u201cLPCC\u201d), Fast Fourier Transform (\u201cFFT\u201d)-based cepstral coefficients, MEL cepstrum coefficients, and the like.","As used herein, the term \u201cmatched audio portions\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to portions of audio having equivalent (or substantially equivalent) spectral signatures, or spectral coefficient-based measures, such as distances, with which to correlate different spectral signatures. Note that matched audio portions can include variant audio, such as is the case with audio portions captured during multiple takes of the same scene where actors might speak at different rates of speech, interject or omit different words, and the like. Regardless, acoustic pattern identifiers of various embodiments can be configured to correlate audio portions with variant audio to form matched audio portions based on the equivalency of, for example, spectral signatures. As used herein, the term \u201cacoustic pattern\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to the groupings (e.g., sequences) of either spectral signatures or spectral coefficient-based measures, such as distances, or both. Such groupings can indicate matched audio portions. In one embodiment, the magnitude of the spectral coefficient-based measures, such as distances, can be used to determine trough distances, which signify matching audio portions. In a specific embodiment, a relationship (e.g., a linear relationship) between spectral signatures and their distances provide for an acoustic pattern that is indicative of matching audio portions.","As used herein, the term \u201caudio\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to one or more sounds that are audible (e.g., perceived by humans), and can be of or relate to the transmission, storage, reproduction or reception of sound. For example, audio can be in the form of an audio waveform, an audio file, an audio signal, an audio clip, an audio track, and the like. As used herein, the term \u201cvideo\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to one or more images that are visible (e.g., perceived by humans), and can be of or relate to the transmission, storage, reproduction or reception of images. For example, video can be in the form of a video waveform, a video file, a video signal, a video clip, a video track, and the like. As used herein, the term \u201ccontent\u201d refers generally, at least in one embodiment, to information and\/or material presented within a display, an interface, or the like, in relation to, for example, an audio and\/or visual presentation of sounds and\/or imagery. Examples of content include text, such as an electronic document (e.g., a document in Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d)), as well as audio, images, audio\/video media, such as Flash\u00ae presentations, text, and the like. As such, a content file (or media file) can include a digital data file which is composed of images, sound and words for one camera angle. As used herein, the term \u201cpanel,\u201d at least in one embodiment, can refer to displays, palettes, tabs, windows, screens, portions of an interface, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","310","310","320","320","322","324","322","324"]},"To illustrate the operation of spectral signature generator  and a spectral signature correlator , consider the following example. As is shown, spectral signature generator  can be configured to analyze audio (\u201cAudio \u201d)  and audio (\u201caudio \u201d)  to generate arrangements (e.g., vectors) (not shown) of spectral signatures  and , respectively. In particular, spectral signature generator  can generate a spectral signature  at each unit of time, such as spectral signatures SS at i\u22121, SS at i, SS at i+1 for audio , and can generate a spectral signature  at each unit of time, such as spectral signatures SS at j\u22121, SS at j, SS at j+1 for audio . In one embodiment, one spectral signature  and one spectral signature  can be generated at each 1\/100of a second. Spectral signature correlator  can be configured to calculate a correlation (or a degree of correlation) among spectral signatures  and . In one embodiment, spectral signature correlator  can determine a calculated correlation between a specific spectral signature  and a specific spectral signature , whereby groupings of calculated correlations can be indicative of matching audio portions between audio  and audio . In one embodiment, the calculated correlations between spectral signature  and spectral signature  can be distances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["321","323","331","321","325","321","390","392","390","392"]},"In a specific embodiment, spectral coefficient calculator  can be configured to operate as a linear prediction-based cepstral coefficient (\u201cLPCC\u201d) calculator  to characterize portions of audio based on cepstral coefficients, such as linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients. In one example, spectral coefficient calculator  implementing linear prediction-based cepstral coefficient calculator  can generate linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients as follows. One or more of spectral audio matcher , spectral signature generator , and spectral coefficient calculator \u2014either alone or in combination\u2014can digitize audio from either audio file  or audio file , and, in some cases, subdivide the audio into frames over which linear prediction coefficients (\u201cLPCs\u201d) can be generated.","Linear prediction-based cepstral coefficient calculator  can convert the linear prediction coefficients into linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients. In some instances, spectral coefficient calculator  can implement the Levinson-Durbin algorithm, as is known, to generate the linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients. In at least one embodiment, linear prediction-based cepstral coefficient calculator  can calculate linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients in accordance with an inverse z-transform of the logarithm of the spectrum. In some cases, spectral signature generator  can generate a portion of the linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients using at least a frequency domain, with the linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients being in the time domain. In a specific embodiment, linear prediction-based cepstral coefficient calculator  can implement about 14 linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients, which can represent a spectral shape in a level-independent manner. In some instances, the linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients are quantized (or include a degree of quantization) in accordance with a k-means Vector Quantization algorithm\u2014which is known\u2014to form, for example, an 8-bit number to represent a spectral signature.","In one embodiment, spectral coefficient calculator  is configured to generate linear prediction-based cepstral coefficients as spectral signatures at a rate that can be in the fractions of a second, such as one generated linear prediction-based cepstral coefficient per 1\/100of a second. As such, spectral coefficient calculator  can generate 100 spectral signatures\u2014as samples\u2014for one second of audio in audio file  and audio file . Spectral coefficient calculator  provides these spectral signatures to spectral signature correlator , which, in some embodiments, can be configured to calculate correlations among the spectral signatures for audio file  and audio file  to form calculated correlations.","In this example, spectral signature correlator  includes a spectral signature distance engine , a pattern detector , and a pattern parametric manager . In a specific embodiment, spectral signature distance engine  is configured to determine a distance representing a correlation\u2014or a degree of correlation\u2014between multiple spectral signatures from, for example, audio files  and . As such, spectral signature correlator  can determine a distance that is indicative of whether spectral signatures associated with audio file  are equivalent (or substantially equivalent) to spectral signatures associated with audio file . As used herein, the term \u201cdistance,\u201d at least in one embodiment, can refer to any measure that can be used to determine the degree of similarity between two or more spectral signatures.","In one embodiment, spectral signature distance engine  computes a distance from one spectral signature (\u201cSS\u201d) to another spectral signature (\u201cSS\u201d) as follows: Distance=Distance+log(1+sqrt((SS\u2212SS)^2)), for summation over \u201cN\u201d coefficients. Further, SS=[Ceps()\u2212means()]\/std(i), and SS=[Ceps()\u2212means()]\/std(j), where Ceps() is the icoefficient for audio file , means() is the imean for audio file , std(i) is the istandard deviation, Ceps() is the jcoefficient for audio file , means() is the jmean for audio file , std(j) is the jstandard deviation.","Pattern parametric manager , among other things, is configured to manage the determination of whether a specific distance is sufficient to deem two spectral signatures as being associated with the same portion of audio (or substantially so). For example, pattern parametric manager  can set a threshold below which a distance is sufficiently short enough for corresponding spectral signatures to be considered as being part of the same portion of audio. In some cases, this threshold is referred to as a trough distance.","Pattern detector  can be configured to detect whether a pattern of spectral signatures\u2014or any other spectral characteristic\u2014an be determined, whereby a pattern (i.e., an acoustic pattern) can be indicative of whether matching portions of audio can be identified. In one embodiment, pattern detector  can operate to detect patterns in which the distances for the portions of the audio are substantially coextensive to, for example, a linear relationship. That is, the distances indicating a match for the portions of the audio track each other as time linearly progresses (e.g., for each 1\/100of a second) for both audio files  and . Detected patterns can be output as matched audio portion(s).","Optionally, spectral audio matcher  can provide the matched audio portion (or identifiers thereof) to audio\/video synchronizer  to synchronize audio and\/or video at a synchronization point. In one embodiment, audio\/video synchronizer  includes a cross-correlator  that is configured to perform a cross-correlation operation for synchronization purposes. The cross-correlation operation can implement known statistics to use cross-correlation to measure the similarity of two signals. Further, if the audio files in audio files  and  are offset from each other in relation to time, then the cross-correlation operation can figure out the offset for aligning\u2014or synchronizing\u2014audio files  and . In one embodiment, cross-correlator  correlates audio in a 1 second interval for each of audio files  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3B"],"b":["400","402","410","422","0","1","2","420","0","1","2","411","8","1","7","2","404","404","414","412","414","412","404","390","392"]},"An acoustic pattern identifier implementing spectral signature distance engine  and pattern detector  can determine matching audio portions for audio captured during multiple takes of the same scene, according to at least one embodiment of the invention. To illustrate, consider the following in which two different people are interacting with each other. In this case, first grouping  can relate to audio (i.e., speech) generated by a first person, whereby second grouping  can relate to audio generated by a second person.","Note that second grouping  begins approximately after first grouping  finishes at S (of the X-axis). As such, the two persons speak in substantially a consecutive, non-overlapping fashion. Further, the timing between the two audio files is fairly synchronized as evidenced by, for example, the equivalent duration for first grouping , which spans 5 units of time in both audio  (e.g., S to S) of the X-axis and audio  (e.g., S to S) of the Y-axis. Audio files  and  can have a higher degree of synchronization should audio  begin at S of the Y-axis (not shown), which would be in synchronicity with audio  beginning at S of the X-axis.","Note, too, that the speech delivered in both audio  and audio  relating to first grouping  is shown to be spoken at approximately the same speed. For purposes of discussion, consider that the slope of a linear relationship coextensive with a diagonal line (not shown) defined by first grouping  is 45 degrees. In cases where audio  is delivered more slowly than audio , then one would expect the slope of the linear relationship to increase over 45 degrees because audio , which otherwise covers 5 units of time, would be extended to, for example, 6-8 units of time (not shown). The opposite can be true for cases in which audio  is delivered more quickly than audio .","Moreover, consider an instance in which the first person adds or omits utterances or speech in audio  relative to audio . While spectral signature distance engine  might generate some distances that are not within a trough distance (i.e., indicating mismatches in audio) for some samples (or spectral signatures) due to, for example, an omitted \u201cuh\u201d sound, pattern detector  can nevertheless operate to determine a pattern, such as first grouping , based on a tolerance for such variances in speech.","Note further that in some instances in which multiple people speak at the same time, such as in a situation in which two people in a coffee shop each give an exact, same order for coffee at the same time. Since their speech overlaps each other, spectral signature distance engine  might generate distances that may or may not be associated with higher values of distances (e.g., signifying less of a match). But pattern detector  can nevertheless operate to determine a pattern based on a tolerance for such variances in speech and\/or spectral signatures. In view of the foregoing example, an acoustic pattern identifier can match audio portions for first grouping  regardless of the differences in the rate of speech or audio between audio  and audio , as well as the differences in utterances or speech (i.e., different portions of speech) in audio  relative to audio .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","500","506","500","508","500","509","500","510","500","514"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","606","608","610","612","614","616","618","618","618"]},"According to some examples, computer system  performs specific operations in which processor  executes one or more sequences of one or more instructions stored in system memory .
