{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to the field of image processing and, more specifically, to techniques for universally correcting blockiness with a low million instructions per second (MIPs).","Blockiness is one of the most noticeable artifacts introduced by block-based video and image coding. The reasons behind the blockiness is that the block-based coding uses a block (e.g. 8\u00d78 or 4\u00d74) as a basic unit, for transformation, quantization and texture coding, and the inter-block correlation, is lost during this coding. The problem is especially severe when video\/image content is coded at very low bit rates (high quantization step size qp). For intra macroblocks (MBs), the blocking artifacts are visible only around block boundaries. However for inter MBs, the motion compensation may bring the artifacts inside the blocks. The blocking artifacts coming from the reference frames is termed \u201cinherited blockiness\u201d because the blockiness is inherited from previous frames. The inherited blockiness may be visible at any location and have any length.","There are two types of approaches to address the inherited blockiness issue. A first approach is to exploit long-tap filtering on all pixels in order to smooth out artifacts because the inherited blockiness may appear anywhere. The first approach employs the DC offset mode defined in the motion picture expert group (MPEG)-4 standard, in which a 9-tap filtering is applied on all eight neighboring pixels around a block edge. The second approach traces the moving trajectory of the blockiness and applies DB on the moved artifacts.","The second approach has been proved to be an effective tool to remove inherited blockiness, the MIPs requirement for deblocking a 30 frames per second (fps) VGA image is too high for mobile or wireless applications.","Using a H.264 hardware deblocker (DB) as a post-loop deblocker for MPEG-4 and Wireless Media Video 9 series (WMV9) is known. However, in the past, the post-loop deblocker only filters the pixels around 8\u00d78 blocks, so the inherited blockiness still remains. Furthermore, the filtering strength, for skipped MBs and coded block pattern (CBP) 0 blocks, is not strong enough. The standard practice always sets BS for an inter MB as two or less (unless the neighboring MB is of intra).","There is therefore a need for techniques to universally correct blockiness, including inherited blockiness, with a low million instructions per second (MIPs).","Techniques to universally correct blockiness with a low million instructions per second (MIPs) are described herein. In one configuration, a device comprising a processor operative to implement a set of instructions to commandeer an in-loop deblocking filtering engine and to universally correct blockiness in a decoded output signal during a post-loop filtering operation using the in-loop deblocking filtering engine is provided. The device also includes a memory coupled to the processor.","In another aspect, an integrated circuit comprising a decoder having an in-loop deblocking filtering engine is provided. The integrated circuit also includes a processor operative to implement a set of instructions to commandeer the in-loop deblocking filtering engine and to universally correct blockiness in a decoded output signal during a post-loop filtering operation using the in-loop deblocking filtering engine. The integrated circuit further includes a memory coupled to the processor.","In a still further aspect, a computer program product including a computer readable medium having instructions for causing a computer to commandeer an in-loop deblocking filtering engine is provided. The instructions further cause the computer to universally correct blockiness in a decoded output signal during a post-loop filtering operation using the in-loop deblocking filtering engine.","Additional aspects will become more readily apparent from the detailed description, particularly when taken together with the appended drawings.","The images in the drawings are simplified for illustrative purposes and are not depicted to scale. To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures, except that suffixes may be added, when appropriate, to differentiate such elements.","The appended drawings illustrate exemplary configurations of the invention and, as such, should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention that may admit to other equally effective configurations. It is contemplated that features or steps of one configuration may be beneficially incorporated in other configurations without further recitation.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any configuration or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other configurations or designs, and the terms \u201ccore\u201d, \u201cengine\u201d, \u201cmachine\u201d, \u201cprocessor\u201d and \u201cprocessing unit\u201d are used interchangeably.","The techniques described herein may be used for wireless communications, computing, personal electronics, etc. An exemplary use of the techniques for wireless communication is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"The wireless device  is capable of providing bi-directional communications via a receive path and a transmit path. On the receive path, signals transmitted by base stations are received by an antenna  and provided to a receiver (RCVR) . The receiver  conditions and digitizes the received signal and provides samples to a digital section  for further processing. On the transmit path, a transmitter (TMTR)  receives data to be transmitted from the digital section , processes and conditions the data, and generates a modulated signal, which is transmitted via the antenna  to the base stations.","The digital section  includes various processing, interface and memory units such as, for example, a modem processor , a video processor , a controller\/processor , a display processor , an ARM\/DSP , a graphics processing unit (GPU) , an internal memory , and an external bus interface (EBI) . The modem processor  performs processing for data transmission and reception (e.g., encoding, modulation, demodulation, and decoding). The video processor  performs processing on video content (e.g., still images, moving videos, and moving texts) for video applications such as camcorder, video playback, and video conferencing. The controller\/processor  may direct the operation of various processing and interface units within digital section . The display processor  performs processing to facilitate the display of videos, graphics, and texts on a display unit . The ARM\/DSP  may perform various types of processing for the wireless device . The graphics processing unit  performs graphics processing.","The techniques described herein may be used for any of the processors in the digital section , e.g., the video processor . The internal memory  stores data and\/or instructions for various units within the digital section . The EBI  facilitates the transfer of data between the digital section  (e.g., internal memory ) and a main memory  along a bus or data line DL.","The digital section  may be implemented with one or more DSPs, micro-processors, RISCs, etc. The digital section  may also be fabricated on one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or some other type of integrated circuits (ICs).","The techniques described herein may be implemented in various hardware units. For example, the techniques may be implemented in ASICs, DSPs, RISCs, ARMs, digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, and other electronic units.","Furthermore, the techniques described herein to remove blockiness\/artifacts introduced by video coding can be used for MPEG-4, H.263, WMV9 and H.264 standards. As can be seen from the description below, the advantage of these techniques is that annoying inherited artifacts are removed at a very low cost such as 2.5-4 million instructions per second (MIPs). The requirements for the new post-loop de-artifact\/blocker (DAB) apparatus  for a low complexity configuration with almost 0% CPU usage for an ARM and reasonable DSP MIPs can be achieved with no module put in an ARM, and with no pixel access. Moreover, the real filtering is performed in DSP.","In the exemplary configuration, the only filter used is the H.264 in-loop deblocker (DB) because it is built in hardware (HW).
