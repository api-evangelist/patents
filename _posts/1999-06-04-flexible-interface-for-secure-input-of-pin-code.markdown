title: Flexible interface for secure input of pin code
abstract: The present invention concerns a system () and a process for authenticating a PIN code of a user in an interactive information system in order to run an application. It comprises input means () for PIN code entry, security manager means () for comparing the PIN code of the user upon a request for user authentication from the application, with a registered PIN code, and giving authorization to run said application if the PIN code of the user matches with the registered PIN code, and display means () for displaying any graphics including a PIN entry field. The request for user authentication is provided on the display means via the PIN entry field with the look and feel of said application. The system further comprises emitting means for entering crypted digits, the security manager means () being arranged to give authorisation to run the application after full entry of said crypted digits and if the PIN code of the user is identical to the registered PIN code.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention is related to interfaces between man and machine such as computer, telephone or television devices, which need a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to authenticate the user running an application.","By running an application, one should understand to continue or to have access to an application or to specific resources of an application.","The invention is more particularly but not exclusively related to a system and a method used in an interactive information system such as an entertainment system.","Requirements for security in interactive entertainment systems are contradictory.","This is because, in order to run an application, an authentication of the user\/viewer is needed while using the specific look and feel of the application.","However, it is also preferred that the PIN code should not be given to the application for security purpose.","In fact, two types of solutions are presently known for authentication. Both present drawbacks, as they are only capable of fulfilling part of the above requirements.","Either the application presents its own user interface for PIN entry, then queries the underlying system to check if the given PIN is correct.","This solution does not hide the PIN code from the application.","Or the application requests the underlying system to authenticate the viewer. For this the underlying system, using its own look and feel, prompts the viewer for its PIN, verifies its validity and then returns the information that the viewer is authorised or not to the application.","This solution is safe, but does not allow integration of the PIN entry with the application look and feel.","In other words and referring to , it is shown a system which presents a good look and feel, but which is not safe, as the PIN code is known by the application.","More precisely, the application  has total control of the look and feel.","The viewer provides his PIN code through input means  in digital data to the application via an input device, for instance transmitted as infrared signals  to the device on which runs the application which displays in  the look and feel for the PIN entry field.","Such application, which is now aware of the PIN code, transmits it in  to security manager means  which, after checking, confirms in  authorisation from the system .","The PIN code (Input means ) is therefore provided outside of the system , which is unsecured, and may allows third parties to have access to the PIN code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Here, the application  has no control over the look and feel, contrarily to the precedent case.","The application  requests in  the system  to identify the user.","The security manager means  uses the input means  (PIN Code), provided in  and the display screen to create in  a display of the PIN entry field.","When the security manager means  has checked the PIN code, it gives authorisation () to display or to access to resource to the application .","On a security point of view this system is good as, at no point, the system  gives out the PIN code to the application.","However, the look and feel is here totally under system control, without any consideration for the current application look and feel.","It is therefore a main object of the present invention to provide an improved system and method for authorising a secure way of authentication for an access to an application through a PIN code while using the look and feel of said application during the PIN code interrogation.","It is another object of the invention to provide an improved system and method wherein the safety needed for PIN code entry, is combined with perfect integration of the prompt with the service.","It is another objet of the invention to provide a simple and cost saving flexible interface for secure input of a PIN code.","The problems outlined above are in large part solved by a system for authenticating a PIN code of a user in an interactive information system, in order to run an application which comprises:","input means for PIN code entry,","security manager means for comparing the PIN code of the user, upon a request for user authentication from the application, with a registered PIN code, and giving authorisation to run said application if said PIN code of the user matches the registered PIN code,","and display means for displaying any graphics including a PIN entry field,","characterised in that","the request for user authentication being provided on the display means via the PIN entry field with the look and feel of said application, the system further comprises emitting means for entering crypted digits in said PIN entry field upon entering the PIN code of the user in the security manager means through said input means,\n\nand the security manager means are arranged to give authorisation to run the application after full entry of said crypted digits and if the PIN code of the user is identical to the registered PIN code.\n","With such system the PIN code remains hidden from the environment, the user having only the impression to enter physically his PIN code within the PIN entry field of the application. In fact, it remains in the security manager means, which is within the system.","In a preferred embodiment the application is a television program.","The invention also provides a method for authenticating a PIN code of a user in an interactive information system, in order to run an application, wherein said information system emits a request for authenticating a user,","said user enters a PIN code through input means, said PIN code of the user is compared with a registered PIN code, within security manager means,","and authorisation is provided to run said application if the PIN code of the user matches with the registered PIN code,","characterised in that","the request for authenticating being provided with a PIN entry field having the look and feel of the is application,","crypted digits are entered in said PIN entry field, upon entering the PIN code by the user in the security manager means,","and authorisation to display the application is only provided after full entry of said crypted digits, and if the PIN code signal of the user is identical to the registered PIN code as checked by the security manager means.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","11"]},"The application  initiates a PIN entry request  to authenticate the user request and simultaneously asks the security manager means  to handle key input  to be introduced through Input means , for instance through a key pad.","The security manager means  comprises a small computer system including a central processing unit (CPU), memory and local storage.
