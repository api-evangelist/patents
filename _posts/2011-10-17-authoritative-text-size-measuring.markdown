{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to rendering text on an computing device and in particular to rendering text in collaborative document processing systems.","Traditionally, the viewing and editing of electronic documents\u2014such as word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations\u2014was done using specific software applications installed on a computing device. Recently, online document processing applications have been developed which makes it possible for people to create these documents without having document processing software specially installed. These online applications provide access to the document processing features through an Internet browser. The actual documents are stored on the application server, but may be downloaded locally to a client computing device. Because the documents are stored centrally and are accessed via an Internet browser, it is possible for multiple people to view, edit, and share the document regardless of the hardware and software capabilities of the computing device they are using.","The appearance of the same text in an electronic document may differ from one computing device to another. In particular, the appearance of the same text may differ among various Internet browsers. For example, the height or width of the characters may be different or the line breaks may occur at different points in the text. There are several reasons for these differences. Browsers may have different versions of the same font installed. Browsers may also use different algorithms for kerning (determining the amount of space between characters), layout, sizing, or rendering. Furthermore, some browsers may engage in sub-pixel rendering if the display screen of the computing device allows.","In online document processing applications, uniform appearance of text is important. If the size and line breaks of the text do not appear the same across different computing devices, it can cause confusion among different users who view or edit the document from different computing devices. Current solutions to the uniform text rendering problem generally have relied on having the same display or rendering program installed in each computing device.","It is preferable to find a solution that can display text uniformly regardless of the hardware or software capabilities of the computing device. Systems and methods are disclosed herein for rendering text on a client computing device by a server. In one aspect, a computerized method includes sending text from a server to the client computing device for rendering and receiving at the server initial text formatting information from the client computing device. The method further includes generating revised text formatting information on the server and sending the revised text formatting information from the server to the client computing device for re-rendering of the text in accordance with the revised text formatting information.","In another aspect, a computerized method for displaying a document on a plurality of client computing devices by a server includes sending the document from the server to the plurality of client computing devices and receiving initial text formatting information at the server from a first client computing device in the plurality of client computing devices. The method further includes generating revised text formatting information on the server for the first client computing device in the plurality of client computing devices and sending the revised text formatting information from the server to the first client computing device in the plurality of client computing devices for re-rendering of the document so that the document text appears substantially the same on each client computing device.","In another aspect, a system for displaying a document on a plurality of client computing devices includes a server. The server is configured to send the document to the plurality of client computing devices, receive initial text formatting information from each client computing device, generate revised text formatting information for each client computing device, and send the revised text formatting information to each client computing device for re-rendering of the document so that the document text appears substantially the same on each client computing device.","In another aspect, a computerized method for re-rendering text on a client computing device by a server includes receiving initial text formatting information at the server from the client computing device. The method further includes generating revised text formatting information on the server and sending the revised text formatting information from the server to the client computing device for re-rendering of the text in accordance with the revised text formatting information.","In another aspect, a computerized method for server-side rendering of text on a client computing device includes receiving text from the server on the client computing device, generating initial text formatting information on the client computing device, and sending the initial text formatting information to the server. The method further includes receiving revised text formatting information from the server and re-rendering the text in accordance with the revised text formatting information.","To provide an overall understanding of the invention, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described, including systems and methods for displaying a document on a plurality of client computing devices by a server. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein may be adapted and modified as is appropriate for the application being addressed and that the systems and methods described herein may be employed in other suitable applications, and that such other additions and modifications will not depart from the scope thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","103","109","103","105","107","109","100","101","100","101","100","101","101","101"]},"The server in client-server system  will now be discussed in greater detail.  depicts a server  which includes a processor , input and output devices , a communications interface , read-only memory (ROM) , random access memory (RAM) , database , and bus . The bus  enables every component in server  to electronically communicate with each other. Input\/output devices  may include a keyboard, mouse, display screen, touchpad, speakers, or any other compatible input or output device. Communications interface  may be a network connection, Internet connection, or any other type of electronic communication component. In one embodiment, the communications interface  can communicate with multiple client computing devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, and handheld devices. Database  can store electronic documents that can be accessed by clients through communications interface .","Processor  may be configured to perform tasks such as sending electronic documents stored in database  to multiple client computing devices using communications interface , receiving edits to electronic documents stored in database  from client computing devices, and generating text formatting information to be displayed on client computing devices. Processor  may be configured to ensure that documents stored in database  and distributed to different computing devices will have uniform appearance of text across the client computing devices.","Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from RAM or ROM or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data, such as database , include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.","The interaction of a client computing device and the server will now be discussed.  depicts a client-server system process flow chart. In some embodiments, server  in  is similar to server  depicted in . Client formatting logic unit , client formatting cache , server response handler , server formatting cache , and display unit  are found on the client computing device. The client computing device, through an Internet browser, can request the display of an electronic document stored on server . In order for the computing device to display the text of the document, the client formatting logic unit  generates initial text formatting information and displays the rendered text on display . The initial text formatting information may also be stored on client formatting cache . Client formatting logic unit  also sends the initial text formatting information and a server formatting request to server . Server  generates revised text formatting information based on the client's request and sends the formatting data to server response handler . Server response handler  receives the revised text formatting information from server  and sends a render request to display  to re-render the text according to the server instructions. The revised text formatting information may also be stored on server formatting cache  so that if the computing device renders the same segment of text in the future, it can use the information stored in server formatting cache  rather than sending another formatting request to the server. As described in relation to , server  controls the formatting of text on the computing device and thus can render text uniformly regardless of the specific hardware and software capabilities of the computing device.","Methods of operation of the server in the client-server system are now discussed.  is a flow chart depicting a method  for rendering text on a client computing device by a server. Method  includes sending a segment of text from a server to a client computing device, receiving initial text formatting information from the computing device, generating revised text formatting information on the server, and sending the revised text formatting information to the client computing device. In some embodiments, the server that performs method  is similar to the server in client-server system depicted in  or the server depicted in . Method  begins by the server sending a segment of text to a computing device in step . This step may be in response to a request by the computing device to view an electronic document stored on the server. The server sends the computing device the electronic document, including all the text within the document for display on the computing device. Communication between the server and the computing device may be effectuated by an Internet connection or other form of electronic communication.","After the server sends a segment of text to the computing device, the computing device uses local formatting information stored on the computing device to produce initial text formatting information. This initial text formatting information may include the width and height of each character, the location of line-breaks within the text, or text styling information (e.g. italics, underline). The initial text formatting information may pertain to an individual character, entire words, prefixes of words, or any other grouping of text. The computing device sends the initial text formatting information to the server in step .","When the server receives the initial text formatting information from the computing device, the server generates revised text formatting information in step . In some embodiments, the server uses Java or 2-D application programming interface (API) programs to generate the revised text formatting information. The server generates the revised text formatting information to ensure a uniform appearance of the text if the text was displayed on multiple computing devices. Thus the revised text formatting information may have different widths and heights for characters than in the initial text formatting information or may change the location of line-breaks within the text. In some embodiments, the revised text formatting information may be the same as the initial text formatting information, indicating that the computing device has already correctly rendered the text. In some embodiments, the server has a cache that stores revised text formatting information for retrieval in case a computing device requests formatting information for the same text segment.","After the server generates the revised text formatting information, the server sends this information to the computing device in step . Once the computing device receives the revised text formatting information, it can re-render any segments of text where the revised text formatting information differs from the initial text formatting information. In some embodiments, the revised text formatting information is stored in a cache on the computing device. If the same piece of text is re-rendered at a later time, the computing device can retrieve the revised text formatting information from its cache rather than communicating with the server again. Thus method  enables a server to control the rendering of text on a computing device to ensure uniform appearance of text across a variety of computing devices.","Next, methods of rendering documents on multiple computing devices using a server are discussed.  is a flow chart depicting a method of displaying a document on a plurality of client computing devices by a server. Method  includes sending a document from the server to a plurality of client computing devices, receiving initial text formatting information from a computing device in the plurality of computing devices, generating revised text formatting information for the computing device, and sending the revised text rendering information to the computing device. In some embodiments, the system that performs method  is similar to the client-server system depicted in  or , and the server in method  may be similar to the server depicted in . Method  begins by the server sending a document to a plurality computing devices in step . This step may be in response to a request by a plurality of computing devices to view the document stored on the server. The requests to view the document by the plurality of computing devices do not have to occur at the same time. The server can handle asynchronous requests by computing devices to view the document. The server sends each of the computing devices the same electronic document, including all the text within the document for display on each computing device. Communication between the server and the plurality of computing devices may be effectuated by an Internet connection or other form of electronic communication.","After the server sends the document to each computing device, the computing devices uses local rendering information stored on each of the computing devices to produce initial text formatting information. This initial text formatting information may include the width and height of each character, the location of line-breaks within the text, or text styling information. The initial text formatting information may pertain to an individual character, entire words, prefixes of words, or any other grouping of text. Each computing device sends its initial text formatting information to the server in step .","When the server receives the initial text formatting information from a computing device in the plurality of computing devices, the server generates revised text formatting information for the computing device in step . In some embodiments, the server uses Java or 2-D application programming interface (API) programs to generate the revised text formatting information. The revised text formatting information may have different widths and heights for characters or may change the location of line-breaks within the text. The server generates the revised text formatting information to ensure a uniform appearance of the text across the plurality of computing devices. Thus the revised text formatting information generated by the server for the same segment of text should be the same for all computing devices. For some computing devices, the revised text formatting information may be the same as the initial text formatting information, indicating that the computing device has already correctly rendered the text. In some embodiments, the server has a cache that stores revised text formatting information for retrieval in case another computing device requests formatting information for the same text segment.","After the server generates the revised text formatting information, the server sends this information to the computing device in step . Once the computing device receives the revised text formatting information, it can re-render any segments of text where the revised text formatting information differs from the initial text formatting information. In some embodiments, the revised text formatting information is stored in a cache on the computing device. If the same piece of text is re-rendered at a later time, the computing device can retrieve the revised text formatting information from its cache rather than communicating with the server again. Thus method  enables a server to control the rendering of text on a plurality of computing devices to ensure uniform appearance of text.","It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that aspects of the invention, as described above, may be implemented in many different forms of software, firmware, and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures.
