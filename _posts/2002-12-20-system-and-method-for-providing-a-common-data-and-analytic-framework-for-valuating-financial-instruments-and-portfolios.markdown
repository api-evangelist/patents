{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/342,848, filed on Dec. 28, 2001, hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a system and method for providing a data and analytic platform for valuing financial instruments.","Economic parameters cause the value of the financial instruments, such as mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, to fluctuate. Therefore, financial institutions, such as banks and brokerage firms, regularly have to determine the value of financial instruments. The processing and time requirements necessary to perform these valuations are substantial. Moreover, it is important to fit a model to the underlying economic parameter so that the financial institution is able to manage the risk of its portfolio by determining the likely range of future prices and value at risk, among other variables.","Therefore, financial institutions generally apply simulation models to a financial instrument or collections of instruments. These simulation models are usually complex algorithms commonly implemented in a computer programming language. A financial institution may have multiple applications that require analytic results generated by the same simulation model or similar simulation models. Although multiple applications within the institution may use the same model, the code that provides the functionality for the simulation model is typically embedded within each application. Moreover, the model in each application is often coded with incompatible computer programming languages and\/or data structures. Thus, a user of a first application often is not able to use the same model code from the first application in a second application. This approach is inefficient in that it requires that the same simulation model be coded multiple times in different applications within the same institution and does not allow for simulation model codes to be reused across the various applications.","Another approach, which results in an inflexible data framework, requires expensive external coordination and integration relationships. With this approach, financial institutions utilize an enterprise-wide integrated application solution, such as Oracle, and\/or SAS running on an IBM mainframe, from an external vendor. All modeling applications in the enterprise-wide solution are coded using the same data structures. Although this approach provides a common data framework, it requires that all previously used modeling applications be standardized. This, in turn, may constrain the flexibility of the previously used data framework(s) in the financial institution.","In addition to valuing individual financial instruments, many financial institutions also are often required to rapidly assess large portfolios containing multiple financial instruments. However, many financial institutions do not employ comprehensive distributive processing techniques in their financial instrument valuation. Given the complexity of simulation models that assess large portfolios, the institution's enterprise-wide computer processing resources may be significantly drained and may result in inefficiencies in information and resource sharing. Therefore, the enterprise-wide application approach does not only reduce flexibility in the institution's data framework, it precludes optimal use of network resources when solving large complex resource intensive calculations.","The present invention relates to a distributed system that provides a common data and analytic model platform for enabling users of different applications to evaluate financial instruments. The system includes multiple user applications, and a computer network with multiple analytic servers, each of which includes simulation models for evaluating the financial instruments. The computer network also includes components that accept requests from the user applications, executes each request against an appropriate simulation model and returns results from the simulation model to the user application.","Specifically, the computer network includes at least one enterprise server, at least one computational server cluster, and at least one file server. Each enterprise server receives requests from the user application and is a high availability server responsible for splitting up requests into independent tasks. In embodiments of the invention where the computer network includes multiple enterprise servers, the computer network also includes at least one load balancer to distribute requests between the enterprise servers. Each enterprise server forwards requests from user application(s) to one or more computational server cluster that provides specialized processing capabilities for executing simulation models and includes at least one analytic server that executes the simulation models. In a preferred embodiment, each analytic server processes one task at a time and includes at least one simulation library, at least one simulation algorithm for implementing requests against the simulation library, and at least one application interface. Requests and other data used in the system are stored in the file server(s) that includes storage media for storing information, such as programming code and data.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the system and method particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawing. The present invention described below extends the functionality of the inventive system and method for providing a common analytic and data framework for valuing mortgages and mortgage portfolios.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","106","108","110","102","106","106"]},"According to the invention, user applications  communicate valuation requests to enterprise server . Each enterprise server  is a high availability server that is responsible for splitting up clients' requests into independent tasks and serves as a gateway from the user application to simulation model(s) that evaluate the financial instruments. Enterprise server  forwards each task to one or more computational server cluster . Each computational server cluster  provides specialized processing capabilities for executing simulation models by including at least one workstation and\/or multi-processor server. Each workstation and\/or multi-processor server executes and\/or is in communications with one or more analytic servers  that include simulation models for evaluating the financial instruments. According to the invention, each analytic server  can process only one task at a time and each analytic server  is also capable of working on multiple versions of software applications and on different versions of a simulation model.","System  also includes multiple file servers  that each includes storage media for storing a copy of the programming code and data used in the invention. File servers  also include a plurality of databases for storing data structures used in the inventive system. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, both the programming code and data are stored in a static state and multiple historical versions of the programming code and data are kept on file server . Various components of system  may access the programming code and data on file servers . As would be obvious to one skilled in the art, the programming code and data also may be stored on other storage media in other parts of LAN  and synchronization utilities may be used to ensure that the programming codes and data stored in various locations are consistent. In a preferred embodiment, each enterprise server  also includes a local copy of the programming code and synchronization utilities ensure that the programming code on file servers  and enterprise server  are consistent.","As is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, LAN  may be further configured with suitable hardware and software, such as mainframes, PCs, and Internet capability to perform the functions of the present invention.","The inventive system is specifically configured to receive a financial instrument valuation request for evaluating one or more financial instruments. LAN  processes the request against a selected simulation model and provides a result to the user. Thus, system  provides a common data and analytic model platform that allows the user, regardless of the application being used, to access and execute the necessary simulation model(s) required by a requesting application .","Each user application  serves as a front end to LAN  by enabling users to submit a financial instrument valuation request, invoke various services on LAN  and view result based on the request. As is apparent to one skilled in the art, user application  may be any application related to evaluating a financial instrument. For example, the user application  may be a transaction application for determining whether a dealer call for a particular financial instrument is reasonably priced. User application  may submit the valuation request in a security mode or a portfolio mode. In the security mode, user application  submits one task at a time and waits for the results. In the portfolio mode, user application  submits a set of tasks at one time. The system immediately returns control of user application  to the user and notifies the user when all tasks are completed. The system may preferably notify the user by e-mail, although it should be apparent that other notification means may be used. Enterprise server  monitors all valuation requests received by LAN , uses the request to determine the appropriate simulation model(s) to be executed, and distributes requests to one or more components in the system in order to efficiently use the network's resources. When more than one enterprise server  is implemented in the system, and one enterprise server  fails or is busy, another enterprise server  may take over and assume responsibilities for the distributed processing requirements of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","202","206","202","200","200","204","200","206","206"]},"Valuation request  may further include one or more optional information fields  for specifying information, such as the location of the simulation model to be used, and the priority of request , among others. For example, if the user is aware that a new model is available to the system, the user may specify the location of the model on the system. In this manner, the present invention is adapted to be a \u201cplug and play\u201d modeling system. The user may also specify, in the request, whether or not to aggregate results from the simulation model(s) and whether the results will be stored in a database. In a preferred embodiment, however, LAN  receives the valuation request from the user, determines the appropriate simulation model(s) to be executed, and distributes the tasks associated with the request and the associated processing requirements within the network according to parameters that allow for the most efficient use of the network. Thereafter, the appropriate model(s) are executed, the results are determined and then returned to the user. Valuation requests  may be real time or batch request and they are highly scalable, thereby enabling the reuse of the same resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3010","104","200","106","3020","106","200","200","108","3030","108","106","112","106","108","112","3040","112","104","108","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["112","112","402","404","406","402","408","404","402","408","404","100","408","406","404","112","406"]},"Specifically, upon receiving each a request, each analytic server  includes a module  for parsing the request from user application into at least one algorithm . Analytic server  also determines the dependence between different calculations to be implemented in the request and parses the request into optimal calculations by caching previous calculation in the requests and dynamically reviewing the results from the previous calculations to determine optimal manner for executing each upcoming calculation. Thereafter, analytic server  executes each calculation in the request in the most optimal manner. Depending on the request, analytic server  may substitute results from calculations into the original request and send back the substitution to the requesting application. Based on the request, each analytic server  is able to store the results in at least one database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 500"],"b":["502","504","506","502","112","504","508","110","506","510","110"]},"Market server  extracts market data from market information database  in file servers  to be used during execution of the simulation model(s). Market information database  stores information, historical data, and factual data related to financial markets, such as but not limited to, the interest rate and stock prices. Therefore, the market server may be used to provide a real-time snapshot of a particular market or a virtual snapshot of a market based on modified information. Data server  is in communication with valuation information database  in file server . Valuation information database  stores financial instrument valuation requests , valuation results, and analytical model calculations. For example, valuation information database  may store two different sets of results from a particular analytical model and associated input values. Data server  may further be used to generate new requests  and populate valuation database  with new results. Thus, data server  is adapted to generate useful valuation information and allow for testing by monitoring how results change using different input parameters and models. As is obvious to one skilled in the art, other specialized servers and\/or databases may be included in the invention.","The foregoing description has been directed to specific embodiments of this invention. It will be apparent, however, that other variations and modifications may be made to the described embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of their advantages.
