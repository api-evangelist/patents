Field of the Invention","The embodiments of this invention generally relate to the synthesis of nanoscale objects, and more particularly to the synthesis of nanoparticles.","2. Description of the Related Art","Nanoscale objects with size of several hundred nanometers or less have promising potential in optic, electronic, magnetic, and catalytic applications. Progression in the production of monodisperse noble metal (Au, Ag, Pt and Pd), semiconducting, and magnetic nanoparticles has provided various systems suitable for nanooptic, nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic studies in mapping the scaling limits of future information technology, understanding spin-dependent transport phenomena, and using nanoparticles as highly sensitive labels (both magnetic and optic) for bio-recognition.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,123,920 and 6,203,777, the complete disclosures of which, in their entireties, are herein incorporated by reference, have suggested that nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 20 nm are ideal for biomedical applications. These small nanoparticles can in principle allow only one or several biomolecules, especially DNA strands, to attach and may be used as easily identified labels for future highly sensitive biomolecule separation and detection. Additionally, noble metal nanoparticles, especially Au nanoparticles, can be used for site-specific attachment of biomolecules, such as DNA strands, by using the high affinity of Au to a thiol group (SH). Furthermore, Au nanoparticles in a variety of size ranges have been synthesized and used for thiol-terminated biomolecule attachment, facilitating optic detection of the biomolecule via surface plasmon property of the Au nanoparticles. An alternative, yet a potentially more sensitive, approach involves using magnetic nanoparticles as tagging labels. The tagged biomolecules can be enriched, separated, or detected magnetically.","One recent research push has been in making nanoparticle labels with core\/shell type structure with the core being a magnet and the shell being Au as described by Lin, J. et al, \u201cGold-Coated Iron (Fe@Au) Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Characterization, and Magnetic Field-Induced Self-Assembly,\u201d J. Solid State Chem., 159, 26 (2001) and Chen, M. et al, \u201cGold-coated Iron Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications,\u201d J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 93, No. 10, 7551 (2003), the complete disclosures of which, in their entireties, are herein incorporated by reference. However, the evidence for Au coating over a magnetic nanoparticle has been inconclusive thus far.","While the conventional structures have provided particle-metal half shell structures via deposition of a thin metal film onto a spherical inorganic\/organic polymeric particle, the conventional structures are generally much larger than 30 nm, making them unsuitable for biomedical applications. Moreover, a chemical solution phase has been used to form a structure containing FePt\u2014CdS, CdSe\u2014Au and PdS\u2014CoS. However, there continues to remain a need for the preparation of novel dumbbell-like nanostructures with controlled functionality, which can be used for various nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic applications including various biomedical applications.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment of the invention provides general techniques for making various types of water-soluble dumbbell-like nanoparticles having a portion comprising a magnetic identity including any of a metal, alloy and metal oxide, and a semiconductor, with another portion comprising a noble metal including any of Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt, whereby the dumbbell-like nanoparticles are capable of being implemented in biomedical and nanodevice applications.","An aspect of the invention provides a process of making nanoparticles, wherein the process comprises forming a mixture of a nanoparticle with a precursor in a first solvent, wherein the nanoparticle comprises a hydrophobic outer coating; heating the mixture; cooling the mixture to room temperature; modifying the hydrophobic outer coating into a hydrophilic outer coating; precipitating a solid product from the mixture, and dispersing the product in a second solvent. The nanoparticles comprise any of dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles and flower-shaped nanoparticles. Additionally, the nanoparticles comprise any of a semiconducting, magnetic, and noble metallic material, wherein the nanoparticles comprise a first portion comprising any of PbSe, PbS, CdSe, CdS, ZnS, Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt, and wherein the precursor comprises any of a cationic, neutral or particulate Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, or transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) precursors of Fe(CO), Co(CO), Ni(CO)or their analogues. Also, the first and second solvents comprise any of alkanes, arenes, ethers, nitrites, ketones, and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the reaction temperature of the process of making nanoparticles is in a range of 0\u00b0 C. to 350\u00b0 C.","A further aspect of the invention provides a process of making dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles, wherein the process comprises mixing nanoparticles with a noble metal precursor and a reducing agent in solvent, wherein each of the nanoparticles comprises a hydrophobic outer coating; heating the mixture; cooling the mixture to room temperature; modifying the hydrophobic outer coating into a hydrophilic outer coating; precipitating product from the mixture; and dispersing the product in solvent to produce nanoparticle dispersion. The nanoparticles comprise any of metal, alloy, oxide, and sulfide. The noble metal precursor comprises any of a cation or metal, and nanoparticles comprising any of Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt. The reducing agent comprises any of an amine, alcohol, aldehyde, hydride, and a metallic reducing agent. The solvent comprises any of alkanes, arenes, ethers, nitrites, ketones, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.","Another embodiment of the invention provides a process of making dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles, wherein the process comprises applying a coating to a nanoparticle; mixing the coated nanoparticle with a noble metal precursor and reducing agent in solvent to produce a mixture; heating the mixture; cooling the mixture to room temperature; modifying the coating into a hydrophilic coating; precipitating product from the mixture; and dispersing the product in solvent to produce a nanocrystal dispersion.

The noble metal precursor comprises any of a cation, metal, and nanoparticles comprising any of Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt. The reducing agent comprises any of an amine, alcohol, aldehyde, hydride, and a metallic reducing agent. The solvent comprises any of alkanes, arenes, ethers, nitrites, ketones, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.","A further embodiment of the invention provides a process of making dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles water-soluble, wherein the process comprises combining a magnetic material with a metallic material to form a dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles; coating the nanoparticles with a hydrophobic outer layer; and modifying a hydrophobic outer layer of the nanoparticles into a hydrophilic outer layer, wherein the hydrophobic layer comprises any of hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters, and wherein the hydrophilic layer comprises any of polar functional groups of \u2014OH, \u2014COOH, \u2014NH2, \u2014CON\u2014, \u2014CN, and ionic groups. The step of modifying comprises forming a bilayer structure of the nanoparticle. Additionally, the step of modifying comprises using surfactant replacement to change the hydrophobic layer into the hydrophilic layer. Moreover, the step of modifying is performed in a temperature ranging from room temperature to 150\u00b0 C.","The dumbbell-like nanoparticles provided by the embodiments of the invention have numerous advantages over currently used nanoparticle systems. They can be made easily from solution phase synthesis. The size of any one part in the dumbbell structure can be tuned. The structure has small noble metal surface from a dot of less than 5 nm for site-specific binding of a single or, at most, a few biomolecules. The structure also has size-tunable magnetic or semiconducting dot from which an optimum magnetic or optic signal can be generated and detected. Further, such dumbbell structure may be used to connect two narrowly separated electrodes to form a nano-contact between two electrodes, a key step for future fabrication of spintronic devices.","Generally, the embodiments of the invention provide a process of forming dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles by mixing noble metal nanoparticles with a magnetic nanoparticle precursor. In other words, the embodiments of the invention provide a colloidal nanoparticle comprising a magnetic portion; a metallic portion adjacent to the magnetic portion; and a modifiable hydrophobic outer layer over the magnetic portion and the metallic portion, wherein the modifiable hydrophobic outer layer is adapted to be transformed into a hydrophilic outer layer, and wherein each of the magnetic and metallic portions comprise surfaces adapted to be modified. Moreover, the magnetic portion and the metallic portion are arranged in a dumbbell-like configuration or flower-like configuration.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention.

Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"The basic chemistry for the formation of the dumbbell structure  involves the noble metal attachment to the previously formed particle surface that includes an element for noble metal attachment. Sulfur (S) and Selenium (Se) are preferably used to form a strong chemical bond with the noble metal, such as Gold (Au) or Silver (Ag). Thus, either metal sulfide (MS) nanoparticles or metal selenide (MSe) nanoparticles can offer the surface containing the S element and Se element, facilitating Au or Ag attachment. For nanoparticles without an S or Se element on the surface, they may be coated with a layer of metal sulfide or metal selenide. By carefully modifying the surface properties, various dumbbell-like nanostructures can be made in accordance with the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 2(A) through 2(C)","FIG. 2(A)","FIG. 2(B)","FIG. 2(C)"],"b":["1","10","2","210","3","10"]},"In another embodiment, the dumbbell-like multi-functional nanoparticles  made from an organic solution phase are coated with a layer of hydrocarbon surfactant for nanoparticle stabilization in the solvent. This hydrocarbon coating makes the nanoparticles hydrophobic; i.e., they can only be dispersed in non-polar or weakly polar solvent such as alkane, benzene, toluene, and aromatic solvent. Moreover, the hydrophobic surfactant around each dumbbell nanoparticle can be replaced by a hydrophilic surfactant, resulting in water-soluble and biocompatible nanoparticles, which can be dispensed into a polar solvent such as ethanol, methanol, or water, for example, as shown in . Additionally, the noble metal can be used for site-specific attachment to bio-molecules as shown in  which illustrates dumbbell-like nanoparticle  with different coatings, \u201cL\u201d and \u201cL\u201d.","This will allow nanoparticles  to attach to a magnetic sensor surface  for highly sensitive bio-recognition, as shown in , where \u201cL\u201d is the biomolecule in interest and L can be any hydrophilic surfactant. For example, \u201cL\u201d can be a two-strand DNA fragment or an antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich structure. Alternatively, the organic surfactant around each particle can be removed and the particle can be attached to a patterned electrode containing noble metal, such as gold. The presence of gold in a dumbbell nanoparticle will facilitate particle attachment to this electrode by gentle annealing it to allow an interface diffusion to occur between the gold sphere and the gold electrode. This aids in building a connection between two electrodes ,  with only one particle , either a magnetic or semiconducting nanoparticle, as shown in , resulting in novel spintronic and single electron devices. For example, the magnetic nanoparticle could affect spin-dependent transport between the two electrodes (often made magnetic) , . In addition, the nanoparticles are configured sufficiently small such that the electronic transport between the two electrodes ,  via the nanoparticles  becomes quantized because of Coulomb blockade. In other words, the nanoparticles can act as a \u201cquantum dot\u201d in single electronic devices.","Experimentally, semiconductor nanoparticles  have been constructed by attaching Au nanoparticles from an organic solution phase synthesis based on scheme  (FIG. (A)), or magnetic nanoparticles attached by Ag or Au nanoparticles based on Schemes - (). PbSe nanoparticles may be synthesized using any known procedure such as that described in Murray, C.

Thus, mixing these PbSe particles with HAuClsalt in the presence of oleylamine and stirring the mixture at 40\u00b0 C. for 1 hour yields PbSe\u2014Au dumbbell nanoparticles according to the embodiments of the invention.","The embodiments of the invention provide multi-shaped nanoparticles such as FeO\u2014Au dumbbell-like particles (shown in the TEM image of ) and FeO\u2014Au flower-like nanoparticles (shown in the TEM image of ), which can be made by decomposing Fe(CO)over Au nanoparticles.

The bifunctionality introduced by such a dumbbell structure could be used for various nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic applications. Moreover, the magnetic detection provided by the embodiments of the invention is capable of yielding a biosensor suitable for single biomolecule detection. For example, to make magnetic nanoparticles for sensitive bio-label applications, nanoparticles are made that can site-specifically bind to a DNA strand.

Moreover, the magnetic portion and the metallic portion are arranged in a dumbbell-like configuration or flower-like configuration. The dumbbell-shaped colloidal nanoparticles provided by the embodiments of the invention are unique from the widely studied core-shell structures because the dumbbell-shaped nanoparticles comprise two different surfaces that provide two platforms for different surface chemistry in one particle. Such a characteristic is currently not available for core-shell structures that have only one type of surface. Furthermore, the embodiments of the invention provide the first known example of a flower-shaped nanoparticle. The advantage of this flower-like structure is that one single particle provides a stronger magnetic signal than conventional nanoparticles. That is, the totality of several petal (flower-like) magnetic nanoparticles, which maintains chemical solubility, is unique.

In addition, a flower-shaped nanoparticle has a free gold surface for surfactant attachment that is otherwise unavailable in a conventional core-shell structure. Accordingly, the embodiments of the invention provide the example of nanoparticles having dumbbell and flower-shaped structures comprising a magnetic particle as the first part and a metal portion as the second part, and having both surfaces (magnetic and metal surfaces) available for surface modification, which is different from that of a conventional core-shell structure having only one type of surface available for modification.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
