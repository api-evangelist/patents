{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates to color balancing based on the content of a digital image.","Digital images are being used in a rapidly increasing number of applications. In many of those applications, automated analysis of digital images can be performed to enhance the picture quality. The quality of a digital image is often dependent on color levels and color intensity. For example, when capturing a digital photo, characteristics of the ambient environment, such as lighting or reflections off objects, may negatively impact the color representation of the digital picture such that subsequent adjustment of the colors may be desirable. Color balancing of such images tends to be challenging because the importance of particular color aspects (e.g., hue, saturation, chroma, colorfulness, value or lightness, and luminance) tends to vary from image to image. For example, some images may benefit from color adjustments to environmental elements such as grass, air, or water, while other images may benefit from color adjustments to human faces, or other body parts, and their corresponding skin tones.","This disclosure describes, among other things, a color space, along with corresponding techniques, systems and computer programs or software, that facilitate color balancing of at least a portion of a digital image based on the image content.","In general, an aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented in methods performed by one or more software processes that include shifting the colors of essentially any feature in a digital image towards a desired reference color for the selected feature. The method includes designating a reference color in essentially any color space and determining a region of interest within a digital image. Further, the method includes converting the digital image and the reference color into a modified color space by applying a predetermined gamma value and transforming the digital image and reference color into an opponent color space. Generally, an opponent color space is defined by separate luminance and chromatic channels. The method further includes a color balancing process that may be performed in the opponent color space based on the difference of at least one channel of an average color, determined for the region of interest, and the reference color. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding apparatus, methods, and computer program products.","These and other implementations can include one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the reference color and the digital image can be accessed in a RGB color space. The method can further include the transformation into a YIQ opponent color space, where the difference of at least one of the chromatic I and Q channels provides the basis for the color adjustment process.","In some implementations the reference color may be designated by a manual selection of a user, a predetermined reference color within an application, or an automatically selected reference color. The method further includes the automatic selection of the reference color by determining an average color of a detected feature within essentially any digital reference image, such as face detection. Further, the method includes the selection of the reference color by a user from a predetermined color palette within an application.","In some implementations, the average color determined for the region of interest within the digital image can be adjusted by ignoring specific color values selected by a user. The method includes a selection by a user of essentially any area within the digital image defining the colors to be excluded from the color balancing process.","In some implementations, the region of interest can be determined by manual selection from a user or automatically selecting an area within the digital image, such as automatic feature or face detection.","In some implementations, the image processing operation may include adjusting the colors of the digital image by adding the color value difference of the average color and the reference color to the pixels of essentially any area within the digital image.","In some implementations, the difference between the reference color and the average color can further include a color adjustment component, which may be obtained by selection from a user, or may be automatically determined based on achromatic colors within the digital image. The method further includes defining the color adjustment by setting a strength or warmth component within an application.","In some implementations, the image processing operation can be made dependent on the range of colors appearing within the digital image and weighting that color range by the overall color characteristics of the digital image. The method includes testing the digital image for neutral and saturated colors and may provide for exclusion of specified color ranges from the image processing operation.","In some implementations, the processed image may be transformed from the opponent color space into the modified color space and further converted into the color space the operation was initiated from by applying an inverse gamma value.","Various implementations of the subject matter described herein may be configured so as to realize one of more of the following potential advantages.","The disclosed techniques may facilitate a color balancing functionality that minimizes, if not outright eliminates, impact on the luminance, or gray-scale, properties of the original digital image. Unlike most existing white balancing algorithms, which tend to require a user to choose a gray object within the digital image, the disclosed techniques may allow the user to select, without restriction, essentially any color appearing in a digital image. The selected color may then be used to correct colors of either the entire image or a selected subsection of the image by shifting the colors of the digital image towards a desired reference color.","Although not limited in potential application, examples of features within a digital image that the user may desire to enhance are areas such as sky, grass, water, and\/or skin. The user can select essentially any representative feature within a digital image to generate a color average, which may then be used to shift the color scheme of the image towards an independently defined reference color (generally an idealized color for the feature to be color corrected).","It is noted that selected color values may be excluded when generating the average color, which serves as a basis to adjust the image color scheme. Limiting the color spectrum may be desired where the representative feature contains objects of which the colors are not meant to be corrected. For example, in images where a face is the desired feature for color correction, and the person in the image is wearing colored sunglasses, the color correction process can be configured to ignore the specific color pixels representing the color of the sunglasses to ensure that only the skin colors are corrected.","A potential implementation of the disclosed subject matter may employ automatic feature selection, such as face detection, to perform automatic color correction without further input from or interaction with the user, for example, based on an average color of the detected feature within the digital image. When used in combination with automatic face detection, creating individual reference colors for different people may be rendered unnecessary. For example, particularly in a modified YIQ color space as described in the disclosure, the color vectors I and Q of all skin types line up in the same dimensions, regardless of complexion, race, and ethnicity. An application may therefore use a predefined generic and idealized skin color to implement the color balancing method for essentially any image containing a face. It is also noted that color temperature (e.g. blackbody radiators) form a mostly straight line in this modified YIQ color space.","The subject matter described herein potentially allow for color balancing based on image content using essentially any reference color, whether present in the image or not. Application of the disclosed subject matter is not limited to a specific feature within a digital image.","It is noted that the implementation of the described color balancing process is not limited to digital still images, but further extends to other digital imaging technologies, such as digital video. The same process described in the disclosure for applying color balancing to digital images is applicable over a sequence of video frames.","These and other aspects, features and various combinations of them may be expressed, among other ways, as methods, apparatus, systems, means for performing functions, computer program products or the like.","Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and potential advantages of the subject matter will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","The subject matter described herein can be implemented in various ways. Some potentially useful implementations are described below. Descriptions of implementations of the subject matter are not necessarily descriptions of the claimed inventions, which are not limited to the detail implementations described in this section, but rather are described in broader terms in the claims.","Digital images are widely used for various purposes, including, but not limited to recreational, social networking, identification, or commercial applications. The quality of a digital image is an important factor for the effective and efficient utilization of the image. The color of the digital image is an essential element providing the commercial or social value for most applications.","For example, the digital photo of a person or landscape may be less than satisfactory if the colors are not true to nature and\/or to the liking of the viewer. Because digital images may be created using any of a variety of devices, such as digital cameras, cell phones, laptops, or tablet computers, the corresponding image quality may vary significantly depending on the particular device and environmental conditions present at the time of image capture.","Colors often are impacted by the environmental circumstances under which an image is captured, such as indoor low light or outdoor sunlight conditions. A color balancing process may be required to convert the image into a usable or appealing representation of the contents to the human eye. The methods and systems described herein describe systems, techniques and computer programs that may be used for color balancing a digital image based on its color properties.","Such color properties are often described using color spaces which are mathematical models describing how colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. Examples of commonly used color spaces include RGB, CMY, CMYK, YIQ, YUV, YCrCb, CIELAB, HSV, HSI, IHC and HSL. In general, color spaces may be broadly classified as being either Cartesian-based or polar coordinate-based. Some implementations of the described subject matter may benefit by operating in \u201copponent\u201d color spaces, such as YIQ, YCrCb, or CIELAB.","Generally, opponent color spaces define the color spectrum by opponent chromatic channels, such as red versus green and blue versus yellow, and an opponent achromatic channel, black versus white. The achromatic channel generally represents the light-dark variation, or luminance, of the color space. An implementation of the color correction herein described is performed as an additive offset on the chromatic channels, isolated from the luminance channel, in an opponent color space.","The YIQ color space is a 3D Cartesian coordinate-based opponent color space. The Y component represents the nominal luminance, which describes the brightness in an image, the \u201cblack and white\u201d or achromatic portion of the image. The I and Q color components represent the chrominance, which describes the color information in an image, where the I component represents the blue-orange axis, and the Q component the green-purple axis. The YIQ color space is intended to take advantage of the human color response characteristics. The human eye is more sensitive to spatial changes (e.g. change across location in the image) in luminance than changes to hue or saturation. The YIQ color space has been used primarily by the original NTSC (1953) color TV system.","Referring to , the example illustrates a digital image  that does not depict the desired blue color of the sky as shown by the reference color . The described subject matter enables the user to automatically adjust the color setting of the digital image to properly reflect the desired colors of selected features. The color balancing process  is performed by comparing the color levels of a selected area within the digital image  with a reference color . The reference color  describes the desired target color for a particular area or feature of the digital image . In the example of , the reference color  depicts a desired color for the sky.","The reference color  can be obtained by a variety of processes, including manual selection by the user, predetermined colors within the application (e.g. a color palette), or automatic selection of certain areas within a reference image. An example for automatic selection of the reference color is a face detection process used to identify the desired skin tone in a reference image by averaging the color values of an area containing a face. After determination of the reference color , the color balancing process  can be applied to adjust the color attributes of one or more color channels of the digital image  based on the reference color  by shifting the respective color channels of the digital image  towards the reference color . The end result is a corrected image  representing the desired color scheme.","The described subject matter is not limited to particular features, such as faces, grass, or skies, but can be implemented for essentially any feature contained within the image. The described process can also be used in combination with automatic feature selection processes of a particular region of interest. An implementation of the described subject matter is the automatic balancing process of an image in combination with face detection.","A face detection process is applied to the digital image and areas containing faces are used to define the region of interest. Predefined skin tone colors, such as cooler colors for indoor, and warmer colors for sunlight settings can be used as reference colors for automatic color adjustment. The subject matter described herein is not limited to the application of color balancing processes to the pixels of an entire image, but can also be implemented for essentially any area of an image.","Referring to , a flow chart depicts an example of a color balancing process in a modified YIQ color space. Digital images are generally stored in some form of encoded color space. The process  illustrates an implementation in which color balancing is initiated with an image in a RGB color space. It is noted that the process may be initiated from essentially any color space. A method to obtain a digital image in a RGB color space is the software application ColorSync, a color management application programming interface (API), developed by Apple, Inc. This process is typically performed by using a tone reproduction curve (e.g. gamma) and a color matrix. It is noted that images can be transferred between different color spaces by well-known mathematical formulas and processes and no further detail discussion is necessary.","A digital image  is accessed in a RGB color space and loaded into an application performing the color balancing process. A desired reference color  also is also generated in the RGB color space. The reference color  can be defined by user selection (e.g. a specific area of interest of a reference image, such as grass, sky, a face, or chosen from a color palette), predefined in the application (e.g. standard skin tones), or obtained through automatic feature selection (e.g. face detection in a reference image). The reference color  is an idealized average color for a feature within a digital image the user desires to enhance. If an area of interest is selected to generate the reference color , the color values of the pixels within the selected area are averaged, defining the reference color .","A region of interest  generally depicts an area within a digital image on which the color balancing process may be based and can be determined by various methods, including manual selection by a user or automatic selection by an application. In combination with automatic feature selection, such as face detection, a region of interest  can be defined by an application without user input. The user can also define a region of interest  manually by selecting a range of pixels within a digital image . This can be essentially any area within an image depicting a feature a user desires to enhance, including, but not limited to, grass, sky, water, or skin.","A digital image  and a reference color  are converted into a modified representation within a RGB color space by exponentially applying a predetermined encoding gamma value . For this example, a steep encoding gamma value  of 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, etc. may be beneficial for this specific conversion, but it is noted that the full range of gamma values may be used.\n\nrgb\u2032=rgb\n\nThe application of a steep gamma value may result in better color separation of the chromatic channels for the following color balancing process.\n","The modified RGB representation of the digital image  and the reference color  may be transformed into a luminance-chrominance format color space with at least 3 channels. In the described example, the digital image  and the reference color  are preferably transformed into a YIQ color space. Since the basis for transformation into the YIQ color space is the modified RGB representation, the digital image  and reference color  are now depicted in a modified YIQ color space. For example, the conversion from the modified RGB to the modified YIQ color space can be calculated as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["Y","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["I","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["Q","\u2032"]}}}]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"0.299"},{"mn":"0.587"},{"mn":"0.114"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0.596"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"0.275"}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"0.321"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0.212"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"0.523"}},{"mn":"0.311"}]}]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["R","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["G","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["B","\u2032"]}}}]}}],"mo":"\u00d7"}],"mo":"="}}}},"Referring to , a flow chart depicts the image processing operation . The prior selected region of interest , now described in the modified YIQ color space, may be averaged forming an average color , which embodies the color value of the YIQ channels for the selected pixels appearing within the region of interest . The average color  is a representation of the color range within the digital image the user desires to move towards the reference color .","The color range of the average color  may be further limited by excluding color values the user desires not to change as indicated at step . For example, colors of objects within the region of interest  that may not fit within the color range of the selected feature, such as red balloons in the sky or colored sunglasses on a face, can be excluded from the image processing operation to ensure that only desired color values are shifted towards a reference color.","In the described example, the Y channel may be ignored for the operation and only the I and Q channel values of the average color  and the reference color  are compared. The color difference  of the I and Q channels can be calculated as:\n\n\u0394\n","Ignoring the Y channel in the color balancing operation, as described above, ensures that the luminance (black and white) tone reproduction of the corrected image stays identical to the original image. If the I and Q channel values of the reference color  and average color  are identical, no value difference is calculated and further processing of the digital image  is not necessary, as indicated at step .","Within some implementations the user may desire to further adjust the color balance of an image to achieve an anticipated result. The above described color balancing process allows for implementation of additional, manual or automatic, refinement of a digital image. The color difference  can be refined with a color adjustment component , forming an adjusted color difference .The color adjustment component  includes, but is not limited to, a function of user inputs or the chromatic content of a digital image. The color adjustment component  can be controlled manually by the user, generally through a user interface , or automatically within the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["410","420","410"],"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"i":["I","+Q"],"sup":["2","2","4","4"]},"For example, a strength value of 0 can prevent color correction, whereas a strength value greater than 1 can overcorrect an image. The warmth component  may provide an option for the user to adjust the color scheme of an image to reflect a desired setting. For example, the warmth component  can be a linear interpolation between two idealized skin tones, a cooler \u201cindoor\u201d skin tone and a warmer \u201csunlight\u201d skin tone, allowing the user to shift to color scheme between two settings.","Another example for additional adjustment and control over the color balancing process may be the application of a weighting function in a color space. A range of colors may be excluded from processing if the color characteristics of the image would render such processing undesirable. For instance, an image can be tested for neutral and highly saturated colors that should remain unchanged and excluded from further processing.","Referring back to , the color difference , or the adjusted color difference , can be used to shift the color scheme of the digital image  towards a desired color representation based on the reference color .

An implementation of the above described color balancing process only modifies the chrominance of a digital image, but not the luminance, by excluding the Y channel of the YIQ color space.","Referring back to , the processed image  may be converted from the modified YIQ color space to the modified RGB color space using an inverse matrix:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["R","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["G","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["B","\u2032"]}}}]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1.0"},{"mn":"0.956"},{"mn":"0.621"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"1.0"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"0.272"}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"0.647"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"1.0"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1.105"}},{"mn":"1.702"}]}]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["Y","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["I","\u2032"]}}},{"mtd":{"msup":{"mi":["Q","\u2032"]}}}]}}],"mo":"\u00d7"}],"mo":"="}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"b":["360","290","290","240"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sub":"linear =rgb\u2032","sup":"1\/y "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["510","530","510","530","510"]},"In the YIQ color space, the I and Q channel values for skin colors are not dependent on the actual skin tone of the person presented in an image and therefore are generally applicable, regardless of complexion, ethnicity, or race.
