Field","The present invention relates to data duplication using a shared storage area, and more specifically, to an information processing apparatus, a data duplication method, a program, and a storage medium for improving security level in data duplication using a shared storage area.","2. Description of the Related Art","A desktop environment in a general operating system is equipped with a clipboard for temporarily storing data. The clipboard is a convenient general-purpose shared memory into which data can be freely written from various applications by a simple operation and from which data can be freely read\u2014provided that a format thereof can be interpreted.","In a general clipboard, one item of data can be stored at one time; however, Microsoft Office (a registered trademark), Emacs and so on provide an extended function for storing past data in another area as an extended function specific to their applications. This function facilitates sharing a plurality of items of data among the applications; however, this is an extended function specific to the applications, and the data is stored in a volatile storage area, which requires that the applications are in operation, and on completion of the applications, the data is lost.","From the viewpoint of extending the function of the clipboard, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-170165 (Patent Literature 1) discloses a data duplication method including saving means capable of ordinary data storage and storing copy source data for pasting; loading means capable of ordinary data reading and restoring copy source data for pasting on an object basis from a copy and paste specific file; copying means for specifying copy source data and creating a paste data file using the saving means; and pasting means for producing a duplicate of the copy source necessary for pasting using the loading means. The technology of Patent Literature 1 allows data to be shared by a plurality of users and to be reused after restarting the computer.","Also in the viewpoint of extending the function of the clipboard, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-250896 (Patent Literature 2) discloses a data-entry support apparatus equipped with a copy (or cut) and paste function in which data that is frequently pasted is left in the clipboard as much as possible.","As described above, the clipboard is a convenient function; however, in the viewpoint of security, it is difficult to manage because of the convenience, which can cause a serious security incident. Unlike a kernel object, the clipboard is a user object that is not equipped with an access control mechanism, such as an access control list (ACL). Therefore, there is a risk of unintended information leakage to a suspicious program operating on the same desktop environment. Although data on a clipboard, pasted on a necessary location, is normally unnecessary data, important data is sometimes left without being overwritten. At that time, the data left on the clipboard may leak to the outside via a peer-to-peer pear file-swapping application or the like infected with a virus. Such information leakage is not permitted in organizations, such as government and municipal offices, universities, and companies.","Accordingly, this intensifies the need for some security restrictions on the clipboard function to prevent information leakage. As a measure against information leakage via a shared memory, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-176431 (Patent Literature 3) discloses an access control program, for the purpose of preventing information leakage caused by reuse of information by a user having an access right, in which particular processes, such as copying and pasting, that an OS or applications perform to reuse the content of a protected document stored in a document storage area, are monitored, and when the particular processes are detected, various processes for setting a second access right, which succeeds a first right, to a second document that reuses the content of a first document, to which a first right is set, are executed.","According to the related art of Patent Literature 3, the access control policy of a copy source document is handed over to a copy destination document, so that an information flow via the shared memory can be controlled. However, the technology of Patent Literature 3 is a technology for setting a document access control policy, and thus, data may remain in an unprotected state on the shared memory.","The foregoing background requires a technology capable of efficiently limiting the lifetime of data in a shared storage area, such as a clipboard, so that unnecessary data after being pasted to a necessary location can be efficiently erased.","On the other hand, since the clipboard is a general-purpose shared memory that is accessed from all processes, uniformly limiting the function of the clipboard results in a loss of the convenience. For GUI-based computers, it is not desirable to unnecessarily impair the user convenience for the purpose of enhancing the security. Furthermore, because only protection for particular applications has low effect, it is desirable to achieve a high-versatility application-independent function. Furthermore, since there are various levels of secrecy required for information, it is desirable to protect data in a shared storage area at various levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[PTL 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application.

Accordingly, the present invention provides an information processing apparatus having the following characteristics. An information processing apparatus of the present invention in which one or more applications operate includes a copy-operation monitoring portion that acquires copy data that a copy source application issues an instruction to copy to a general-purpose shared memory, sets a lifetime interpreted from an operation pattern via an input device for the copy data, and then stores the copy data in a nonvolatile or volatile storage area.","The information processing apparatus further includes a display portion that displays, on a display, a paste candidate selected from one or more items of copy data stored in the storage area; a paste-operation monitoring portion that transfers the paste candidate read from the storage area to a paste destination application in response to a confirmation operation via the input device; and an erasing portion that erases, from the storage area, copy data that has become unpermitted to remain because the lifetime has expired. According to an aspect, the copying can include cutting that involves erasing a copy content from a copy source application. Furthermore, the present invention allows one of the volatile storage area and the nonvolatile storage area to be specified as a designated storage by interpreting the operation pattern via the input device.","The above configuration allows a lifetime to be freely set for copy data stored in a shared storage area using an operation pattern via an input device. Copy data whose lifetime has expired is erased in sequence from the storage area by the data erasing portion. Accordingly, this can suitably reduce the possibility that copy data remains unintentionally in the storage area to cause information leakage. Thus, the lifetime of data in the shared storage area can be efficiently limited to enhance the security without reducing the ease of operation of users and the convenience of the shared storage area.","Although the present invention will be described hereinbelow with embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described below.","An information processing apparatus according to embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to .  is a functional block diagram of an information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. The information processing apparatus shown in  is, not particularly limited, configured as a computer , such as desktop, notebook, tablet, and netbook personal computers, a workstation, a server, a portable terminal, and a personal digital assistant (PDA).","The computer  includes a central processing unit (CPU), a random access memory (RAM), a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid state drive (SSD), and a network interface card (NIC) (not shown). The computer  of this embodiment further includes an input device, such as a keyboard  and a mouse , or a touch panel (not shown), as a physical device  for providing a user interface, and a display unit, such as a display (not shown). The computer  operates under the control of a graphical user interface (GUI) based operating system (hereinafter, referred to as an OS), such as Windows (a registered trademark), Linux (a registered trademark), UNIX (a registered trademark), and Mac (a registered trademark) OS X.","The computer  includes one or more applications to operating on an OS. Examples of the applications to are, not particularly limited, a web browser, a mailer, a document preparation application, groupware, a spreadsheet application, a database application, a presentation application, and an integrated development environment.","The computer  can include a standard clipboard , that is, a so-called general-purpose shared memory, as part of functions that the OS provides. The standard clipboard  allows the user to write data freely from various applications  by menu selection or a simple operation using a shortcut key and to read data to various applications by a similar simple operation.","The computer  further includes a message queue , as part of functions that the OS provides, on which messages corresponding to the operations of the physical device , such as the keyboard  and the mouse , are posted. When an operation is performed on the keyboard  or the mouse , the OS posts a message corresponding to the operation on the message queue . Thereafter, the message is generally extracted from the message queue  in a thread message loop and is transferred again to corresponding one of applications  via the system.","The standard clipboard  mentioned above is a user object, which can be accessed from all applications and has no access limit mechanism. Thus, there is a risk of information leakage via the standard clipboard . Therefore, the computer  according to the embodiment of the present invention includes an extended clipboard  in addition to, or instead of, the standard clipboard .","The extended clipboard  monitors an application programming interface (hereinafter referred to as an API) and the message queue  and controls accesses from the process to resources, such as the standard clipboard , in accordance with the result of monitoring the transfer of a message from the physical device  to the process. The extended clipboard  can be configured as a library that is incorporated into the individual applications  operating on the computer  and that operates between the applications  and the OS to provide an extended shared storage area. Such a library is referred to as a dynamic link library or a shared library.","A copy operation using the extended clipboard  will be described hereinbelow. More specifically, the extended clipboard  includes a message monitoring portion  and a copy-operation monitoring portion . The message monitoring portion  monitors the message queue  and obtains messages related to the operations of the physical device  on the windows of the application to posted to the message queue . If the obtained message is a message on a copy operation, the message monitoring portion  transfers the message to the copy-operation monitoring portion .","The copy-operation monitoring portion  interprets the message transferred from the message monitoring portion  and processes it and monitors an API related to copying (hereinafter referred to as a copy API). When the application serving as a copy source performs an API call to instructs the standard clipboard  to perform copying, the copy-operation monitoring portion  obtains the copy data, sets a lifetime that defines a range in which the data is permitted to remain, and stores the data in a predetermined storage.","The storage of the copy data includes a volatile storage area  that a volatile storage unit, such as a RAM, provides and a nonvolatile storage area  that a nonvolatile storage unit, such as a HDD and an SSD, provides. This embodiment is provided with the nonvolatile storage area , in which copy data is stored, so that the user can use the copy data even after the computer  is once shutdown. The volatile storage area  and the nonvolatile storage area  are configured to each store one or a plurality of items of copy data so that data that was copied in the past can also be reused for a long period of time.","On the other hand, lifetimes can be set to copy data stored in the volatile storage area  and the nonvolatile storage area . Examples of the lifetimes to be set are, not particularly limited, the term of validity that defines a term in which data is permitted to remain and a limit count (or frequency) that defines the limit of the number of pasting times permitted for the data.","The settings of the storage and lifetime of copy data are managed using, for example, data-remanence control information  having a data structure as shown in , to be described later in detail. In the case where the volatile storage area  or the nonvolatile storage area  is used as the storage, the above API call from the copy source application is blocked so that the copy data is not transferred to the standard clipboard .","In the embodiment of the present invention, the operation patterns of the keyboard  and the mouse  are given meaning. The copy-operation monitoring portion  receives a message on a copy operation and interprets the operation pattern to thereby determine the storage of the copy data and a lifetime set for the copy data. The operation pattern is described as an operation state or the time series of operation states of the keyboard  and the mouse  or one of them, such as a key combination in a keyboard operation, the sequence of a key combination, and a mouse gesture.","A configuration example in a Windows (a registered trademark) environment will be described. The copy operation can be configured such that copy data is stored in the volatile storage area  using the first key combination, \u201cCtrl+C\u201d with a limit count of 1, and the limit count is increased using the following key combinations, \u201cCtrl+C\u201d. In another configuration example, the volatile storage area  is selected by pressing the key combination, \u201cCtrl+C\u201d, once, and the nonvolatile storage area  is selected by pressing and holding the key combination, \u201cCtrl+C\u201d.","While the copy operation has been described, a cut operation is the same as the copy operation in that data is written to the extended clipboard , as viewed from the extended clipboard , although it differs in that the cut content is erased, as viewed from the application side. Accordingly, this embodiment describes the cut operation as one aspect of the copy operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","142","144","120"]},"A paste operation using the extended clipboard  will be described hereinbelow. The extended clipboard  further includes a paste-operation monitoring portion  and an overlay display portion . If an obtained message is a message on a paste operation, the message monitoring portion  transfers the message to the paste-operation monitoring portion . The paste-operation monitoring portion  interprets the message transferred from the message monitoring portion  and processes it, and monitors an API related to pasting (hereinafter referred to as a paste API).","More specifically, the paste-operation monitoring portion  receives the message on the paste operation and interprets the operation pattern, as in the copy operation to select copy data to be pasted and confirm it. The overlay display portion  draws the selected paste candidate, on a display screen, of one or more items of copy data stored in the storage area. A method for drawing is not particularly limited; however, this embodiment creates a transparent window in front of the window of the paste destination application , on which the paste candidate is overlaid.","An example in a Windows (a registered trademark) environment will be described. The paste operation can be configured such that a paste candidate is selected with a key combination, \u201cCtrl+V\u201d, in a predetermined order, such as a reverse chronological order (or a chronological order), while the \u201cCtrl\u201d key is held, and the key is released while the desired copy data is selected and displayed, so that the data to be pasted can be confirmed.","When the application , which is a paste destination, performs an API call that issues an instruction to paste copy data from the standard clipboard , the paste-operation monitoring portion  transfers the confirmed copy data to be pasted to the paste destination application . In the case where the copy data confirmed as data to be pasted is subjected to lifetime setting, such as a limit count, that needs to be rewritten according to the paste operation, the paste-operation monitoring portion  updates the data-remanence control information , such as decreasing the limit count.","The paste destination application obtains the transferred copy data and pastes the copy data in an appropriate format. Although the paste destination application in  differs from the copy source application , the copy source and the paste destination may be the same application.","Handling of copy data whose lifetime has expired in the copy (cut) and paste operation using the extended clipboard  will be described. The extended clipboard  further includes a data erasing portion . The data erasing portion  determine whether data whose lifetime has expired so that it becomes unpermitted to remain, with reference to the data-remanence control information  regularly or irregularly or in response to an explicit notification that the lifetime of the copy data has expired from the paste-operation monitoring portion .","When data whose lifetime has expired so that it becomes unpermitted to remain is found, the data erasing portion  erases the corresponding copy data from the volatile storage area  or the nonvolatile storage area  and also the registration thereof from the data-remanence control information . In an embodiment in which only lifetime setting, such as the limit count, is provided which needs rewriting according to the paste operation, the function of the data erasing portion  may be included in the function of the paste-operation monitoring portion .","The flow of the process of the copy operation will be described in more detail with reference to .  is a flowchart of the copy process to the extended clipboard  that the copy-operation monitoring portion  of the computer  according to the embodiment of the present invention executes. The process shown in  is started from step S, and in step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  obtains a message on a copy operation from the message monitoring portion . In step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  interprets the operation pattern. The interpretation of the operation pattern can be performed by application of any of interpretation rules  shown in  and , for example; however it is not particularly limited thereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 3(A)"],"b":["200","200","142","142","144"]},"An interpretation rule B shown in  defines an action to select the volatile storage area  by pushing the key once, select the nonvolatile storage area  by pushing and holding the key, and set the paste limit count to one, and store the copy data in the first copy key operation. In the second and further copy operations, the limit count is increased by one by a short-pushing copy key operation, and the storage is changed to the nonvolatile storage area  by a push and hold copy key operation.","For changing the lifetime, as , rules can be created so that the limit count is increased, or the storage is changed from the volatile storage area  to the nonvolatile storage area  in which data can be stored for a longer period of time, that is, the security is decreased while the convenience is increased, with an increasing number of copy key operations; however, it is not particularly limited thereto. As shown in , the rule may be created so that the copy data is first stored in the nonvolatile storage area , with a large limit count, and the limit count is decreased, and the storage is changed from the nonvolatile storage area , in which copy data can be stored for a long period of time, to the short-term volatile storage area  with an increasing number of copy key operations, that is, the security is increased as the convenience is decreased.","Furthermore, as shown in , an increase in limit count for each copy key operation may be changed between a case in which ordinary-level security is required and a case in which a secret level is required depending on the attribute of a document focused in the copy source application . For the details of dynamic access control depending on the security level of a document opened in an application, refer to Non Patent Literature 1 (Sanehiro FURUICHI, and Michiharu KUDO, \u201cAccess Control Policy Management for GUI-based Computer\u201d, Information Processing Society of Japan, IPSJ Journal, Vol. 49, No. 9, pp. 1-11 (September, 2008)).","In another embodiment, the lifetime can be automatically determined in accordance with a security level determined from the content of copy data in cooperation with a content analysis engine that executes content analysis adopted in a known data loss protection (DLP) technology. For example, for copy data with high degree of secrecy, shorter lifetime or less limit count can be determined. In this case, the user can increase and decrease the automatically determined lifetime within a fixed limit range (for example, an upper limit) using the operation pattern.","The content analysis engine is an engine which can be implemented as a module inside or outside the computer  and which analyzes the content to determine whether secret information is included. For example, the engine can create an index from database in which secret information, such as customer information, is stored and can detect secret information registered in the database using the index. Alternatively, the engine can register a secret document file to create an index and can detect a copy of the registered document or a document created by quoting part of the document using the index. Furthermore, the engine can specify secret information using a specific keyword or phrase included in the document or using the attributes of the file.","In addition, as shown in , the rule may be created so that the storage is changed from one copy key operation to another. In the example shown in , the storage is changed for each copy key operation, that is, first, to the clipboard , next, to the volatile storage area  in which the data remains until the power of the computer  is shut off, and finally, to the nonvolatile storage area  in which data remains even if the power of the computer  is shut off.","Referring again to , in step S, the process is separated depending on the interpretation of the operation pattern in step S. In step S, if it is interpreted that a copy process is required (copy), the process moves to step S. If it is interpreted in step S that a change of storage is required (change of storage), the process moves to step S. If it is interpreted in step S that a change of lifetime setting is required (change of lifetime setting), the process moves to step S.","If a copy process is required, the copy source application received the message and issues a copy API call that issues an instruction to copy data to the standard clipboard . In this case, in step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  detects the copy API call from the copy source application and obtains copy data from the application ","In step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  stores the obtained copy data in a storage specified from the interpretation in step S (one of the volatile storage area , the nonvolatile storage area , and the standard clipboard ). In step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  adds a record corresponding to the stored copy data to the data-remanence control information  and sets an initial value for lifetime setting specified by the interpretation of the operation pattern to the stored copy data, and the process moves to step S. For example, if the interpretation rule shown in  is applied, it is interpreted that a copy process is required in the first copy key operation, and in step S, the copy data is stored in the volatile storage area , and in step S, limit count  is set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["146","130","146","146","146","146","146"],"i":["a ","b ","c ","d "]},"The example shown in  has both of the term-of-validity field and the limit count field as lifetime settings for copy data. In the case where both the term of validity and the limit count are set, the lifetime is expired when the term of validity is reached or the limit count of pasting is performed. In the data-remanence control information  shown in , copy data is listed in a reverse chronological order (or a chronological order), with the latest copy data placed at the head (or the end) and is used also as history data.","As shown in , in the embodiment described, the lifetime set for copy data is managed by a table separate from the copy data; however, it is not particularly limited thereto. In another embodiment, the lifetime may be managed in each of the volatile storage area  and the nonvolatile storage area  in the form of attachment to copy data.","Referring again to , in step S, the next message from the message monitoring portion  is waited for, in which the process loops step S until the next new message is obtained, or a predetermined time passes to time-out (during NO period). In step S, if the next operation message is obtained or a time-out occurs, the process moves to step S. In step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  determined whether the following copy operation has been performed. For example, if an event irrelevant to copying is performed or a time-out occurs, it is determined that no following copy operation has been performed.","In step S, if the following copy operation has not been performed (NO), the copy process is finished in step S. On the other hand, for example, if it is determined in step S that the following copy key operation has been performed, and the following copy operation for the copy process has been performed (YES), the process is looped to step S, where interpretation on the following copy operation is performed.","Referring again to step S, if it is interpreted that a change of storage is required (change of storage), in step S, the copy-operation monitoring portion  transfers the copy data from the present storage to a storage specified by interpreting the operation pattern, and in step S, updates the data-remanence control information along with the change of storage. For example, if the interpretation rule shown in  is applied, it is interpreted that a change to the nonvolatile storage area  is required at the tenth operation after continuous copy operations. In this case, in step S, the copy data in the volatile storage area  is moved to the nonvolatile storage area , and in step S, the storage type in the data-remanence control information  is changed to \u201cstorage\u201d. If a change of storage is required, the copy API called as a result of transmission of the message to the copy source application by the copy key operation is blocked.","In step S, if it is interpreted that a change in lifetime setting is required (change in lifetime setting), in step S, the lifetime setting is changed according to the interpretation of the operation pattern to update the data-remanence control information . For example, if the interpretation rule shown in  is applied, in step S, the limit of number of pasting times is increased by a predetermined number for the individual second to ninth continuous copy key operations. In the case where the term of validity is set, the term of validity can be extended stepwisely for each of the second to ninth copy key operations in step S. If a change of lifetime setting is required, the copy API called as a result of transmission of the message to the copy source application by the copy key operation is blocked.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["100","300","304","302","304","312","310","304","304","130","316"]},"The flow of the process of the paste operation will be described in more detail with reference to .  is a flowchart showing a paste process from the extended clipboard  executed by the paste-operation monitoring portion  of the computer  according to the embodiment of the present invention.

In step S, the paste-operation monitoring portion  interprets the operation pattern. The interpretation of the operation pattern can be performed by applying the same interpretation rules shown in  and ; however, it is not particularly limited thereto.","The embodiment described uses a shortcut key \u201cCtrl+V\u201d (hereinafter referred to as a paste key operation), which is general in Windows (a registered trademark), in which the paste key operation is continued while the \u201cCtrl\u201d key is held, so that a paste candidate is selected from one or more items of copy data stored in the volatile storage area  and the nonvolatile storage area , and the paste key operation is cancelled, with the desired copy data being selected, so that the data to be pasted is confirmed.","In step S, the process is separated in accordance with the interpretation of the operation pattern in step S.

Copy data whose lifetime has expired is erased from the storage area in sequence by the data erasing portion . Accordingly, this can suitably reduce the possibility that copy data remains unintentionally in the extended clipboard  to cause information leakage.","Furthermore, according to the embodiments, the nonvolatile storage area  is provided in addition to the volatile storage area , so that one or a plurality of items of copy data can be stored in these shared storage areas. The stored copy data can be pasted to an application by a simple select operation. The storage of the copy data can be designated by a simple operation between the nonvolatile storage area  and the volatile storage area ; for example, low-secrecy data can be used after the computer  is restarted by being stored in the nonvolatile storage area . In other words, the extended clipboard  according to the embodiments effectively limits the number of remaining data to allow a plurality of data items to be easily shared while improving the security, thus suitably enhancing the convenience of the clipboard.","Furthermore, a clipboard function extended in an application-independent form can be provided by being configured, not as an application specific function, but as a shared library incorporated into an application process. Since the shared library is configured to allow a copy API and a paste API to be monitored to control the flow of copy data, copying of data to the standard clipboard  can be blocked, and thus, information leakage via the existing standard clipboard  can also be suitably prevented.","As described above, according to the embodiments of the present invention, an information processing apparatus, a data duplication method, a program, and a storage medium capable of efficiently limiting the lifetime of data in a shared storage area, typified by a clipboard, can be provided without reducing the ease of operation of users and the convenience of the shared storage area, so that both the convenience and security protection of the shared storage area can be achieved.","The above functions of the present invention can be achieved by computer executable programs described in object oriented programming languages, such as C++, Java (a registered trademark), Java (a registered trademark) Beans, Java (a registered trademark) Applet, Java (a registered trademark) Script, Perl, and Ruby, and can be delivered in a computer readable storage medium or through transmission.","While the present invention has been described in the specific embodiments, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments, and modifications may be made without departing from the scope that those skilled in the art can consider, such as other embodiments, addition, changes, and deletion, any of which is included in the scope of the present invention provided that the operational advantages of the present invention are offered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0089"},"b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0002","num":"0090"},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0003","num":"0091"},"b":"112"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0004","num":"0092"},"b":"114"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0005","num":"0093"},"b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0006","num":"0094"},"b":"122"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0007","num":"0095"},"b":"130"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0008","num":"0096"},"b":"132"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0009","num":"0097"},"b":"134"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0010","num":"0098"},"b":"136"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0011","num":"0099"},"b":"138"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0012","num":"0100"},"b":"140"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0013","num":"0101"},"b":"142"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0014","num":"0102"},"b":"144"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0015","num":"0103"},"b":"146"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0016","num":"0104"},"b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0017","num":"0105"},"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0018","num":"0106"},"b":["300","320","330","340"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0019","num":"0107"},"b":"302"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0020","num":"0108"},"b":["304","332"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0021","num":"0109"},"b":"310"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0022","num":"0110"},"b":"312"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0023","num":"0111"},"b":["316","324","346"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0024","num":"0112"},"b":["322","342"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0025","num":"0113"},"b":"326"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0026","num":"0114"},"b":"344"}]}}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
