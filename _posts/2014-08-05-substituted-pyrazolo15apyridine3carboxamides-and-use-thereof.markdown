{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Stage Application filed under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 of International Application No. PCT\/EP2014\/066780, filed Aug. 5, 2014, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to European Patent Application Nos. 13179782.1, filed Aug. 8, 2013, and Ser. No. 14\/166,893.9, filed May 2, 2014,","The present application relates to novel substituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides, to processes for preparation thereof, to the use thereof, alone or in combinations, for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory centre. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","Through the formation of cGMP and the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion, and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","In the last few years, there have been descriptions of some compounds which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","WO 2012\/072512-A1 and WO 2010\/117787, among other documents, disclose various pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives which can be used for treatment of disorders.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and are suitable as such for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula

encompassed by formula (I), of the formulae specified hereinafter and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, and the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter as working examples and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, to the extent that the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","In the context of the present invention, preferred salts are physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the inventive compounds.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids, for example salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the inventive compounds which, in the solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of solvates in which the coordination is with water. Preferred solvates in the context of the present invention are hydrates.","Depending on their structure, the inventive compounds may exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or if appropriate also as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers, and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically homogeneous constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this purpose, more particularly HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","If the inventive compounds can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the inventive compounds. An isotopic variant of an inventive compound is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the inventive compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass from the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into an inventive compound are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of an inventive compound, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the inventive compounds may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the inventive compounds can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the inventive compounds. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here denotes compounds which may themselves be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example by metabolic or hydrolytic means) to inventive compounds during their residence time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents, unless specified otherwise, are each defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a linear or branched alkyl radical having the particular number of carbon atoms specified.

Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is effected by means of a species-specific plasma\/DMSO formulation, and in the case of dogs by means of a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. In all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage, based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. The removal of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgesic (atropine\/rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 ml s.c.). The blood is taken (generally more than 10 time points) within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation; if required, it can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (which may also be a chemically unrelated substance) is added to the samples of the inventive compounds, calibration samples and qualifiers, and there follows protein precipitation by means of acetonitrile in excess. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions, and subsequent vortexing, is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by means of LC-MS\/MS using C18 reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(terminal half-life), F (bioavailability), MRT (mean residence time) and CL (clearance), by means of a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.","Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (by means of LC-MS\/MS; see above) and determined by calculating the ratio of the C\/Cvalue.","Table B shows data of representative compounds of the present invention following intravenous administration in rats:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1307","num":"2389"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00016","num":"00016"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE B"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"AUC","CL","t","MRT"]},{"entry":["Example","[kg \u00b7 h\/l]","[l\/h\/kg]","[h]","[h]"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["39","0.53","2.46","6.2","7.8"]},{"entry":["43","0.49","2.56","5.9","7.4"]},{"entry":["55","0.37","2.76","2.6","3.5"]},{"entry":["168","0.45","2.19","3.2","4.3"]},{"entry":["169","0.44","2.21","4.0","4.9"]},{"entry":["170","0.32","2.92","2.6","3.4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"To determine the metabolic profile of the inventive compounds, they are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, liver microsomes or primary fresh hepatocytes from various animal species (e.g. rats, dogs), and also of human origin, in order to obtain and to compare information about a very substantially complete hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism, and about the enzymes involved in the metabolism.","The inventive compounds were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1-10 \u03bcM. To this end, stock solutions of the inventive compounds having a concentration of 0.01-1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared, and then pipetted with 1:100 dilution into the incubation mixture. Liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 unit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium, likewise at 37\u00b0 C. After an incubation time of 0-4 h, the incubation mixtures were quenched with acetonitrile (final concentration about 30%) and the protein was centrifuged off at about 15 000\u00d7g. The samples thus quenched were either analysed directly or stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis.","The analysis is carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS\/MS). To this end, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18 reversed-phase columns and variable eluent mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05% formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification, structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolites, and for quantitative metabolic reduction of the compound according to the invention in the incubation mixtures.","B-8. Caco-2 Permeability Test","The permeability of a test substance was determined with the aid of the Caco-2 cell line, an established in vitro model for permeability prediction at the gastrointestinal barrier (Artursson, P. and Karlsson, J. (1991). Correlation between oral drug absorption in humans and apparent drug permeability coefficients in human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. Biochem. Biophys. 175 (3), 880-885). The Caco-2 cells (ACC No. 169, DSMZ, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen, Brunswick, Germany) were sown in 24-well plates having an insert and cultivated for 14 to 16 days. For the permeability studies, the test substance was dissolved in DMSO and diluted to the final test concentration with transport buffer (Hanks Buffered Salt Solution, Gibco\/Invitrogen, with 19.9 mM glucose and 9.8 mM HEPES). In order to determine the apical to basolateral permeability (PA-B) of the test substance, the solution comprising the test substance was applied to the apical side of the Caco-2 cell monolayer, and transport buffer to the basolateral side. In order to determine the basolateral to apical permeability (PB-A) of the test substance, the solution comprising the test substance was applied to the basolateral side of the Caco-2 cell monolayer, and transport buffer to the apical side. At the start of the experiment, samples were taken from the respective donor compartment in order to ensure the mass balance. After an incubation time of two hours at 37\u00b0 C., samples were taken from the two compartments. The samples were analysed by means of LC-MS\/MS and the apparent permeability coefficients (P) were calculated. For each cell monolayer, the permeability of Lucifer Yellow was determined to ensure cell layer integrity. In each test run, the permeability of atenolol (marker for low permeability) and sulfasalazine (marker for active excretion) was also determined as quality control.","B-9. hERG Potassium Current Assay","The hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) potassium current makes a significant contribution to the repolarization of the human cardiac action potential (Scheel et al., 2011). Inhibition of this current by pharmaceuticals can in rare cases cause potentially lethal cardiac arrythmia, and is therefore studied at an early stage during drug development.","The functional hERG assay used here is based on a recombinant HEK293 cell line which stably expresses the KCNH2(HERG) gene (Zhou et al., 1998). These cells are studied by means of the \u201cwhole-cell voltage-clamp\u201d technique (Hamill et al., 1981) in an automated system (Patchliner\u2122; Nanion, Munich, Germany), which controls the membrane voltage and measures the hERG potassium current at room temperature. The PatchControlHT\u2122 software (Nanion) controls the Patchliner system, data capture and data analysis. The voltage is controlled by 2 EPC-10 quadro amplifiers controlled by the PatchMasterPro\u2122 software (both: HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) NPC-16 chips with moderate resistance (\u02dc2 M\u03a9; Nanion) serve as the planar substrate for the voltage clamp experiments.","NPC-16 chips are filled with intra- and extracellular solution (cf. Himmel, 2007) and with cell suspension. After forming a gigaohm seal and establishing whole-cell mode (including several automated quality control steps), the cell membrane is clamped at the \u221280 mV holding potential. The subsequent voltage clamp protocol changes the command voltage to +20 mV (for 1000 ms), \u2212120 mV (for 500 ms), and back to the \u221280 mV holding potential; this is repeated every 12 s. After an initial stabilization phase (about 5-6 minutes), test substance solution is introduced by pipette in rising concentrations (e.g. 0.1, 1, and 10 \u03bcmol\/l) (exposure about 5-6 minutes per concentration), followed by several washing steps.","The amplitude of the upward \u201ctail\u201d current which is generated by a change in potential from +20 mV to \u2212120 mV serves to quantify the hERG potassium current, and is described as a function of time (IgorPro\u2122 Software). The current amplitude at the end of various time intervals (for example stabilization phase before first substance, first\/second\/third concentration of test substance) serves to establish a concentration\/effect curve, from which the half-maximum inhibiting concentration ICof the test substance is calculated.\n\n","The inventive compounds can be converted to pharmaceutical formulations as follows:","Tablet:","Composition:","100 mg of the inventive compound, 50 mg of lactose (monohydrate), 50 mg of corn starch (native), 10 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 25) (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and 2 mg of magnesium stearate.","Tablet weight 212 mg, diameter 8 mm, radius of curvature 12 mm.","Production:","The mixture of inventive compound, lactose and starch is granulated with a 5% solution (w\/w) of the PVP in water.
