{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following application is cross-referenced and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/740,740, entitled \u201cBUSINESS METRICS AGGREGATED BY CUSTOM HIERARCHY\u201d, having inventors Myerson, et al., filed on Apr. 26, 2007.","Information technology (IT) systems are important to maintaining business operations. IT system health is typically monitored by the business to determine how the system is operating and whether business goals are being met. Monitoring IT system health is important to keeping the IT system reliable and effective and for providing a successful business.","Most IT monitoring systems are designed for a specific IT system. Thus, the monitoring system is usually hard coded to address specific features of the particular IT system. To make changes to the monitoring system requires significant time and resources to change the underlying code of the system. For example, changing a typical monitoring system would require a change in monitoring system code, a new executable file, or other significant and time-consuming changes to the system. It is desirable to have a flexible monitoring system for monitoring an IT system.","A metrics generation system provides metrics for an IT, point of sale, manufacturing or some other computing system from different data sources in a single display. Configuration files containing parameters and instructions are loaded by the system to access different data sources. The configuration files may identify the data source location, the data to retrieve, and other information regarding data extraction. Once retrieved, the data is placed into a single data schema, processed, and placed into a metric hierarchy. The metric hierarchy is specified by a user through configuration files. The metrics generation system is flexible in that it can be changed to extract data from different IT data sources, calculate different metric information having a hierarchy of attributes, and display a variety of metric data in different formats.","Data processing and display are performed in a flexible and dynamic manner based on parameters and instructions contained in one or more configuration files. Configuration files are used to define tasks for data extraction, processing and display, set attribute values which define metrics to be calculated and displayed, and otherwise configure aspects of the middle tier and presentation tier of the present technology. The configuration files can be generated by a user manually, through an application in response to user input, as a deliverable such as an update, or some other manner.","One embodiment receives configuration files which include server extraction parameters. A unique query is generated for a first server and second server based on the server extraction parameters. The first server and second server have a different communication interface and are associated with different server extraction parameters. The first unique query is sent to the first server and the second unique query is sent to the second server. Responses having data are received from the first server and second server. The data from the response is loaded and stored in different tables having a same schema.","One embodiment includes a staging database, a presentation database and a data set generation module. The staging database receives configuration files, loads extraction parameters and metric parameters from the configuration files, extracts data from one or more data sources based on the extraction parameters, and generates metrics based on the metric parameters. The presentation database receives metrics from the staging database and aggregates the metrics based on aggregation settings associated with each metric. The data set generation module packages data sets to be displayed. Each data set includes a portion of the aggregated metrics and is defined by metric attributes which are included in the metric parameters.","One embodiment receives configuration files which have metric calculation parameters and display parameters. Two or more sets of data are then retrieved. The data sets are associated with two or more servers based on the configuration files. Each of the two or more servers has data stored in a different schema. Metric data is then generated for each of the two or more servers from the two or more sets of data and the configuration files. The metric data is aggregated for each of the two or more servers, and the aggregated metric data is displayed based on the display parameters in the configuration files for each metric.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A flexible and dynamic metrics generation system provides IT computing system metrics. The metrics generation system retrieves IT system health data, determines and aggregates metrics from the retrieved data based on user defined parameters and displays the metrics based on user preferences. The metrics generation system is flexible in that it can be changed to extract data from different IT data sources, calculate different metric information having a hierarchy of attributes, and display a variety of metric data in different formats.","Data extractions, calculations and display are performed based on parameters and instructions contained in one or more configuration files. To change how data is processed or displayed by the system involves changing the configuration files rather than system code itself. The configuration files are loaded by one or more data bases and applications of the system. Once the configuration files are loaded, the system dynamically changes how it retrieves data, processes data, and\/or displays data to an administrator.","The metrics generation system includes a middle tier and a presentation tier. The middle tier includes one or more databases and other modules which extract data from one or more data sources, process the extracted data, and prepare the processed data to be displayed, all based on one or more configuration files loaded by the middle tier modules. The presentation tier receives the processed data and displays the data for a user based on configuration files having display parameters.","Configuration files are used to define tasks for data extraction, processing and display, set attribute values which define metrics to be calculated and displayed, and otherwise configure aspects of the middle tier and presentation tier of the present technology. The configuration files may be in a particular format, such as extended markup language (XML), and may generated by a user manually or through an application in response to user input. Additionally, a user may change one or more configuration files at any time before or during monitoring of an IT system. For example, in response to changing the configuration files to adjust a particular metric, the metrics generation system is updated to adjust the metric processing and display accordingly.","In some embodiments, configuration files may be comprised of backend configuration files and display configuration files. Backend configuration files may be used to configure a database layer (backend tier) which extracts, processes and stores data from one or more data sources. The display configuration files may include one or more configuration files used to configure a user interface (part of the presentation tier) and the data displayed in the user interface.","By using configuration files to specify system operating parameters rather than hard coding parameters into system modules, the system is easily expandable, flexible and dynamic. For example, data captured from monitoring an IT system may be stored in data sources having different database schema. The configuration files may include parameters and instructions to extract data from each server regardless of the schema it uses. The data from the two or more data stores is then loaded into a single schema and processed. Further, additional data stores may be easily added by manipulating the configuration files. After processing, metrics from any of the data stores may be displayed in a single user interface. This may be achieved by specifying display preferences in the display configuration files for each metric. This is discussed in more detail below.","The present technology may be applied towards an IT system, point of sales application, or some similar system. Though an IT system is referenced at points of this discussion, it is intended that other types of systems may be used as well, such as a point of sales system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","112","114","160","120","130","140","150","160","120","130","140","150","105"]},"Data stores - may contain data collected from one or more IT systems.

Sets of tasks, workflow operations, and constraints can be collected as DTS packages that can be scheduled to run periodically or when certain events occur. In some embodiments, data may be communicated between data stores -, database  and display application  in some other manner. In some embodiments, communication between database  and data stores - may involve a different communication means or service.","Display application  may display metric data for an administrator of an IT system. Display application  receives metric data and other information from database  or some intermediate module between application  and database  (not illustrated in ) and display preferences from one or more configuration files . Display application  may then display the received metric data in user interface  according to the preferences and details specified in one or more of configuration files .

Cubes are relations, wherein a cube operator can be imbedded in non-procedural data analysis programs and treats each of N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in the N-space, and the set of points forms an N-dimensional cube.
