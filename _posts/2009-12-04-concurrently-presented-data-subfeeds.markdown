title: Concurrently presented data subfeeds
abstract: When presenting a news feed (e.g., statuses of contacts in a social media network), it may be inefficient to display the data items in a single column according to a single filter, such as a designated group of contacts. Rather, from the data feed, a set of at least two data subfeeds may be generated based on different filters, and the at least two data subfeeds may be currently presented to the user (e.g., as two or more vertically aligned columns, each presenting a different set of data items based on a different filter.) The user may prefer the concurrent presentation due to the contextual separation of the data items according to different filters, and may more easily administrate the filters and groupings; e.g., dragging data items from one column to another column may alter the filters to achieve a more preferred sorting of data items in future presentations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Within the field of computing, many scenarios involve a presentation of a data feed, such as a set of events in a computing environment, a set of news items published by a news outlet, the statuses of a set of contacts in a social media network, and a set of media items published by a set of media producers. A user may request to view the data feed as a set of data items; e.g., the user may request a column of data items to be displayed as a vertically aligned list or as a tree view. Moreover, among the data items, the user may define a group (e.g., within the user's set of contacts in the social media network, the user may designate a subset of contacts comprising the user's professional colleagues), and may request a view of the data feed filtered according to the group (e.g., a presentation of the statuses of members of the professional colleagues group.)","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Scenarios involving the presentation of a data feed may be difficult or inefficient in various aspects. As a first example, when data items of a data feed are presented in a vertical list, the presentation may inefficiently utilize the width of the display, particularly in view of the prevalence and popularity of wide display devices and of multiple displays arranged in a horizontal configuration. As a second example, it may be inefficient for a user to issue several consecutive requests to filter the data feed according to various groups; e.g., a particular data item might be redundantly displayed in many such presentations, contrary to the preferences of the user. As a third example, it may be difficult for the user to create and manage the groups whereby the data feed might later be filtered.","Alternative techniques for presenting the data feed that might present various advantages involve generating various data subfeeds, each comprising a subset of the data items of the data feed, and concurrently presenting the data subfeeds to the user. For example, in a social media network, the user's contacts might be separated in various groups, such as \u201cFriends,\u201d \u201cProfessional Contacts,\u201d \u201cSchool Contacts,\u201d and \u201cEveryone Else,\u201d and four columns may be concurrently presented to the user in vertical alignment (e.g., having the same Y-axis positions and column heights within the display space), with each column presenting a vertical list of the statuses of the represented contacts. The concurrent presentation of groups (in the exemplary columnar layout or in a different layout) may enable more efficient use of the display space of the user's display device, and may more efficiently present the data feed to the user with contextual grouping. Additionally, concurrently presenting several data subfeeds may permit additional filtering, e.g., by restricting a particular data item to appear in only one displayed data subfeed in order to reduce redundancy, and by allowing the user to transfer data items between data subfeeds in order to manage the filters associated therewith. These and other advantages may be achieved by concurrently displaying various data subfeeds of a data feed in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Within the field of computing, many scenarios involve a presentation of a data feed to a user, where the data feed comprises a set of data items. As a first example, a set of notifications arising within the computing environment, such as the receipt of email, antivirus scans, and the completion of disk management processes, may be presented to alert a user of relevant events. As a second example, a user may subscribe to a source of news, such as via a Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed subscription offered by an RSS publisher of a particular type of data, and a subscription client may present the syndicated data items to the user upon receipt. As a third example, a user of a social media network service may select a set of contacts, and may wish to view the status updates posted by these contacts in some order (e.g., sorted chronologically or by popularity.) As a fourth example, a user may be interested in a set of data items posted to a data sharing service, such as files uploaded to a file store or photos uploaded to a photo sharing service, and may request a list of new data items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","12","18","20","24","20","22","12","20","26","12","20","18","12","18","20"]},"In the exemplary scenario  of , the user  may configure the device  to retrieve the data feed , and to present the data feed  on the display  of the device . However, the data feed  may be presented to the user  in various ways.  presents an illustration of an exemplary scenario  featuring two different presentations to the user  of the data items  comprising the data stream  of . The first exemplary presentation  of  features a simple presentation of the complete data feed , comprising all of the data items  of the data feed  along with some of the metadata items . The data items  are presented in horizontal alignment as a vertical column, and may be sorted in various ways (e.g., sorted chronologically as per the first exemplary presentation , or sorted by popularity or rating.) Alternatively, the user  may wish to view a subset of the data items . For example, the user  may define a group of contributors whose photos are of particular interest (e.g., contributors who are also friends or family members of the user ), and may request to view the subset of data items  in the data feed  submitted by members of this group. The device  may therefore present on the display a second exemplary presentation  of the data feed , comprising only the data items  submitted by members of the group. In this exemplary scenario , the second user may not be a member of the defined group, but the third user may be, so the data items  generated by the third user are presented in the second exemplary presentation  (along with one or more metadata items  describing the respective data items , such as the time of the image.) In this manner, the device  may display different presentations of the data feed  according to the interests of the user .","However, the exemplary presentations illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of  may indicate some potential disadvantages with these techniques for presenting the data feed  to the user . As a first example, it may be appreciated that some data feeds  may be frequently updated, such as by a data source that submits many data items , or by a large set of data sources (e.g., a data feed  of photos that may be submitted by a large body of contributing users.) These data feeds  may be difficult to follow according to the first exemplary presentation  comprising the entire set of data items  of the data feed , because the data feed  may be updated too quickly for the user  to follow as an updating set of data items . Upon each viewing, the user  may be presented with a different set of new data items , instead of a small set of new data items  submitted after the previously viewed data items ; and the user  may have difficulty finding older data items  of interest within the rapidly updated data feed . As a second example, if the data feed  is presented as a vertical column of horizontally aligned data items  (whether or not restricted to a particular group or subset), it may be appreciated that a considerable amount of lateral display space may be unused; e.g., a window hosting the presentation of the data feed  may include significant whitespace to the left or right of the columnar presentation of the data feed . This inefficient use of horizontal display space may be exacerbated, e.g., by the increasing prevalence of wide display devices (such as monitors having a comparatively high width-to-height aspect ratio), and\/or by the increasing popularity of multi-display computer configurations with displays arranged horizontally to present a comparatively wide display space. As a third example, it may be difficult for the user to define and maintain various groups (e.g., frequent maintenance may be involved to keep a current \u201cfriends\u201d group of users.) As a fourth example, it may be frustrating for the user to view consecutively many different groups or presentations of the data feed . For example, viewing the data feed  in various configurations may compel the user  to make multiple selections from a \u201cview by group . . . \u201d combo box or other user control. Also, if a particular data item  falls within many groups, the user  may be presented with the same data item  in many different presentations of the data feed , thereby increasing the frustration to the user by redundantly presenting the same data item  in several presentations and reducing the value of maintaining multiple groups. In these and other ways, it may be inefficient to present the data feed  to the user  according to the exemplary presentations illustrated in .","Presented herein are alternative techniques for presenting the news feed  to the user  in a more advantageous manner. These techniques involve passing the data items  of the data feed  to two or more filters, where each filter specifies a different set of criteria that may be applied to the metadata items  of the respective data items  of the data feed . For example, a first filter might specify a particular set of criteria, such as that the author of the image is from a certain group, and that the image was created within a certain timeframe (e.g., within the current calendar year.) A second filter might specify a different set of criteria, such as that the author of the image is from the same group, but that the image was created within a different timeframe (e.g., within the previous calendar year.) Each filter may be applied to the metadata items  of respective data items , and some data items  may pass through the filter to create a data subfeed, while others are excluded by the filter and from the data subfeed. Therefore, each filter produces a different data subfeed, each comprising a subset of data items  from the data feed . (Each data subfeed may contain a distinct set of data items  as compared with any other data subfeed; or may contain an identical set of data items  as another data subfeed, but may have selected the same data items  according to a different set of criteria.) After at least two data subfeeds have been generated according to different filters, the data subfeeds may be concurrently presented to the user  as a different data subfeed group on a display of a device. For example, the data subfeeds may be presented as two or more vertically aligned columns, each column presenting a horizontally aligned set of data items  comprising a different subfeed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["40","20","26","26","20","22","20","26","42","20","26","42","42","44","20","2","20","20","42","46","48","26","50","20","3","20","48","52","46","52","54","56","16","40","46","54","20","22","52","56","20","26","58","22","20","60","16","66","62","64","16","68","16","16","12","20"]},"As per these techniques and as illustrated in , the data feed  may be presented to the user  as a set of data subfeeds, each comprising a different set of data items  (or, at least, a similar set of data items  selected according to a different set of criteria.) This presentation may present several advantages with respect to other presentation techniques (such as illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of .) As a first example, the concurrent presentation of two or more data subfeeds might improve the user's review of the contents of the data feed , particularly where the data feed  includes a large number of data items  and\/or is frequently updated. The data feed  is thereby segmented into a set of smaller data subfeeds, each comprising a smaller set of data items  with a particular contextual theme that may be of interest to the user . As a second example, the concurrent presentation of data subfeeds in different data subfeed groups (e.g., as a set of vertically aligned columns) may more efficiently utilize the lateral area of the display  of the user's device. As a third example, in some implementations of these techniques, a data item  may be prevented from being included in more than one concurrently displayed data subfeed group in order to reduce the redundant presentation of the data item  to the user . As a fourth example, in some embodiments, the user  may be permitted to manipulate the data items  of the respective data subfeeds, and such actions may be used to adjust the filters associated with the corresponding subfeeds. For example, if a user  drags a data item  from a first column to a second column, the criteria of the first filter corresponding to the first column may be adjusted to exclude the data item  (and, perhaps, other data items  that are inferred to be similar to the moved data item ) from the first column, while the criteria of the second filter corresponding to the second column may be adjusted to promote the inclusion of the moved data item  (and, perhaps, other data items  that are inferred to be similar to the moved data item ) in future presentations thereof. These and other potential advantages may be achieved, and\/or disadvantages may be reduced, by presenting the data feed  according to the techniques discussed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["70","16","70","72","74","26","20","20","22","70","76","22","20","26","42","46","78","22","20","26","48","52","80","16","54","20","46","56","20","52","26","70","82"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["90","90","92","94","96","26","20","20","22","12","92","26","42","48","20","26","90","98","26","96","98","100","22","20","26","42","46","22","20","26","48","52","98","102","96","104","20","46","106","20","52","98","26","12"]},"Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data . This computer-readable data  in turn comprises a set of computer instructions  configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment, the processor-executable instructions  may be configured to perform a method of presenting a data feed comprising at least one data item on a display of a device, such as the exemplary method  of . In another such embodiment, the processor-executable instructions  may be configured to implement a system for presenting a data feed comprising at least one data item on a display of a device, such as the exemplary system  of . Many such computer-readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects, and some variations may present additional advantages and\/or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover, some variations may be implemented in combination, and some combinations may feature additional advantages and\/or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments (e.g., the exemplary method  of  and the exemplary system  of ) to confer individual and\/or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.","A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein these techniques may be utilized. As a first example of this first aspect, the techniques may be utilized with many types of devices featuring displays, such as a workstation computer having a large display, possibly comprising several monitors positioned laterally to present a comparatively wide display space; a portable personal computer, such as a netbook, having a somewhat smaller display; and a mobile phone having a comparatively small display. The device might also comprise a set of two or more devices; e.g., a server, such as the server of the data feed , may generate the data subfeeds, and may send the data subfeeds to a device  operated by the user  for presentation on the display  of the device . As a second example of this first aspect, many types of implementations may be devised that embody the techniques discussed herein. For example, in the exemplary scenario  of , respective components of the exemplary system  may be implemented as, e.g., a volatile memory (such as system RAM) or static memory (such as flash RAM) comprising instructions that implement the architecture of one or more components and the respective configurations thereof; a static circuit, such as a semiconductor, that is configured to perform the logic of the component; a programmable circuit, such as an FPGA or EEPROM, that is configured to perform the logic of the component; or a combination of such implementations.","As a third example of this first aspect, the data feed may comprise many types of data items  representing various types of items, such as notable events arising within a computing environment; media objects, such as documents, pictures, sounds, videos, or three-dimensional models; data objects, such as applications, databases or database records, or files; representations of physical entities, such as devices or individuals; or a combination of such objects. The data items  comprising the data feed  might also include many types of data, including the full contents of the data item ; a description of the data item  (e.g., a thumbnail version or text description of an image or photo, or the first few lines of a document); one or more metadata items  associated with the data item ; a link to access the data item ; or simply a notification that one or more new data items have been received. The data feed  may also be received and\/or compiled from one or more data sources; e.g., the data feed  may comprise a first data item  received from a first data source (such as a first user or a first server) and a second data item  received from a second data source (such as a second user or a second server.) Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios wherein the techniques discussed herein may be advantageously utilized.","A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of generating one or more filters used to select data items  from the data feed  to comprise a data subfeed. As a first example of this second aspect, the filter may use many types of criteria, while performing the selection of data items , including criteria that utilize Boolean logic (e.g., specifying particular features of metadata items  that are to be exactly or approximately matched to include a data item  in the data subfeed, or to exclude a data item  from the data subfeed) and\/or fuzzy logic (e.g., a scoring system that estimates the comparative degree of belonging of a data item  to a particular data subfeed, based on an iterative evaluation of the metadata items  of the data item .) As a second example of this second aspect, the filter may apply many types of evaluative processes to the data items , including an expert system based on a set of heuristics, a neural network, a genetic algorithm, a Bayesian classifier, an explicitly programmed logical hierarchy or flowchart, or various other forms of statistical and\/or logical analysis.","As a third example of this second aspect, the filter may apply the criteria to one or more aspects of respective data items ; e.g., by applying a criterion to one metadata item  (e.g., \u201cselect all images authored by the second user\u201d), to several metadata items  (e.g., \u201cselect all images having the word \u2018cow\u2019 in the filename, caption, or description of the image\u201d), or to the metadata items  of several items (e.g., \u201cexamine all of the images generated by the second user, and select the image having the latest creation date and time.\u201d) The metadata items  may also be stored inside the data item , stored with the data item  (e.g., in an encapsulation container), stored separately from but associated with the data item  (e.g., in a metadata table of a database), and\/or synthesized in relation to the content or other metadata items of the data item  (e.g., metadata indicating the objects presented in an image that may be generated by applying an image recognition algorithm to the image.)","As a fourth example of this second aspect, the logic embodied by these criteria and\/or implemented by these evaluative processes may be generated in many ways. In a first set of embodiments of this fourth example, the logic may be specified by one or more users  (including a user who generates the data items , a user who provides the data feed , and\/or the user  to whom the data feed  is to be presented.) For example, such users may select one or more criteria for selecting data items  to comprise a data subfeed, including one or more inclusion criteria specifying at least one metadata item  whereby matching data items  are included by the filter, and\/or one or more exclusion criteria specifying at least one metadata item  whereby matching data items  are excluded by the filter.","In a second set of embodiments of this fourth example, one or more criteria of a filter may be inferred by identifying one or more commonalities among the metadata items of respective data items  in the data feed . For example, an embodiment may examine the metadata items  of the data items  of a data feed  in order to identify commonalities among a subset of such data items  that may imply a contextual relationship (e.g., authorship by a specific individual or group of individuals; receipt from a particular data source; creation within a particular time frame; and\/or shared keywords or topical tags.) The embodiment may therefore generate a filter with criteria specifying such commonalities, and may present the subset of data items  as a data subfeed having a contextual basis. In one such embodiment, respective data items  may be generated by at least one entity having a relationship with the user  to whom the data feed  is to be presented; and among the data items  of a data feed  generated by various entities, at least one commonality may be identified among the metadata items  thereof related to the relationships of the entities with the user , and this commonality may be included in a filter and used to generate a data subfeed. For example, a data feed  comprising a photo stream may feature data items  generated by entities having different relationships with the user  as represented in a social media network, such as a friend, family, or professional colleague relationship with the user . If several data items  have metadata items  indicating authorship by entities represented as professional colleagues of the user , this metadata item  may be identified as a commonality among such data items , and a \u201cphotos created by professional colleagues\u201d filter may be created to generate a corresponding data subfeed of the data feed .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["120","122","124","122","22","20","26","120","26","22","124","124","124","20","124","20","124"]},"In a third set of embodiments of this fourth example, one or more criteria of a filter may be inferred based on actions performed by the user , which may indicate various relevant aspects, such as the user's preferences for various data items ; the user's perceptions of contextual relatedness of various data items ; affirmation of or disagreement with the criteria of a filter; and\/or the representation of underlying groups upon which such criteria are based. For example, such embodiments may identify a user action associated with one or more data items , may identify at least one relevant metadata item of the data item  that may have motivated the user action, and may infer at least one filter criterion of at least one filter based on the at least one relevant metadata item. The filter may then be used to generate a data subfeed that takes into account the past user actions of the user, such as by improving the contextual relatedness of selected data items  or presenting to the user  a data subfeed of greater interest, based on the user interests previously expressed by the user .","In a first scenario involving this third set of embodiments, a user action may indicate a user interest of the user  in a particular data item , such as clicking on a thumbnail representation of an image to request a full-size image, or time spent playing a particular video or audio segment that is of apparent interest to the user . An embodiment may endeavor to identify at least one relevant metadata item  that may have motivated the user interest of the user  in the data item , and may endeavor to infer at least one filter criterion of a filter based on the relevant metadata items. This embodiment may therefore present or improve a filter that is configured to select data items  having the at least one relevant metadata item  may motivate the future user interest of the user . This filter may resemble a \u201cFavorites\u201d filter, where particular qualities of data items  that may have evoked the interest of the user  may be used to infer future interest in similar data items  that may also be of interest to the user .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["130","122","124","122","20","130","26","12","12","12","22","130","26","12","22","122","44","124","20","122","124","26"]},"In a second scenario involving this third set of embodiments, the user action may comprise a request to create a new data subfeed comprising at least one data item . The embodiment may then endeavor to identify at least one distinctive metadata item  of the selected data items , in order to determine why the user  has requested to create a new data subfeed comprising these data items . For example, the metadata items  of the selected data items  may be compared with the metadata items  of unselected data items  of other data subfeeds, in order to identify one or more commonalities among the selected data items  that are not shared by the unselected data items , where such commonalities may imply a distinctive contextual relationship among the selected data items . If such distinctive metadata items  may be identified, the embodiment may generate a new filter having criteria based on these metadata items , which may be utilized to select other data items  that share these commonalities, and that the user  may wish to include in the new data subfeed. In one such scenario, the data subfeeds may be displayed as vertically aligned columns, and an empty column may be displayed alongside the columns for the data subfeeds. If the user  drags one or more data items  into the new column, the embodiment may evaluate the dragged data items  for commonalities, may generate a new filter with criteria based on the identified commonalities, and may present to the user  a new column for a data subfeed generated with the new filter. This embodiment may therefore facilitate a user in creating new data subfeeds in a convenient manner, and populating the data subfeed with other data items  that are inferred to be contextually related to the selected data items .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["140","122","124","140","54","56","144","20","144","122","44","20","140","12","122","44","122","142","20","12","20"]},"In a third scenario involving this third set of embodiments, the user action may comprise a request to add at least one data item  to an existing data subfeed. The embodiment may then endeavor to identify at least one relevant metadata item that may promote the inclusion of the added data item  (and similar data items ) to the data subfeed, such as by identifying at least one relevant metadata item  of the selected data item  that has a commonality with metadata items  of the data items  already in the data subfeed. The filter of the data subfeed may then be adjusted by inferring at least one inclusion criterion based on the at least one relevant metadata item . Conversely, the user action may comprise a request to remove at least one data item  from a data subfeed. The embodiment may then endeavor to identify at least one relevant metadata item that may promote the exclusion of the removed data item  (and similar data items ) from the data subfeed, such as by identifying at least one relevant metadata item  of the selected data item  that contrasts the metadata items  of the data items  remaining in the data subfeed. The filter of the data subfeed may then be adjusted by inferring at least one exclusion criterion based on the at least one relevant metadata item . These processes may facilitate the user in adjusting the filters of the data subfeeds in order to achieve a more desirable data subfeed (e.g., where the data items  of the data subfeed are more contextually related.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["150","20","26","150","54","20","56","20","144","20","144","144","26","20","54","26","20","56","3","2"]},"In a fourth scenario involving this third set of embodiments, a user action  may be used not only to update the filters of respective data groups, but to update other sets of information that is also compiled by the user . These categories may have category criteria, similar to the filter criteria of the filters for respective data subfeeds. Moreover, if a filter of a data subfeed is updated, the updates to the filter criteria of the filter may be propagated back to the category criteria category; e.g., upon updating at least one filter criterion, the embodiment may update the at least one category criterion based on the update of the at least one filter criterion. For example, the user  may define a category as a group of contacts comprising \u201cfriends\u201d among the entire set of contacts represented in a social media network, and may specify category criteria designating individual contacts or groups of contacts for inclusion in the \u201cfriends\u201d category. Similarly, a filter of a data subfeed may be generated as a \u201cphotos by friends\u201d data subfeed, which may comprise selects data items  produced by particular contributors who are also designated as friends. If the user  chooses to remove some or all data items  produced by a particular contributor from the \u201cfriends\u201d data subfeed, an inference may be drawn that this particular contributor is no longer a friend of the user , and category filter of the \u201cfriends\u201d category may be adjusted to exclude the corresponding entity from the category. Those of ordinary skill in the art may involve many types of user actions , many types of inferences therefrom, and many resulting effects on the data subfeeds and\/or filters that may be incorporated in the techniques discussed herein.","A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to improvements in the application of one or more filters to the data feed . As a first example of this third aspect, redundancy in the presentation of data items  among the set of data subfeeds may be reduced by removing data items  from the second data subfeed  that are included in the first data subfeed . For example, if a data item  is found to be selected by one filter for inclusion in a particular data subfeed, the data item  may be removed from other data subfeeds or excluded from consideration by the filters of other data subfeeds. Alternatively or additionally, and as a second example of this third aspect, a data subfeed may be generated to include some or all of the data items  that are excluded from the other data subfeeds. This data subfeed may comprise an \u201ceverything else\u201d data subfeed that presents data items  that are not contextually related to the data items  comprising the other data subfeeds (according to the criteria of the respective filters.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["160","26","26","20","122","44","122","44","46","52","26","26","20","52","20","122","20","54","46","56","52","54","66"]},"A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of concurrently presenting the data subfeeds comprising the data feed . As a first example of this fourth aspect, the data subfeeds may be presented in many ways. In one such example, the data subfeeds may be presented as vertically aligned columns that are positioned laterally across the display ; e.g., a first data subfeed may be presented as a first data subfeed column comprising horizontally aligned data items  of the first data subfeed, while a second data subfeed may be presented as a second data subfeed column comprising horizontally aligned data items  of the second data subfeed, where the second data subfeed column is vertically aligned with respect to the first data subfeed column. Other presentations may also be available, and may present some advantages and\/or reduce disadvantages as compared with the columnar view when presented on particular displays. For example, the data subfeed groups may be presented as a set of horizontally aligned rows, where each data subfeed group is displayed as a set of vertically aligned data items . This presentation might be advantageous, e.g., when presenting a large number of data subfeeds, each having a small set of data items, on a comparatively tall display.","As a second example of this fourth aspect, the user  may be permitted to toggle between displaying the full data feed  and display the data subfeeds. For example, upon receiving a request from the user  to present the data feed , an embodiment may present on the display  a data feed group comprising the data items  of the data feed  (instead of the data subfeed groups); and upon receiving a request from the user  to present the data subfeeds, the embodiment may concurrently present on the display  the first data subfeed group comprising the data items of the first data subfeed and the second data subfeed group comprising the data items of the second data subfeed instead of the data feed group.","As a third example of this fourth aspect, the user  may be permitted to assign names to the data subfeeds; e.g., upon receiving a request from the user  to assign a data subfeed name to a data subfeed, the data subfeed name may be stored and related to the data subfeed; and when the data subfeed group of the data subfeed is subsequently presented, the data subfeed name may be presented with the contents of the data subfeed. Alternatively or additionally, upon receiving from the user  a group display request relating to the presenting of a data subfeed group (e.g., a request by the user  to display a particular data subfeed group in a particular region of the display ), the data subfeed group of the data subfeed may be displayed according to the group display request. Moreover, in some embodiments, the group display request of the user  may be stored related to the data subfeed; and upon subsequently presenting the data subfeed group of the data subfeed on the display , the embodiment may retrieve a stored group display request related to the data subfeed, and may display the data subfeed group according to the stored group display request. For example, if the user  requests to display a particular data subfeed group in a region of the display  having a particular position, size, shape, zoom factor, opacity, etc., the user action may be stored as a group display request, which may be persistently applied to the data subfeed group during subsequent presentations thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["170","170","54","56","16","170","20","20","162","12","174","12","144","172","54","56","56","172","174","54","56","16"]},"Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
