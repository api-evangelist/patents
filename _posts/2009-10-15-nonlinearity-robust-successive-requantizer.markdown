No. 61\/105,635, which was filed on Oct. 15, 2008.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. CCF0515286 awarded by National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","A field of the invention is wireless communications. Another field of the invention is digital to analog converters. Example applications of the invention include high-performance digital communication systems such as cellular telephone handsets and wireless local and metropolitan area network transceivers.","Virtually all wireless communication systems require local oscillators for up-conversion and down-conversion of their transmitted and received signals. Most commonly, the local oscillators are implemented as fractional-N PLLs (phase locked loops). Fractional-N PLLs can generate a high quality, high frequency signal from a digital input stream and a lower frequency reference waveform.","The spectral purity of the local oscillator in a transceiver is a critical factor in overall transceiver performance. Communication standards therefore explicitly or implicitly stipulate stringent phase noise requirements on the local oscillators. Most standards dictate the maximum acceptable phase noise power in various frequency bands. Additionally, most standards require that spurious tones in the local oscillator's phase noise be highly attenuated, particularly in critical frequency bands. DACs also have stringent spurious tone requirements in wireless applications, digital audio applications and instrumentation applications. Digital audio and instrumentation spurious tone requirements are particularly critical in many consumer products.","Modern digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs) rely upon a digital delta-sigma modulator (\u0394\u03a3 modulator) to coarsely quantize a constant or slowly varying digital sequence. The quantized sequence can be viewed as the sum of the original sequence plus spectrally shaped quantization noise that has most of its power outside of a given low-frequency signal band. Ultimately, the quantized sequence is converted to an analog signal and further processed by analog circuitry including a low-pass filter to suppress quantization noise outside of the signal band.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1B"],"sub":["ref ","ref ","dlv","ref","dlv","CP ","ctrl","ref","dlv","ref "],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","108","100"]},"If y[n] could be set directly to the desired fractional value, a, directly then the output frequency of the PLL would settle to (N+\u03b1)f, thereby achieving the goal of the fractional-N PLL. Unfortunately, y[n] is restricted to integer values because the divider  is only able to count integer VCO cycles whereas a is a fractional value. To circumvent this problem y[n] is designed to be a sequence of integers that average to \u03b1. The input to the \u0394\u03a3 modulator  is \u03b1 plus pseudo-random least significant bit (LSB) dither, so its output has the form y[n]=\u03b1+s[n], where s[n] is a zero-mean sequence consisting of spectrally shaped \u0394\u03a3 quantization noise and LSB dither. The dither prevents s[n] from containing spurious tones that would otherwise show up as spurious tones in the PLL's output. Hence, the output frequency settles to an average (N+\u03b1)f, as desired, although s[n] introduces phase noise.","For most wireless applications spurious tones can be sufficiently suppressed only with design tradeoffs that significantly degrade other aspects of performance. This is particularly problematic in fractional-N PLLs wherein the input to the modulator usually is a constant and the output sequence from the modulator is converted to analog form and subjected to various nonlinear operations because of nonideal circuit behavior. The common approach to address spurious tones is to make the analog circuitry very linear so that the spurious tones have sufficiently low power for the given application. This limits design options and results in higher analog circuit power consumption than would be required if fewer linear analog circuits could be tolerated.","The tradeoffs tend to increase power consumption and circuit area, limit the choice of reference frequencies, and dictate low PLL bandwidths which preclude on-chip loop filters. They also become less effective in system-on-chip designs as CMOS circuit technology is scaled into the sub-100 nanometer regime. Therefore, the spurious tone problem negatively affects power consumption, cost, and manufacturability of wireless transceivers, and the problem gets worse as CMOS circuit technology scales with Moore's Law.","To address the quantization noise, researchers have described methods of implementing noise-shaped quantizers. See, e.g., A. J. Magrath and M. B. Sandler, \u201cEfficient Dithering of Sigma-delta Modulators with Adaptive bit Flipping,\u201d Electron. Lett, vol. 31, no. 11, pp. 846-847, May 1995; S. H.

However, these methods specifically focus on stabilizing noise-shaped coders and do not address the effect of nonlinearities on the quantization error.","An embodiment of the invention is a successive requantizer, which serves as a replacement for a \u0394\u03a3 modulator in a fractional-N PLL or DAC, and avoids the above-mentioned spurious tone problem, thereby circumventing the tradeoffs that result from reliance on common approach of making highly linear analog circuitry to avoid spurious tones. A successive requantizer fractional-N PLL of the invention has the potential to reduce power consumption and the cost of commercial communication devices. A successive requantizer of the invention performs digital quantization one bit at a time in such a way that the quantization noise can be engineered to have desirable properties such as non-linearity robustness. The invention is applicable to most high-performance digital communication systems, such as cellular telephone handsets and wireless local and metropolitan area network transceivers.","It is critical spurious tones in the noise introduced by DACs and fractional-N PLLs have very low power. Unfortunately, spurious tones are inevitable in the phase noise of fractional-N PLLs. In principle, dither applied to a modulator can prevent the quantization noise from containing any spurious tones whatsoever. In practice, digital delta sigma modulators are major sources of spurious tones in oversampling DACs and fractional-N PLLs and are believed by the present inventors to give rise to spurious tones whenever their quantization noise is subjected to nonlinear distortion.","The present invention identifies and addresses a surprising fundamental source of spurious tones in fractional-N PLLs, namely, the digital \u0394\u03a3 modulator. The fractional-N PLL is identified as the fundamental source of spurious tones in the PLL's phase noise. This is true even when dither is used to prevent spurious tones in the \u0394\u03a3 modulator's quantization noise. Regardless of how dither is applied, spurious tones are induced when the \u0394\u03a3 modulator's quantization noise is subjected to non-linear distortion. In a typical \u0394\u03a3 modulator used in a fractional-N PLL, the interaction of the constant input and the modulator's first accumulator gives rise to hidden periodicities. Dither provides sufficient randomness to avoid spurious tones in y[n], but not to avoid spurious tones when s[n] is subjected to nonlinear distortion.","This is particularly problematic in fractional-N PLLs wherein the output sequence from the \u0394\u03a3 modulator is converted to analog form and subjected to various non-linear operations because of non-ideal circuit behavior. In embodiments of the invention, a successive requantizer replaces the \u0394\u03a3 modulator and avoids the spurious tone problems. The successive requantizer can also serve as a replacement for a \u0394\u03a3 modulator in digital analog converter, and example embodiment DACs take the same form as a fractional-N PLL.","An embodiment of the invention is a successive requantizer, which serves as a replacement for a \u0394\u03a3 modulator in a fractional-N PLL, and avoids the above-mentioned spurious tone problem, thereby circumventing the tradeoffs that result from reliance on common approach of making highly linear analog circuitry to avoid spurious tones.

The drawings may include schematic representations, which will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows. Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale.","Fractional-N PLLs used in communications applications and DACs using \u0394\u03a3 modulators ultimately generate analog waveforms.

Therefore, a is scaled by 2prior to the successive requantizer to convert it into an integer. As explained below, the 3-bit integer-valued output of the successive requantizer is y[n]=\u03b1+s[n], where s[n] is quantization noise.

Generalized for an input that is a sequence of B-bit numbers, x[n], and an output that is a sequence of B-K-bit numbers, x[n], where n=0, 1, 2, . . . , is the time index of the sequences. The generalization is shown in . The successive requantizer then consists of K quantization blocks , each of which quantizes its input by one bit, so the successive requantizer quantizes K bits overall. Each quantization block generates a quantization sequence, s[n], with the property that x[n]+s[n] is an even number for each n, where x[n] is the quantization block's input sequence. The quantization block adds s[n] to x[n] and discards the least significant bit (LSB) to implement the 1-bit quantization. Without loss of generality, numbers within the successive requantizer are taken to be integers with a two's-compliment binary number representation. Since x[n]+s[n] is an even number for each n, its LSB is zero, so discarding the LSB does not incur a truncation error. Hence, the quantization noise of the successive requantizer is a weighted sum of the s[n] sequences.","The properties of the quantization noise s[n] can be engineered by appropriate design of the s[n] sequences. So far, the only restriction on the s[n] sequences is that x[n]+s[n] must be an even integer for each n and d.

These state transition matrices ensure that the (s[n])and (t[n])sequences are free of spurious tones because each is a random process whose autocorrelation function converges to a constant as its time spread increases. Furthermore, the PSD of s[n] has a zero at \u03c9=0 and increases at 6 dB per octave as \u03c9 increases from zero. In this respect, the quantization noise shaping of this version of the successive requantizer is comparable to that of a first-order \u0394\u03a3 modulator.","Successive requantizers with higher than first-order quantization noise shaping can also be designed. For example, second-order quantization noise shaping can be achieved by quantization blocks that calculate s[n] as a function the running sum of t[n] in addition to t[n], a random sequence, and the parity of x[n]. However, the fractional-N PLL in this work is a phase noise cancelling fractional-N PLL, so higher than first-order shaping is not necessary because most of the quantization noise is removed prior to the loop filter via a DAC.","The running sums of each t[n] sequence, i.e.,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":["d","i"],"mo":","}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"k"}}}],"mo":"="},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":",","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["t","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"10"}}]}}}}},"can be bounded for all n, and each t[n] has a smooth power spectral density that increases monotonically with frequency.","A tradeoff related to the quantization block in  is that its reduced susceptibility to nonlinearity-induced spurious tones comes at the expense of increased quantization noise power.

Any particular design will benefit from analytical quantification of the tradeoff and its effect on the performance of a particular fractional-N PLL, and especially in the case of a PLL that lacks phase noise cancellation. Preferred embodiments of the invention use a phase noise cancelling PLL design, such as the design that is described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/352,293 (\u201cthe '293 application\u201d), filed Jan. 12, 2009, and entitled Adaptive Phase Noise Cancellation for Fractional-N Phase Locked Loop (which application is incorporated by reference herein).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":"ref"},"The  fractional-N PLL includes the successive requantizer  to that is shown in  and the remainder of the circuit preferably conducts adaptive phase noise cancellation as conducted by the preferred embodiments in the '293 application. The  fractional-N PLL includes a sampled loop filter  that drives a VCO , with preferred embodiments using a sampled loop filter having two separate loop filter halves that drive separate half-sized parallel varactors in the VCO  as in the '293 application. An amplifier  uses a 12 MHz crystal and supplies the reference clock voltage to a phase frequency detector\/charge pump . The timing of pulses in the reference voltage and pulses received from the divider  determines whether the PFD\/Charge pump will produce a positive or negative pulse of current to increase or decrease the VCO frequency. The successive requantizer  acts as discussed above to provide a sequence of values that average to a desired fractional value. A noise cancellation path including a filter , dithered quantizer , segmented DEM  encoder and DAC bank , discrete-time integrates the quantization noise to obtain a digital sequence and transform it via the DAC  into a current pulse of fixed duration and variable amplitude that equals the quantization noise portion of the charge in the corresponding charge pump pulse. A prototype integrated circuit in accordance with  also included alternate circuitry that could be enabled or disabled, including a \u0394\u03a3 modulator which could be optionally be used instead of the successive requantizer and an offset pulse generator  that can be enabled or disabled. In the IC prototype, the loop filter's sampling could be enabled or disabled, and when it was disabled, the loop filter reduces to a conventional loop filter.","The divider  is similar to the divider in the '293 application, except with minor changes to provide timing signals that control the offset current generator  and open the loop filter switch each reference period. As described in '293 application, the necessary timing signals are obtained by a chain of flip-flops clocked at half the VCO frequency. The timing signal used to close the loop filter switch each reference period could similarly have been derived within the divider block, but an RC one-shot circuit, timed from an output of the divider block, with a nominal duration of 25 ns was used in the prototype integrated circuit instead for simplicity because the length of time the switch is left open is not critical. Provided the switch is open when the loop filter's input current is non-zero, the PLL dynamics are relatively insensitive to the length of time it is open. Testing of the prototype with the successive requantizer, offset pulse generator, and sampled loop filter enabled and \u03b1 chosen such that \u03b1f=50 kHz revealed fractional spurs well inside the 975 kHz loop bandwidth, but all below \u221270 dBc in power. Four copies of the IC were tested. Table 1 shows the worst-case measurements taken from the four ICs. An IC wiring mistake disabled the DAC calibration circuitry, so the measurements described above were made after a one-time manual adjustment of the DAC gain. To confirm the diagnosis of the mistake, it was corrected in one copy of the IC by FIB microsurgery, but with the anticipated side effect of a coupling path that increased the measured in-band phase noise, 3 MHz phase noise, and largest in-band fractional spur by 10 dB, 3 dB, and 3 dB, respectively, above those shown in Table

quantization noise discussed above still leaves flexibility in the design of the s[n] sequences. This flexibility is exploited to ensure that s[n] for p=1, 2, . . . , h, and t[n] for p=1, 2, . . . , hare free of spurious tones, where hand hare positive integers. By definition, if s[n] and t[n] contain spurious tones at a frequency \u03c9, then Equations (2) and (3) above, respectively, are expected to be unbounded in probability at \u03c9=\u03c9as L>\u221e. Therefore, to establish that there are no spurious tones in either s[n] or t[n], it is sufficient to show that Equations (2) and (3) are bounded in probability for all |\u03c9|\u2266\u03c0 as L\u2192\u221e. A spurious tone at \u03c9=0 is just a constant offset. Many practical systems are able to tolerate, or compensate for this offset so this case is excluded from consideration. Theorems 1 and 2 below present sufficient conditions on the s[n] sequences for (2) and (3) to be bounded in probability for every L\u22671 and 0<|\u03c9|\u2266\u03c0, thereby ensuring the absence of spurious tones in s[n] and t[n]. First-order highpass quantization noise is achieved with quantization blocks that implement equation (11) above. Results imply that neither s[n] nor t[n] contain spurious tones. Therefore, s[n] and t[n] inherit these properties provided the r[n] sequences for d=0, . . . , K\u22121 are independent.","However, if the quantization noise or its running sum is subjected to non-linear distortion, spurious tones can be induced. The presence of spurious tones implies that subjecting t[n] to second-order distortion is sufficient to induce spurious tones even though t[n] is known to be free of spurious tones.","The spur generation mechanism can be understood by considering the first quantization block. Suppose the input to the successive requantizer is an odd-valued constant and t[n\u22121]=0 for some value of n. Then (11) implies that (s[n], s[n+1]) is either (\u22121, 1) or (1, \u22121) depending on the polarity of P[n]. It follows from (5) that (t[n], t[n+1]) is either (\u22121, 0) or (1, 0), and, by induction, t[n] has the form { . . . , 0, \u00b11, 0, \u00b11, 0, \u00b11, 0, . . . }. Therefore, t[n] has the form { . . . , 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, . . . } which is periodic. A similar, but more involved analysis can be used to show that the t[n] sequences for d>0 also contain periodic components. These periodic components cause the spurious tones.","For the purpose of illustrating the principle of successive requantization for tone free quantization sequences, the remainder of the description assumes that the input to the quantizer, x[n], is an integer-valued and deterministic sequence for n=0, 1, . . . , and that the successive requantizer is designed such that the following properties are satisfied:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0074"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00010","num":"00010"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["o","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["x","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}},{"mi":"mod","mo":"\u2062","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["if","is","odd"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}}},"mo":","}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["if","is","even"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}}},"mo":","}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"13"}}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"is called the parity sequence of the dquantization block.
