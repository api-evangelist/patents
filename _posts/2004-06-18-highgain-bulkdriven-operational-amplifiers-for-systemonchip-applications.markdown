title: High-gain, bulk-driven operational amplifiers for system-on-chip applications
abstract: An ultra-low voltage rail-to-rail operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is based on a standard digital 0.18 Î¼m CMOS process. Techniques for designing a 0.8 volt fully differential OTA include bias and reference current generator circuits. To achieve rail-to-rail operation, complementary input differential pairs are used, where the bulk-driven technique is applied to reduce the threshold limitation of the MOSFET transistors. The OTA gain is increased by using auxiliary gain boosting amplifiers.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/479,506, filed Jun. 19, 2003, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.","The work leading to the present invention was supported in party by the DARPA\/ITO under AFRL Contract F29601-00-K-0182, the National Science Foundation under Contract No. CCR-0304574, and the Fulbright Program under Grant No. 87481764. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to a bulk-driven operational amplifier and more particularly to such an amplifier exhibiting high gain, suitable for use in system-on-chip applications requiring low power.","The reduction in the minimum dimensions in VLSI technologies, along with the trend of using small portable devices, necessitates reduced power supply voltages. In order to facilitate submicrometer high density systems on a single integrated circuit (IC), voltage levels must be lowered to ensure reliability. Threshold voltages of future CMOS technologies may not decrease much below what is available today, making it difficult to design analog circuits with lower supply voltages.","In analog circuit design, the threshold voltage of a transistor should be lowered in proportion to the reduction in the supply voltage to appropriately bias the device. This characteristic makes standard low voltage analog circuits incompatible with CMOS technology trends. To combat this conflict without requiring the development of expensive CMOS technologies with lower threshold voltages, novel circuit design techniques must be developed that are compatible with future CMOS technologies.","A promising approach in low voltage analog circuits is the so-called \u201cbulk-driven\u201d MOSFET method. In this method, the gate-to-source voltage is set to a value sufficient to form an inversion layer, and an input signal is applied to the bulk terminal. In this manner, the threshold voltage of a MOSFET can be reduced or even removed from the signal path.","The concept of a bulk-driven MOS transistor was first proposed in A. Guzinski, M. Bialko, and J. C. Matheau, \u201cBody-Driven Differential Amplifier for Application in Countinous-Time Active-C Filter,\u201d , pp. 315\u2013319, June 1987, as active components in an OTA differential input stage. Later, in 1991, the concept was used in the practical realization of a software-programmable CMOS telephone circuit, as reported in F. Dielacher, J. Houptmann, and J. Resinger, \u201cA Software Programmable CMOS Telephone Circuit,\u201d -, Vol. 26, No. 7, pp. 1015\u20131026, July 1991. However, not until 1998 did the method draw significant attention as a viable low-voltage analog design technique, as reported in B. J. Blalock, P. E. Allen, and G. A. Rincon-Mora, \u201cDesign 1-V Op Amps Using Standard Digital CMOS Technology,\u201d , Vol. 45, No. 7, pp. 769\u2013780, July 1998. Specifically, in Blalock et al, a 1 volt Op Amp was designed in a standard CMOS digital process utilizing the depletion characteristics of bulk-driven transistors.","One important drawback of the bulk-driven method, however, is that the body transconductance gis approximately five times smaller than the gate transconductance g. Thus, when the input differential pair of an amplifier is composed of bulk-driven transistors, the resulting DC gain is relatively low. This behavior is the primary reason for the low gain (around 45 dB) in previously reported bulk-driven amplifiers, as reported in Blalock et al and in F. Bahmani and S. M. Fakhraie, \u201cA Rail-to-Rail, Constant-G, 1-Volt CMOS Opamp,\u201d , Vol. 2, pp. 669\u2013672, May 2000.","It is thus an object of the present invention to improve the gain of bulk-driven amplifiers. To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to an ultra-low voltage rail-to-rail operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) which can be based on a standard digital 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process. To achieve rail-to-rail opera-tion, complementary input differential pairs are used, where the bulk-driven technique is applied to reduce the threshold limitation of the MOSFET transistors. The OTA gain is increased by using auxiliary gain boosting amplifiers. This additional circuitry enables the OTA to operate at 0.8 volts, achieving an open loop gain of 68 dB while consuming 94 \u03bcW. The DC gain of the amplifier is the highest gain achieved to date in bulk-driven amplifiers.","In a preferred embodiment, a 0.8 volt fully differential folded-cascode OTA is presented. Both PMOS and NMOS bulk-driven input differential pairs are used to achieve full rail-to-rail operation. A continuous-time common mode feedback circuit is adopted in order to suppress variations in the output common mode. Four common-source gain boosting amplifiers are used to increase the gain to the target level of 68 dB (the DC gain was around 48 dB before gain boosting). That gain is the highest gain achieved to date in bulk-driven amplifiers. A bias circuitry which generates the required bias voltages for the amplifier core along with a low-sensitivity reference current generator circuit are also used in the preferred embodiment.","The design of an ultra-low voltage, high performance folded-cascode OTA circuit in a standard digital CMOS process will be disclosed. To accommodate a low power supply voltage (0.8 volt), the bulk-driven MOSFET approach is used. The low gain disadvantage of the bulk-driven technique is circumvented by employing gain boosting amplifiers, permitting the achievement of a DC gain of 68 dB. Due to a lower body transconductance, bulk-driven amplifiers inherently exhibit relatively poor gain. The low gain is the primary reason why amplifiers reported in Blalock et al and in Bahmani et al have only exhibited a DC gain as high as 45 dB. The present invention offers an advantage in that that bulk-driven amplifiers can be modified to operate with low power supply voltages while still exhibiting performance levels that satisfy the demands of state-of-the-art mixed-signal circuits.","Aspects of the present invention are disclosed in the following paper, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure: Jonathan Rosenfeld, Mucahit Kozak and E. G. Friedman, \u201cA 0.8 volt high performance OTA using bulk-driven MOSFETs for low power mixed signal SOCs,\u201d , September 2003, pp. 245\u2013246.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.","The amplifier core  of an OTA is illustrated in . This circuit is based on a fully differential topology with two complementary input pairs , . The output branch  includes common gate amplifiers M, Mwith cascode current loads ,  to increase the gain. A common mode feedback circuit (CMFB) ,  is used with four auxiliary common source amplifiers. The operation of the OTA is explained in greater detail below.","Rail-to-rail operation is achieved using a pair of PMOS (; Mand M) and NMOS (; Mand M) transistors at the input stage. This strategy supports rail-to-rail (0 volt to 0.8 volt) operation of the amplifier; thus, the input common mode range (ICMR) is extended to the largest possible range. This increased range is achieved because when the input common mode voltage is low, the P-type pair is on and the N-type pair is off, while when the input common mode is high, the P-type pair is off and the N-type pair is on. In the middle range, however, both pairs are on, providing a higher overall gain.","The output branch  of the OTA includes two symmetric common gate (CG) amplifiers (Mand M). Both amplifiers have cascode current loads (, including Mand M; and , including Mand M) to increase the gain. The bias current is provided to Mand Mby the current sources Mand M, respectively, which also operate as current loads for the P-type input pair (Mand M). Note that a complementary structure is also implemented for the N-type input pair. Transistors Mand Mact as current sources for the N-type input pair.","Auxiliary common source (CS) amplifiers (, including M, M, M, and M; and , including M, M, M, and Mshown in ) provide a target open loop gain of at least 60 dB. In this way, stacking multiple transistors in the output branch is avoided, providing more overdrive voltage to maintain the transistors in the saturation region, while simultaneously increasing the voltage gain. The output of the CS amplifier is connected to the gate of the CG amplifier so as to maintain an almost constant source voltage. This source node is fed back as the input voltage to the CS amplifier. In this way, the local feedback action reduces the variations in the bias current when the source voltage of the CG amplifier changes, thereby increasing the output resistance.","The CMFB circuit (, including M, M, M, and M; and , including M, M, M, and Mshown in ) is used to suppress the variations in the output common mode, particularly in applications with feedback. These variations occur due to mismatches among the transistors. These mismatches cause a difference between the DC operating voltages in the outputs (V and V). Furthermore, by forcing the output common mode to a specific level (normally halfway between Vand ground), the range of the input common mode is increased.","The CMFB circuit was first proposed in B. Razavi, , New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001. In this configuration, transistors M, M, M, and Moperate in the linear region, acting as voltage controlled resistors. When the DC operating point at the output differs from the target common mode voltage, a change in the tail current of the input pair occurs, resulting in an increment or decrement in the bias currents. This effect restores the DC operating point to the desired voltage level.","In order to ensure that the transistors operate in the saturation region (or in the linear region for some of the transistors in the CMFB circuit), fixed bias voltages are applied either to the gate or body of the transistors. The bias voltage generator circuit  is shown in .","Due to limited voltage headroom, simple voltage dividers are used to generate the bias voltages (Vthrough Vin ). Transistors M, M, and Mact as current mirrors for the transistor M, providing the appropriate currents to generate voltages V, V, and V. A complementary structure is also applied to generate voltages V, V, and V. Transistor Mis the current mirror of M, which is biased with a constant current source I(1 \u03bcA).","A low-sensitivity reference current generator circuit  is illustrated in . Because the gate and source of Mand Mare common for both transistors, and the aspect ratios are equal, I=I(neglecting channel length modulation). Furthermore, note that V=V+IR.
