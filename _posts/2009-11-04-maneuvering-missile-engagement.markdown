title: Maneuvering missile engagement
abstract: A hostile missile is identified as being of a type which maneuvers aerodynamically within the atmosphere when it performs an exoatmospheric maneuver which significantly changes its specific energy. When the determination is made that the hostile missile is an atmospheric maneuvering missile, the hostile missile is engaged with an interceptor which is guided toward a predicted intercept point (PIP) assuming horizontal hostile missile flight at an altitude above a specified minimum altitude.

The Government has certain rights in this invention.","Missile threats are propagating throughout the world, with unstable nations believed to be in possession of both ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. Attention has been directed toward countermeasures for hostile missiles. There are many aspects to the problems of engaging hostile missiles. For example, there are limitations on the knowledge of where and when a missile launch may take place, so the sensors or intelligence necessary for accurate identification and tracking may not be available or in place. If the path of the hostile missile is not known, it cannot, in general, be engaged, and may achieve its hostile intent. If sensors such as radar or infrared systems are available, they may produce useful target tracking information, but such sensors are subject to the deleterious effects of noise and various types of uncertainty, such as uncertainty as to the actual location of the sensor and its direction. These uncertainties are compounded when multiple sensors view the region in which the hostile target is found, as the differences among the sensors may result in the appearance of more hostile missiles than actually exist, or possibly fewer.","It may not be possible to locate the sensors the launch point of the hostile missile. Consequently, the missile may not be detected until it is well into its flight, as when it is in the exosphere, at which time its booster engines may be exhausted. In such a scenario, the hostile missile may have to be engaged in its terminal or ballistic phase. Engagement may be accomplished by use of an interceptor missile. Various missile tracking and interceptor missile control schemes have been proposed or used.","If countermeasures are available near the launch site of a hostile missile, engagement in the boost phase might be possible. Boost phase engagement is desirable, so as to avoid problems associated with hostile missile countermeasures. Such countermeasures may include deployment of decoy objects to tend hide the location of the reentry vehicle and to confuse the interceptor missile control system. A description of a method for targeting a reentry vehicle within a group of decoys appears in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/473,032 filed May 27, 2009, (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,115,148) in the name of Boardman et al. Boost phase engagement is rendered difficult by limitations on the ability of sensors to acquire the hostile missile target at or near the time of launch due to obscuring terrain features. Additionally, the boosting missile changes its mass as propellant is consumed, and the time at which the boost engine cuts off is not known in advance, so its velocity from moment to moment may be difficult to determine. Even if the track of the hostile missile is well established, additional problems with engagement involve initiation of the control system of an interceptor missile, and details of the interceptor missile controls. Boost-phase engagement of hostile missiles is described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/958,421 filed Dec. 18, 2007, in the name of Pedersen, and in many other references.","Guidance of interceptor missiles is rendered difficult because of the transition of the hostile or target missile from boost mode to ballistic mode at some point in its trajectory. Some of the problems associated with targeting of a hostile missile are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/395,830 filed Mar. 2, 2009, (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,106,340) in the name of Diaz et al.","In the continuing race between the designers of attack missiles and the designers of countermeasures, hostile missiles are improved by becoming more sophisticated. Among such improvements is the introduction of missile maneuvers during exo-atmospheric and endo-atmospheric flight. Such maneuvers may defeat ballistic missile engagement systems which are predicated on ballistic motion of the target.","Improved missile engagement is desired.","A method according to an aspect of the invention is for engaging a ballistic missile target. The method comprises the steps of sensing a ballistic target, and measuring its exoatmospheric position, and determining its exoatmospheric velocity. The method further comprises the determination, from time to time, of the specific energy of the target. The specific energy determined at a given time, such as the time of the current update, is compared with that determined at an earlier time, namely the time of a previous update, to generate a specific energy difference. The specific energy differences are compared with a threshold. In response to each difference in the specific energy being below the threshold the steps are repeated of determining the specific energy of the target, processing the specific energy of a current determination with that of a previous determination to generate a specific energy difference, and comparing the difference with a threshold. In response to the difference being greater than the threshold, the target is deemed to be maneuvering exoatmospherically and to be of a type which transitions from exoatmospheric ballistic motion to aerodynamic flight within the atmosphere. When the target is so identified, the interceptor missile is guided toward an expected intercept point within the atmosphere. The expected intercept point, in one mode of the method, is found by (a) determining a ballistic intercept point assuming that the target follows a ballistic trajectory and (b) modifying the ballistic intercept point toward which the interceptor missile is guided to account for the aerodynamic flight characteristics. In a most preferred mode of the method, the step of modifying the ballistic intercept point toward which the interceptor missile is guided includes the step of maintaining the minimum value of the predicted altitude of intercept above a given value, or in the alternative the step of preventing the minimum value of the predicted altitude of intercept from dropping below a minimum.","A method according to an aspect of the invention is for engaging a ballistic missile target. The method comprises the steps of sensing a ballistic target, measuring its position, and determining its velocity, and, from time to time, determining the exoatmospheric specific energy of the target. The method further comprises the step of processing the specific energy of a current determination of the specific energy with that of a previous determination, which may be the immediately preceding determination, to generate a specific energy difference. The specific energy difference(s) is or are compared with a threshold energy. In response to the difference in specific energy being below the threshold energy, the steps are repeated of determining the specific energy of the target, processing the specific energy of a current determination with that of a previous determination to generate a specific energy difference, and comparing the difference with a threshold. In response to the difference being greater than the threshold, the target is deemed to be maneuvering and to be of a type which transitions from exoatmospheric ballistic motion to aerodynamic flight within the atmosphere. An expected intercept point within the atmosphere is determined, and an interceptor missile is guided toward the expected intercept point. In one mode of this method, the step of determining an expected intercept point includes the steps of determining a ballistic intercept point assuming that the target follows a ballistic trajectory, and modifying the ballistic intercept point to account for the aerodynamic flight. The step of modifying the ballistic intercept point toward which the interceptor is guided may comprise the step of maintaining the predicted altitude of intercept above a threshold value of altitude.","In a preferred mode of the method, the step of determining an expected intercept point within the atmosphere may comprise the step of taking the difference between the current altitude of the target and the threshold value, and determining the time-to-go for the target to reach the threshold value. In this mode, a determination is made of a speed ratio related to the absolute velocity of the target and the horizontal velocity of the target. The horizontal pseudocomponents of velocity of the target in horizontal flight is or are determined by multiplying the horizontal components of the target velocity by the speed ratio. A determination is made of pseudo-horizontal-position of the target. This determination is made by adding the current horizontal position of the target to the quotient of (a) the difference between the pseudocomponents and the target velocity components (b) divided by the time-to-go.","A method according to another aspect of the invention is for engaging a target missile. This method comprises the steps of tracking the target missile with a sensor, and computing sensor-to-target range, target velocity, and interceptor-to-target range. The interceptor average velocity is computed, and the target missile relative heading to intercept is computed assuming ballistic motion of the target missile. The interceptor relative heading to intercept is computed assuming ballistic motion of the target missile. Interceptor time-to-go to intercept is computed assuming ballistic motion of the target missile, and a predicted intercept point is computed assuming ballistic motion of the target missile. A determination is made if (a) the predicted intercept point assuming ballistic motion is less than a threshold altitude and (b) the target missile is capable of aerodynamic flight. If (a) the predicted intercept point is less than a threshold altitude and (b) the target missile is capable of aerodynamic flight, the kinetic parameters of the target missile are adjusted to reflect horizontal motion at the threshold altitude. Target missile relative heading to intercept is computed assuming adjusted motion of the target missile. Interceptor relative heading to intercept is computed assuming adjusted motion of the target missile. Interceptor time-to-go to intercept is computed assuming adjusted motion of the target missile. A predicted intercept point is computed assuming adjusted motion of the target missile. Interceptor range-to-go to intercept point is computed. Interceptor heading error to the intercept point is computed, and the heading error is applied to guide the interceptor.","In a particular mode of this method, the step of determining if (b) the target missile is capable of aerodynamic flight comprises the steps of, from time to time, determining the exoatmospheric specific energy of the target missile. The exoatmospheric specific energy of the missile during successive determinations is computed, to establish the magnitude of exoatmospheric specific energy changes. The magnitude(s) of the specific energy changes are compared with a threshold energy level, and if the specific energy changes exceed the threshold, the target missile is deemed to be capable of aerodynamic flight. The successive determinations may be immediately successive determinations.","Specific energy of a missile in flight is the sum total of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. Once the boost phase of flight is completed, the remaining flight is ordinarily ballistic, and the specific energy represents the total energy imparted to the missile. Once the boost phase is completed, specific energy can be used to determine the maximum ground range to the impact point.","A significant change in specific energy of a missile during what was previously ballistic flight indicates that additional energy is being added to the missile system and is indicative of a maneuver. The addition of energy may increase or decrease the specific energy. It should be noted that the specific energy of a ballistic missile has some variability, and the minimum usually occurs at apogee (that portion of an orbit at which the separation of masses is maximum). According to an aspect of the invention, exoatmospheric specific energy changes greater than a particular threshold are deemed to be indicative of aerodynamic maneuvering capability. The identification of a aerodynamic maneuvering capability, in turn, can be used to trigger appropriate engagement system responses to preserve interceptor missile intercept capability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","10","10","14","16","18","18","20","14","16","18","16"],"i":["a ","b","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["210","212","16","14","212","200","214","216","218","218","222","16","20","200","220"]},"The target maneuver in the exoatmosphere (the transition between target track and of ) is what the specific energy threshold of block  of  detects in order to deem the target to be aerodynamically maneuverable.

A scale factor of target velocity is calculated as the ratio of magnitude of total velocity and horizontal velocity. For a descending target this results in a value greater than 1. The horizontal components of target velocity are multiplied by the scale factor to create an adjusted velocity with the vertical component set to zero, to thereby represent level flight. The target horizontal position components are adjusted by adding the product of the difference in current velocity components and adjusted velocity components and the target time of flight to the threshold altitude. The adjusted target vertical position is set to the threshold altitude value. This adjusted target position is illustrated by  in .
