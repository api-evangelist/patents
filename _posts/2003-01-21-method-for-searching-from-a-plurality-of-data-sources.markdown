title: Method for searching from a plurality of data sources
abstract: A method of searching for information on a computer information network comprises providing a searchbase comprising a plurality of descriptive packets, wherein each packet is associated with one of a plurality of information sources published on a computer information network and includes a query language and template usable therewith, a sending protocol usable therewith and a receiving protocol usable therewith. A search request is received over the computer information network from a user for retrieving information from the plurality of information sources in accordance with given search criteria. The search request is transformed into an inquiry capable of searching the searchbase and the searchbase is searched with the inquiry to identify any of the plurality of information sources which potentially meet the given search criteria. The search request is transformed into queries for the identified information sources, wherein each query is in accordance with the query language and query template in the descriptive packet for the corresponding information source and the queries are sent over the computer information network to the identified information sources in accordance with the sending protocol in the descriptive packet for the corresponding information source. Information is received over the computer information network from the identified information sources in response to the queries in accordance with the receiving protocol in the descriptive packet for the corresponding information source.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DEFINITIONS","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation application of application Ser. No. 09\/441,270 filed Nov. 16, 1999 and now pending.","The present invention relates to methods for searching for information in a plurality of information sources connected to a computer information network and specifically to searching databases on the Internet.","The ARPANET, a predecessor to what is now called the Internet, was started in the late 1960's under J. C. R. Licklider at the Defense Department as a way for a government research funding agency to save costs and to allow its users to share information by having its researchers share computers rather than each institution having its own. Using hardware and software protocols developed for this purpose, users could be at their own terminals but access a computer anywhere on the network as if it were in their own location. The targeted use was remote terminal access, but other uses (such as electronic mail) quickly became widely used. In those early days the number of computers was small and many of the researchers knew each other, because the only computers allowed on the network were those belonging to institutions funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense (\u201cARPA\u201d, later called \u201cDARPA\u201d). Over time many more computers (and users) were added, and access to the Internet became more widespread as the National Science Foundation allowed its researchers and others affiliated with its initiatives to connect to the DARPA network (which later became known as the Internet).","In the 1990's two major evolutions occurred that helped lead to the explosive growth of the Internet. The first was that commercial enterprises were allowed to connect their computers to the Internet without the prior requirement of having a government-funded research project. And second, the World-Wide-Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d) protocols and software were created.","From the earliest days a few commercial enterprises were allowed to connect to the ARPANET. However, this was carefully controlled by DARPA, which allowed only those at the cutting-edge of computer research (such as Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and the computer laboratories of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to connect. Later other companies' internal networks were inter-connected (such as IBM's BITNET) as the value of being able to communicate rapidly among companies, government agencies, and educational institutions became clear. But there was little incentive for most other companies and institutions to connect. The ideas underlying the Web had been germinating for some time. Tim Berners-Lee managed the research group at CERN that introduced the Web protocols and software in 1990 that is credited with making these concepts practical and accessible to millions of people. This was done just at the right time to capture the attention of most of the computing world, including the information technology industry and the media. The Web embodied, simultaneously, easy-to-use software and the promise of universal access to a large variety of information. Building on years of Internet protocol development, creation of freely-accessible content, the evolution of low-cost computer networking, and a growing desire for operating system and hardware-independent standardized access, the Web quickly became a dominant computer phenomena of the second half of the 1990's.","This has resulted in explosive growth of the Internet. The number of computers attached to the Internet is estimated to have increased from fewer than one million in January, 1993 to over 40 million six years later. It is also estimated that the number of users with access to the Internet will have increased from 20 million in 1996 to 140 million in 2002.","Along with the explosive growth in computers and users came an even more explosive growth in the information available to those users. Each computer connected to the Internet is potentially a source of information (although many are accessible only to people within a security perimeter, because they are inside a corporate or other institution). Each computer may contain thousands or millions of documents and information files. This is in contrast to the early days of the network, when only a limited number of computers contained documents and files relevant to a limited a set of research subjects. Compounding the issue is the great diversity of information available. Many of the information nuggets available do not fit neatly into the world's standard information classification schemes (e.g., the Dewey Decimal System or the Standard Industrial Classification codes for companies).","The Internet is a great advance for the communications ability of individuals and organizations, because many individuals and most organizations have the financial means to connect to the Internet. Furthermore, a great deal of the world's explicit information (that is, information that is written, graphic, audio or visual) is also available on the Internet. But this very success has caused a major problem that is slowing the usefulness of the Internet itself. The problem is the difficulty of locating relevant information in answer to any particular query.","Current technologies for search-and-retrieval all suffer from problems which cause retrievals to contain irrelevant, non-existent, and out-of-date references, and additionally to contain so many references that the retrievals overwhelm the capacity of a person to find the particular information sought.","Prior art information retrieval processes typically use the measures of \u201cRecall\u201d and \u201cPrecision\u201d to assess the efficacy of an approach. Today, the immense size and dynamic nature of the Internet, which has become the database of choice of most people and which is searched most frequently, requires the additional evaluation measures of Ranking and Timeliness.","Recall: Recall is a measure of the completeness of retrieval. Recall is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant documents returned to the total number of relevant documents in the database. For example, if one is looking for information about widgets, and working with a database of one million documents in which there are 100 relevant documents, a search which returns 40 of those 100 has Recall of 0.4 (40\/100). The Recall factor is independent of the total number of returns obtained from the search.","Precision: Precision is a measure of the purity of retrieval. Precision is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant documents returned to the total number of documents returned. In the previous example, if the search had returned 50 documents in total, then the Precision would be 0.8 (40\/50). The Precision factor is independent of both the total number of documents, and the total number of relevant documents, in the database.","Ranking: Ranking is a means of helping the user locate the information sought when the retrieval is very large, and consists of the search system indicating to the user some measure of the level of relevancy of each response. This is in recognition of the fact that people get overwhelmed by too large a retrieval, and typically look only at the first few responses. A retrieval list of 1,000 unranked responses is virtually worthless, except to suggest to the user to limit the search. No good metrics have been developed yet for comparing the Ranking of different search systems.","Timeliness: Timeliness is a measure of the relevancy of responses in a retrieval due to the age of the responses. The concept of Timeliness is related to the fact that information generally loses its value with time. This simplification is clearly incorrect when it come to historical data which does not change with time, but it is generally true when applied to descriptions of the present (e.g., the names of movies playing this week). Timeliness concerns not only the issue of out-of-date responses (e.g., an old list of \u201cmovies playing this week\u201d), but also the issue of the age of the index itself (e.g., an old index may not contain documents about current \u201cmovies playing this week\u201d. No good metrics have been developed yet for comparing the Timeliness of different search systems.","It must be remembered that the user making the search is almost always interested in the Recall and Precision of the search results relative to the actual documents, not in the Recall and Precision of the search results relative to the index entries. Thus, a search methodology which obtains perfect Recall and perfect Precision on its index entries, but which returns index entries which reference only documents which no longer exist, is of little use to the searcher. This can happen if the index is out-of-date; i.e., if the index is very low in Timeliness. Thus, higher Timeliness tends to make for higher Recall and higher Precision by decreasing the number of out-of-date entries, and increasing the number of relevant entries, in the search space.","Ideally, Recall and Precision would be 1.0, Timeliness would be high, meaning that all responses would be current, and the Ranking of the responses would agree exactly with the ranking the user would make. This would mean that only relevant documents would be located, and that all relevant documents would be located.","There are a number of current approaches to solving the generalized query problem. The major ones include:","Directories of categories, with knowledge sources attached to the category most appropriate to them. The Dewey Decimal System is an example of this approach, while newer examples include the Internet directories such as Yahoo! and the Open Directory Project.","Structured-form domain-specific databases that contain information directly or references to that information. User queries are converted to database queries in a language such as SQL (Structured Query Language). An example would be a database of books, where each item in the database (information about a particular book) contains fields such as the author's name, the title of the book, the publisher, the date published, and so on.","Free-form text archives. The free-form text systems work with a set of documents by creating indexes which contain each word along with references to the documents in which that word is contained. A user query can then be analyzed for the words it contains, and a list of documents containing those words can be retrieved from the indexes. Refinements include the use of common word filtering (removes \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, etc.), Boolean combinations (\u201cand\u201d, \u201cnot\u201d, etc.) of the words sought, phrases (search for the phrase \u201cpoisoned by food\u201d), proximity (the word \u201cfood\u201d within 20 words of the word \u201cpoison\u201d), word stems (e.g., converting plurals to singular form), wildcards, word-level synonyms, and so on. Current Internet search engines typically work on this principle.","Concept search. A representation of the meaning of the information source is created, and then matched with the meaning of a query. There are a variety of approaches to this, generally falling under the heading of \u201cnatural language understanding\u201d and \u201cknowledge representation\u201d.","None of the foregoing approaches has solved the basic Internet search problems, and each has distinct strengths and weaknesses.","The directory approach is somewhat effective, and sometimes produces useful results (it has reasonable Precision, but poor Recall). The Dewey Decimal System has been in use for quite some time, but provides only a starting point for search. The Standard Industrial Code that classifies companies is not useful in the context of most queries and is being supplanted. In the Internet, Yahoo's hundreds of categories covers a small percentage of the World Wide Web sites; the Open Directory Project's 8,000+ categories is still a small percentage of the desired number. Further, many find that information items are misclassified or that the information sought cannot be found using a directory structure because either there is no mechanism for following the directory hierarchy to find the information, or the information does not fall clearly into any of the allowed categories, or the category to which it belongs is so broad that it has too many entries (in some cases millions).","Categories are similar to the field definitions in a structured database system: they define and thus limit the search space. The chief benefit of the Directory approach is the nature of hierarchy itself\u2014in a Directory one always can be assured that there is a place to put every kind of information. Unfortunately, this does not adequately solve the search problem.","Domain-specific databases limit search to predefined dimensions (e.g., a given database might permit one to search for a book by author but not by genre). There is little possibility that this technology could answer a search that falls outside its domain of discourse, because the domain defines the universe to be queried. A famous example of this in the research literature discusses the issue of when a database field is defined as a person's hair color, but the person is bald. Structured databases appear to work only within relatively small domains of interest which can be tightly bounded. Even in such circumstances, there may be multiple valid (but different) views of (i.e., sets of dimensions for) a domain. For example, the nature and representation of a \u201ccustomer\u201d varies not only among different companies, but also within parts of a single company. Domain-specific databases have good Recall and Precision, but only within their domain of discourse.","The most-used technique for wide-scale search today is the Free-form text search. Its primary advantage is that the indexing can be done completely automatically, thus enabling a larger coverage of existing sources than the approaches described above. Traditional commercial information retrieval services (such as Dialog) work primarily with this technology. Most Internet search engines also use this approach as their basic technology. They work by having a spider program read all Web pages they can reach and create large indexes of the words they find (including the words in the \u201cmeta-tags\u201d that an author has added to the page to help indexing). Depending upon the sophistication of the technology used, these indexes can be created from the entire document or from only the first few lines, or from word stems as well as the complete words, or from word synonym tables or thesauruses.","Several different technologies have been developed to facilitate the search for information within computer databases using the Free-form text approach. The following is a brief discussion of each of the major techniques, along with a summary of their relative strengths and weaknesses.","Boolean search is the earliest, most primitive technology. It lets the user specify words or terms to be searched using logical operatives like \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, and \u201cnot\u201d. This results in retrievals high in Recall, rather low in Precision, and poor in Ranking, and their Timeliness depends entirely on the age of the database.","Fuzzy Boolean search lets the user specify a series of words or terms, then ranks the matching documents in order of those containing all of the terms, then all but one, etc. This allows the user to add more terms to their search parameters, and maintain high Recall, but also increase Precision, at least at the top of the list. Unfortunately, this type of search only reveals the obvious, as it has no means of discovering relevant documents that may contain similar terminology, and it is no better than regular Boolean with regards to Ranking or Timeliness in most cases.","Vector-based search goes an additional step in ranking by looking at the rate of occurrence of the specifying terms in each document relative to their rate of occurrence in all documents in the database. It assumes that specified terms which are relatively rare in the collection are more important, and gives higher ranking to documents in which they occur. In addition to this recognition of global statistics, Vector-based search technology uses a geometric model to create a different axis for each specified term, and gives a value for the relative frequency of occurrence of the term in each document. Thus every document can be located as a vector within the space of the model. What often happens is that similar documents group in one area of the model, and the user can then create a query to select all documents within that area. While Vector-based searching can improve Precision, it won't improve Recall, because it will not bring back documents that are relevant, but don't contain the initial query terms. Compared to Fuzzy Boolean, it improves Ranking, but brings back the same documents, and has no effect on Timeliness.","Thesaurus-based search attempts to increase Recall. Here, a thesaurus of terms which are synonymous with various terms contained in the database is manually created. Thus when the search terms are specified, the search engine also looks for synonyms, increasing Recall but often results in lower Precision due to the widening effects of using synonyms. Unfortunately, because of the time-intensive nature of creating a thesaurus, this method is cost-effective only to small databases which are relatively narrow in their subject matter. Thesaurus-based search is no better than vector-based search in Timeliness, and can be worse with respect to Ranking.","Automatic Query Expansion search creates a thesaurus automatically by including terms that have a high coincidence in documents that contain the specifying terms. Then the search engine performs a second query, including the newly-created thesaurus terms. This gives some of the Recall benefit of thesaurus-based systems, but still tends to adversely affect Precision, although Ranking and Timeliness are not affected.","Structured Query search typically requires the user to set up a very complicated query, which may take an experienced user as long as 30 minutes to develop. This is fine for sophisticated users who have the time, but it is impractical for the typical Internet information seeker.","Latent Semantic Indexing search is the only technology in this list which completely bypasses the Boolean process. Like Vector-based search, it creates a geometric representation of each document in the database. By reducing this information to a matrix and using mathematical manipulation, it attempts to correlate related terms and thus recognize the separable contents of each document. This helps increase Recall, Precision, and Ranking, but at a great computational cost which makes it very slow and impractical for large databases, and as with all other prior art methods, Timeliness is dependent upon the age of the database.","There are a variety of other approaches used to improve the results of the basic Boolean search. These include word frequency, pattern-based searches, popularity and search-by-example refinement.","Word frequency ranking is a standard technique to count the number of times that each word appears in a document. However, it makes the overly simplistic assumption that the more often a word appears, the more likely the word is to represent the content of the document. The document's rank, that is, the closer it will be placed to the beginning of the result list, is then based on the count. In general, ranking documents is a technique designed to compensate for low precision.","Another technique is to use pattern-based logic, or variants of fuzzy logic, which allows the user to specify information in a more general way. This can be as simple as use of \u201cwildcards\u201d in a search pattern. For example, the pattern \u201cown*\u201d might indicate that the user wants documents containing any of the words \u201cown\u201d, \u201cowns\u201d, \u201cowner\u201d, \u201cowning\u201d, etc. Another type of fuzzy search is described above as fuzzy Boolean search. More sophisticated techniques in this area include attempts to define a set of words that are similar in intent to each word in a vocabulary (in effect, a thesaurus), and expand the search to include such similar terms (for example, searching for \u201cown\u201d might also automatically search for documents containing the word \u201cpossess\u201d). In general, fuzzy logic is a set-theoretic numeric technique that is very difficult to apply in non-numeric areas such as words and concepts, and thus has not been widely available in this area.","Another attempt to increase Ranking is the use of popularity measures. This technique keeps track of query terms and the responses that people actually view afterwards. This information is then used with future queries: the terms contained in a query are looked up in the history database, and the results are ordered based on their popularity in terms of actual usage in the past. Another popularity technique is to use the number of hyperlinks that point to a page as a measure of its importance, and likelihood of being appropriate. Popularity techniques are based on the assumption that what people looked at is what they really wanted to find, and that future queries will have the same goals.","Search-by-example refinement allows the user to look at the list of response results and designate some that are the most appropriate. The system then attempts to create a search that will be more likely to retrieve information similar to those. Technically, the system creates a more complex set of Boolean conditions based on the attributes of the given examples. The problem is that it is not clear to the system which attributes of the responses are the ones the user is indicating, and this technique has not proven effective in practice. The existence of this technique is yet another indication of the poor results generally experienced with Free-form text retrieval technology.","All of these free-form text approaches suffer from the problem that the search system does not understand either the information in its domain of discourse, or the query. This basic failing results in returning irrelevant results (often far too many), and in missing relevant ones.","Concept search attempts to solve the first of these problems. All of the concept search approaches tried to date define \u201cconcept\u201d in various ways and then use this notion of concept as a node in a directory hierarchy. They then use the directory methods as described above. Each approach has some methodology to extract the concepts from the user query, which are then used to determine hierarchy nodes that are relevant. These nodes have information sources (usually documents or Web pages) linked to them, which are displayed as the result of the query.","Definitions of \u201cconcept\u201d have included ad-hoc terms that the researcher deems a concept, synonym sets that attempt to define a concept as a whole, and some computer-executable language constructs based on the predicate calculus (a central term with conditions attached, such as the concept of a \u201cman\u201d as a person whose gender is male.) Each approach has a different way to extract the \u201cconcepts\u201d from a user query, for example, if concepts are defined as synonym sets then the words used in the query are indexed in a thesaurus to get the relevant synonyms.","Other work has been undertaken at the Digital Library project at Stanford University. However, its efforts are directed at the creation of lower level enabling technologies for the effective and efficient search and retrieval of text based documents as are commonly found in electronic libraries.","These systems all suffer from problems of the limited nature of current natural language systems (they work on only limited domains of discourse); the primitive notion of concept; and the lack of robust mechanisms to describe the concepts involved in information sources.","In addition to the problems with the prior art methods discussed above, none of the above techniques solves\u2014or even attempts to solve\u2014the problem of Timeliness. This is because the indexing methods used assume that all information put into the index is static, i.e., that the page indexed will be obtained again at a later time at the same URL address.","This assumption that most indexed information is static information is increasingly incorrect for two reasons. First of all, even so-called static pages (e.g., historical text) can be changed, the most common example being that the page goes out of existence entirely. (What Web searcher hasn't had the experience of searching for some particularly obscure item only to find that the URL of the seemingly best return \u201ccannot be located on this server\u201d?)","But of even more importance is the fact that an increasing number of pages on the Web are either pages of a type which themselves do not contain information typically sought but which are the gateways to such information (e.g., a query form of a vendor), or are pages which themselves are dynamically generated (i.e., pages which are created only at the time of being accessed). Prior art indexing methods typically ignore query forms, and typically are fooled into indexing the words of a dynamically generated page even though the next accessing of that page will almost certainly find different words than those which were indexed.","The prior art methods used by central authorities (e.g., a \u201cMall\u201d on the Web) for searching multiple databases belonging to multiple vendors include: (1) copying all of the databases into one centralized database and converting them all into one uniform database; (2) sending the same form of query to all of the databases, regardless of the form of query which the database was organized to receive; and, (3) sending a customized query to each database, the customized query being generated by a computer program manually written specifically for that database by a programmer.","The first method is used internally in enterprises under the label of an \u201centerprise data warehouse,\u201d and by some Web-based shopping malls such as Yahoo! Store. It has the major disadvantages of requiring enormous effort to create an adequate central database design, using least-common-denominator content, and never having the central database up-to-date.","The second method is primarily useful in a situation of identical, replicated databases, because otherwise the query will not match each database's vocabulary. In a diverse database environment (e.g., multiple information sources on the Web), this method will most often produce \u201cquery not understood\u201d responses and therefore this method cannot generally be used.","The third prior art method overcomes the problems of the previous method, but at the cost of requiring manual programming for each database. This creates an environment which cannot economically scale beyond a relatively small number of information sources. Even more significantly, the environment cannot automatically adapt to changes in an information source's database structure, thereby requiring that even minor changes in structure require re-programming. These effects are evident in the present situation wherein current Web-based shopping malls cannot cost-effectively handle more than about 2,000 vendors.","Thus, the increasing lack of Timeliness, the inability to index or obtain current information through query forms, and the poor indexing of dynamically generated pages, are all contributing to ever-decreasing Recall and ever-decreasing Precision, with the result that prior art techniques are increasingly unable to solve the problem of finding current information in an increasingly broad, large-scale, and dynamic computer information network, such as the Internet, shown schematically in .","The present invention solves the problems just stated with a set of mechanisms which are robust and which work with both static and dynamic information sources, including query forms.","The approach of the present invention includes sending a customized query to each database, wherein the query is automatically generated without the need for human programming. This is accomplished by obtaining from each information source, not its database, but rather the information describing how to query its database.","This query information is contained in a descriptive packet associated with the information source, and is contained in a database referred to as a \u201csearchbase\u201d. The searchbase contains the identity of the information source, the descriptive packet associated with the information source, and associations with the categories of information about which the information source is organized to be queried. The searchbase also may contain information concerning the parties associated with the information source, such as the author, provider, and\/or publisher of the information source, and\/or information about the content of the information source and\/or its database, such as copyright and patent information, licensing information, associated fee and\/or cost information, and information about how to purchase the information or the items referenced by the information.","A descriptive packet contains a single query method. Thus, if a vendor, for example, uses three query methods which require the use of three query forms (perhaps for use with three different product lines), for purposes of the present invention the vendor is treated as though the vendor were three vendors, each the publisher of one information source. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between information sources and descriptive packets, as shown in .","The information sources may be associated not only with vendors, but also with any party providing information. Examples include organizations which provide news, financial information (such as stock quotations), sports information, weather reports, traffic reports, entertainment information (such as ticket availability), business information (such as travel information, travel schedules, and hotel availability) and databases (such as telephone listings, membership lists, laws and regulations, and library or other collection holdings). The method of the present invention is particularly useful for parties providing information which is most valuable when it is current.","Each information source may be associated with more than one category with respect to which it is organized to be queried, and any particular category may be associated with more than one information source. Both these possible relationships are shown on .","The searchbase itself contains the relationships between categories and information sources and the associated descriptive packets. A \u201cnode\u201d may be considered to be these relationships with respect to a particular category. Thus, in , the nodes shown are: A-IS1-DP1; B-IS2-DP2; B-IS3-DP3; C-IS4-DP4; D-IS4-DP4, etc. The categories themselves have inter-relationships, and are organized in a hierarchy (discussed later), but this hierarchy is not part of the searchbase itself. Many different types of associations between the categories and the information sources are possible, and each type requires its own method of applying an inquiry to the searchbase. Two such methods are shown in , and are discussed later. The invention uses a mechanism for creating and evolving an index of information sources; a mechanism for storing information which enables accessing both static and dynamic information sources including query forms and which allows the retrieval of both static and dynamically-generated information from those information sources; a mechanism for extracting query parameters from a user search request which can be used to search the searchbase; a mechanism for using data retrieved from the searchbase to query relevant information sources and retrieve the relevant answers to the query; and a mechanism for presenting the retrieved information to the user who made the search request.","The mechanism for creating and evolving an index of information sources involves a network of categories of information. This network of categories is not necessarily a mathematical tree (that is, each category element has one and only one superior element), but may be a hierarchical network (e.g., one with multiple parent elements). Associated with each category element of the network may be descriptive information which facilitates search-request-to-element associations and descriptive packages which facilitate element-to-information-source associations. The network is created by both a centralized authority and by submission from the authors of the information sources or third parties. This keeps the networks relevant and realistic. That is, the authors of the information sources (e.g., vendors and database managers) understand better than anyone else what categories are meaningful to their information and how to categorize their own information. The network also includes mechanisms to cross-reference and link elements that might otherwise not be clearly related. For example, assume that the hierarchy contains:\n\n","The mechanism for storing information in the searchbase which enables accessing both static and dynamic information sources including query forms comprises each node in the searchbase having associated with it a descriptive packet which describes an information source that purports to contain information relevant to the category of that node (shown schematically in ). Each packet contains within it the information needed by a computer to access information from the associated information source. The information contains at least an identification of the information source and machine-executable method descriptions of how to query the information source and how to receive and analyze the information which results from that query. For purposes of the foregoing, a \u201cmethod description\u201d may be considered to be a set of sentences in a computer executable language by which the language processor program for that language interprets the sentences to achieve the desired action.","The descriptions for querying the information source comprise a query language, a template for use with that language (i.e., a sample of the structure of a query expected to be received by the information source), and a sending protocol (which is a receiving protocol for the information source).","The descriptions for receiving and analyzing the information which results from the query comprise a response language, a template for use with that language (i.e., a sample of the structure of a response given by the information source in reply to a query), and a receiving protocol (which is a sending protocol for the information source).","The sending and receiving languages may be the same or different languages, and the sending and receiving protocols may be the same or different protocols.","The central authority maintains the computer-executable language definitions and language processors. The searchbase contains the method descriptions in the descriptive packets for each associated information source.","The central authority may be one or more computer systems which may be geographically co-located or geographically dispersed. The central authority also may be functionally dispersed, including having parts of its functionality operating on the search requester's computers or the computers on which information sources reside, for example, by means of the use of cookies, browser plug-ins, and server-side applications. Similarly, the searchbase may be in a single location or geographically dispersed, and may be resident on one or more computer systems, including those of the search requester and one or more computers on which the information sources reside. Numerical computations, search functions, and control functions may all be performed by the central authority either serially or in parallel.","The languages may be procedural languages, such as C or Java, or may be declarative languages, such as a URL or XML. A method description may access both static and dynamically-generated information sources, and may retrieve from those sources both dynamically-generated information and static information, including executable programs such as JAVA applets. For this purpose, dynamically-generated means that the content is created only when a request for it is received, and static means not dynamically-generated. By this definition, all information retrieved from a query form is dynamically generated (whether the query form itself is static or dynamically generated), and all information retrieved from a standard Web page is static (even though, the publisher of the page may change its content from time to time).","As an example of the foregoing, consider a method description which designates a URL as the query language, HTTP as the sending protocol, HTTPS as the receiving protocol, the GREP pattern matching language as the response language, and an appropriate parsing template for use to parse the response made in GREP. If the query template is the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.startup.com\u201d, then information will be retrieved from a static information source (a Web page), while if the query template is the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.startup.com\/query.cgi?product=foo\u201d, dynamically-generated information (almost certainly) will be retrieved.","The mechanism for extracting query parameters from a user search request which can be used to make an inquiry of the searchbase comprises entering user search requests in a variety of ways, including predefined forms, pick-lists, browsing of the searchbase categories, word-search, and natural language. The set of mechanisms also include storage of information that relates terms (words, word stems, phrases) to searchbase categories. These linkages and programmed inference rules, which relate sets of searchbase nodes, thereby creating a concept thesaurus, are created by both a central authority and by the authors of the information sources. A variety of word-search and natural language technologies can be applied to free-form input, as described in the background section above, again provided that the searchbase and the linkage information is available.","The mechanism for extracting query parameters from a user search request may also include further dialog with the user, including clarification, narrowing, broadening, and\/or other refinements of the user's search request.","The mechanism for using the data retrieved from the searchbase to access the relevant information sources and retrieve the relevant answers to the query comprise the information packages described above.","The process of accessing an information source relative to a given search request comprises extracting query parameters from the search request utilizing the search-request-understanding methods and interpreting the access method using the appropriate language processor with the parameters generated by the search-request-understanding methods. The parameters may be substituted into the access method description, or may be made available to the interpreter with linkages from standardized variable names to the parameter values (e.g. \u201ccolor\u201d\u2192value for this query). The interpretation of the access method will generate values that become the parameters of the next step in the process (e.g., the identification of a connection to the information source).","The sending of the generated query to the information source is accomplished by the execution of the program using the sending protocol. Such protocols may be standards such as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. The protocol submitted may include these base protocols along with additional information such as login ID and password. Protocols also may indicate responses to requests for information such as cookies and client-side information. For example, a protocol description submitted to the searchbase may indicate HTTPS along with the digital signature to be used for authentication. (Additional inputs would be provided as required during use of the input forms of  if the user indicted a selection which might require such additional inputs, for example, HTTPS.) Proprietary protocols built into the access methods (e.g., the \u201cBetty Beta\u201d example of ) also may be used. The protocol description allows access and retrieval from information sources that personalize their responses based upon parameters in the search request from the user's system. For example, if a search request included information indicating the party for whom the search was being conducted, the information source could tailor its responses using information about the user that was known to the information source (e.g., from its own database, or from a cookie in the user's computer), so as to return results more useful to the user than otherwise would be possible.","The process of retrieving the resulting information relative to a given process of interpretation comprises interpreting the receiving protocol to receive the response and interpreting the retrieval method using the appropriate language processor with the parameters generated by the access instance and the response information. The process of parsing the resulting information relative to a given retrieval instance consists of interpreting the parse method using the appropriate language processor with the parameters generated by the retrieval instance.","If the information retrieved is cached (e.g., in a central searchbase), the retrieval method may be marked as requiring a re-execution. That is, the retrieval should happen directly from the information source at the time of the query, thus making sure that the information is as up-to-date as the information source provides.","The response may be a \u201cnegative acknowledgment\u201d or NAK. This response may indicate any of several possibilities, including that the information source does not have any response which meets the search criteria (i.e., the answer to the query is the null set), or that the information source does not understand the query submitted, or that the information source is unavailable at the moment, or that the information source is unidentifiable or may no longer exist.","The mechanism for formatting the retrieved information for presentation to the user who created the search request comprises:\n\n","This output is itself in an appropriate language, such as HTML or XML. An example of a presentation might be a tabular list of all results, with each entry containing a description, attribute values, and an identification, such as a URL (e.g., a hyperlink) which when selected would provide the user with the complete information about that entry.","The method as described allows search of both static and dynamic information sources with static descriptive structure (such as the information categorization). It also allows information sources to have dynamic descriptive structures.","In the latter case an information packet describing the information source contains a method for accessing and retrieving information about the descriptive structure of the information source. This structural information may include the information categories relevant to the information source as well as the other information packets previously described that in total allow the searchbase to access and retrieve information from that information source.","One objective of the present invention is an improved method of searching for information on a computer information network.","This objective is achieved in accordance with the present invention by a method comprising providing a searchbase comprising a plurality of descriptive packets, wherein each packet is associated with one of a plurality of information sources published on a computer information network and includes a query language and template usable therewith, a sending protocol usable therewith and a receiving protocol usable therewith.

For purposes of this example we will describe the domain of shoes. This is intended to be illustrative rather than complete.","The example consists of a set of three information sources associated with vendors of shoes, each having five products, and in which the taxonomic structure of categories is based on the tree structure of general\/specific relationships, and is shown in .

With such a structure, a user's search request is used to search not only the specific category in the searchbase determined by parsing the user's search request, but also all categories which are either entirely more general or entirely more specific. Thus, a user's request to search athletic shoes will result in the information sources being queried with respect to the following categories: apparel-shoe-athletic (the requested category); apparel and apparel-shoe (both entirely more general); and apparel-shoe-athletic-hiking, apparel-shoe-athletic-riding, apparel-shoe-athletic-running, and apparel-shoe-athletic-tennis (all entirely more specific). But no query will be made with respect to the category of \u201cwork shoes\u201d (apparel-shoe-work), because this category is neither entirely more general nor entirely more specific than \u201cathletic shoes\u201d (apparel-shoe-athletic).","The searchbase could, or course, be constructed in the inverse manner, namely, wherein the information sources are associated not only with the specific categories specified by the information source, but also with all categories which are either entirely more general or entirely more specific. With such a structure, the user's search request would be used to search only the specific category requested by the user.  is a schematic representation of such a searchbase structure.","The three vendors are referred to as Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. The products contained in the databases of the three information sources is shown in . In this example, each vendor provides a query form for the use of its customers over the Web, although each vendor's query form is different from the other two vendors' query forms.","In order to permit users to access its most current database of shoes, the vendor must submit to the searchbase the search methodology which the vendor uses to allow its database to be queried. In this example, that means the vendor must provide the information necessary to enter a query into its query form and to understand the response obtained from the query. The vendor submits only the methodology; the vendor does not submit the database itself.","When a search request is made by a user, the methodology is used to search the vendor's database in the same manner that the search would be conducted were the user submitting the search request from the vendor's own Web query form. For example, if the vendor's query form allows as input just the title or model of a book, record, drug, automobile, or any other product, or permits Boolean operators, phrases, or other types of search criteria to be input, then the method of the present invention will allow the same searches to be conducted.","Thus, although the vendor alone retains control over its database, and the user need not even know of the existence of the vendor, the user is able to search the most current version of the vendor's database by making a search request through the searchbase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0185"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A-12C"},"Referring now to , the form in  includes a location  for the name, company, address, phone, fax, and e-mail associated with the information source.

For example, one or more of the steps of the methods as described can be performed by one or more authors, providers, and\/or publishers of, or agents for, or parties associated with, an information source and\/or the searchbase. Similarly, one or more of the steps of the methods as described can be performed by the user or agents for the user (including so-called \u201csoftware\u201d or \u201cprogram\u201d agents), or by network access providers such as Internet service providers, or by intermediary parties such as application service providers and the operators of search engines, Web portals, and Web sites.","Descriptive packets may be supplied by one or more third parties who provide the packets to one or more searchbases which are made available through one or more locations on the Internet, etc. Descriptive packets or parts of descriptive packets may be stored in the form of cookies for automated or manual retrieval by the central authority. Descriptive packets may be obtained by the central authority scanning in the appropriate information from lists published in hard copy in newspapers, magazines, or publications mailed or otherwise sent in to the central authority. While  shows a form for use with one information source and one associated access description, the information required for any number of descriptive packets with the same access descriptions may be submitted together, for example, by means of a different form. Hereinabove it is stated how the central authority may query an information source as to how to query its database after the central authority receives a search request. Similarly, an information source may submit a descriptive packet of a type which if queried will result in more specific information about the information source and therefore result in a more efficient indexing of that information source. An example of information sources of the type just referred to are so-called \u201cbomblets\u201d which consist of a multitude of identical sensors dropped from an airplane which all measure the same type of information (e.g., temperature), but which differ only in their physical location which the sensors are able to determine after they land. A query of each of these otherwise identical information sources before a user's search request is received would enable the searchbase to categorize them with respect to their location, thereby lessening the computational burden when a user's search request is received.","The user may interact with one or more intermediary third parties (e.g., search engines or Web sites) who will submit the search criteria to the searchbase and receive information therefrom for presentation to the user in additional steps.","One or more searchbases may be created and\/or provided by third parties for one or more central authorities to perform the searches thereon, and a central authority may create and\/or provide one or more searchbases for one or more third parties to allow such third parties to offer to the users of the third parties' services the ability to query one or more of such searchbases.","While  shows only the subject matter of the information source, it is understood that additional information about the information source could be submitted to the searchbase to allow specific categories of searches to be conducted. Such limitations could be, for example, related to the language(s) in which the database of the information source is provided, the country of origin of the information source or of its database, the location of one or more of the authors, providers, and\/or publishers of the information source or its database, the date of the information in the information source's database, or some characteristic of the information source. For example, an information source could indicate that it was associated with: a buyer, a seller, an individual, an organization, an information provider, an information receiver, an affinity group, a discussion forum, a product reviewer, a commercial organization, a non-profit organization, a charitable organization, an educational organization, a governmental organization, etc.","It is understood that the physical embodiments of the information sources which are the subject matter of the present invention are not limited to those set forth in the examples. Information sources include not only conventional web pages, but include automated reporting stations (e.g., weather, traffic, skiing-condition reporters), automated data stations (e.g., atmospheric, air, water, soil data reporters), automated sensor stations (e.g., household appliances, vehicles, office equipment sensors), and autonomous web servers. These automated information sources may provide not only the raw data which they measure, but also information resulting from the analysis of that data, and descriptive data about themselves, such as their own location, age, and measurement tools capabilities.","As one further example of the scope of the present invention, the computer networks involved may include wired and wireless networks, fixed and mobile network elements, continuous and intermittent connections among the elements, and transmission among the elements by radio, microwave, infrared, and optical means.","It is understood that the embodiments described hereinabove are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
