{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications and more specifically to connecting an endpoint to a conference call.","A conference call may allow more than two endpoints to participate in a call. To participate in a call, a user of an endpoint may dial a telephone number to access a conference server. The user may be asked to provide a conference identifier and other identifies such as a user identifier. After entering the requested information, the user may be connected to the conference call. Entering the requested information may be cumbersome. Consequently, connecting an endpoint to a conference call may be unsatisfactory in certain situations.","In accordance with the present invention, disadvantages and problems associated with previous techniques for connecting an endpoint to a conference call may be reduced or eliminated.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, connecting an endpoint to a conference call includes associating a caller identifier with a conference call identifier, where the caller identifier corresponds to an endpoint and the conference call identifier corresponds to a conference call. A call is received from the endpoint, and the caller identifier is determined to be associated with the conference call identifier. Connection of the endpoint to the conference call is initiated.","Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a caller identifier associated with an endpoint may be efficiently associated with a conference call in which the endpoint was participating. Accordingly, the endpoint may be readily connected or reconnected to the conference call.","Another technical advantage of one embodiment may be that the endpoint is not required to send conference identifier information in order to connect to the call. Yet another technical advantage of one embodiment may be that the endpoint may be required to send authentication information before being connected to the conference call. And yet another technical advantage of one embodiment may be that the user of the endpoint may be given a choice to connect to the conference call.","Certain embodiments of the invention may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.","Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},"According to one embodiment, an endpoint may be readily reconnected to a conference call. For example, an endpoint may be disconnected if a cell phone drops a call or if a wired phone is unplugged or loses power. If an endpoint is disconnected from the conference call, the endpoint may contact the conference server. The conference server may reconnect the endpoint to the conference call according to the caller identifier mapped to the conference call. Accordingly, the user of the endpoint may just call the original number to rejoin the conference.","According to the illustrated embodiment, system  includes endpoints  coupled to a conference server  at a service provider location  through communications networks  as illustrated in . An endpoint  may comprise any device suitable to place a call and to participate in a conference call. Endpoint  may comprise, for example, a personal digital assistant, a telephone, a mobile handset, or any other device suitable for communicating signals to and from communication network .","Endpoint  may support, for example, signaling used in telephone networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), integrated services digital network (ISDN), ISDN user part (ISUP), channel associated signaling (CAS), robbed-bit signaling, R2 signaling, Q reference point signaling (QSIG), or cellular signaling; or signaling used in conjunction with Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the session initiation protocol (SIP), H.323, H.248, media gateway control protocol (MGCP), mobile IP, or other voice over IP (VoIP) protocols; or any other suitable communication protocol.","A call refers to a connection between two or more stations and to operations used to establish, maintain, and release the connection. A call may be in session when there is an active connection. During a call, endpoints  may communicate signals, such as signals comprising packets. A packet may comprise a bundle of data organized in a specific way for transmission. A packet may carry any suitable information such as voice, data, multimedia, other information, or any combination of the preceding.","Communication networks  allows endpoints  to communicate with conference server . A communication network  may comprise a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a public or private data network, the Internet, a wireline or wireless network, a local, regional, or global communication network, an enterprise intranet, other suitable communication link, or any combination of the preceding.","Service provider location  refers to a location of a service provider. A service provider may comprise any entity that provides a telecommunications service such as a telephone company or an enterprise network. According to the illustrated embodiment, service provider location  includes conference server . Conference server  may, however, be located at any suitable location.","Conference server  provides a conference call service to endpoints . According to one embodiment, conference server  records caller identifiers of endpoints  participating in a conference call. Conference server  associates the caller identifiers with the conference call by, for example, mapping caller identifiers to corresponding conference call identifiers. If an endpoint  is disconnected from the conference call, conference server  may readily connect endpoint  to the conference call using the caller identifiers mapped to the conference call identifier. Conference server  is described in more detail with reference to .","Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to system  without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, conference server  may be located somewhere other than at service provider location . Moreover, the operations of system  may be performed by more, fewer, or other modules. For example, the operations of conference server  may be performed by more than one module. Additionally, functions may be performed using any suitable logic comprising software, hardware, other logic, or any suitable combination of the preceding. As used in this document, \u201ceach\u201d refers to each member of a set or each member of a subset of a set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["22","10","22","30","40","42","44","30","20","22","30"]},"Control logic  manages the operation of modules  of conference server . As used in this document, the term \u201ccontrol logic\u201d refers to any suitable device operable to accept input, process the input according to predefined rules, and produce output, for example, a personal computer, work station, network computer, wireless telephone, personal digital assistant, one or more microprocessors within these or other devices, or any other suitable processing device.","Memory  stores data used by conference server , and may include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), magnetic drives, disk drives, Compact Disk (CD) drives, Digital Video Disk (DVD) drives, removable media storage, network attached storage, any other suitable data storage device, or any combination of any of the preceding.","According to the illustrated embodiment, memory  includes workflows  and conference call data . Workflows  describe the operation of control logic . An example of a workflow  is described in more detail with reference to . Conference call data  may include a conference call table that associates caller identifiers of endpoints  participating in a conference call with a conference call identifier of the conference call. A caller identifier of an endpoint  may comprise a unique identifier associated with endpoint  that serves to distinguish endpoint  from other endpoints . A caller identifier may comprise, for example, a phone number, a name of a user, an electronic mail address, universal resource identifier (URI), or other identifier. A conference call identifier may comprise a unique identifier that distinguishes the conference call from other conference calls.","A caller identifier may be obtained in any suitable manner. For example, the caller identifier may be obtained from a PSTN service such as a calling line identity presentation (CLIP), a connected line presentation (COLP), a calling name identification presentation (CNIP), or a connected name presentation (CONP) service. As another example, the caller identifier may be obtained from name or number identification services provided by H.323 signaling. As another example, the caller identifier may be obtained from a name identification service from Q reference point signaling (QSIG). As yet another example, the caller identifier may be obtained from a contact, from, p-asserted-identity, p-preferred-identity, record-route, or via header, or an authenticated identity body (AIB) of a SIP message.","A caller identifier may be associated with a conference call identifier by mapping the caller identifier to the conference call identifier. The mapping between a caller identifier and a conference call identifier may be stored for a predetermined period of time after an endpoint disconnects to allow the endpoint to reconnect. The predetermined period of time may be of any suitable duration, for example, between three and ten minutes such as five minutes. When a conference call ends, the information associated with the conference call may be removed from conference call data .","Conference call data  may include other suitable information. For example, conference call data  may include a passcode that must be entered into an endpoint  in order to access the conference call. As another example, conference call data  may include a recording of a message entered by a user of endpoint  that may be used to identify the user. For example, a user may record his or her name prior to entering the conference call. Conference call data  may also include any policy or state specific to a caller identifier such as owner or moderator privileges.","According to one embodiment, modules  may include, for example, a voice response unit , an authentication module , and an audio mixer  coupled as shown in . Voice response unit  receives input from endpoint  and outputs responses to endpoint . The responses may comprise voice responses, for example, recorded or computer-generated voice responses. According to the illustrated embodiment, voice response unit  includes a detector , one or more workflows , and a message generator  coupled as illustrated in . Detector  detects input into voice response unit  from endpoint . Workflows  describe the operation of voice response unit  in response to input from endpoint . Message generator  generates messages that voice response unit  presents to endpoint . Message generator  may include a voice synthesizer or a player that plays pre-recorded messages.","Authentication module  may be used to verify that endpoint  is authorized to access a conference call before allowing the endpoint  access to the conference call. For example, a user of endpoint  may be asked to enter a passcode before being granted access to a conference call. A passcode may refer to a code that is used to verify the identity of a user. Authentication module  may also verify a user of endpoint  through a biometric attribute such as a voice print, a facial feature map, or a hand geometry map of the user. Audio mixer  mixes signals received from endpoints. The mixed signals are transmitted to endpoints  such that each endpoint  may play the signals sent by the other endpoints .","Control logic , memory , and modules  may be integrated or separated according to particular needs. For example, the present invention contemplates the functions of control logic , memory , and one or more modules  being provided at a single device. Control logic , memory , and one or more modules  may, however, be separated. For example, authentication module  may be located at a separate device. Any of control logic , memory , and one or more modules may be coupled to any other using a bus, a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a global computer network such as the Internet, or any other appropriate wire line, wireless, or other links.","Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to conference server  without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, conference server  may have more, fewer, or other modules. Moreover, the operations of conference server  may be performed by more, fewer, or other modules. For example, the operations of voice response unit  and authentication module  may be performed by one module, or the operations of voice response unit  may be performed by more than one module. Additionally, functions may be performed using any suitable logic comprising software, hardware, other logic, or any suitable combination of the preceding.","Conference server  may provide advantages over other methods of connecting a conference call. For example, the session initiation protocol (SIP) assigns a unique universal resource identifier (URI) to each conference call. However, this unique URI is typically not the same address which was used to initially contact the conference service. An endpoint  sends a request to this URI to participate in the conference call. This URI, however, is not used to connect or reconnect endpoint  to the conference call. Conference server  may provide an advantage in that it correlates a conference call identifier with a caller identifier and restores the state of an endpoint if endpoint  is disconnected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["50","40","100","22","20","20"]},"The conference call information may be provided in any suitable manner. For example, an organizing endpoint  may provide the conference call information. As another example, an endpoint  requesting access to a conference call may provide the conference call information. The information may be used to connect or reconnect the endpoint  to the conference call. Conference server  maps the caller identifier to the conference call identifier at step  to associate endpoint  with the conference call. The mapping may be stored as conference call data  while the conference call is in session.","A call is received from endpoint  at step . Conference server  determines if endpoint  is associated with a conference call that is in session at step . The conference call data  may indicate that the caller identifier is mapped to a conference call identifier for a conference call that is in session. If the endpoint is not associated with an in session conference call at step , the method proceeds to step . At step , endpoint  is denied access into the conference call, and the call from endpoint  is processed as a new call. After processing the new call, the method terminates. If the endpoint is associated with an in session conference call at step , the method proceeds to step , where conference server  initiates connection to the conference call.","According to one embodiment, there may be a connect request option at step . The connect request option provides for asking the user of endpoint  whether the user would like endpoint Q to connect to the conference call. If there is a connect request option at step , the method proceeds to step  to determine if the user of endpoint  wants to connect. The user may select to connect by sending a request to connect. If the user of endpoint  does not want to connect at step , the method proceeds to step . If the user of endpoint  wants to connect at step , the method proceeds to step . If there is no connect request option at step , the method proceeds directly to step .","According to one embodiment, an authentication option may be provided at step . An authentication option allows for authentication of endpoint  before connecting endpoint  to the conference call. If there is an authentication option at step , the method proceeds to step , where conference server initiates the authentication process. Authentication module  authenticates endpoint  at step . If endpoint  is not authenticated, the method proceeds to step . If endpoint  is authenticated, the method proceeds to step . If there is no authentication option at step , the method proceeds directly to step .","According to one embodiment, an announcement option may be provided at step . An announcement option provides for announcing the user of endpoint  by playing a recording or other audio signal associated with the user. If there is an announcement option, the method proceeds to step , where voice response unit  announces the caller. If there is no announcement option, the method proceeds directly to step . At step , endpoint  is granted access to the conference call and is connected to the conference call. After connecting endpoint , the method terminates.","Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the method without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, steps may be performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention.","Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a caller identifier associated with an endpoint may be efficiently associated with a conference call in which the endpoint was participating. Accordingly, the endpoint may be readily connected or reconnected to the conference call.","Another technical advantage of one embodiment may be that the endpoint is not required to send conference identifier information in order to connect to the call.
