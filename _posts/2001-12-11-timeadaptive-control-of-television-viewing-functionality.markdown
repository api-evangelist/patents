{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates in general to television systems, and more particularly, to functionality provided by set-top boxes.","Subscriber television systems are now capable of providing many services in addition to analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the settop box, has become an important computing device for accessing various video services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of two-way digital services such as video-on-demand.","A DHCT is typically connected to a cable or satellite television network and includes hardware and software for providing various services and functionality. Preferably, some of the software executed by a DHCT is downloaded and\/or updated via the cable television network. The ability to download software provides flexibility in adding or updating applications executed by the DHCT. Each DHCT also typically includes a processor, communication components and memory, and is connected to a television. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, a DHCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","One problem with typical DHCTs is that they are not very responsive to an individual user's demands. For example, in television systems that provide hundreds of services, locating desired television programs can require many keystrokes by the viewer and can consume significant amounts of time. Furthermore, different users may have different preferences regarding the information that may be presented via an electronic program guide (EPG), and these preferences may vary from time to time. Therefore, it should be appreciated that there is a need for improved systems and methods that address these and\/or other problems associated with providing desirable television functionality.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. These embodiments are examples, among others, of systems and methods of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention, which may be embodied in many different forms, should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","200","130","200","140","200","110","130","110","130","130","110","200","110","200","140","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","110","200","110"]},"The DHCT  preferably includes a communications interface  for receiving signals (video, audio and\/or other data) from the headend . The DHCT  further includes at least one processor  for controlling operations of the DHCT , an output system  for driving the display device , and a tuner system  for tuning to a particular television service to be displayed and for sending and receiving various types of data or media to\/from the headend . The tuner system  includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner and transmitter for bidirectional data communication using, for example, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner for receiving broadcast television signals and data. A receiver  receives externally-generated user inputs or commands from an input device such as, for example, a remote control device.","The DHCT  also includes a personal video recorder (PVR) module  for recording television instances. The PVR module  may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media for storing the recorded television instances. The DHCT  may also include an analog video decoder to decode and digitize the video and audio associated with a broadcast analog channel. The PVR module  may include a compression engine to compress the data of a decoded and digitized analog channel prior to storage. Although shown as residing within the DHCT , the PVR module  may alternatively be located outside the DHCT .","The DHCT  may include one or more wireless or wired interfaces (not shown), also called ports, for receiving and\/or transmitting data to other devices. For instance, the DHCT  may feature a USB (Universal Serial Bus), an Ethernet port (for connection to a computer), an IEEE-1394 connection (for connecting to consumer electronics equipment), a serial port, a parallel port, a radio frequency (RF) interface, and\/or an infra-red (IR) interface. In this manner, user inputs may, for example, be provided via a computer, via buttons or keys located on the exterior of the DHCT , via a hand-held remote control device, and\/or via a keyboard that includes user-actuated keys, etc.","With additional reference to ,  is a block diagram illustrating selected components stored in the system memory  of the DHCT . The system memory  described herein is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the present invention. In one implementation, system memory  includes flash memory  and dynamic random access memory (DRAM)  for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor . Basic functionality of the DHCT  is provided by an operating system  that is primarily stored in flash memory . The operating system  includes at least one resource manager  that provides an interface to and coordination of resources of the DHCT  such as, for example, computing resources.","One or more programmed software applications, herein referred to as applications, are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT . Applications stored in flash memory  or DRAM  are executed by processor  under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by an application is stored in DRAM  or flash memory  and read by processor  as needed during the course of the application's execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application at the time it was generated as a software application, in which case it is stored in flash memory . Data generated by an application is stored in DRAM  by processor  during the course of the application's execution.","An application referred to as navigator  is also resident in flash memory  for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel up\/down, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The client applications may be resident in flash memory  or downloaded into DRAM .","The flash memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a service application manager (SAM) client .","The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  is also responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and allocation of the limited DHCT  screen resources. Window manager  allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. Window manager  communicates with resource manager  to coordinate available resources (such as display memory) among different resource-consuming processes. Such processes may be directly or indirectly invoked by one or more applications. The window manager  also maintains, among other things, a user input registry  in DRAM  so that when a user enters a key or a command via a remote control device or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry  may be accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT  should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device, the command is received by the receiver  and relayed to the processor . The processor  dispatches the event to the operating system  where it is forwarded to the window manager . The window manager  then accesses the user input registry  and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application.","The SAM client  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend  (). A SAM database  in DRAM  includes a data structure of services that are created and updated by the headend . Many television services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Television services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, the presentation of television broadcast programs, video-on-demand (VOD), music or other audio data, and interactive program guides (IPG).","In general, the identification of a service includes the identification of an executable application that provides the service along with a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the service to be provided. As a non-limiting example, a service of presenting a television instance could be executed with a set of parameters to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D.","Application clients can be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the SAM client , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend. In this non-limiting example, DRAM  contains a PVR application , an interactive program guide (IPG) application , a video-on-demand (VOD) application , and a preference engine application . It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for this present embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in flash memory . These applications, and others provided by a subscriber television system operator, are software entities for providing services to the user.","The preference engine  monitors a user's or household's television viewing preferences by keeping track of viewing parameters corresponding to services that the DHCT  presents. A viewing parameter may be a television service, a type of television service, a television instance, or a type of television instance, among others. A viewing parameter may also be a service instance's assigned rating such as the rating signifying the intended audience. As used herein, a service instance is a service presentation such as, for example, a television program (or episode) or a VOD movie. In one embodiment, by retrieving information from DRAM  and from an internal timer , a preference engine  keeps track of viewing parameters in relation to the time of day, i.e. the \u201cclock time.\u201d The preference engine  stores information in DRAM  according to the tracking procedures it performs. In another embodiment, the preference engine  also keeps track of viewing parameters in relation to the time of week, e.g., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Weekday (Monday-Friday), or Weekend (Saturday and Sunday). In yet another embodiment, the preference engine  also keeps track of viewing parameters in relation to the time of year (e.g., calendar date). By keeping track of the extent to which various television services, types of television services, service instances, and types of service instances are presented in relation to time of day, time of week, and\/or time of the year, the preference engine  facilitates the provision of improved television services to the user. Such improved services may include, for example, the provision of customized IPGs, service navigation, and service instance recording.","In one embodiment, the preference engine  keeps track of viewing parameters through the use of one or more preference tracking databases . Although referred to as a \u201cdatabase\u201d, a preference tracking database  may comprise data structures that are not stored in a database format. A preference tracking database  contains data that reflect the extent to which a DHCT  presents various television services during one or more time periods. In one embodiment, a preference tracking database  keeps track of the duration and\/or frequency that a DHCT  presents services having certain viewing parameters. For example, a preference tracking database  may contain scores that are correlated to the duration and\/or frequency that a DHCT  presents services having certain viewing parameters. One or more preference look-up tables  may be created in memory based on data collected in connection with a user or household's viewing preferences. Such data may be based on, for example, a preference tracking database  or user input that expressly indicates user preferences. In one embodiment, the preference look-up tables  are created by the preference engine  and contain viewing parameters that are associated with respective time periods. The viewing parameters may be television services, types of television services, service instances, types of service instances, service instance ratings, and\/or respective content parameters, among others. A content parameter may be used to explicitly specify the presence of violence, offensive language, and sexual content in a service instance, for example. These parameters may be retrieved from IPG database  stored in DRAM , and may be part of a service instance's information. Each time period may represent a time of day, a time of week, a time of year, or a combination thereof (e.g., 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Sunday in January). In one embodiment, a preference look-up table  contains a plurality of rows where each row corresponds to a respective daily time period. In one possible implementation, each row corresponds to a half-hour time period. In another possible implementation, a plurality of preference look-up tables  corresponding to a plurality of respective weekdays are used. For example, one preference look-up table  may be used for each of the seven days of the week. Alternatively, one preference look-up table  may be used for a group of days such as Monday through Friday, another for weekend days, such as Saturday and Sunday, and yet another for holidays.","In an alternative embodiment, look-up tables may be created by a user during a configuration or customization procedure without the assistance of preference engine . The preference engine may function autonomously thereafter or until the subscriber conducts another configuration or customization procedure. In yet another embodiment, a preference engine  is not included in the DHCT .","A person with ordinary skill in the art will understand that there are many different methods of arranging and storing data. A preference look-up table  is not necessarily stored in a table format; it is, however, presented here in a table format for illustrative purposes. The following table represents a non-limiting example of some of the information that may be contained in a preference look-up table  in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example of preference look-up table for types of service instances"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20021:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20022:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20023:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20024:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20026:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.","NEWS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20027:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.","NEWS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20028:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.","CARTOONS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20029:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.","CARTOONS"]},{"entry":[{},"10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.","CARTOONS"]},{"entry":[{},"11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.","CARTOONS"]},{"entry":[{},"12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.","SOAP-OPERAS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20021:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.","SOAP-OPERAS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20022:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.","SOAP-OPERAS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20023:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.","TALK-SHOWS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20024:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.","TALK-SHOWS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.","TALK-SHOWS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20026:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.","NEWS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20027:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.","SIT-COMS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20028:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.","SIT-COMS"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20029:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.","SPORTS"]},{"entry":[{},"10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.","SPORTS"]},{"entry":[{},"11:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},"12:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.","MOVIES"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In the example shown in table 1, each time period is associated with a type of service instance. In an alternative embodiment, each time period in a preference look-up table  may be associated with multiple viewing parameters that are ranked based on a score corresponding to a user's or household's viewing time and\/or viewing frequency of services having such viewing parameters. In an alternative embodiment in which the subscriber customizes viewing preferences for specific time periods, each preference look-up table  may be associated with one or more TV services, but where each service is only associated with one look-up table.","Each entry in a look-up table associated with a period of time may comprise multiple preferences or specifications for that entry. The number of viewing parameters may differ from a first entry to a second entry. Each entry can have an independent number of viewing parameters associated with it. As a non-limiting example, the flexibility to associate any number of viewing parameters in each entry is provisioned by implementing a link-list structure for its set of viewing parameters.","Multiple preference look-up tables  may be used for looking up different combinations of viewing parameters and time periods. For example another preference look-up table  may be used to look up television service preferences based on the day of the week. Alternatively, a separate look-up table contains information for locating a look-up table corresponding to a respective day of the week. In an alternative embodiment a multidimensional preference look-up table , possibly implemented with link lists as described above, may be used to look up multiple types of viewing parameters associated with multiple types of time periods.","In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT  work with the navigator  by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the SAM client  for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares DHCT  resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the SAM client , the operating system , and the DHCT . Third, an application conforms to situations where shared resources are only accessible via the navigator . Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM client  (the navigator  will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application client is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator  (e.g., power, channel +\/\u2212, volume +\/\u2212, etc.).","Data and software used in providing a DHCT service to a user may be stored in one or more of the following memory resources: a data storage device located at a headend, a data storage device located at a customer premises, a non-volatile memory internal to the DHCT , and\/or a hard drive internal to the DHCT . For example, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application (e.g., IPG application ), or to respective parts thereof, may reside in and\/or execute out of DRAM  and\/or flash memory , or may reside in a local storage device connected to DHCT  and may be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program or algorithm may reside in DRAM  or in flash memory , or may reside in a local storage device connected to the DHCT  and may be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program or algorithm may be written into DRAM  by the executable program or algorithm and may be transferred to flash memory  or to a local storage device for storage purposes. It should be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited by where or how any data and\/or applications are stored or retrieved.","The IPG application  has a data gathering mechanism, or daemon , running continuously as a background task to receive IPG data intended to reside in the DRAM . IPG daemon  receives IPG data corresponding to a time-window and stores such IPG data for a pre-specified period of time in the DRAM . This mechanism can be employed at power-up and\/or during periodic updates that, for instance, occur at pre-determined times (such as midnight). The IPG data updates can also occur upon change to the data on an IPG server  and subsequent notification to the client that new data is available.","Transmission of data packets containing a time specification from the headend  helps the DHCT  to synchronize its clock and keep track of time and intervals. In one implementation, a timer in the DHCT  can count down to a time that initiates processor  to signal the IPG daemon  background task to retrieve transmitted IPG data. DHCT  can receive IPG data, for instance, as a BFS file transmitted via a BFS server  either as an in-band or out-of-band transmission, or both. Hence, an IPG server  in communication with the BFS server  can package an IPG database into files and transfer them to the BFS server  for downstream transmission.","IPG data typically spans service instance information for a complete service line-up, be it hundreds or possibly thousands of services, for a pre-specified time-window (e.g, 14 or 30 days). An individual service (e.g., NBC, Video-On-Demand, Email) is typically associated with each service. Since the duration of service instances vary, for example, typically from 30 minutes to 210 minutes, a service could possibly offer 48 service instances per day, as an example.","As a non-limiting example, IPG data comprises data organized into database records or other data structures. The IPG data records comprise fields containing information such as service instance titles, service instance descriptions, service instance content descriptions, service instance genre, service instance release years, casts or performers lists, ratings information, play duration, and\/or links to additional respective service instance related information such as service instance previews and critic's reviews and comments. In another embodiment, service instance information may include a price for a service rendering a service instance as well as an effective window of time and\/or calendar days in which the service is purchasable.","The IPG database  contains information for the presentation of available service instances at the current time and for subsequent periods throughout a time-window into the future designated to be supported by IPG application . Part of the IPG data may be retained at the IPG server  for on-demand requests by a DHCT. Such is the case for Service Instance Long Descriptions that would require excessive DHCT  memory for storage, especially in light of the large number of service instances provided by a large service line-up over multiple days. The remainder of the IPG data is intended to reside in the DHCT  and is broadcast via one or more downstream data services, possibly one or more in-band transmission channels or out-of-band (OOB) transmission channels.","A user's request for a service instance information (e.g., a program's Long Description) stored in an IPG server  at the headend  generates a signal that is transmitted from the DHCT  to the IPG Server . The IPG server  transmits the requested service instance information via one or more downstream data services and the DHCT  conveniently downloads the information through its communications interface .","As time progresses, the IPG database  is updated due to one of various possible reasons such as: service instance data becomes obsolete as an IPG time-window \u201cshifts\u201d in pre-specified time-increments into the future; TV stations or other services (e.g., digital music services) may alter their service instance offering due to one of many possible reasons (e.g., NBC overrides a scheduled program to transmit a President's State of the Union address); or a change in the service line-up.","IPG application  functionality includes database management capabilities in which database records can be stored in DRAM  or some other storage device. The IPG server  in communication with IPG application  effects updates to the IPG database  stored in DRAM  on a regular or periodic basis. IPG application  receives information on the IPG database  transmitted by IPG server  through the communications interface  and invokes its database management functionality to store received IPG database  in a section of DRAM . The IPG application  is preferably a programmed software application executed by utilizing the computer resources in the DHCT . An executable program is stored in DRAM  and executed by processor  under the auspices of the real-time operating system. Thus, data required as input by the IPG application  is stored in DRAM  and read by processor  from DRAM  as need be during the course of the application's execution. IPG application  reads IPG database records and processes them into displayable representations as part of a graphical user interface (GUI) presentation displayed on the display device .","In one embodiment, configuration manager  working in communication with general settings application  allows a user to select and customize the user's control of TV functionality, including displayable information retrieved from IPG database , for one or more time periods. In this way the user can customize the extent of TV functionality and\/or of IPG information displayed to the user's liking. A user can customize TV functionality and\/or displayable IPG information to adaptively change over time. The customization of time-adaptive functionality can be indefinite until a user overrides an existing selection in the future or until a period of time expires according to the user's customization. In one embodiment in which preference engine  exists and is allowed to function, the user's customization may be altered in the future by preference engine .","Customizable information further includes the configuration and layout of an IPG screen for different time periods in addition to the IPG information. Displayable IPG information for each of a plurality of time periods can be customized by service identity, service instance type, service type, service instance rating, and\/or service instance content, among others. Other configurable aspects of IPG information pertain to which applications are permitted to present IPG information during each respective time period. For instance, since IPG information is accessible by WatchTV  to populate fields in a service banner during service changes, and within the fields of a displayed service guide's presentation, the user may customize or limit the IPG information that applications can retrieve from IPG database  and display during certain time periods or intervals.","Each of the above mentioned applications and functions mentioned throughout preferably comprise executable instructions for implementing logical functions and can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport an application for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection (electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM) (electronic), a read-only memory (ROM) (electronic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (electronic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM) (optical). Note that the computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which an application is printed, as the application can be electronically captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, and then stored in a computer memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 6"],"b":["400","200","400","410","411","412","413","414","410","420","480","500","471","472","473","471","472","473","495","290","490","200","460","600","401","200"]},"In an alternative embodiment, different and\/or additional methods of providing user input may be used including, for example, a remote control device having different keys and\/or key layouts, a keyboard device, a voice activated input system, a touch-screen display, etc. The invention described herein is not limited by the type of device used to provide user input. As a non-limiting example, the functionality of the arrow keys  may be provided via a disc-shaped key (not-shown) whereby locations on the disc-shaped key correspond to respective directions on a display screen.","With additional reference to  throughout the remaining figure descriptions,  depicts a non-limiting example of an IPG screen  that illustrates an initial program guide arrangement in a time format. IPG screen  may be presented by the DHCT  () in response to user input that is provided via, for example, the activation of the guide key  ().

The fields in the detailed focus area  are populated with information read from IPG database  in DRAM  by IPG client application .","A television service which the DHCT  is currently providing (which is typically the service instance occupying the full screen before the user is presented with IPG screen ) is displayed in a video area . Immediately below the video area  is an information banner  depicting the television service which the DHCT  is currently providing (e.g., channel 5), the current day and date (e.g., Thursday, January 18), and the current time (e.g., 5:00 p.m.). The date and timing information are retrieved from internal clock information stored in system memory . The displayed TV service information is retrieved from IPG database  stored in DRAM .","The main service instance display area  contains a listing of television instance titles corresponding to television instances that are or will be available for viewing during the time periods listed under the time area  and that correspond to respective television services identified in television service area .
