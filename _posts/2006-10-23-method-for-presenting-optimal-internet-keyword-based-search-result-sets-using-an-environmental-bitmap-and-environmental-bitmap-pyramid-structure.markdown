This application claims the Feb. 24, 2000, Apr. 7, 2000 and Jun. 25, 2003 filing dates as to the common subject matter.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of financial resource management, inventory control and online purchasing between customers, retailers, suppliers and wholesalers. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system of computers linked to form a Supercomputer subdivided into multiple hierarchical neural sub-components having neural elements residing at remote sites. The Supercomputer updates, validates and verifies the flow of environmental messages, allowing the end users to find the lowest FOB, C&F, CIF, CDF and CDIF price for goods and services. The system manages the production rate for the supplier by purchasing at optimal cost order quantities and shipping maximal discount rate. By coordinating the resources of multiple customers through the same suppliers and financial institution, the system will use economies of scale to lower transactional service charges and the suppliers' best price to the consumer. Furthermore, this invention also relates to the field of searching engines by cleaning, standardizing, organizing, transforming, analyzing and then evaluating the massive amount of data thus placing harmony, balance and proportion to the chaos and anarchy of the Internet, identifying keywords that use eigenvectors giving a value or a rank to each link of the world wide web. The system is comprised of computers configured, linked and otherwise arranged to form a Supercomputer subdivided into multiple hierarchical neural-like subcomponents, having neural elements residing at remote sites.","The present invention also relates generally to the field of Telecommunications, using parallel cluster computers to create a very fast and inexpensive Supercomputer that allows the integration of the Internet as a large and complex Telco Network. The application is meant to further clarify and elucidate the reader with the intellectual property contained in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,614,893, 6,842,511 and 7,058,601 by expanding from simple ILEC to national carriers, global IP Telephony and Wireless Telecommunications Real Time billing. The concept of vector CDR is further expanded to include roaming surcharges and multi-organization calls. The invention solves intrinsic drawbacks of clusters by dividing them into a grid of nodes that are able to move large amounts of data, and can perform decisions on their own absent of the centralized Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP).","The system is thus a parallel cluster Supercomputer with at least one teraflop of bandwidth calibrated to move organizationally the equivalent of one terabyte per minute (TB\/min) of raw data. The Intelligent Components analyze, gather and distill the messages of the environment created by each telephone call, and then prime, rate and match\/merge the plurality of CDR into a correlated billing entity that, in turn, is stored at the insertion rate of one million transactions per minute. The technology has evolved into a mission critical system that is commercially known as the Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae (hereinafter MPS\u00ae), that is designed to simulate and plot circuit by circuit all of the telecommunications networks of a PTT. The commercial version of the MPS\u00ae is designed to handle a small Telco such as \u2018Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad\u2019 (hereinafter ICE). ICE network consists of 1,160,000 fixed, 1,000,000 wireless and 100,000 IP Telephony subscribers, covering the entire 506 Area Code (or Costa Rica). A second \u2018massive\u2019 volume system utilizing a XLDB (Extremely Large Database) can handle a large Telco. For example: the Massive Mission Critical MPS\u00ae can cover France Telecom with 34,900,000 fixed; 48,100,000 wireless; 6,000,000 ADSL, 4,000,000 IP subscribers or the Internet with 1,000,000,000+ users.","Finally, the technology uses fuzzy math to measure the quality, performance and strength of the traffic traveling through the environment, so that human intelligence can perform strategic planning, and using Business Intelligence programs better understand the needs of the end users. By incorporating the MPS\u00ae into a UCommerce method and system, the supplier system will be able to identify inefficiencies, match\/merge multiple quotes to take benefit of economies of scale, perform savings optimizing the traffic patterns of the movement of merchandise from Leg A (origin) to Leg B (destination) using X_FOB and Y_CDIF, and convert all of the suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, warehouses and links to possess geospatial, demographic and debit card functionalities to improve product, quality and service.","2. Description of the Prior Art","With the advent of the Internet and related technologies, electronic commerce and related online services have become ones of the fastest growing segments of the economy. Organizational data networks gather, validate, verify and exchange end users' information in an effort to understand, for example, the kinds of products, services and qualities consumers value most, and how and why they make such determinations.","With regard to the electronic trade (or E-Trade) industry, there have long been individual computers loaded with programs for performing online purchasing, inventory control and accounting functions to manage resources. Electronic trade systems rely on the processing power and data storage of a SMP or mainframe. A problem with these single computer applications has been that more processing power and data access capability was needed, as well as reduced bandwidth usage coupled with web and virtual world access.","Another related problem is that each transaction must be paid in full before goods and services are shipped, which particularly complicates matters for consumers who must obtain funds through financial institutions. Solutions to these problems are presented in the published doctoral dissertation of the present inventor, entitled \u201c\u201d, submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at California Coast University in November of 1999, the entire content of which is incorporated herein for reference.","Accordingly, UCommerce is an integrated real time Financial Resource Management, Online Purchasing and Inventory Control system that overcomes the shortcomings, limitations and drawbacks of the existing prior art.","It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a computer network system operating in parallel and simulating a network of existing retailers, wholesalers and suppliers, wherein the system has the capability to produce, sell or transfer goods and\/or services without taxing the capacity of the existing network.","It is another object of the present invention to provide such a computer network system configured to instantaneously generate, plot and update a lowest price and optimal shipping cost trajectory between two geographical locations for each user's request, immediately upon scanning the user's initial network message.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide such a computer network system which plots the optimal shipping trajectory, providing the lowest cost and delay time for a particular transaction. Where the purchase order contains pricing data that enables billing to commence, the moment of the financial resources are made available and updated or continued in real time as the transaction progresses.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a computer network that minimizes bandwidth usage by performing scheduled and synchronized supplier and wholesaler \u201cavailable inventory\u201d calculations and updates throughout the network. The computers are networked together to function as a Supercomputer, which can accurately project future resource requirement trends in order to update end user's software to avoid system congestion. Preferably, a Summit Tier and functions are provided to update all of the components by sending only summarized information packets to their organizational subordinates.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide such a network system that maximizes network-processing power by shunting calls from computers momentarily operating at or near capacity, and thus having smaller buffers to less-taxed computers having larger buffers. Preferably, this process of sharing available resources between members of the systems mimics lateral and vertical synergy in human organizations.","It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide such a network system having the flexibility to operate in conjunction with antiquated financial institutions and supplier technologies, so that existing equipment is not wasted and the cost of updating is minimized.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a network system, wherein the system performs network troubleshooting functions to minimize down time and platform failure by warning a repair crew, almost immediately of the nature and location of a problem. Preferably, in this manner, the system is maintained via a proactive and preventative maintenance program.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide such a system that enables customers and multiple suppliers to collectively and partially satisfy an entire purchase order.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide such a system, which is relatively redundant and inexpensive to assemble and operate.","It is still another object of the present invention to convert the prior art to the UCommerce architecture into a Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae.","It is still another object of the present invention to partition the main cluster or superset into sets, subsets and elements, that are placed in a distributed manner for better efficiency and effectiveness of handle tasks.","It is still another object of the present invention to add geospatial components to X_FOB and Y_CDIF methods and multi transport dimensioning to permit more sophisticated logistic planning of resources from origin to destination (or Leg A to Leg B).","It is still another object of the present invention to create a method, commercially known as XCommerce, that converts the \u2018massive\u2019 amounts of electronic information of the Internet by transforming the content into basic language business blocks and then stores its mathematical values into Environmental Bitmaps Data Structures, so that Inventory Control Systems can quantify, qualify and match\/merge the best satisfying results of an end user KEYWORD request.","It is still another object of the present invention to create a method that identifies the best cost at the local, regional and global scope, commercially known as Z_PRICE, pronounced as \u2018The Price\u2019.","It is still another object of the present invention to be able to match\/merge a plurality of quotes into a macro quote with several transport and time sensitive dimensions.","It is still another object of the present invention to give vector characteristics to the geospatial information into traffic patterns that permit the optimal distribution of goods and services.","It is still another object of the present invention to transform the Summit Tier or Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae into a global domain Superset cluster.","It is still another object of the present invention to transform the Middle Tier or Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae into a regional domain set cluster.","It is still another object of the present invention to transform the Lower Tier or Team Work Switch\u00ae into a local or LATA domain subset cluster.","It is still another object of the present invention to transform local warehousing means that can accommodate retailers, wholesalers and suppliers organizations, UCommerce, Free Trade Zone and customs warehouses.","It is still another object of the present invention to transform each node member of a search engine cluster of 64+ nodes into an element, that owns a discrete number of links and has the means to valorize each of them as they become apparent through means of a web crawler ability to filter, analyze and distill the environment.","It is still another object of the present invention to optimize transport dimensions using X_FOB and Y_CDIF to comply with Z_PRICE optimizations.","It is still another object of the present invention to optimize the search engines dimensions using W_RANK environmental bitmap data.","It is still another object of the present invention to integrate a database XLDB (or Extreme Large Database) with Business Intelligence capabilities that control, coordinate, partition, replicate and maintain the vector patterns information that is redundant and robust.","It is still another object of the present invention to convert all of the physical and electronic information into environmental bitmap multi dimensional and geospatial inventory.","It is still another object of the present invention to create the means to store a summary of the traffic of behavior of the end user as patterns of behavior that are used to give value to links.","It is still another object of the present invention to apply the process of LATIN or cleaning and standardizing the environmental spaghetti, and enabling a lingua franca interface to distribution and storages means of goods and services converting all of the data into a superset Y. Superset Y=(0, R, \u02dcR, S, \u02dcS, W, \u02dcSW, U, \u02dcVU) has several sets R=Retailers, S=Suppliers, W=Wholesalers, and U=UCommerce Warehouses. The tilde symbol or \u02dc represents waste. Each set A has real data and \u02dcA duplicate or garbage data. In large networks, \u02dc or garbage grows geometrically as a network grows in complexity. Once the system data integrity exceeds a critical mass, the information with the environment suffers from the \u2018Spaghetti Phenomena\u2019 and then becomes confounded or useless.","It is still another object of the present invention to apply the process of cleaning, mapping, organizing, standardizing and transforming the content of the electronic files of the Internet into unique elements belonging to the Superset (U). The Superset U=(0, I, \u02dcI, J, \u02dcJ, K, \u02dcK, T, \u02dcT) and has the independent variables (I, J, K) that measures content value, and the dependent variable (T) consists of the time dimension.","It is still another object of the present invention to give Y_LATIN or transforming and organizing the spaghetti of global traffic and availability of merchandise that is delivered door to door. This is the process where the MPS\u00ae removes all of the anarchy, chaos, redundancy and saturation, and in turn, reduces \u02dcR, \u02dcS, \u02dcU, and \u02dcW to 0 as Information Entropy is achieved.","It is still another object of the present invention to associate, coordinate, control, optimize and synchronize a plurality of independent searches request without saturation, with Informational Entropy and minimal latency or system tax burden. \u02dcI, \u02dcJ and \u02dcK are eliminated as the system creates Simple, Hybrid and Complex Search Structure Searches that quantify and qualify with certitude the value of the content of a link. \u02dcT is eliminated once the system is able to gather, distill and analyze real time events of the environment.","It is still another object of the present invention to create the Z_PRICE method that analyzes and evaluates the spaghetti of the logistical queue of traffic in order to identify the lowest cost and time delays associated with the transportation of goods and services door to door by using optimal X_FOB and Y_CDIF prices from the local, regional and global scope points of view.","It is still another object of the present invention to create the W_RANK method that analyzes and evaluates the Internet's environmental spaghetti to associate, coordinate, control, optimize, synchronize and then match\/merge a plurality of independent searches into higher informational quality results.","It is still another object of the present invention to teach how to build a Simple Pyramid Search valorization method for search engine keywords.","It is still another object of the present invention to teach how to build a Hybrid Pyramid Search valorization method for search engine keywords.","It is still another object of the present invention to teach how to build a Hybrid Pyramid Search valorization method for search engine keywords. The top valued W_RANK bitmaps are used as display means to end users.","It is still another object of the present invention to incorporate the latest techniques of X_FOB, Y_CDIF and Z_PRICE methods to deliver products and services door to door at optimal time and cost.","It is still another object of the present invention to incorporate the latest techniques of W_PRICE methods to quickly deliver the highest quality of content to a browser search request.","It is still another object of the present invention to incorporate the latest techniques of W_PRICE methods to quickly deliver the highest quality of content to a browser search request.","It is still another object of the present invention to incorporate, validate, valorize, analyze, read and distill the content of a link to improve the W_RANK.","The present invention overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the prior art, and accomplishes the above-stated objectives as well as others as may be determined by a fair reading and interpretation of the entire specification.","An expert system Supercomputer, commercially known as UCommerce, is provided to incorporate a plurality of independent nodes, also referred to herein as intelligent components which work together in an organized and hierarchical manner to represent all of the network platform components, the human resources of an organization and the consumers interactions with the system.","An expert system Supercomputer is provided to incorporate a plurality of independent nodes, also referred to herein as Intelligent Components which work together in an organized and managerial hierarchical manner to represent all of the products, services, human resources and consumers of the organization. The system will assimilate a plurality of concurrently working sovereign distribution centers, such as Retailers, Suppliers, Wholesalers and UCommerce warehouses. This concept is further expanded to integrate geospatial components to each message from the environment, and allows each network to interact with the MPS\u00ae. The technology utilizes business rules to determine, based on traffic volumes and available resources, the node of the system that performs the match\/merge. Therefore, Intelligent Components make decisions using business rules, permitting them to perform complex tasks once the Quote or Order Owner builds the Vector CDR, and they have all of the Partial Vector components. This ability of the lower nodes of the hierarchy to complete most tasks permits the system to avoid unnecessary and redundant activities. This permits the system to work independently at a lower throughput when the centralized SMP is absent. The HQ leader of each Switch has the ability and authority to create an environmental bitmap that consists of a summary data of their entire organization. The highest HQ leader gathers, distills and disseminates the environmental data, so it can assign, control, coordinate and synchronize directives to its entire organization to process tasks. The solution of large and\/or complex networks requires geospatial data which denotes a 3D mentality, the hierarchy organization and plurality of networks were transformed into a Pyramid like structure, since it constitutes a better representation of the reality and elucidates the magnitude of the problem that is being solved.","An expert system Supercomputer, commercially known as XCommerce, works in an organized and hierarchical manner to represent all of the links, content of the Internet and the massive traffic volumes derived from the consumers interactions with the environment.","The original Ph. D. dissertation was interested in solving the dilemma of having real time billing entities for a network, the size of Telecom Italia with all of its complexity and associated environmental spaghetti. The invention was designed to work outside of the Legacy System by using school of management techniques, quality assurance and integrated bundled mechanism of data migration, match\/merge algorithms to correlate tariff billing entities and a billing engine that would make the information immediately available, so to stop the 2 month billing cycle in arrears that had a net result of costing the organization between $200 and $400 million USD per year, depending on severity of fraud. Fraud occurs when the bureaucratic Legacy System is unable to react in a proactive or reactive manner to the changing conditions of the environment, and possesses implicit inefficiencies and limitations. By simulating the data flow of messages from the environment through means of simulation, the results will elucidate pitfalls\/conditions of the networks that clog or saturate the system: first, arrange the resources of the system to coordinate the flow of data to handle a specific rated capacity; then, test the system when traffic approaches the critical mass or specific asymmetric conditions occur. As the volume increases arithmetically, the \u2018tax burden\u2019 on the available throughput increases exponentially, complexity is directly proportional with the number of layers required to gather environmental information. The \u2018Tax burden\u2019 phenomena becomes apparent once the critical mass is exceeded or traffic volumes are greater than 5% of the rated capacity. Under these dire conditions, the unmanaged flow of traffic, massive quantities of data moved and net effects of the \u2018tax burden\u2019 of the system concurrently deteriorate and saturate the network. In a nutshell, this technology optimal manages and coordinates throughput to avoid saturation during dire traffic conditions:","a) Unmanaged systems get clogged quicker than managed ones do, alternatively if they are managed into single nodes they decay as the number of nodes increase. Ex.: for 1,024 nodes, unmanaged nodes require 200 minutes to perform a synchronized network wide CO flush; whereas 1,024 managed nodes will perform the same task in 17 minutes.","b) The mechanism to distribute information to the centralized Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP) further augmented the cost of throughput to perform a correlated billing entity, increases geometrically with the number of dependent tiers. In this case, the Legacy System uses the first tier of monitors to read and filter information, the second tier to perform data manipulation, and the summit tier to match\/merge correlated billing entities. The Modern System uses the first tier to read, filter information and perform data manipulation, and onwards to match\/merge correlated billing entities. The GES\u2122 or MPS\u00ae performs all of the tasks from the first tier onwards. The Legacy System has two dependent tier layers, the Modern System and the MPS\u00ae.","c) The log of the lowest common denominator of grid unmanaged Network Platform Equipment is variable Z. This is described in the ratio of actual monitoring CPU to SMP. In this case, the Legacy System has about 64 nodes per SMP; the Modern System has about 16 nodes per SMP; whereas the GES\u2122 has 1 node that behaves as a SMP.","Accordingly after revamping the gathering means of the existing architectures, the Legacy System would be able to perform data mitigation and the billing cycle in days and weeks instead of 2 months. Through means of a Modern System, the process of data mitigation and the billing cycle were reduced by one magnitude level to hours and days, whereas the commercial version of the GES\u2122 (known in the dissertation as the Hot Billing System) reduced the magnitude by another level to minutes and hours, and the Massive Mission Critical MPS\u00ae further reduced the magnitude by another level to seconds and minutes! As per conclusions of the dissertation, Real Time Billing was just one step away.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,614,893 introduces the method of further programming the Intelligent Components not to just understand the proprietary multinational CDR obtained by the Black Box, but instead to actually perform data mitigation and billing cycle through means of reading the SS7 signal packets IAM, ACM, ANM and REL messages. This improvement was the necessary step required to perform Real Time Billing reducing the magnitude by another level to seconds and minutes, which constitutes the technological advantages of the Massive Mission Critical MPS\u00ae. New methods were added to the managerial hierarchical system by granting each node the ability to share tasks with parents\/siblings\/subordinates with lateral and vertical synergy. The primary advantages are as follows:","a) Pseudo Real Time Billing technologies match\/merge occurs after the fact using CDR information. Results show at best the data mitigation and billing cycle is made available within minutes and hours. These delays, in gathering data, can produce dire consequences on throughput of the system.","b) Through means of lateral and vertical synergy, the tax burden phenomena was virtually eliminated and contained within tolerable levels.","c) The NEW definition of \u2018Real Time\u2019 starts from the incipiency of a call as a SS7 IAM packet generated by the Network Platform Equipment and continuously changes the transactional fuzzy states as better data is obtained. The system updates the fuzzy state of the call as ACM packets notify a connected call, ANM packets an active call and REL packets instruct the NPE that a call has terminated and to immediately discharge used resources.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,842,511 introduces the concept of reflecting a Telecommunications network, and thus competitors and their usage of the system resources were contemplated, still within the framework of a large fixed network. The primary advantages are the ability to create a Vector CDR that belongs to 3parties and to integrate the organization and its resources to the GES\u2122 system and method.","CIP #2 develops the notion that the spaghetti of the Legacy System is transmitted as an echo of the environment to a mirror. This mirror, that consists of the GES\u2122, mimics, replicates and simulates the activities of each NPE, and in turn, organizes the information based on geospatial (X, Y, Z) coordinates into geographical areas that are known as blocks. These blocks are responsible for standardizing all of the messages into a lingua franca, simplifying the pits falls of the spaghetti through means of normalization, and transforming the data into correlated billing entities with tariffs. The system further organizes and arranges a plurality of informational blocks into larger objects that resemble 3D pyramids like structures that are autonomous, independent and having ownership of a specific geographical domain belonging to the superset (U). For the basis of the building blocks, the NPE object is used for determining the ownership of the CPE and their associated subscribers. For the basis of the building blocks, the NPE is used as the point of reference for all of the CPE of its subordinate subscribers.","The hierarchical structure was incremented to accommodate global networks with HQ0 to HQ12 pyramid structures. It added the concept of having fixed and wireless networks working in parallel within the same framework, and introduced the XO for cell sites. Within a territory an additional level of hierarchy was added to match\/merge the loose ends of calls that use both fixed and wireless networks, that we named Hybrid Calls. Thus two concurrent running HQ0 to HQ5 would solve the issues of the ILEC territory, and the newly added HQ6 tier would resolve hybrid calls.","Two additional groups of tiers were added to the traditional ILEC hierarchy to solve national long distance calls, HQ7 to HQ9, and international calls, HQ10 to HQ12. Finally, the concept of Complex Calls was added. This is to satisfy calls that have classical characteristics: Leg A, point of origin, and Leg B, point of destination format, with Leg X, billable point of origin, and Leg Y, billable point of destination, and several tandem circuits such as Legs (T, U). This call consists of two or more calls to instantiate a single call. For example, a person that has a global network AT&T Italia phone with a billing address of Rome, Italy; originates a call from Miami, USA, to a person that has a global network Nextel phone with a billing address in Buenos Aires, Argentina, that presently is in New York City, USA. At least three calls must be tagged to make the connection.","One Vector Path could use AT&T local long distance between Miami and New York City.","One Vector Path could use AT&T international call between Miami and Rome for billing purposes only, and\/or physically if required.","One Vector Path could use Nextel international call between New York City and Buenos Aires for billing purposes, and\/or physically if required.","For a complex call, the origin and destination don't belong to the same network. Match\/Merging calls with missing gaps of information substantially lower informational entropy. If the originating person dials 01154#######, the call is an outbound from Miami to Argentina where Nextel rebroadcasts the call to New York City, since the caller is registered to have a global plan; it is possible that the Miami to Rome call will be symbolic and used for a billing purpose only, the system will be able to route a domestic USA call and assign the international roaming surcharge.","CIP #3 was further updated and revamped to satisfy the needs of a commercial version as a Product in ICE, Costa Rica, and the first encounter was that four dimensions of telecommunications traffic are required: 1) Fixed, 2) IP, 3) Wireless, and 4) International wireless competition. To take advantage of cluster and grid technologies, the basic pyramid structures evolved into sector, regional and domain Switches. Thus the GES\u2122 had a substantial evolution to the MPS\u00ae that consists of a hierarchy of tiers of parallel cluster nodes, to discrete segments of clusters that behaved like grids and covered a predefined geographical area and all of the NPE, with the corresponding CPE based on the assigned geospatial (X, Y, Z,) location. Note: an object can only belong to a specific block and Switch like object.","Thus the basic Switch became to fruition by allowing clustering computer software with a modified Unix Shell, to launch scripts based on predefined time intervals or socket ID instances and to begin integrating all the incompatible data structures, protocols and technologies. Each CPE belonging to a specific NPE has geospatial, demographic and financial characteristics. The Switch can instantiate, block, kill and listen to calls, perform data mining, data warehousing, fault management, provisioning, routing and network trending, in real time. Based on the size of the PTT, the organization will be broken down into three geographical depending tiers as follows:","a) The Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae interacts with the Senior Management of the organization to allow it to control all of the human and NPE organizational resources to make strategic decisions derived from live network wide data. This Switch covers the entire domain of the organization, or can be distributed amongst a cluster of these Switches for larger PTT. (international and complex traffic)","b) The Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae interacts with the Middle Management of the organization to allow it to control all of the human and NPE organizational resources to make decision support and operating support decisions derived from live regional data. This Switch covers the entire region of the organization that covers an NPA (Numbering Plan Area) or LATA (Local Access and Transport Area). (long distance traffic)","c) The Team Work Switch\u00ae interacts with Engineering, Field Crews and MIS, to manage and control the integrity and stability of the different technologies NPE to deliver to the end user the best quality, product and service. This Switch covers a sector of the organization that covers a plurality of CO, XO and ISP within an Exchange (NXX) or NPA. (local traffic)","All of the components work collectively and independently from each other, and still simultaneously perform the task analyzing, evaluating, gathering and processing information from the environment, in real time. New messages occur at the moment of incipiency of receiving the fuzzy logic IAM, ACM, ANM or REL messages from the environment. Intelligent Components are the basic elements of the system. These are new attributes to them that supersede previous Business Rules:","a) Each Intelligent Component is also an independent working entity.","b) Intelligent Components can mimic, replicate and simulate Fixed, IP, VOIP and\/or Wireless Network Platform Equipments.","c) Each Intelligent Component is assigned a primary function with their Switch to control the NPE. When nodes match\/merge calls that belong to their primary functions, they can complete a Vector CDR as if one level higher in the hierarchy. For example, a primary function fixed HQ0 can complete a Vector CDR that is Intra CO and Intra NXX calls.","d) Each Intelligent Component determines if a call is Simple, Hybrid or Complex.","e) For Simple Calls, having Legs (A, B, T) belonging to a single network, the system determines the Leg A owner, which in turn assigns the Vector CDR owner.","f) For Simple Calls, if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae domain by the system, the Team Work Switch\u00ae Leg A owner will complete the Vector CDR. If the Leg A owner TWS\u00ae does not have Leg B data, it creates Partial Vector Legs (A, T) information and requests the owner of the leg B owner TWS\u00ae to send the partial Leg B. Then the TWS\u00ae Leg A owner has to match\/merge Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T) to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path.","g) For Simple Calls, if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae domain by the system, the Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae Leg A owner will complete the Vector CDR. If the SIS\u00ae Leg A owner does not have Leg B data, it creates all of the Partial Vector Legs (A, T) information, and requests the owner of the leg B owner SIS\u00ae to send the partial Leg B. Then the SIS\u00ae Leg A owner has to match\/merge Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T) to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path.","h) Hybrid Calls, having Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T, U, X, Y, I, J, K), belong to the exact two networks. The system determines the Leg A owner, which in turn assigns the Vector CDR owner.","i) The system will create two Sub Vectors CDR, where each has complete Legs (A, B) side information of a call from the point of view of a single network. Thus a Hybrid Call will have exactly two Sub Vectors CDR and Complex calls more than three.","j) By means of the Vector CDR and its corresponding data structure bitmap information, the system will know that the Hybrid Call had a total cost by adding (origin, tandem and destination) components Sub Vector CDR.","k) For Hybrid Calls, if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Team Work Switch\u00ae domain by the system, the Team Work Switch\u00ae Leg A owner node will complete the Vector CDR. If Leg A owner node does not have Leg B data, it creates Partial Vector Legs (A, T) information that belongs to the same network, which sends it to the partial Leg A node of its superior TWS\u00ae, and requests the owner of Leg B owner node to send the Partial Vector Leg B that belongs to the other network. Then the TWS\u00ae has to match\/merge Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T) to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path, and the two complete Sub Vectors CDR that belong to each network.","l) For Hybrid Calls, if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae domain by the system, the Team Work Switch\u00ae Leg A owner node will complete the Vector CDR. If Leg A owner node does not have Leg B data, it creates Partial Vector Legs (A, T) information that belongs to the same network and to the Partial A function of its superior SIS\u00ae, and requests the SIS\u00ae superior of Leg B owner node to send the Partial B function that belongs to the other network. Then the SIS\u00ae Leg A owner has to match\/merge Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T) to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path, and the two complete Sub Vectors CDR that belong to each network.","m) For Hybrid Calls, if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae domain, the Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae Leg A owner node will complete the Vector CDR. If Leg A owner node does not have Leg B data, it creates Partial Vector Legs (A, T) information that belongs to the same network, which sends it to the Partial A function of its superior SIS\u00ae, and requests the SIS\u00ae superior of Leg B owner node to send the Partial B function that belongs to the other network. Then the MPS\u00ae Leg A owner can match\/merge Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T) to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path, and the two complete Sub Vectors CDR that belonged to each network.","n) For larger and complex networks, a \u2018CORE\u2019 MPS\u00ae might exist to load balance a plurality of MPS\u00ae and to allow a smoother transition of information between the system and the power users.","o) The SIS\u00ae performs the match\/merge task for regional and global domain Hybrid Calls.","p) Complex Calls, that possess Partial Vector Legs (A, B, T, U, X, Y, I, J, K, V, W, C, D), belong to a plurality of networks. The system determines the Leg A owner, which in turn assigns the Vector CDR owner.","q) The Sub Vector CDR, within its bitmap data structure, has all of the associated components to reverse engineer a Complex Call from origin to destination within a network environment (F), (I) or (W).","r) Leg A side Switch owner can match\/merge Sub Vectors CDR Leg A.","s) Leg B side Switch owner can match\/merge Sub Vectors CDR Leg B.","t) Each Switch has a specialized Parser Function that distributes the flow of IAM, ACM, ANM and REL messages to the appropriate node with the new rules mentioned above.","u) To block or kill a call, Leg A owner instantiates REL messages and forward chains through the system.","v) To instantiate a call, Leg A owner instantiates a Wireless call through the optimal resource route.","w) To communicate with a Customer Service Representative through a specific ANI, the system will send a message to the NPE to play a specific voice message.","x) The Customer Service Representative can then call a specific ANI to interact with the system, or alternatively instantiate a new call using specialized software that creates network packets.","y) Intelligent Data Warehouse HQ2 or + has large data repositories, and uses parts of the throughput to perform specialized Data Mining and Data Warehousing activities through means of the integrated 3party licensed Database.","z) The Parser Function directly receives through the GNOC centers an echo of a plurality of trunks and circuits that belong to a specific Sector or Region, and can be mapped directly to a specific NPE. These nodes are directly connected via fiber to each of the nodes, so latency is minimized. When an Intelligent Component wants to communicate to the network, this node is the one that performs the live Central Office rerouting, block or killing of calls, and instantiation of new calls.","The \u2018CORE\u2019 MPS\u00ae is the means by which the power users of the system can perform real time changes to the system, and can request system integrity and performance updates to better make tactical and strategic decisions. End users that want to monitor their available credit as a call progresses via ADSL can do so through this node.","The Internet is considered a global telecommunications network with 1,000,000,000 subscribers, and thus most of the business rules apply. UCommerce and XCommerce are business intelligence applications designed to give the end users the latest information. In order to eliminate redundancy, raw data must be converted by a Supercomputer into primed data with patterns of behavior for real time financial evaluation to dynamically adapt to the changes of the environment.","The parallel clustered multi-tiered Supercomputer consists of a plurality of nodes, where each one is programmed with Artificial Intelligence software programs, commercially known as Intelligent Components or IC, to perform processing power predefined and ad hoc tasks based, that must be logistical rationalized based on the requirements derived from the environment.","The cluster is also known as the Superset (U). The cluster is divided into three geospatial tiers: a) Global, b) Regional, and c) local possessing specialized Data Mitigation, Network Trending, Provisioning, \u2018Data Mart\u2019 and Business Intelligence functionality relying on a sharable Extreme Large Data Base (XLDB) tier. Each of the nodes or IC is assigned a geospatial area of coverage range from 0, small geographical areas, to 7, the world, a managerial hierarchy system denoted as HQ. Each Intelligent Component possesses the following characteristics and functions:","a) Data base means with real time information of the inventory and the latest prices of retailers, suppliers, wholesalers and UCommerce warehouses that will give customers products and services delivered door to door at the optimal price and time. The system will consider the world as a single supra macro region, and thus the consumer will readily have available same ocean, land and air cargo such as blue, red and black label services from local, regional or global products and services. This method offers small and large customers the ability to locally buy and sell worldwide merchandise, thus allowing them to compete anywhere in the world without the need of storing physical inventory.","b) Total Quality Management or TQM functionality that analyzes and identifies product, quality and service designed to determine customer satisfaction and perceived value.","c) Data Manipulation or DM process consists of gathering, reading, priming and inserting Network Platform Equipment transactions into a structured format that can be used for billing, call routing and vectoring, fault management, fraud detection and network statistics.","d) Management Information Systems or MIS methods that organize, transform, distribute and replicate organizational detailed and summarized lingua franca information created by each transactional processes and activities, are transformed and organized into a relational manner from the environment.","e) Expert Information Systems or EIS mechanism permits business intelligence software to evaluate information in a structured way for decision makers, such as the CEO and a president of an organization, to understand where and why things happen in an organization. With this information, the visionaries of an organization can make tactical adjustments and strategic course corrections.","f) Inventory Control means depending on the Intelligent Component's assigned managerial hierarchical geospatial area of coverage assignment as Local, Regional or Global.","All of the Intelligent Components work collectively and independently from each other, and still simultaneously perform the task analyzing, evaluating, gathering and processing information from the environment in real time, or from the moment of incipiency of receiving the fuzzy logic piece of information that triggers new and updates pending activities or tasks. The cluster of computers must be subdivided into a superset, set, subset and element, grouping the following Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae architecture with local, regional, global and informational sub cluster partitioning to help build three geospatial tiers:","The Summit Tier or Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae or MPS\u00ae Information Portal HQ7 coordinates the Data Mart cluster used for Business Intelligence and Invoicing that work with Crusader Technology Software via the Internet that allows users to have access to their business and personal information in real time. The system analyzes each Crusader Technology Software interaction to better understand what the client values in order to keep the subscriber satisfied. HQ6 is the master node of the cluster (U) that has control of all of the financial institutions interfaces, human resources and Network Platform Equipments of an organization. Consequently, each Intelligent Component has the four cluster configurations as follows: HQx ([I], [J], [K]y, [T]), where x ranges from 0, local, to 7, global geospatial scope, [I] Global (Superset), [J] Region (Set), [K] Local (subset), y denotes the element, and [T] XLDB or Data Mart Cluster.","The Middleware Tier or Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae or SIS\u00ae controls UCommerce warehouses based on continent HQ5, continental region HQ4 or LATA (Local Access and Transport Districts) HQ3.","The Lower Tier or Team Work Switch\u00ae or TWS\u00ae controls a plurality of points of presence based on the organization suppliers HQ2, warehouses HQ1 or retailers HQ0. These HQ2 to HQ0 collectively constitute the workhorse of the system, and Intelligence has control of users' requests and replies to the system. These Intelligent Components coordinate and synchronize the entire billing, provisioning and TQM functionality requests and replies. They also have the ability to interact with 3parties organizations and supply them with a summary of all of the data they have processed.","Virtually simulate 3parties organization functionality by storing via software interface, district via TWS\u00ae, region via SIS\u00ae or globally via MPS\u00ae to reduce the need of having to rely on the centralized mainframe. Each Intelligent Component or Intelligent Data Warehouse must only synchronize the latest inventory once every predefined cycle, and then the artificial intelligence programming will optimize and maximize its organizational management logistics. The nodes of the system will interact directly with the provisioning and physical or queued inventory of each member of a 3party distribution means.","Intelligent Components can request to members of the same group or Team Work Switch\u00ae any excess buffer resources to complete a task (lateral synergy). Members of a TWS\u00ae can coordinate the resources of any parent and their subordinates to complete a task. Members of different regional cluster can synergistically collaborate to process tasks via Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae and perform worldwide tasks thanks to the summit cluster or Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae.","Intelligent Components can be programmed to behave and to be the substitute of one or more nodes in performing organizational tasks, so that collectively the \u2018HIVE\u2019 works as a Super Intelligent Component engulfing a global supplier system. The supplier system has specialized interaction means with the environment that gather, distill, analyze and then standardize and convert the raw information into primed lingua franca data, which in turn is quantified, qualified, organized and transformed, so that Information Entropy is achieved and consequently the chaos and anarchy or \u2018Spaghetti Phenomena\u2019 is eliminated.","Collectively, multiple Intelligent Components work together to parallel and simulate an existing organization that possesses an UCommerce supplier system.","Each primed lingua franca message by the system has a single version of the truth vector trajectory that assigns a discrete amount of Intelligent Components, so they can communicate amongst themselves or members of the organization and the Internet clients. Based on the vector trajectory, each message has an owner and the path of all of the participating Intelligent Components required to process a given activity, so they can communicate amongst themselves via forward and rearward chaining. Proactively, the human resources of the organization use business intelligence software that can send parameters to the master node of each TWS\u00ae (subset), SIS\u00ae (set) and MPS\u00ae (superset) that permits humans to control, coordinate and synchronize directly their network. The software sends the parameters to a single or plurality of clusters, so they can optimally analyze, assign, calculate, distribute, prioritize and weight the rate of messages and timing limitations for the next queue of incoming messages, based on the conditions of the environment and historical trends.","Each Intelligent Component is also an independent working entity or an element of a given superset, set or subset, grouping with the following characteristics:","a) HQ3 and higher are also Intelligent Data Warehouses, performing data warehouse functions, and are programmed to monitor and control multiple nodes. They act as virtual simulation of the organization. HQ2, HQ1 and HQ0 that are designed to remove redundancy, geospatially distribute activities, and to correlate and update information.","b) Intelligent Components are programmed to valorize with supply side economics the limited resources and capacities of the network with their parents, peers and subordinates (lateral and vertical synergy), so that the system does not tax the capacity of the existing network in real time.","c) Intelligent Components are programmed to immediately create, plot and update purchase orders as soon as new messages from the environment are processed.","d) Intelligent Components analyze the latest environmental conditions to manage and organize the flow of information within their organization, from predefined point A to point B routes to avoid clogs and saturation maximize throughput, and assign and prioritize cluster nodes via synergy that have substantial buffer resources since unused resources are considered waste or garbage, which is the independent variable that is directly related in creating the \u2018Spaghetti Phenomena\u2019.","e) Thus, network traffic is analyzed by supersets, sets, subsets, groups of elements and by element domain, based on the known latest working conditions of each Intelligent Component, network routing traffic patterns and throughput limitation of each given domain. The TWS\u00ae, SIS\u00ae and MPS\u00ae perform the non obvious task of removing complexity in order to be a real time system by eliminating data redundancy, filtering, quantifying, qualifying data as good or garbage, and minimizing waste before beginning to transmit the data through the managerial hierarchy system.","f) Intelligent Components are programmed to eliminate the \u2018Spaghetti Phenomena\u2019 at the point of attack, so that the system can reach Information Entropy at the organizational level which is a necessary condition to be considered a real time invention.","g) Intelligent Data Warehouses stabilize the flow of financial conditions, criteria, inventories, shipping cost and tariffs required for billing, and update to the Information System or XLDB Data Mart with transactional statistics that are made available to the rest of the Intelligent Components to better optimize resources and available bandwidth.","h) Each Intelligent Component is programmed to be autonomous, and through means of the managerial hierarchy and synergy, can work in parallel with others to function as a single unit. They process all of the information forming a virtual instance organizational environment.","i) The members of the hierarchical management pyramid analyze, update, monitor, control, validate, verify and administer information that in turn eliminates the \u2018Spaghetti Phenomena\u2019, which in turn permits Informational Entropy once primed data has balance, harmony and proportion. This fact alone removes the need for a central mainframe and also shows that garbage in equals to garbage out and that raw data derived from the chaos and anarchy of the environment is meaningless, and that the real time solution consists of simultaneously synchronizing the workload (MIS), optimizing throughput (Engineering), proactively satisfying clients demands (TQM) and updating human intelligence with good information (EIS); and the fact that they are all of the required or mandatory at once is not obvious in nature.","j) Each Intelligent Component has its own location identification means, one said summit parent simulation computer being located at each of a plurality of subordinates. Depending on the size of the network, the architecture of how computers are linked together might require a plurality of scopes, each with its own parent and subordinate. For the purposes of this invention, retailers, wholesalers and suppliers are available. Furthermore, each node must belong to the main cluster or \u2018HIVE\u2019, and to a geospatial specific domain local, regional or global cluster.","Every single activity and purchase order is made in parallel, starting from the point of origin and ending at the point of destination, and by rearward chaining of routing vector information through the simulation network to the point of origin. The Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae Architecture provides a computer network system which plots a purchase order providing the lowest prices and the best terms and conditions available for that transaction at that moment, and a request is initiated and continues in real time as the activity progresses.","The Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae Architecture provides such a computer network, which minimizes bandwidth usage by performing, cleaning, standardizing, organizing and transforming the raw data from the \u2018Spaghetti Phenomena\u2019 or Legacy System environment, so that UCommerce supplier system can analyze and evaluate the best usage network resources to satisfy the needs of the customers in the following manner:","a) The \u2018HIVE\u2019 administers, coordinates, controls, mimics, manages the live network and also reflects a concurrent and parallel working simulation of the live network call routing activities and transactions.","b) The heart of the system is the business intelligence TQM functions that make sure to predict when a customer becomes dissatisfied to immediately avoid churn, and also enable the supplier system to bill and manage the follow of money in real time.","c) The three clusters of tiers belonging to the managerial hierarchy update their subordinate components by sending only summarized information packets to their organizational subordinates. Consequently, these updates facilitate network wide information in real time to each intelligent component, so that the decisions are based on facts, and not lookup tables or hard coded predefined routing patterns. This is the basis for the development of the two new methods: Z_PRICE and W_RANK.","d) The different clusters or switches can avoid bottlenecks within their organization by assigning cost to each activity and limiting the resource. Each Intelligent Component has at its disposal to perform tasks and the ability to find and use available buffer resources by less taxed members of the group, and load balances the demand on the organization's resources, as per scenarios and business cases with regard to particular situations (SNAFU) or dire conditions contemplated by management. The system works always at maximal throughput and can only use emergency reserved resources on its own when the fault is serious enough to cause customer dissatisfaction; and a human resource has not acted to the problem within the predefined time allocated for a response.","e) The \u2018HIVE\u2019 is an open architecture which operates in conjunction with the Legacy System and its associated technologies, so that existing equipment is not wasted and the cost of updating is minimized.","f) Parent components are responsible for assigning tasks with time limitations to their subordinates.","g) When two or more independent variables exist, a plurality of subordinate members can take ownership of a plurality of circuits of a transaction and then send the partial Vector CDR information to the assigned transactional owner, so it can gather all of the circuits information and then match\/merge the billing entity or purchase order.","The \u2018HIVE\u2019 System is derived from a Genesis Engine Supercomputer\u2122 Architecture that consists of a system built using a particular configuration. To begin the system, is constructed from a pair of network links that are parallel clustered to form a Supercomputer () which monitors and controls the Internet represented in Fig. X as (1) Inbound messages and (2) Outbound messages from the environment (), meeting at a junction point in the form of an organization that has external contact with the outside world via the Internet. The Supercomputer is divided into several tiers for a better distribution and efficiency of the workload. The system () can be divided by the summit tier () or Managerial Pyramid Switch\u00ae that is a Superset cluster grouping that is parent of all of the components. The middle tier (-) or Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae is a set cluster grouping that manages and controls all of the middleware activities for the interacting financial institutions, retailers, suppliers and wholesalers, and also helps the parent () component to coordinate and manage all of the available resources. Each middle tier (-) manages multiple lower tier Intelligent Components (-) or Team Work Switch\u00ae, that is a subset cluster group. Each group consists of a plurality of nodes or elements that can perform the following:","a) Receive and send messages and transactions for all of the activities performed by human resources and end users that interface with the system ().","b) Update all of the end users that communicate with the system with the latest shipping cost formulas, geographical location of retailers, suppliers, system warehouses, wholesalers and product lines from the different manufacturers.","c) Match\/merge the activities of multiple end users with regards to the same supplier to afford the best competitive rate via economy of scale discounts where applicable.","d) Have a hierarchical structure that is geospatial in nature and helps facilitate the interaction with the human resources, financial transactions and clients' demands. Where each HQ is assigned a value from 0 (local) to 7 (global) denotes its authority, position, power and responsibility within the \u2018HIVE\u2019. For example, HQ7 interacts with all of the customers. The HQ7 interacts with the outside world environment, preferably with the management of the supplier system, in particular via data warehousing and business intelligence software. Whereas a simple HQ0 interacts, monitors and controls the activities of one or more end users within a local geographical area. Thus, not all of the Intelligent Components are identical, even though they have the same intrinsic characteristics and functions.","e) Have delegation of command, by means of lateral synergy where a subordinate creates a virtual instance of its immediate superior, and acts and functions in the same manner as its supervisor, including the same delegated authority and responsibility within the hierarchy. For example, a network has a major system failure at the regional level, and particular Synergy Interface Switch\u00ae subordinates and their end users are unable to communicate with the rest of the organization to get wholesaler or supplier prices. The least taxed Team Work Switch\u00ae will behave temporarily as the SIS\u00ae and will temporary approve, verify and validate as a partial transaction a given activity with the maxi cost algorithm as if the entire organization was still visible and fully operational. Once the network communication is restored, the TWS\u00ae notifies its supervisors all of their activities and then each supervisor reviews the activities validated SIS\u00ae with the mini cost algorithm. Then the SIS\u00ae makes the appropriate validation of inventory, pricing and transportation, and rearward chains the missing gaps of information with certitude to its subordinates that will continue interacting amongst themselves until all of the information has been successfully updated and validated.","f) The \u2018HIVE\u2019 is the main cluster that is used to give a heart beat to all of the concurrently working nodes of the clusters, as is also known as the Superset.","g) The summit tier of nodes is commercially known as MPS\u00ae, that monitors all of the activities of the environment and is responsible for training its subordinates of the most effective and efficient manner to present conditions. The system assigns priorities and rations available resources, forcing its subordinates to share resources and work together, primarily, by promoting shunting resources from nodes having larger buffers to process the activity. In a nutshell, these nodes control, coordinate, manage and monitor the Internet or the superset (U). The MPS\u00ae performs the following:","Coordinates the activities of the subscriber software driven requests. ii) Analyzes, gathers and identifies consumer personal information and purchasing patterns of behavior. iii) Allows an organization to have a personalized yet secure interaction with the public. iv) Manages end users' requests and replies while determining their level of satisfaction with regards to TQM functions. v) Communicates with the outside of the environment via the Internet.","h) The middle tier of nodes is commercially known as SIS\u00ae that monitors all of the activities of a given region of the environment and is responsible for training its subordinates of the most effective and efficient manner to present conditions. This tier controls and is responsible for the actual inventory, and makes financial decisions using mini cost algorithms. These elements gather information and study patterns of purchasing and production behavior and faults, and then make on their own ad hoc optimized logistics reports that are submitted to the managers of the supplier organizations. This \u201cinverted or reverse\u201d ad hoc query does not hog the resources of the network, since the system builds the report on its own by summarizing the reports of its subordinates and then sending them to the user. In a nutshell, these nodes control, coordinate, manage and monitor a geographical region of the Internet or the set, where U=(I, J, K). The SIS\u00ae manages and controls the logistical flow of transportation and queuing of delivery of goods and services from an UCommerce warehouse to the destination. The SIS\u00ae merges multiple end users' requests as one to have better bargaining power and lower costs to the consumer via economies of scale.","i) The lower tier of nodes is commercially known as TWS\u00ae that monitors all of the activities of a given partition of the environment, such as a geographic area of coverage of a LATA (local access and transport area), cleans, standardizes, organizes and transforms the raw data of the environment into a lingua franca. The TWS\u00ae validates and verifies each end user request and reply, and is assigned an ownership of several end users. This tier at incipiency determines the origin, tandem and destination of the transaction. By means of the data mining activities of the client software, the system updates and keeps the end users profile current. In a nutshell, these nodes control, coordinate, manage and monitor a subset of the Internet by modeling a plurality of retailers, suppliers and wholesalers organization points of presence, and have the means to interact directly with their provisioning systems.","X_FOB method: The UCommerce client software uses stored media devices or downloaded compressed file structures with critical data that allows the end user to perform optimized searches. The client will take advantage of lookup tables stored in memory or open files with a product list to determine which products are valid. Then the system opens the data specification files and all of the static data is displayed in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The system subdivides a search and then disseminates the request. The client analyzes the request using the fuzzy logic and then breaks it into several partial commands by suppliers. Each partial request is sent to the supplier system and replied to the client that is responsible for merging and integrating each of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. The system will prioritize each available product based on UCommerce shipment value and overall net price. Once the client gets the updated price, it adds the domestic shipment when Inventory is not available. X_FOB penalizes the FOB price based on the number of days the product is away from the C&F port. X_FOB stands for delay free FOB price. X_FOB is primarily concerned with the optimal distribution of goods and services from Leg A to UCommerce warehouse Leg T or Leg U, using Ocean, Land and Cargo transportation services, where delivery is preferred in days.","Y_CDIF method: The software uses stored media devices or downloaded compressed file structures with critical data that allows the client to perform optimized searches. The client will take advantage of lookup tables stored in memory or open files with a product list to determine which products are valid. Then the system opens the data specification files and all of the static data is displayed in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The system subdivides a search and then disseminates the request. The client analyzes the request using the fuzzy logic and then breaks it into several partial commands by suppliers. Each partial request is sent to the supplier system and replied to the client that is responsible for merging and integrating each of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. Once the system has assigned a X_FOB price for a given product, the end user selects a C&F international shipping method via Air White, Green, Blue, Red and\/or Black Label express mail services. The International shipment charge if any is added to the FOB price per unit. The system then calculates the Air shipment method expressed in hours to further adjust the FOB price+International Shipment+Value Added Duties. In other words, the system will penalize or make more expensive the Y_CDIF price of a product due to greater time delay requirements to deliver products to the consumer. Y_CDIF stands for delay free CDIF door-to-door service. Y_CDIF is primarily concerned with the optimal distribution of goods and services from Leg A, Leg T or Leg U to destination Leg B, after paying cargo, duties and insurance, and using Cargo and Express shipment transportation services where delivery is preferred in hours, taking into account cost as constraint. Y_CDIF Gold is a rush service, when the client requires merchandise ASAP, where cost is a secondary constrain and time the primary, and immediate service is optimal.","X_FOB and Y_CDIF are a way to calculate the quality and versatility of a transport route from Leg A to Leg B Warehouse that ranges from optimal a 10 and weakest a \u22124. Leg A is the origin, Leg B is the destination, Leg T is an UCommerce warehouse residing in the same continent that Leg A does, and Leg U is a UCommerce warehouse residing in the same continent that Leg B does. To determine the value, the UCommerce software determines the following: 1) merchandise is already in a warehouse Inventory In Hand, 2 & 3) Industrial Basis for Leg A and Industrial Basis for Leg B country by using a lookup table, 4) Domestic shipment modifier based on the country, 5) Leg A and Leg B are in the same region, and 6) Intercontinental modifiers based on Leg A and Leg B continents. X_FOB does not calculate inventory in hand, where as Y_CDIF Gold has priority to the merchandise and is immediately sent.","X_FOB Routing: Each Intelligent component, TWS\u00ae, SIS\u00ae and MPS\u00ae determines, for each point of presence warehouse, the best continental-regional warehouse for sending merchandise FOB or C&F. The supplier also assigns the best FOB price via X_FOB method and then determines the C&F destination ports to send goods and services. When making calculations, the client uses the geographical UCommerce Warehouse by default. Alternatively, the end user can select a different path from the critical path and the system will make the appropriate calculation. The client software will immediately monitor and track the critical path, and the end user will define path and warn any time delays and cost differences.","Y_CDIF Routing: The supplier system determines the best path to send CDF merchandise via Y_CDIF method, and the end user only has to specify where they want the goods and services delivered. Every time the system detects a significant change in inventory for a given product, the system will update all of the clients of the newly derived critical paths for delivering good and services.","X_FOB and Y_CDIF Restocking: After each purchase, each TWS\u00ae, SIS\u00ae and MPS\u00ae determines how to replenish Inventory In Hand levels and purchase optimal levels of merchandise to maintain the minimum amount of inventory in stock at the lowest cost to the system. X_FOB restocks in ocean, land or cargo transportation methods, whereas Y_CDIF uses green, blue or red labels. Y_CDIF Gold uses red or black labels.","UCommerce Searches: The client software must require from the end user a supplier before making a search. Once the end user selects the valid supplier for a given product, the system can start the partial search commands that are sent to each TWS\u00ae, SIS\u00ae and MPS\u00ae that using X_FOB and Y_CDIF methods create optimal transportation cost from Leg X to Leg Y. When the supplier system responds from the active memory information of each Intelligent Component, the client merges all of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. The Intelligent Component does not make a SQL command request instead of the Intelligent Component has control of the inventory, and is responsible for managing and coordinating the flow of information sent to it to be processed by the different clients. Once the information is made to the Intelligent Component, it will match\/merge optimal routes in its entirety or partially until the best satisfying means of delivery are obtained.","UCommerce Pickups: The end user can also request the shipping only through the UCommerce method supplier system. The end user delivers at the nearest authorized agents the goods with the original cost, so that the system can generate the quote for the duties and expenses at the final destination. Each order confirmation uses an authorized agent that accepts the goods to be shipped in behalf of the client, and then sends them to the final destination via C&F, CDF or CDIF as the client selected.","UCommerce Restocking: When making a search for C&F, CIF, CDF and CDIF, the system calculates X_FOB and Y_CDIF until the warehouse has enough Inventory In Hand to satisfy the order. Thus if an end user requested quote demands for a quantity of items that exceeds available Inventory In Hand, the system will do the following: 1) Requests the missing Inventory via X_FOB and Y_CDIF restocking means. 2) Then merchandise will receive the appropriate time delay for availability in the system. 3) Ideally, the system will request all of the missing merchandise from the manufacturer as one consolidated order, since the merchandise will not leave until all of the units are available. 4) All of the FOB quotes from UCommerce Warehouse offer X_FOB Inventory In Hand with the corresponding restocking delay. 5) All of the C&F, CDF and CDIF quotes will offer both X_FOB and Y_CDIF to the final destination port with the corresponding restocking delay, whereas Y_CDIF Gold makes available the actual Inventory In Hand with no delay.","X_FOB Inventory Control Bitmaps: Each TWS\u00ae, SIS\u00ae and MPS\u00ae creates a X_FOB real time Inventory control tables that allow subordinate Intelligent Components to monitor a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information such as: 1) Availability, 2) Quantity In Hand, 3) Highest Quantity, 4) Best Price, 5) Most Reliable route, and 6) transportation means.","Y_CDIF Inventory Control Bitmaps: Each TWS\u00ae, SIS\u00ae and MPS\u00ae creates a Y_CDIF real time Inventory control tables that allow subordinate Intelligent Components to monitor a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information. The bitmaps consist of 0 and 1 to notify which supplier carries a specific product in the Available field. The In Hand consists of a number of 2 to the n\u22121 power in hexadecimal form 0 to 32758 products in hand. The highest bitmap is a hexadecimal value that calculates how much inventory a specific supplier has where F means unlimited. The best Price and Most Reliable bitmaps sort with ranking which supplier offers the best service to the end user. These numbers are updated after each change in inventory to reflect the latest optimal prices and paths. These bitmaps have preprocessed all of the mathematical calculations with the best case inventory and logistical flow for a given item using X_FOB and Y_CDIF guidelines, eliminating the need for end users' software components to have to do the calculations or bog down the system with unnecessary queries.","Search Engine Supercomputers: Several Search Engines exist in the lucrative market of delivering valorized content via the Internet, such as Ask, Altavista, Google, MSN and Yahoo, to name a few, that are based on large scale Supercomputers of thousands of CPU (U) that are subdivided into groups (sets) and clusters (subsets) of 64 specialized nodes or elements that a lightning speed identifies the best satisfying response for a given parameters of regular expressions. Note: clusters of 64 nodes distribution tend to be the most cost\/efficiency arrangement based on the magnitude of the superset (UI).
