At this time, the home network control apparatus  informs the server  of capability information including a method of encrypting\/decrypting the script-type control information (hereinafter, referred to as an encryption\/decryption method).","In response to the capability information including the encryption\/decryption method and a control information requesting message from the home network control apparatus , the server  encrypts the script-type control information according to an encryption\/decryption algorithm, that is, the encryption\/decryption method included in the capability information. In operation , the server  transmits the encrypted script-type control information to the home network control apparatus .","The server  may encrypt the entire script-type control information or only a part directly associated with home network device control from the script-type control information. For example, information associated with construction of a general user interface screen, and information used to process an event may be provided to users in a readable form.","The home network control apparatus  receives the encrypted script-type control information from the server  and transmits the encrypted script-type control information to a plug-in application that performs a control point (CP) function. The plug-in application is a program that helps a web browser to execute unsupported functions. The plug-in application in the present exemplary embodiment performs functions of searching and controlling Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) devices connected to a home network and other functions.","The plug-in application in the home network control apparatus  decrypts the encrypted script-type control information according to the encryption\/decryption algorithm, extracts a control command and parameter for performing a predetermined service for the home network devices  from the decrypted script-type control information, and transmits the control command and parameter to the home network devices  (operation ).

In other words, the server  provides to the home network control apparatus  the information directly associated with home network device control as information that cannot be read by users who are not authorized through the encryption\/decryption algorithm. Thus, even if malicious users sniff a control information message in a network, they may be prevented from controlling the home network devices .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"110"},"In operation , the home network control apparatus  informs the server  of capability information including encryption\/decryption methods.","In operation , the home network control apparatus  transmits, to the server  via a general-purpose control web application, a control information requesting message that requests control information used to control a home network device.","The encryption\/decryption methods may be at least one of symmetrical encryption\/decryption algorithms and public key encryption\/decryption algorithms.
