{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel fluoroalkyl-substituted pyrazolopyridines, to processes for their preparation, to their use, alone or in combinations, for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for production of medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO. By forming cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in disorders which are based on a disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of heme. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","In recent years, some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as, for example, 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, WO 00\/06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives, and WO 03\/095451 carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines. WO 2010\/065275 and WO 2011\/149921 disclose substituted pyrrolo- and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators.","It is an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and which have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to compounds known from the prior art, for example with respect to their in vivo properties such as their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior and\/or their metabolic profile and\/or their dose-activity relationship.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"48.60mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09090610-20150728-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["A is nitrogen or CR\n    \n    ","L is a #-CRR\u2014(CRR)-## group\n    \n    ","Ris hydrogen, halogen, cyano, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,","Ris a group of the formula *\u2014(CRR)CHF, *\u2014(CRR)CFor *\u2014(CRR)\u2014(C-C)-cycloalkyl,\n    \n    ","Ris hydrogen, cyano, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,","Ris hydrogen, cyano, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,\n\nand the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of the N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides or salts thereof.\n"]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds, comprised by formula (I), of the formulae mentioned below and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts and the compounds comprised by formula (I), mentioned below as working examples, and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, if the compounds, comprised by formula (I), mentioned below are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Compounds according to the invention are likewise N-oxides of the compounds of the formula (I) and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the compounds according to the invention.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids, for example salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the compounds according to the invention which, in the solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules.

The stereoisomerically uniform constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the compounds according to the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than that which occurs usually or predominantly in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, S, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, such as, more particularly, those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be of benefit, for example, for the study of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to the comparative ease of preparability and detectability, compounds labeled particularly with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore, in some cases, also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","Moreover, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention.

The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.","For the implantation, the fasted animals are anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Sanofi: 50 mg\/kg i.p.) and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue (VetBonD\u2122, 3M).

Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous and Oral Administration","The pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are determined in male CD-1 mice, male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is effected by means of a species-specific plasma\/DMSO formulation, and in the case of dogs by means of a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. In all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage, based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. The taking of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anesthesia and administration of an analgesic (atropine\/rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 ml s.c.). The blood is taken (generally more than 10 time points) within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation; if required, it can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (which may also be a chemically unrelated substance) is added to the samples of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention, calibration samples and qualifiers, and this is followed by protein precipitation using excess acetonitrile. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions, and subsequent vortexing, is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analyzed by means of LC-MS\/MS using C18 reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(terminal half life), MRT (mean residence time) and CL (clearance), using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.","Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (by means of LC-MS\/MS; see above) and determined by calculating the ratio of the C\/Cvalue.","B-5. Metabolic Study","To determine the metabolic profile of the compounds according to the invention, they are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, liver microsomes or primary fresh hepatocytes from various animal species (e.g. rats, dogs), and also of human origin, in order to obtain and to compare information about a very substantially complete hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism, and about the enzymes involved in the metabolism.","The compounds according to the invention were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1-10 \u03bcM. To this end, stock solutions of the compounds according to the invention having a concentration of 0.01-1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared, and then pipetted with 1:100 dilution into the incubation mixture. Liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 unit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium, likewise at 37\u00b0 C. After an incubation time of 0-4 h, the incubation reactions were stopped with acetonitrile (final concentration about 30%) and the protein was centrifuged off at about 15000\u00d7g. The samples thus stopped were either analyzed directly or stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis.","The analysis is effected by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS\/MS). To this end, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18-reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05% formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification, structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolites, and for quantitative metabolic assessment of the compound according to the invention in the incubation mixtures.","C.
