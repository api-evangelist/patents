No. 10\/877,009, filed Jun. 25, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,560,276, issued Jul. 14, 2009, which itself claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/483,264, filed Jun. 27, 2003, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein. This also claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/638,702, filed Dec. 23, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates to the field of mammalian cell biology and cell culture. In particular, the invention relates to cultured cells derived from postpartum tissue having the potential to support cells of and\/or differentiate to cells of a soft tissue lineage, and methods of preparation and use of those postpartum tissue-derived cells. The invention also relates to methods for the use of such postpartum-derived cells in the regeneration and repair of soft tissue, and in cell-based therapies for conditions of soft tissue.","Injuries to soft tissue, for example, vascular, skin, or musculoskeletal tissue, are quite common. One example of a fairly common soft tissue injury is damage to the pelvic floor. This is a potentially serious medical condition that may occur during childbirth or from complications thereof which can lead to damage to the vesicovaginal fascia. Such an injury can result in a cystocele, which is a herniation of the bladder. Similar medical conditions include rectoceles (a herniation of the rectum), enteroceles (a protrusion of the intestine through the rectovaginal or vesicovaginal pouch), and enterocystoceles (a double hernia in which both the bladder and intestine protrude).","The basic manifestation of a hernia is a protrusion of an organ into a defect within the fascia. Surgical approaches toward hernia repair have focused on reducing the presence of the hernial contents in the peritoneal cavity and generating a firm closure of the fascial defect either by using prosthetic, allogeneic, or autologous materials. A number of techniques have been used to produce this closure including the movement of autologous tissues and the use of synthetic mesh products. Drawbacks to these current products and procedures include hernia recurrence upon weakening of the closure.","As another example of a soft tissue condition, ligaments and tendons are viscoelastic structures that mediate normal joint movement and stability and are subject to tear and brittleness with age or injury. These structures are complex, relatively static collagenous structures with functional links to the bone, muscle, menisci, and other nearby tendons and ligaments.","Soft tissue conditions further include, for example, conditions of skin (e.g., ischemic wounds, diabetic wounds, scar revision or the treatment of traumatic wounds, severe burns, skin ulcers (e.g., decubitus (pressure) ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers), and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers); vascular conditions (e.g., vascular disease such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and venous disease; vascular injury; and improper vascular development); conditions affecting vocal cords; cosmetic conditions (e.g., those involving repair, augmentation, or beautification); muscle diseases (e.g., congenital myopathies; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory, neurogenic, and myogenic muscle diseases; and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle-muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy); conditions of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments, including but not limited to a periodontal ligament and anterior cruciate ligament; and conditions of organs and\/or fascia (e.g., the bladder, intestine, pelvic floor).","Surgical approaches to correct soft tissue conditions or defects in the body generally involve the implantation of structures made of biocompatible, inert materials that attempt to replace or substitute for the defective function. Implantation of non-biodegradable materials results in permanent structures that remain in the body as a foreign object. Implants that are made of resorbable materials are suggested for use as temporary replacements where the object is to allow the healing process to replace the resorbed material. However, these approaches have met with limited success for the long-term correction of structures in the body.","Thus, novel therapeutic regimens for conditions related to soft tissue are of great clinical significance.","The invention is generally directed to postpartum-derived cells which are derived from postpartum tissue which is substantially free of blood and which is capable of self-renewal and expansion in culture and having the potential to differentiate into or provide trophic support to a cell of a mesodermal or ectodermal lineage, for example, a soft tissue cell phenotype.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides cells derived from human postpartum tissue substantially free of blood, capable of self-renewal and expansion in culture, having the ability to differentiate to or provide trophic support to cells of a soft tissue phenotype or to differentiate to cells of a soft tissue phenotype; requiring L-valine for growth; capable of growth in about 5% to about 20% oxygen; and further having at least one of the following characteristics:","production of at least one of GCP-2, tissue factor, vimentin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin;","lack of production of at least one of lack of production of at least one of NOGO-A, GRO-alpha or oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor, as detected by flow cytometry;","production of at least one of CD10, CD13, CD44, CD73, CD90, PDGFr-alpha, PD-L2 and HLA-A,B,C;","lack of production of at least one of CD31, CD34, CD45, CD80, CD86, CD117, CD141, CD178, B7-H2, HLA-G, and HLA-DR,DP,DQ, as detected by flow cytometry;","expression, which relative to a human cell that is a fibroblast, a mesenchymal stem cell, or an iliac crest bone marrow cell, is increased for at least one of interleukin 8; reticulon 1; chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (melanoma growth stimulating activity, alpha); chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 6 (granulocyte chemotactic protein 2); chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3; and tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3 or expression, which relative to a human cell that is a fibroblast, a mesenchymal stem cell, or an iliac crest bone marrow cell, is increased for at least one of C-type lectin superfamily member A2, Wilms tumor 1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2, renin, oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1, protein kinase C zeta, clone IMAGE:4179671, hypothetical protein DKFZp564F013, downregulated in ovarian cancer 1, and clone DKFZp547K1113;","expression, which relative to a human cell that is a fibroblast, a mesenchymal stem cell, or an iliac crest bone marrow cell, is reduced for at least one of: short stature homeobox 2; heat shock 27 kDa protein 2; chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1); elastin; cDNA DKFZp586M2022 (from clone DKFZp586M2022); mesenchyme homeobox 2; sine oculis homeobox homolog 1; crystallin, alpha B; dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2; DKFZP586B2420 protein; similar to neuralin 1; tetranectin; src homology three (SH3) and cysteine rich domain; B-cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative; cholesterol 25-hydroxylase; runt-related transcription factor 3; hypothetical protein FLJ23191; interleukin 11 receptor, alpha; procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer; frizzled homolog 7; hypothetical gene BC008967; collagen, type VIII, alpha 1; tenascin C; iroquois homeobox protein 5; hephaestin; integrin, beta 8; synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2; cDNA FLJ12280 fis, clone MAMMA1001744; cytokine receptor-like factor 1; potassium intermediate\/small conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily N, member 4; integrin, alpha 7; DKFZP586L151 protein; transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ); sine oculis homeobox homolog 2; KIAA1034 protein; early growth response 3; distal-less homeobox 5; hypothetical protein FLJ20373; aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C3 (3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type II); biglycan; fibronectin 1; proenkephalin; integrin, beta-like 1 (with EGF-like repeat domains); cDNA clone EUROIMAGE 1968422; EphA3; KIAA0367 protein; natriuretic peptide receptor C\/guanylate cyclase C (atrionatriuretic peptide receptor C); hypothetical protein FLJ14054; cDNA DKFZp564B222 (from clone DKFZp564B222); vesicle-associated membrane protein 5; EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1; BCL2\/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3-like; AE binding protein 1; cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa polypeptide 1 (muscle); neuroblastoma, suppression of tumorigenicity 1; and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, 36 kDa;","secretion of at least one of MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, GCP-2, HGF, KGF, FGF, HB-EGF, BDNF, TPO, MIP1a, RANTES, and TIMP1;","lack of secretion of at least one of TGF-beta2, ANG2, PDGFbb, MIP1b, 1309, MDC, and VEGF, as detected by ELISA; and","the ability to undergo at least 40 population doublings in culture.","In certain embodiments, the postpartum-derived cell is an umbilicus-derived cell. In other embodiments, it is a placenta-derived cell. In specific embodiments, the cell has all identifying features of any one of: cell type PLA 071003 (P8) (ATCC Accession No. PTA-6074); cell type PLA 071003 (P11) (ATCC Accession No. PTA-6075); cell type PLA 071003 (P16) (ATCC Accession No. PTA-6079); cell type UMB 022803 (P7) (ATCC Accession No. PTA-6067); or cell type UMB 022803 (P17) (ATCC Accession No. PTA-6068). The postpartum-derived cells of the invention are preferably human cells. The cells may provide trophic support to cells of a soft tissue phenotype, for example, that of fascia, epithelium, endothelium, skin, vasculature, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The cells themselves may be induced to differentiate to a soft tissue phenotype.","Populations of PPDCs are provided by the invention. In some embodiments, a population of postpartum-derived cells is mixed with another population of cells. In some embodiments, the cell population is heterogeneous. A heterogeneous cell population of the invention may comprise at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95% undifferentiated or differentiation-induced PPDCs of the invention. The heterogeneous cell populations of the invention may further comprise, for example, stem cells, epithelial cells (e.g., mucosal cells, for example, cells of oral mucosa; gastrointestinal tract; nasal epithelium; respiratory tract epithelium; vaginal epithelium; corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, bladder urothelial cells, cells of the larynx, esophageal cells, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells, and mixtures thereof. Cell populations of the invention may be substantially homogeneous, i.e., comprise substantially only PPDCs (preferably at least about 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more PPDCs). Homogeneous cell populations of the invention may comprise umbilicus- or placenta-derived cells. Homogeneous populations of placenta-derived cells may be of neonatal or maternal lineage. Homogeneity of a cell population may be achieved by any method known in the art, for example, by cell sorting (e.g., flow cytometry), bead separation, or by clonal expansion.","The invention also provides heterogeneous and homogeneous cell cultures containing undifferentiated or differentiation-induced postpartum-derived cells of the invention.","Some embodiments of the invention provide a matrix for administration to a patient. In some embodiments, the matrix is seeded with a population of postpartum-derived cells (PPDCs) of the invention. In some embodiments, the matrix is pretreated with a population of postpartum-derived cells of the invention. The PPDCs may be differentiation-induced or undifferentiated. The population of PPDCs may be substantially homogeneous or heterogeneous. For example, the matrix may be inoculated with PPDCs and cells of at least one other desired cell type, for example but not by way of limitation, epithelial cells (e.g., cells of oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, nasal epithelium, respiratory tract epithelium, vaginal epithelium, corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells. The matrix may contain or be pre-treated with one or more bioactive factors including, for example, drugs, anti-inflammatory agents, antiapoptotic agents, and growth factors. The seeded or pre-treated matrices can be introduced into a patient's body in any way known in the art, including but not limited to implantation, injection, surgical attachment, transplantation with other tissue, and the like. The matrices of the invention may be configured in vitro or in vivo to a desired shape and\/or size, for example, to the shape and\/or size of a tissue or organ in vivo. The scaffolds of the invention may be flat or tubular or may comprise sections thereof. The scaffolds of the invention may be multilayered.","Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are PPDC products including extracellular matrix (ECM) of PPDCs, cell fractions (e.g., soluble cell fractions; insoluble cell fractions; cell lysate, supernates of cell fractions; cell membrane-containing fractions) of PPDCs, and PPDC-conditioned medium. Matrices of the invention may comprise or be pre-treated with any one of the foregoing PPDC-products.","In some embodiments the invention provides compositions of PPDCs or a PPDC product and one or more bioactive factors, for example, but not limited to growth factors, anti-apoptotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, and\/or differentiation-inducing factors.

Examples of soft tissue cells offered trophic support by PPDCs include cells of cartilage tissue, meniscal tissue, ligament tissue, tendon tissue, intervertebral disc tissue, periodontal tissue, skin tissue, vascular tissue, muscle tissue, fascia tissue, periosteal tissue, ocular tissue, pericardial tissue, lung tissue, synovial tissue, nerve tissue, kidney tissue, bone marrow, urogenital tissue, intestinal tissue, liver tissue, pancreas tissue, spleen tissue, or adipose tissue.","In some embodiments of the invention, PPDCs are induced to differentiate to a cell of a soft tissue phenotype, for example but not limited to, a phenotype of a cell of cartilage tissue, meniscal tissue, ligament tissue, tendon tissue, intervertebral disc tissue, periodontal tissue, skin tissue, vascular tissue, muscle tissue, fascia tissue, periosteal tissue, ocular tissue, pericardial tissue, lung tissue, synovial tissue, nerve tissue, kidney tissue, bone marrow, urogenital tissue, intestinal tissue, liver tissue, pancreas tissue, spleen tissue, or adipose tissue.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the postpartum-derived cells, extracellular matrix produced thereby, cell fractions, and PPDC-conditioned medium are included within the scope of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions preferably include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.","In some embodiments, methods of regenerating soft tissue in a patient in need thereof by administering PPDCs, PPDC products, PPDC compositions, or matrices of the invention to a patient are provided.","Further provided by the invention are methods for treating a soft tissue condition in a patient by administering one or more postpartum-derived cell, PPDC population, or PPDC products of the invention (e.g., ECM, matrix, cell fraction, conditioned medium, or composition of the invention). Treatment of a soft tissue condition according to the invention includes but is not limited to trophic support of soft tissue, tissue repair, tissue reconstruction, tissue bulking, cosmetic treatment, therapeutic treatment, tissue augmentation, and tissue sealing. The PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be used in the treatment of, for example but not by way of limitation, a hernia, damage to the pelvic floor, a burn, cancer, traumatic injury, scars, skin ulcers (e.g., decubitus (pressure) ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers), ischemic wounds, surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers; vascular disease such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and venous disease; muscle disease (e.g., congenital myopathies; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory, neurogenic, and myogenic muscle diseases; and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle-muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy); and replacement and repair of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament, rotator cuff, periodontal ligament).","The invention further provides methods of providing trophic support to cells such as soft tissue cells by exposing or contacting a cell to a postpartum-derived cell of the invention or a PPDC-product.

In some embodiments, the soft tissue condition is a vascular condition, such as a vascular disease or injury or improper vascular development. In some aspects of the invention, the vascular network is administered by transplantation to the patient.","Further provided by the invention are kits of the PPDCs and\/or PPDC products. The kits of the invention preferably include at least one component of a matrix, a hydrating agent, a cell culture substrate, a bioactive factor, a second cell type, a differentiation-inducing agent, cell culture media, and instructions, for example, for culture of the cells or administration of the cells and\/or cell products.","In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for identifying compounds that modulate growth and\/or differentiation of a postpartum-derived cell comprising contacting a cell of the invention with a compound and monitoring the cell for growth or a marker of differentiation. Also provided are methods for identifying compounds toxic to a postpartum-derived cell of the invention by contacting the cell with a compound and monitoring survival of the cell.","Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description and examples that follow.","Various terms used throughout the specification and claims are defined as set forth below.","Stem cells are undifferentiated cells defined by their ability at the single cell level to both self-renew and differentiate to produce progeny cells, including self-renewing progenitors, non-renewing progenitors and terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells are also characterized by their ability to differentiate in vitro into functional cells of various cell lineages from multiple germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm), as well as to give rise to tissues of multiple germ layers following transplantation and to contribute substantially to most, if not all, tissues following injection into blastocysts.","Stem cells are classified by their developmental potential as: (1) totipotent\u2014able to give rise to all embryonic and extraembryonic cell types; (2) pluripotent\u2014able to give rise to all embryonic cell types; (3) multipotent\u2014able to give rise to a subset of cell lineages, but all within a particular tissue, organ, or physiological system (for example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can produce progeny that include HSC (self-renewal), blood cell-restricted oligopotent progenitors, and all cell types and elements (e.g., platelets) that are normal components of the blood); (4) oligopotent\u2014able to give rise to a more restricted subset of cell lineages than multipotent stem cells; and (5) unipotent\u2014able to give rise to a single cell lineage (e.g., spermatogenic stem cells).","Stem cells are also categorized on the basis of the source from which they may be obtained. An adult stem cell is generally a multipotent undifferentiated cell found in tissue comprising multiple differentiated cell types. The adult stem cell can renew itself and, under normal circumstances, differentiate to yield the specialized cell types of the tissue from which it originated, and possibly other tissue types. An embryonic stem cell is a pluripotent cell from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst-stage embryo. A fetal stem cell is one that originates from fetal tissues or membranes. A postpartum stem cell is a multipotent or pluripotent cell that originates substantially from extraembryonic tissue available after birth, namely, the placenta and the umbilicus. These cells have been found to possess features characteristic of pluripotent stem cells, including rapid proliferation and the potential for differentiation into many cell lineages. Postpartum stem cells may be blood-derived (e.g., as are those obtained from umbilical cord blood) or non-blood-derived (e.g., as obtained from the non-blood tissues of the umbilical cord and placenta).","Embryonic tissue is typically defined as tissue originating from the embryo (which in humans refers to the period from fertilization to about six weeks of development. Fetal tissue refers to tissue originating from the fetus, which in humans refers to the period from about six weeks of development to parturition. Extraembryonic tissue is tissue associated with, but not originating from, the embryo or fetus. Extraembryonic tissues include extraembryonic membranes (chorion, amnion, yolk sac and allantois), umbilical cord and placenta (which itself forms from the chorion and the maternal decidua basalis).","Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized (\u201cuncommitted\u201d) or less specialized cell acquires the features of a specialized cell, such as a nerve cell or a muscle cell, for example. A differentiated or differentiation-induced cell is one that has taken on a more specialized (\u201ccommitted\u201d) position within the lineage of a cell. The term committed, when applied to the process of differentiation, refers to a cell that has proceeded in the differentiation pathway to a point where, under normal circumstances, it will continue to differentiate into a specific cell type or subset of cell types, and cannot, under normal circumstances, differentiate into a different cell type or revert to a less differentiated cell type. De-differentiation refers to the process by which a cell reverts to a less specialized (or committed) position within the lineage of a cell. As used herein, the lineage of a cell defines the heredity of the cell, i.e., which cells it came from and what cells it can give rise to. The lineage of a cell places the cell within a hereditary scheme of development and differentiation. A lineage-specific marker refers to a characteristic specifically associated with the phenotype of cells of a lineage of interest and can be used to assess the differentiation of an uncommitted cell to the lineage of interest.","In a broad sense, a progenitor cell is a cell that has the capacity to create progeny that are more differentiated than itself and yet retains the capacity to replenish the pool of progenitors. By that definition, stem cells themselves are also progenitor cells, as are the more immediate precursors to terminally differentiated cells. When referring to the cells of the present invention, as described in greater detail below, this broad definition of progenitor cell may be used. In a narrower sense, a progenitor cell is often defined as a cell that is intermediate in the differentiation pathway, i.e., it arises from a stem cell and is intermediate in the production of a mature cell type or subset of cell types. This type of progenitor cell is generally not able to self-renew. Accordingly, if this type of cell is referred to herein, it will be referred to as a non-renewing progenitor cell or as an intermediate progenitor or precursor cell.","As used herein, the phrase differentiates into a mesodermal, ectodermal or endodermal lineage refers to a cell that becomes committed to a specific mesodermal, ectodermal or endodermal lineage, respectively. Examples of cells that differentiate into a mesodermal lineage or give rise to specific mesodermal cells include, but are not limited to, cells that are adipogenic, chondrogenic, cardiogenic, dermatogenic, hematopoietic, endothelial, myogenic, nephrogenic, urogenitogenic, osteogenic, pericardiogenic, or stromal. Examples of cells that differentiate into ectodermal lineage include, but are not limited to epithelial cells, neurogenic cells, and neurogliagenic cells. Examples of cells that differentiate into endodermal lineage include, but are not limited to pleurigenic cells, and hepatogenic cells, cells that give rise to the lining of the intestine, and cells that give rise to pancreogenic and splanchogenic cells.","The cells of the invention are referred to herein as postpartum-derived cells or postpartum cells (PPDCs). Subsets of the cells of the present invention are referred to as placenta-derived cells (PDCs) or umbilicus-derived cells (UDCs). In addition, the cells may be described as being stem or progenitor cells, the latter term being used in the broad sense. The term derived is used to indicate that the cells have been obtained from their biological source and grown or otherwise manipulated in vitro (e.g., cultured in a growth medium to expand the population and\/or to produce a cell line). The in vitro manipulations of postpartum-derived cells and the unique features of the postpartum-derived cells of the present invention are described in detail below.","Various terms are used to describe cells in culture. Cell culture refers generally to cells taken from a living organism and grown under controlled conditions (\u201cin culture\u201d). A primary cell culture is a culture of cells, tissues or organs taken directly from organisms and before the first subculture. Cells are expanded in culture when they are placed in a growth medium under conditions that facilitate cell growth and\/or division, resulting in a larger population of the cells. When cells are expanded in culture, the rate of cell proliferation is sometimes measured by the amount of time needed for the cells to double in number. This is referred to as doubling time.","A cell line is a population of cells formed by one or more subcultivations of a primary cell culture. Each round of subculturing is referred to as a passage. When cells are subcultured, they are referred to as having been passaged. A specific population of cells, or a cell line, is sometimes referred to or characterized by the number of times it has been passaged. For example, a cultured cell population that has been passaged ten times may be referred to as a P10 culture. The primary culture, i.e., the first culture following the isolation of cells from tissue, is designated P0. Following the first subculture, the cells are described as a secondary culture (P1 or passage 1). After the second subculture, the cells become a tertiary culture (P2 or passage 2), and so on. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that there may be many population doublings during the period of passaging; therefore the number of population doublings of a culture is greater than the passage number. The expansion of cells (i.e., the number of population doublings) during the period between passaging depends on many factors, including but not limited to the seeding density, substrate, medium, and time between passaging.","A conditioned medium is a medium in which a specific cell or population of cells has been cultured, and then removed. While the cells are cultured in the medium, they secrete cellular factors that can provide trophic support to other cells. Such trophic factors include, but are not limited to hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix (ECM), proteins, vesicles, antibodies, and granules. The medium containing the cellular factors is the conditioned medium.","Generally, a trophic factor is defined as a substance that promotes survival, growth, proliferation, maturation, differentiation, and\/or maintenance of a cell, or stimulates increased activity of a cell. Trophic support is used herein to refer to the ability to promote survival, growth, proliferation, maturation, differentiation, and\/or maintenance of a cell, or to stimulate increased activity of a cell.","When referring to cultured vertebrate cells, the term senescence (also replicative senescence or cellular senescence) refers to a property attributable to finite cell cultures; namely, their inability to grow beyond a finite number of population doublings (sometimes referred to as Hayflick's limit). Although cellular senescence was first described using fibroblast-like cells, most normal human cell types that can be grown successfully in culture undergo cellular senescence. The in vitro lifespan of different cell types varies, but the maximum lifespan is typically fewer than 100 population doublings (this is the number of doublings for all the cells in the culture to become senescent and thus render the culture unable to divide). Senescence does not depend on chronological time, but rather is measured by the number of cell divisions, or population doublings, the culture has undergone. Thus, cells made quiescent by removing essential growth factors are able to resume growth and division when the growth factors are re-introduced, and thereafter carry out the same number of doublings as equivalent cells grown continuously. Similarly, when cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen after various numbers of population doublings and then thawed and cultured, they undergo substantially the same number of doublings as cells maintained unfrozen in culture. Senescent cells are not dead or dying cells; they are actually resistant to programmed cell death (apoptosis), and have been maintained in their nondividing state for as long as three years. These cells are very much alive and metabolically active, but they do not divide. The nondividing state of senescent cells has not yet been found to be reversible by any biological, chemical, or viral agent.","As used herein, the term Growth medium refers to a culture medium sufficient for expansion of postpartum-derived cells. Growth medium preferably contains Dulbecco's Modified Essential Media (DMEM). More preferably, Growth medium contains glucose. Growth medium preferably contains DMEM-low glucose (DMEM-LG) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Growth medium preferably contains about 15% (v\/v) serum (e.g., fetal bovine serum, defined bovine serum).

Examples of soft tissue conditions include but are not limited to hernias, damage to the pelvic floor, tear or rupture of a tendon or ligament, skin wounds (e.g., scars, traumatic wounds, ischemic wounds, diabetic wounds, severe burns, skin ulcers (e.g., decubitus (pressure) ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers), and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers); vascular conditions (e.g., vascular disease such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and venous disease; vascular injury, improper vascular development); and muscle diseases (e.g., congenital myopathies; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory, neurogenic, and myogenic muscle diseases; and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle-muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy).","The term treating (or treatment of) a soft tissue condition refers to ameliorating the effects of, or delaying, halting or reversing the progress of, or delaying or preventing the onset of, a soft tissue condition as defined herein and includes trophic support of soft tissue, soft tissue repair, reconstruction (e.g., breast reconstruction), bulking, cosmetic treatment, therapeutic treatment, tissue augmentation (e.g., bladder augmentation), and tissue sealing.","The term effective amount refers to a concentration of a reagent or pharmaceutical composition, such as a growth factor, differentiation agent, trophic factor, cell population or other agent, that is effective for producing an intended result, including cell growth and\/or differentiation in vitro or in vivo, or treatment of a soft tissue condition as described herein. With respect to growth factors, an effective amount may range from about 1 nanogram\/milliliter to about 1 microgram\/milliliter. With respect to PPDCs as administered to a patient in vivo, an effective amount may range from as few as several hundred or fewer to as many as several million or more. In specific embodiments, an effective amount of PPDCs may range from 10-10. It will be appreciated that the number of cells to be administered will vary depending on the specifics of the condition to be treated, including but not limited to size or total volume\/surface area to be treated, as well as proximity of the site of administration to the location of the region to be treated, among other factors familiar to the medicinal biologist.","The terms effective period (or time) and effective conditions refer to a period of time or other controllable conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity for in vitro methods), necessary or preferred for an agent or pharmaceutical composition to achieve its intended result.","The term patient or subject refers to animals, including mammals, preferably humans, who are treated with the pharmaceutical compositions or in accordance with the methods described herein.","The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (or medium), which may be used interchangeably with the term biologically compatible carrier or medium, refers to reagents, cells, compounds, materials (including, for example, matrices), compositions, and\/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio. As described in greater detail herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for use in the present invention include liquids, semi-solid (e.g., gels) and solid materials (e.g., scaffolds). As used herein, the term biodegradable describes the ability of a material to be broken down (e.g., degraded, eroded, dissolved) in vivo. The term includes degradation in vivo with or without elimination (e.g., by resorption) from the body. The semi-solid and solid materials may be designed to resist degradation within the body (non-biodegradable) or they may be designed to degrade within the body (biodegradable, bioerodable). A biodegradable material may further be bioresorbable or bioabsorbable, i.e., it may be dissolved and absorbed into bodily fluids (water-soluble implants are one example), or degraded and ultimately eliminated from the body, either by conversion into other materials or breakdown and elimination through natural pathways. Examples include, but are not limited to, hyaluronic acid and saline.","Several terms are used herein with respect to cell replacement therapy. The terms autologous transfer, autologous transplantation, autograft and the like refer to treatments wherein the cell donor is also the recipient of the cell replacement therapy. The terms allogeneic transfer, allogeneic transplantation, allograft and the like refer to treatments wherein the cell donor is of the same species as the recipient of the cell replacement therapy, but is not the same individual. A cell transfer in which the donor's cells have been histocompatibly matched with a recipient is sometimes referred to as a syngeneic transfer. The terms xenogeneic transfer, xenogeneic transplantation, xenograft and the like refer to treatments wherein the cell donor is of a different species than the recipient of the cell replacement therapy.","The term matrix as used herein refers to a support for the PPDCs or PPDC product of the invention, for example, a scaffold (e.g., VNW scaffold, foams such as PCL\/PGA, or self-assembling peptides such as RAD16) or supporting medium (e.g., hydrogel or a biomaterial such as Collagen\/oxidized regenerated cellulose).","The following abbreviations are used herein:\n\n","Various patents and other publications are cited herein and throughout the specification, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In one aspect, the invention provides postpartum-derived cells (PPDCs) derived from postpartum tissue substantially free of blood. The PPDCs may be derived from placenta of a mammal including but not limited to human. The cells are capable of self-renewal and expansion in culture. The postpartum-derived cells have the potential to differentiate into cells of other phenotypes. The invention provides, in one of its several aspects, cells that are derived from umbilicus, as opposed to umbilical cord blood. The invention also provides, in one of its several aspects, cells that are derived from placental tissue.","The cells have been characterized as to several of their cellular, genetic, immunological, and biochemical properties. For example, the cells have been characterized by their growth, by their cell surface markers, by their gene expression, by their ability to produce certain biochemical trophic factors, and by their immunological properties.","Derivation and Expansion of Postpartum-Derived Cells (PPDCs)","According to the methods described herein, a mammalian placenta and umbilicus are recovered upon or shortly after termination of either a full-term or pre-term pregnancy, for example, after expulsion after birth. Postpartum tissue can be obtained from any completed pregnancy, full-term or less than full-term, whether delivered vaginally, or through other means, for example, cesarean section. The postpartum tissue may be transported from the birth site to a laboratory in a sterile container such as a flask, beaker, culture dish, or bag. The container may have a solution or medium, including but not limited to a salt solution, such as, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or any solution used for transportation of organs used for transplantation, such as University of Wisconsin solution or perfluorochemical solution. One or more antibiotic and\/or antimycotic agents, such as but not limited to penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, gentamicin, and nystatin, may be added to the medium or buffer. The postpartum tissue may be rinsed with an anticoagulant solution such as heparin-containing solution. It is preferable to keep the tissue at about 4-10\u00b0 C. prior to extraction of PPDCs. It is even more preferable that the tissue not be frozen prior to extraction of PPDCs.","Isolation of PPDCs preferably occurs in an aseptic environment. Blood and debris are preferably removed from the postpartum tissue prior to isolation of PPDCs. For example, the postpartum tissue may be washed with buffer solution, such as but not limited to phosphate buffered saline. The wash buffer also may comprise one or more antimycotic and\/or antibiotic agents, such as but not limited to penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, gentamicin, and nystatin.","In some aspects of the invention, the different cell types present in postpartum tissue are fractionated into subpopulations from which the PPDCs can be isolated. This may be accomplished using techniques for cell separation including, but not limited to, enzymatic treatment to dissociate postpartum tissue into its component cells, followed by cloning and selection of specific cell types, for example but not limited to selection based on morphological and\/or biochemical markers; selective growth of desired cells (positive selection), selective destruction of unwanted cells (negative selection); separation based upon differential cell agglutinability in the mixed population as, for example, with soybean agglutinin; freeze-thaw procedures; differential adherence properties of the cells in the mixed population; filtration; conventional and zonal centrifugation; centrifugal elutriation (counter-streaming centrifugation); unit gravity separation; countercurrent distribution; electrophoresis; and flow cytometry, for example, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).","In a preferred embodiment, postpartum tissue comprising a whole placenta or a fragment or section thereof is disaggregated by ultrasonic disruption, mechanical force (mincing or shear forces), enzymatic digestion with single or combinatorial proteolytic enzymes, such as a matrix metalloprotease and\/or neutral protease, for example, collagenase, trypsin, dispase, LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.), hyaluronidase, and\/or pepsin, or a combination of mechanical and enzymatic methods. For example, the cellular component of the postpartum tissue may be disaggregated by methods using collagenase-mediated dissociation. Enzymatic digestion methods preferably employ a combination of enzymes, such as a combination of a matrix metalloprotease and a neutral protease. The matrix metalloprotease is preferably a collagenase. The neutral protease is preferably thermolysin or dispase, and most preferably is dispase. More preferably, enzymatic digestion of postpartum tissue uses a combination of a matrix metalloprotease, a neutral protease, and a mucolytic enzyme for digestion of hyaluronic acid, such as a combination of collagenase, dispase, and hyaluronidase or a combination of LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.) and hyaluronidase. Collagenase may be type 1, 2, 3, or 4. Other enzymes known in the art for cell isolation include papain, deoxyribonucleases, serine proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase, that may be used either on their own or in combination with other enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases, mucolytic enzymes, and neutral proteases. Serine proteases are preferably used consecutively following use of other enzymes. The temperature and period of time tissues or cells are in contact with serine proteases is particularly important. Serine proteases may be inhibited by alpha 2 microglobulin in serum and therefore the medium used for digestion is usually serum-free. EDTA and DNAse are commonly used in enzyme digestion procedures to increase the efficiency of cell recovery. The degree of dilution of the digestion may also greatly affect the cell yield as cells may be trapped within the viscous digest. The LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.) Blendzyme (Roche) series of enzyme combinations are very useful and may be used in the instant methods. Other sources of enzymes are known, and the skilled artisan may also obtain such enzymes directly from their natural sources. The skilled artisan is also well-equipped to assess new, or additional enzymes or enzyme combinations for their utility in isolating the cells of the invention. Preferred enzyme treatments are 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 hours long or longer. In more preferred embodiments, the tissue is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. during the enzyme treatment of the disintegration step.","Postpartum tissue comprising the umbilicus and placenta may be used without separation. Alternatively, the umbilicus may be separated from the placenta by any means known in the art. In some embodiments of the invention, postpartum tissue is separated into two or more sections, such as umbilicus and placenta. In some embodiments of the invention, placental tissue is separated into two or more sections, each section consisting of predominantly of either neonatal, neonatal and maternal, or maternal aspect. The separated sections then are dissociated by mechanical and\/or enzymatic dissociation according to the methods described herein. Cells of neonatal or maternal lineage may be identified by any means known in the art, for example, by karyotype analysis or in situ hybridization for the Y-chromosome. Karyotype analysis also may be used to identify cells of normal karyotype.","Isolated cells or postpartum tissue from which PPDCs grow out may be used to initiate, or seed, cell cultures. Cells are transferred to sterile tissue culture vessels either uncoated or coated with extracellular matrix or ligands such as laminin, collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, ornithine, vitronectin, and extracellular membrane protein (e.g., MATRIGEL (BD Discovery Labware, Bedford, Mass.)). PPDCs are cultured in any culture medium capable of sustaining growth of the cells such as, but not limited to, DMEM (high or low glucose), Eagle's basal medium, Ham's F10 medium (F10), Ham's F-12 medium (F12), Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium (MSCGM), DMEM\/F12, RPMI 1640, advanced DMEM (Gibco), DMEM\/MCDB201 (Sigma), and CELL-GRO FREE. The culture medium may be supplemented with one or more components including, for example, serum (e.g., fetal bovine serum (FBS), preferably about 2-15% (v\/v); equine serum (ES); human serum(HS)); beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), preferably about 0.001% (v\/v); one or more growth factors, for example, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and erythropoietin (EPO); amino acids, including L-valine; and one or more antibiotic and\/or antimycotic agents to control microbial contamination, such as, for example, penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, amphotericin B, gentamicin, and nystatin, either alone or in combination. The culture medium preferably comprises Growth medium (DMEM-low glucose, serum, BME, an antimycotic agent, and an antibiotic agent).","The cells are seeded in culture vessels at a density to allow cell growth. In a preferred embodiment, the cells are cultured at about 0 to about 5 percent by volume COin air. In some preferred embodiments, the cells are cultured at about 2 to about 25 percent Oin air, preferably about 5 to about 20 percent Oin air. The cells preferably are cultured at about 25 to about 40\u00b0 C., more preferably about 35\u00b0 C. to about 39\u00b0 C., and more preferably are cultured at 37\u00b0 C. The cells are preferably cultured in an incubator. The medium in the culture vessel can be static or agitated, for example, using a bioreactor. PPDCs preferably are grown under low oxidative stress (e.g., with addition of glutathione, ascorbic acid, catalase, tocopherol, N-acetylcysteine). \u201cLow oxidative stress\u201d, as used herein, refers to conditions of no or minimal free radical damage to the cultured cells.","Methods for the selection of the most appropriate culture medium, medium preparation, and cell culture techniques are well known in the art and are described in a variety of sources, including Doyle et al., (eds.), 1995, C& TC: LP, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester; and Ho and Wang (eds.), 1991, ACB, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, which are incorporated herein by reference.","The culture medium is changed as necessary, for example, by carefully aspirating the medium from the dish, for example, with a pipette, and replenishing with fresh medium. Incubation is continued until a sufficient number or density of cells accumulate in the dish. The original explanted tissue sections may be removed and the remaining cells trypsinized using standard techniques or using a cell scraper. After trypsinization, the cells are collected, removed to fresh medium and incubated as above. In some embodiments, the medium is changed at least once at approximately 24 hours post-trypsinization to remove any floating cells. The cells remaining in culture are considered to be PPDCs.","After culturing the isolated cells or tissue fragments for a sufficient period of time, PPDCs will have grown out, either as a result of migration from the postpartum tissue or cell division, or both. In some embodiments of the invention, PPDCs are passaged, or removed to a separate culture vessel containing fresh medium of the same or a different type as that used initially, where the population of cells can be mitotically expanded. PPDCs are preferably passaged up to about 100% confluence, more preferably about 70 to about 85% confluence. The lower limit of confluence for passage is understood by one skilled in the art. The PPDCs of the invention may be utilized from the first subculture (passage 0) to senescence. The preferable number of passages is that which yields a cell number sufficient for a given application. In certain embodiments, the cells are passaged 2 to 25 times, preferably 4 to 20 times, more preferably 8 to 15 times, more preferably 10 or 11 times, and most preferably 11 times. Cloning and\/or subcloning may be performed to confirm that a clonal population of cells has been isolated.","Cells of the invention may be cryopreserved and\/or stored prior to use.","Characterization of PPDCs","PPDCs may be characterized, for example, by growth characteristics (e.g., population doubling capability, doubling time, passages to senescence), karyotype analysis (e.g., normal karyotype; maternal or neonatal lineage), flow cytometry (e.g., FACS analysis), immunohistochemistry and\/or immunocytochemistry (e.g., for detection of epitopes including but not limited to vimentin, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin 18, von Willebrand factor, CD34, GROalpha, GCP-2, oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1, and NOGO-A), gene expression profiling (e.g., gene chip arrays; polymerase chain reaction (for example, reverse transcriptase PCR, real time PCR, and conventional PCR)), protein arrays, protein secretion (e.g., by plasma clotting assay or analysis of PPDC-conditioned medium, for example, by Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)), antibody analysis (e.g., ELISA; antibody staining for cell surface markers including but not limited to CD10, CD13, CD31, CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD80, CD86, CD90, CD117, CD141, CD178, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFr-alpha), HLA class I antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C), HLA class II antigens (HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR), B7-H2, and PD-L2), mixed lymphocyte reaction (e.g., as measure of stimulation of allogeneic PBMCs), and\/or other methods known in the art.","PPDCs can undergo at least 40 population doublings in culture. Population doubling may be calculated as [In (cell final\/cell initial)\/ln 2]. Doubling time may be calculated as (time in culture (h)\/population doubling).","Undifferentiated PPDCs preferably produce at least one of NOGO-A, GCP-2, tissue factor, vimentin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin; more preferred are cells which produce each of GCP-2, tissue factor, vimentin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.

The invention also provides compositions of PPDCs, including populations of PPDCs. In some embodiments, the cell population is heterogeneous. A heterogeneous cell population of the invention may comprise at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95% PPDCs of the invention. The heterogeneous cell populations of the invention may further comprise epithelial cells (e.g., mucosal cells, for example, cells of oral mucosa; gastrointestinal tract; nasal epithelium; respiratory tract epithelium; vaginal epithelium; corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, bladder urothelial cells, cells of the larynx, esophageal cells, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells. For example, cell populations of the invention may include PPDCs and at least one cell type of bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, and other soft tissue progenitor cells. In some embodiments, the cell population is substantially homogeneous, i.e., comprises substantially only PPDCs (preferably at least about 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more PPDCs). The homogeneous cell population of the invention may comprise umbilicus- or placenta-derived cells. Homogeneous populations of umbilicus-derived cells may be free of cells of maternal lineage. Homogeneous populations of placenta-derived cells may be of neonatal or maternal lineage. Homogeneity of a cell population may be achieved by any method known in the art, for example, by cell sorting (e.g., flow cytometry), bead separation, or by clonal expansion.","Methods of the invention further include methods for producing a population of postpartum-derived cells by expanding a cell of the invention in culture. The postpartum-derived cells of the invention preferably expand in the presence of from about 5% to about 20% oxygen. The postpartum-derived cells of the invention preferably are expanded in culture medium such as but not limited to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), mesenchymal stem cell growth medium, advanced DMEM (Gibco), DMEM\/MCDB201 (Sigma), RPMI1640, CELL-GRO FREE, advanced DMEM (Gibco), DMEM\/MCDB201 (Sigma), Ham's F10 medium, Ham's F12 medium, DMEM\/F12, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, or Eagle's basal medium. The culture medium preferably contains low or high glucose, about 2%-15% (v\/v) serum, betamercaptoethanol, and an antibiotic agent. The culture medium may contain at least one of fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor. The cells of the invention may be grown on an uncoated or coated surface. Surfaces for growth of the cells may be coated for example with gelatin, collagen (e.g., native or denatured), fibronectin, laminin, ornithine, vitronectin, or extracellular membrane protein (e.g., MATRIGEL). In some embodiments, a population of postpartum-derived cells is mixed with another population of cells.","The cells of the invention can be induced to differentiate to an ectodermal, endodermal, or mesodermal lineage, preferably a mesodermal or ectodermal lineage. For example, PPDCs may be induced to differentiate into a given lineage by subjecting them to differentiation-inducing cell culture conditions. Also provided herein are populations of cells incubated in the presence of one or more factors, or under conditions, that stimulate cell differentiation along a desired pathway (e.g., toward a soft tissue phenotype such as a muscular, endothelial, or epithelial phenotype).","Methods to characterize differentiation-induced cells of the invention, include, but are not limited to, histological, morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, or using cell surface markers, or genetically or molecularly, or by identifying factors secreted by the differentiation-induced cell, and by the inductive qualities of the differentiation-induced PPDCs.","Methods of Using PPDCs or PPDC Products","Genetic Engineering of PPDCs","The cells of the invention can be engineered using any of a variety of vectors including, but not limited to, integrating viral vectors, e.g., retrovirus vector or adeno-associated viral vectors; non-integrating replicating vectors, e.g., papilloma virus vectors, SV40 vectors, adenoviral vectors; or replication-defective viral vectors. Other methods of introducing DNA into cells include the use of liposomes, electroporation, a particle gun, or by direct DNA injection.","Hosts cells are preferably transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid of interest controlled by or in operative association with, one or more appropriate expression control elements such as promoter or enhancer sequences, internal ribosomal entry sites (IREs), transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, among others, and a selectable marker.","Following the introduction of the nucleic acid of interest, engineered cells may be allowed to grow in enriched media and then switched to selective media. A selectable marker in the nucleic acid of interest may confer resistance to a selection agent or allow cells to grow in the absence of an otherwise required factor. Cells may stably integrate the DNA of interest into their chromosomes. Cells expressing the DNA of interest may be cloned and expanded into cell lines.","This method can be advantageously used to engineer cell lines which express the DNA of interest.","Any promoter may be used to drive the expression of the DNA of interest. For example, viral promoters include, but are not limited to, the CMV promoter\/enhancer, SV40, papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus or elastin gene promoter. Preferably, the control elements used to control expression of the gene of interest allow for the regulated expression of the gene so that the product is synthesized only when desired in vivo. If transient expression is desired, constitutive promoters are preferably used in a non-integrating and\/or replication-defective vector. Alternatively, inducible promoters could be used to drive the expression of the gene of interest when necessary.","Inducible promoters include, but are not limited to, those associated with metallothionein and heat shock proteins.","An expression control element may be tissue-specific. An example of a transcriptional control region that exhibits tissue specificity is the myosin light chain-2 gene control region, which is active in skeletal muscle (Shani, 1985314:283).","The cells of the invention may be genetically engineered to \u201cknock out\u201d or \u201cknock down\u201d expression of factors that promote inflammation or rejection at the implant site. Negative modulatory techniques for the reduction of target gene expression levels or target gene product activity levels are discussed below. \u201cNegative modulation,\u201d as used herein, refers to a reduction in the level and\/or activity of target gene product relative to the level and\/or activity of the target gene product in the absence of the modulatory treatment. The expression of a native gene can be reduced or knocked out using a number of techniques including, for example, inhibition of expression by inactivating the gene completely (commonly termed \u201cknockout\u201d), for example using the homologous recombination technique. Usually, an exon encoding an important region of the protein (or an exon 5\u2032 to that region) is interrupted by a positive selectable marker, e.g., neo, preventing the production of normal mRNA from the target gene and resulting in inactivation of the gene. A gene may also be inactivated by creating a deletion in part of a gene or by deleting the entire gene. By using a construct with two regions of homology to the target gene, for example, the intervening sequence can be deleted (Mombaerts et al., 199188:3084-3087).","Antisense, small interfering RNA, DNAzymes, and ribozyme molecules which inhibit expression of the target gene can also be used in accordance with the invention to reduce the level of target gene activity. For example, antisense RNA molecules which inhibit the expression of major histocompatibility gene complexes (HLA) have been shown to be most versatile with respect to immune responses. Still further, triple helix molecules can be utilized in reducing the level of target gene activity.","These techniques are described in detail by L. G. Davis et al. (eds), 1994, BMMB2nd ed., Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., which is incorporated herein by reference.","Using any of the foregoing techniques, for example, the expression of IL-1 can be knocked out or knocked down in the cells of the invention to reduce the production of inflammatory mediators by the cells of the invention. Likewise, the expression of MHC class II molecules can be knocked out or knocked down in order to reduce the risk of rejection of the implanted tissue.","Once the cells of the invention have been genetically engineered, they may be administered to a patient to allow for the treatment of a soft tissue condition or to produce an anti-inflammatory gene product such as, for example, peptides or polypeptides corresponding to the idiotype of neutralizing antibodies for GM-CSF, TNF, IL-1, IL-2, or other inflammatory cytokines.","Alternatively, the genetically engineered cells may be used to produce new tissue in vitro, which is then administered to a subject, as described herein.","Secretion of Trophic Factors","The secretion of growth factors by PPDCs may provide trophic support for a second cell type in vitro or in vivo. PPDCs may secrete, for example, at least one of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), GCP-2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), thrombopoietin (TPO), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1a), RANTES, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), which can be augmented by a variety of techniques, including ex vivo cultivation of the cells in chemically defined medium.","As demonstrated by Example 14 herein, PPDCs have the ability to support survival, growth, and differentiation of other cell types in co-culture. The methods of the invention thus also include methods of providing trophic support to a soft tissue cell. The methods may include a step of exposing a soft tissue cell to a PPDC or PPDC product, such as PPDC conditioned medium. Examples of cells which may be supported by PPDCs or PPDC products include but are not limited to stem cells, myocytes, myoblasts, keratinocytes, melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, adipocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors). Exposure to or co-culture of PPDC or PPDC products with endothelial cells may stimulate angiogenesis by the endothelial cells.","PPDCs or PPDC products are co-cultured or exposed in vitro or are administered in vivo to provide trophic support to another cell type, including but not limited to epithelial cells (e.g., mucosal cells, for example, cells of oral mucosa; gastrointestinal tract; nasal epithelium; respiratory tract epithelium; vaginal epithelium; corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, bladder urothelial cells, cells of the larynx, esophageal cells, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract, stem cells, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells, and mixtures thereof. For co-culture, it may be desirable for the PPDCs and the desired other cells to be co-cultured under conditions in which the two cell types are in contact. This can be achieved, for example, by seeding the cells as a heterogeneous population of cells in culture medium or onto a suitable culture substrate. Alternatively, the PPDCs can first be grown to confluence and employed as a substrate for the second desired cell type in culture. In this latter embodiment, the cells may further be physically separated, e.g., by a membrane or similar device, such that the other cell type may be removed and used separately following the co-culture period. In other embodiments, the desired other cells are cultured in contact with a PPDC product, such as conditioned medium, extracellular matrix, and\/or a cell fraction of PPDCs. In other embodiments, matrices comprising PPDCs or PPDC products are administered to provide trophic support to another cell type. Use of PPDCs or PPDC products to promote expansion and\/or differentiation of other cell types may find applicability in research and in clinical\/therapeutic areas. For instance, such methods may be utilized to facilitate growth and\/or differentiation of cells of a given phenotype in culture (e.g., cells of a soft tissue phenotype) for basic research purposes or for use in drug screening assays. The methods may also be utilized for in vitro expansion of cells of a soft tissue phenotype for later administration for therapeutic purposes. For example, cells may be harvested from an individual, expanded in vitro in co-culture with PPDCs or a PPDC product, then returned to that individual (autologous transfer) or another individual (syngeneic, allogeneic, or xenogeneic transfer). In these embodiments, it will be appreciated that, following in vitro expansion, the population of cells comprising the PPDCs or PPDC products could be administered to a patient in need of treatment, for example, of a soft tissue condition as described herein. Alternatively, in situations where autologous transfer is appropriate or desirable, the cultured cell populations may be physically separated in culture, enabling removal of the autologous cells for administration to the patient.","In some embodiments, the culturing methods are performed in vivo. For example, PPDCs or a PPDC product may be administered to a patient to provide trophic support to another cell type, including but not limited to epithelial cells (e.g., mucosal cells, for example, cells of oral mucosa; gastrointestinal tract; nasal epithelium; respiratory tract epithelium; vaginal epithelium; corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, bladder urothelial cells, cells of the larynx, esophageal cells, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells, and mixtures thereof.","In some embodiments, PPDCs or PPDC products induce angiogenesis in co-culture with cells such as but not limited to epithelial cells (e.g., mucosal cells, for example, cells of oral mucosa; gastrointestinal tract; nasal epithelium; respiratory tract epithelium; vaginal epithelium; corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, bladder urothelial cells, cells of the larynx, esophageal cells, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells. For example, angiogenic factors, including but not limited to EPO, TIMP1, ANG2, PDGF-bb, TPO, KGF, HGF, FGF, VEGF, and HBEGF, are released by PPDCs. In some embodiments, methods of inducing angiogenesis according to the invention include exposing a soft tissue cell or population thereof to a PPDC or PPDC product in vitro or in vivo. Examples of soft tissue cells that form endothelial networks in accordance with the methods of the invention include aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells). Where the method is performed in vivo, PPDCs or PPDC products may be administered to a patient as described herein. For example, a PPDC population or product may be administered to a patient to provide needed angiogenic factors.","PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be used to produce a vascular network, as demonstrated in Example 14. Methods of producing a vascular network involve exposing (e.g., contacting) a population of soft tissue cells to PPDCs or a PPDC product such as a cell fraction (e.g., lysate or soluble cell fraction thereof), extracellular matrix, or conditioned medium. The population of soft tissue cells preferably contains at least one soft tissue cell of an aortic endothelial cell, coronary artery endothelial cell, pulmonary artery endothelial cell, iliac artery endothelial cell, microvascular endothelial cell, umbilical artery endothelial cell, and umbilical vein endothelial cell. The method of producing a vascular network may be performed in vitro or in vivo. Also included within the scope of the invention are the vascular networks so produced. The vascular networks of the invention may be administered to a patient as a therapeutic regimen. In some preferred embodiments, the vascular networks are administered as treatment of a soft tissue condition, for example but not by way of limitation, a vascular condition, such as a vascular disease or injury or improper vascular development. In some aspects of the invention, the vascular network is administered by transplantation to the patient. In preferred embodiments, damaged or diseased vasculature is removed prior to administration of the vascular network of the invention.","Conditioned Medium of PPDCs","Another embodiment of the invention features use of differentiation-induced or undifferentiated PPDCs for production of conditioned medium. Such conditioned media are contemplated for use in in vitro culture of cells, for example, stem or soft tissue progenitor cells, or cells of a soft tissue phenotype, including but not limited to epithelial cells (e.g., cells of oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, nasal epithelium, respiratory tract epithelium, vaginal epithelium, corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells, and mixtures thereof, or in vivo to support transplanted cells comprising homogeneous or heterogeneous populations of PPDCs or stem or progenitor cells, and\/or cells of a soft tissue phenotype, epithelial cells (e.g., cells of oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, nasal epithelium, respiratory tract epithelium, vaginal epithelium, corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells, and mixtures thereof, for example. PPDC conditioned medium also may be administered in vivo to support the growth, maintenance, and\/or differentiation of endogenous cells.","Therapeutic Applications of PPDCs and PPDC Products","PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be used to treat patients having a soft tissue condition, for example but not limited to patients requiring the repair or replacement of soft tissue resulting from disease or trauma or failure of the tissue to develop normally, or to provide a cosmetic function, such as to augment features of the body. The treatment may comprise at least one of soft tissue repair, reconstruction, bulking, cosmetic treatment, therapeutic treatment, tissue augmentation, and tissue sealing. Provided herein are methods of treating soft tissue conditions in a patient by administering to the patient PPDCs and\/or PPDC products of the invention. Therapeutic applications of the PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention include but are not limited to treatment of hernias, congenital defects, damage to the pelvic floor, tear or rupture of a tendon or ligament, a traumatic wound, skin repair and regeneration (e.g., scar revision or the treatment of traumatic wounds, burns, skin ulcers (e.g., decubitus (pressure) ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers), and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers; treatment of vascular conditions (e.g., vascular disease such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and venous disease; vascular injury; improper vascular development); and muscle diseases (e.g., congenital myopathies; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory, neurogenic, and myogenic muscle diseases; and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle-muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy), breast reconstruction, and bladder augmentation.","Also provided by the invention are methods of treating a patient in need of angiogenic factors comprising administering to the patient the PPDCs or PPDC products (e.g., conditioned medium) of the invention.","The PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be administered alone or as admixtures with other cells. For example, the PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered by way of a matrix. A matrix of the invention may comprise a three-dimensional scaffold. Scaffolds of the invention may be particulate, flat, tubular, single-layered, or multilayered. The PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Where PPDCs are to be administered with other cells, the PPDCs may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with the other cells. Where cells are to be administered sequentially with other cell types, the PPDCs may be administered before or after the cells of a second phenotype.

Preferable routes of in vivo administration include transplantation, implantation, injection, delivery via a catheter, microcatheter, suture, stent, microparticle, pump, or any other means known in the art.","When PPDCs or PPDC products are administered in semi-solid or solid devices, surgical implantation into a precise location in the body is typically a suitable means of administration. Liquid or fluid pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to a more general location (e.g., throughout a diffusely affected area, for example), from which PPDCs or PPDC products migrate to a particular location, e.g., by responding to chemical signals.","Dosage forms and regimes for administering PPDCs or PPDC products described herein are developed in accordance with good medical practice, taking into account the condition of the individual patient, e.g., nature and extent of the condition being treated, age, sex, body weight and general medical condition, and other factors known to medical practitioners. Thus, the effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to be administered to a patient is determined by these considerations as known in the art.","In some embodiments of the invention, it may not be necessary or desirable to immunosuppress a patient prior to initiation of PPDC- or PPDC product-based therapy. PPDCs have been shown not to stimulate allogeneic PBMCs in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Accordingly, transplantation with allogeneic, or even xenogeneic, PPDCs may be tolerated.","It may be desirable to pharmacologically immunosuppress a patient prior to initiating PPDC- or PPDC product-based therapy. This may be accomplished through the use of systemic or local immunosuppressive agents, or it may be accomplished by delivering the PPDCs in an encapsulated device. PPDCs may be encapsulated in a capsule that is permeable to nutrients and oxygen required by the cell and therapeutic factors the cell is yet impermeable to immune humoral factors and cells. Preferably the encapsulant is hypoallergenic, is easily and stably situated in a target tissue, and provides added protection to the implanted structure. PPDCs also may be genetically modified to reduce their immunogenicity.","Survival of transplanted PPDCs in a living patient can be determined through the use of a variety of scanning techniques, e.g., computerized axial tomography (CAT or CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Determination of transplant survival can also be done by removing a section of the target tissue and examining it, for example, visually or through a microscope. Alternatively, cells can be treated with stains that are specific for cells of a given lineage. Transplanted cells can also be identified by prior incorporation of tracer dyes such as rhodamine- or fluorescein-labeled microspheres, fast blue, bisbenzamide, ferric microparticles, or genetically introduced reporter gene products, such as beta-galactosidase or beta-glucuronidase.","Functional integration of transplanted PPDCs into a subject can be assessed by examining restoration of the function that was damaged or diseased, for example, restoration of joint function, blood flow, muscle contraction, etc., or augmentation of function.","Compositions and Pharmaceutical Compositions","Compositions of PPDCs and related products (e.g., extracellular matrix, cell fraction, secreted factors, conditioned medium), including for example pharmaceutical compositions, are included within the scope of the invention. Compositions of the invention may include one or more bioactive factors, for example but not limited to, a growth factor, a differentiation-inducing factor, a cell survival factor such as caspase inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent such as p38 kinase inhibitor, or an angiogenic factor such as VEGF or bFGF. Some examples of bioactive factors include PDGF-bb, EGF, bFGF, IGF-1, and LIF. In some embodiments, undifferentiated or differentiation-induced PDPCs are cultured in contact with the bioactive factor. In some embodiments, undifferentiated PPDCs remain undifferentiated upon contact with the bioactive factor. In other embodiments, the bioactive factor induces differentiation of the PPDCs.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise homogeneous or heterogeneous populations of differentiated and\/or undifferentiated PPDCs or PPDC products in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable which do not deleteriously react with the cells of the invention or related products. To the extent they are biocompatible, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water, salt solution (such as Ringer's solution), alcohols, oils, gelatins, and carbohydrates, such as lactose, amylose, or starch, fatty acid esters, hydroxymethylcellulose, hyaluronic acid, and polyvinyl pyrolidine. Such preparations can be sterilized, and if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, and coloring. Pharmaceutical carriers suitable for use in the present invention are known in the art and are described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Sciences (17Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa.) and WO 96\/05309, each of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The compositions may be delivered in the form of a spray, suspension, solution, dry powder, cream, ointment, or gel.","The dosage (e.g., the number of cells to be administered) and frequency of administration of the pharmaceutical compositions will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to, the nature of the condition to be treated, the extent of the symptoms of the condition, characteristics of the patient (e.g., age, size, gender, health).","For example but not by way of limitation, PPDCs, extracellular matrices or cell fractions thereof, conditioned medium, matrices, vascular networks, and compositions produced according to the invention may be used to repair or replace underdeveloped, damaged, or destroyed soft tissue, to augment existing soft tissue, to introduce new or altered tissue, to modify artificial prostheses, or to join biological tissues or structures. For example, some embodiments of the invention include (i) hernia closures with replacement soft tissue constructs grown in three-dimensional cultures; (ii) skin grafts with soft tissue constructs; (iii) prostheses; (iv) blood vessel grafts; and (v) tendon or ligament reconstruction. Examples of such conditions that can be treated according to the methods of the invention include congenital anomalies such as hemifacial microsomia, malar and zygomatic hypoplasia, unilateral mammary hypoplasia, pectus excavatum, pectoralis agenesis (Poland's anomaly) and velopharyngeal incompetence secondary to cleft palate repair or submucous cleft palate (as a retropharyngeal implant); acquired defects (post-traumatic, post-surgical, post-infectious) such as scars, subcutaneous atrophy (e.g., secondary to discoid lupus erythematosus), keratotic lesions, acne pitting of the face, linear scleroderma with subcutaneous atrophy, saddle-nose deformity, Romberg's disease, and unilateral vocal cord paralysis; cosmetic defects such as glabellar frown lines, deep nasolabial creases, circum-oral geographical wrinkles, sunken cheeks and mammary hypoplasia; hernias; tears or ruptures of a tendon or ligament; severe burns, skin ulcers (e.g., decubitus (pressure) ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers), and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers; vascular diseases such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and venous disease; muscle diseases (e.g., congenital myopathies; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory, neurogenic, and myogenic muscle diseases; and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle-muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy); and replacement and repair of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.","The successful repair or replacement of damaged tissue can be enhanced if the implanted cells and\/or tissue can be fixed in place at the site of repair. Post-implantation movement may cause the new cells or tissue to become dislodged from the site if a pro-active fixation technique is not employed. Various methods can be used to fix the new cells and\/or tissue in place, including: patches derived from biocompatible tissues, which can be placed over the site; biodegradable sutures, hollow sutures, porous sutures, or other fasteners, e.g., pins, staples, tacks, screws and anchors; non-absorbable fixation devices, e.g., sutures, pins, screws and anchors; adhesives; and the use of interference fit geometries.","The PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be administered alone, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, through a catheter or microcatheter, via a pump or spray, or on or in a matrix as described herein.","Use of PPDCs or PPDC Products for Transplantation","The treatment methods of the subject invention involve the implantation of PPDCs, PPDC products, or trans-differentiated cells into individuals in need thereof. PPDCs or PPDC products of the present invention may be delivered to the site of therapeutic need or \u201chome\u201d to the site.","The cells of the present invention may be differentiated in vitro prior to implantation in a patient. In vitro differentiation allows for controlled application of bioactive factors. Alternatively, the cells of the present invention may differentiate in situ or provide trophic support to endogenous cells. The appropriate cell implantation dosage in humans can be determined from existing information relating to, e.g., the activity of the cells. From in vitro culture and in vivo animal experiments, the amount of factors produced can be quantitated. This information is also useful in calculating an appropriate dosage of implanted material. Additionally, the patient can be monitored to determine if additional implantation can be made or implanted material reduced accordingly.","To enhance vascularization and survival of the transplanted cells, angiogenic factors such as VEGF, PDGF or bFGF can be added either alone or in combination with endothelial cells or their progenitors, including CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells.","One or more other components may be co-administered, including selected extracellular matrix components, such as one or more types of collagen known in the art, and\/or growth factors, platelet-rich plasma, and drugs. Alternatively, the cells of the invention may be genetically engineered to express and produce growth factors. Bioactive factors which may be usefully incorporated into the cell formulation include anti-apoptotic agents (e.g., EPO, EPO mimetibody, TPO, IGF-I and IGF-II, HGF, caspase inhibitors); anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., p38 MAPK inhibitors, TGF-beta inhibitors, statins, IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, pemirolast, tranilast, REMICADE, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; e.g., tepoxalin, tolmetin, suprofen); immunosupressive\/immunomodulatory agents (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus; mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus); anti-proliferatives (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil); corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, hydrocortisone); antibodies such as monoclonal anti-IL-2Ralpha receptor antibodies (e.g., basiliximab, daclizumab), polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies (e.g., anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG); anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG); monoclonal anti-T cell antibody OKT3)); anti-thrombogenic agents (e.g., heparin, heparin derivatives, urokinase, PPack (dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone), antithrombin compounds, platelet receptor antagonists, anti-thrombin antibodies, anti-platelet receptor antibodies, aspirin, dipyridamole, protamine, hirudin, prostaglandin inhibitors, and platelet inhibitors); and anti-oxidants (e.g., probucol, vitamin A, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, coenzyme Q-10, glutathione, L-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine) as well as local anesthetics. As another example, the cells may be co-administered with scar inhibitory factor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,735, incorporated herein by reference.","In a non-limiting embodiment, a formulation comprising PPDCs or PPDC products of the invention is prepared for administration directly to the site where the new soft tissue is desired. In some embodiments, the support for the PPDCs or PPDC products of the invention is biodegradable. As an example of a formulation of the invention, and not by way of limitation, PPDCs or PPDC products of the invention may be suspended in a hydrogel solution for injection. Examples of suitable hydrogels for use in the invention include self-assembling peptides, such as RAD16. Alternatively, the hydrogel solution may be allowed to harden, for instance in a mold, to form a matrix having PPDCs or PPDC products dispersed therein prior to implantation. Or, once the matrix has hardened, the cell formulations may be cultured so that the cells are mitotically expanded prior to implantation. Hydrogels are organic polymers (natural or synthetic) which are cross-linked via covalent, ionic, or hydrogen bonds to create a three-dimensional open-lattice structure which entraps water molecules to form a gel. Examples of materials which can be used to form a hydrogel include polysaccharides such as alginate and salts thereof, peptides, polyphosphazines, and polyacrylates, which are crosslinked ionically, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), or block polymers such as polyethylene oxide-polypropylene glycol block copolymers which are crosslinked by temperature or pH, respectively. In some embodiments of the invention, the formulation comprises an in situ polymerizable gel, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2002\/0022676; Anseth et al., 78(1-3): 199-209 (2002); Wang et al., 24(22):3969-80 (2003). Methods of synthesis of the hydrogel materials, as well as methods for preparing such hydrogels, are known in the art.","Other components may also be included in the formulation, including but not limited to any of the following: (1) buffers to provide appropriate pH and isotonicity; (2) lubricants; (3) viscous materials to retain the cells at or near the site of administration, including, for example, alginates, agars and plant gums; and (4) other cell types that may produce a desired effect at the site of administration, such as, for example, enhancement or modification of the formation of tissue or its physicochemical characteristics, or as support for the viability of the cells, or inhibition of inflammation or rejection. The cells may be covered by an appropriate wound covering to prevent cells from leaving the site. Such wound coverings are known to those of skill in the art.","Bioactive factors which may be usefully incorporated into the formulations of the invention include anti-apoptotic agents (e.g., EPO, EPO mimetibody, TPO, IGF-I and IGF-II, HGF, caspase inhibitors); anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., p38 MAPK inhibitors, TGF-beta inhibitors, statins, IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, pemirolast, tranilast, REMICADE, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; e.g., tepoxalin, tolmetin, suprofen); immunosupressive\/immunomodulatory agents (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus; mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus); anti-proliferatives (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil); corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone, hydrocortisone); antibodies such as monoclonal anti-IL-2Ralpha receptor antibodies (e.g., basiliximab, daclizumab), polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies (e.g., anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG); anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG); monoclonal anti-T cell antibody OKT3)); anti-thrombogenic agents (e.g., heparin, heparin derivatives, urokinase, PPack (dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone), antithrombin compounds, platelet receptor antagonists, anti-thrombin antibodies, anti-platelet receptor antibodies, aspirin, dipyridamole, protamine, hirudin, prostaglandin inhibitors, and platelet inhibitors); and anti-oxidants (e.g., probucol, vitamin A, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, coenzyme Q-10, glutathione, L-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine) as well as local anesthetics. As another example, the cells may be co-administered with scar inhibitory factor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,735, incorporated herein by reference.","Formulation of a Soft Tissue Patch","Cultures or co-cultures of PPDCs in a pre-shaped well enables the manufacture of a soft tissue patch of pre-determined thickness and volume. The volume of the resulting tissue patch is dependent upon the volume of the well and upon the number of PPDCs in the well. Tissue of optimal pre-determined volume may be prepared by routine experimentation by altering either or both of the aforementioned parameters.","The cell contacting surface of the well may be coated with a molecule that discourages adhesion of PPDCs to the cell contacting surface. Preferred coating reagents include silicon based reagents i.e., dichlorodimethylsilane or polytetrafluoroethylene based reagents, i.e., TEFLON. Procedures for coating materials with silicon based reagents, specifically dichlorodimethylsilane, are well known in the art. See for example, Sambrook et al. (1989) \u201cMolecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. It is appreciated that other biocompatible reagents that prevent the attachment of cells to the surface of the well may be useful in the practice of the instant invention.","Alternatively, the well may be cast from a pliable or moldable biocompatible material that does not permit attachment of cells per se. Preferred materials that prevent such cell attachment include, but are not limited to, agarose, glass, untreated cell culture plastic and polytetrafluoroethylene, i.e., TEFLON. Untreated cell culture plastics, i.e., plastics that have not been treated with or made from materials that have an electrostatic charge are commercially available, and may be purchased, for example, from Falcon Labware, Becton-Dickinson, Lincoln Park, N.J. The aforementioned materials, however, are not meant to be limiting. It is appreciated that any other pliable or moldable biocompatible material that inherently discourages the attachment of PPDCs may be useful in the practice of the instant invention.","The size and shape of the well may be determined by the size and shape of the tissue defect to be repaired. The well should be deep enough to contain culture medium overlaying the tissue patch.","It is contemplated that a tissue patch prepared in accordance with the invention may be \u201ctrimmed\u201d or configured to a pre-selected size and\/or shape by a surgeon performing surgical repair of the damaged tissue. Trimming may be performed with the use of a sharp cutting implement, i.e., a scalpel, a pair of scissors or an arthroscopic device fitted with a cutting edge, using procedures well known in the art.","The pre-shaped well may be cast in a block of agarose gel under aseptic conditions. Agarose is an economical, biocompatible, pliable and moldable material that can be used to cast pre-shaped wells, quickly and easily. As mentioned above, the dimensions of the well may dependent upon the size of the resulting tissue plug that is desired.","A pre-shaped well may be prepared by pouring a hot solution of molten LT agarose (BioRad, Richmond, Calif.) into a tissue culture dish containing a cylinder, the cylinder having dimensions that mirror the shape of the well to be formed. The size and shape of the well may be chosen by the artisan and may be dependent upon the shape of the tissue defect to be repaired. Once the agarose has cooled and solidified around the cylinder, the cylinder is carefully removed with forceps. The surface of the tissue culture dish that is exposed by the removal of the cylinder is covered with molten agarose. This seals the bottom of the well. When the newly added molten LT agarose cools and solidifies, the resulting pre-shaped well is suitable for culturing and\/or inducing the differentiation of PPDCs. It is appreciated, however, that alternative methods may be used to prepare a pre-shaped well useful in the practice of the invention.","PPDCs in suspension may be seeded into and cultured in the pre-shaped well. The PPDCs may be induced to differentiate to a soft tissue phenotype in culture in the well or may have been induced to differentiate prior to seeding in the well. The cells may be diluted by the addition of culture medium to a cell density of about 1\u00d710to 1\u00d710PPDCs per milliliter.","Once the cells form a cohesive patch, the cohesive plug of cells may be removed from the well and surgically implanted into the tissue defect. It is anticipated that undifferentiated PPDCs may differentiate in situ thereby to form tissue in vivo.","In some embodiments, PPDCs are used to generate cell sheets. The sheets may be multilayered, as described in Shimizu, et al., 24(13):2309-2316 (2003).","Soft tissue defects may be identified by any means known in the art, for example, but not limited to computer aided tomography (CAT scanning); X-ray examination; or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Defects in soft tissue also are readily identifiable visually during arthroscopic examination or during open surgery. Treatment of the defects can be effected during an orthoscopic or open surgical procedure using the methods and compositions disclosed herein.","Accordingly, once the defect has been identified, the defect may be treated by (1) surgically implanting at the pre-determined site a tissue patch prepared by the methodologies described herein, and (2) permitting the tissue patch to integrate into pre-determined site.","The tissue patch optimally has a size and shape such that when the patch is implanted into the defect, the edges of the implanted tissue contact directly the edges of the defect. In addition, the tissue patch may be fixed in place during the surgical procedure. This can be effected by surgically fixing the patch into the defect with biodegradable sutures and\/or by applying a bioadhesive to the region interfacing the patch and the defect.","In some instances, diseased, damaged, or underdeveloped tissue may be surgically excised prior to implantation of the patch of synthetic tissue. A synthetic tissue patch is implanted subsequently into the defect by the methods described above.","Transplantation of PPDCs Using Scaffolds","The cells of the invention or co-cultures thereof may be seeded onto a scaffold, such as a three-dimensional scaffold, and implanted in vivo, where the seeded cells will proliferate on or in the framework and form a replacement tissue in vivo in cooperation with the cells of the patient.","Growth of PPDCs or co-cultures thereof on the framework results in the formation of a tissue which can be utilized in vivo as a corrective or supplemental structure. For example, and not by way of limitation, the scaffolds of the invention can be used to form tubular structures, like those of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, as well as blood vessels; tissues for hernia repair; tendons and ligaments.","In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, PPDCs or co-cultures thereof are inoculated and grown on a three-dimensional framework. The framework may be configured into the shape of the corrective structure desired. When grown in this three-dimensional system, the proliferating cells mature and segregate properly to form components of adult tissues analogous to counterparts found naturally in vivo.","Some embodiments of the invention provide a matrix for implantation into a patient. In some embodiments, the matrix is seeded with a population of postpartum-derived cells of the invention. The PPDCs may be differentiation-induced or undifferentiated. The PPDC population may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. The matrix may also be inoculated with cells of another desired cell type, for example but not by way of limitation, epithelial cells (e.g., cells of oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, nasal epithelium, respiratory tract epithelium, vaginal epithelium, corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells. The matrix may contain or be pre-treated with one or more bioactive factors including, for example, drugs, anti-inflammatory agents, antiapoptotic agents, and growth factors. In some aspects of the invention, the matrix is inoculated with PPDC products of the invention, including for example, extracellular matrix, secreted factors, or cell fractions of the PPDCs. In some embodiments, the matrix is biodegradable. In some embodiments, the matrix comprises extracellular membrane proteins, for example, MATRIGEL. In some aspects of the invention, the matrix comprises natural or synthetic polymers. Matrices of the invention include biocompatible scaffolds, lattices, self-assembling structures and the like, whether biodegradable or not, liquid or solid. Such matrices are known in the arts of cell-based therapy, surgical repair, tissue engineering, and wound healing. Preferably the matrices are pretreated (e.g., seeded, inoculated, contacted with) with PPDCs or PPDC products (e.g., extracellular matrix, conditioned medium, secreted factors, cell fraction, or combination thereof) of the invention. More preferably, PPDCs or PPDC products are in close association to the matrix or its spaces. In some aspects of the invention, the cells or PPDC products adhere to the matrix. In some embodiments, the cells or cell products are contained within or bridge interstitial spaces of the matrix. Most preferred are those seeded matrices wherein PPDCs or PPDC products are in close association with the matrix and which, when used therapeutically, induce or support ingrowth of the patient's cells and\/or proper angiogenesis. The seeded or pre-treated matrices can be introduced into a patient's body in any way known in the art, including but not limited to implantation, injection, surgical attachment, transplantation with other tissue, and the like. The matrices of the invention may be configured for use in vivo, for example, to the shape and\/or size of a tissue or organ in vivo. The scaffolds of the invention may be flat or tubular or may comprise sections thereof, as described herein. The scaffolds of the invention may be multilayered.","For example, but not by way of limitation, the scaffold may be designed such that the scaffold structure: (1) supports the PPDCs or PPDC products without subsequent degradation; (2) supports the PPDCs or PPDC products from the time of seeding until the scaffold is remodeled by the host tissue; or (3) allows the seeded cells to attach, proliferate, and develop into a tissue structure having sufficient mechanical integrity to support itself in vitro, at which point, the scaffold is degraded. A review of scaffold design is provided by Hutmacher, 12(1):107-124 (2001).","Scaffolds of the invention can be administered in combination with any one or more growth factors, cells, drugs, or other components described above that stimulate soft tissue formation or stimulate vascularization or innervation thereof or otherwise enhance or improve the practice of the invention.","The cells of the invention can be grown freely in a culture vessel to sub-confluency or confluency, lifted from the culture and inoculated onto a three-dimensional framework. Inoculation of the three-dimensional framework with a high concentration of cells, e.g., approximately 10to 5\u00d710cells per milliliter, will result in the establishment of the three-dimensional support in relatively shorter periods of time.","In some embodiments, it is important to re-create in culture the cellular microenvironment found in vivo, such that the extent to which the cells of the invention are grown prior to in vivo administration or use in vitro may vary. PPDCs, co-cultures thereof, or PPDC products may be inoculated onto the framework before or after forming the desired shape, e.g., ropes, tubes, filaments. Following inoculation of cells onto the framework, the framework is preferably incubated in an appropriate growth medium. During the incubation period, the inoculated cells will grow and envelop the framework and will bridge any interstitial spaces therein. It is preferable but not required to grow the cells to an appropriate degree which reflects the in vivo cell density of the tissue being repaired or regenerated.","Examples of scaffolds which may be used in the present invention include nonwoven mats, porous foams, sutures, beads, microparticles, or hydrogels. Nonwoven mats may, for example, be formed using fibers comprised of poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) polymer (10\/90 PLGA), referred to herein as VNW, available for purchase through Biomedical Structures (Slatersville, R.I.). Foams, composed of, for example, poly(epsilon-caprolactone)\/poly(glycolic acid) (PCL\/PGA) copolymer, formed by processes such as freeze-drying, or lyophilization, as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,355,699, are also possible scaffolds. Hydrogels such as self-assembling peptides (e.g., RAD16) may also be used. Another embodiment of a scaffold or matrix of the invention comprises collagen\/ORC, CMC, or ORC. These materials are frequently used as supports for growth of tissue. In some embodiments, the scaffold is lyophilized prior to use. In some embodiments, lyophilized scaffolds are rehydrated, with saline for example, prior to use. According to a preferred embodiment, the framework is a felt, which can be composed of a multifilament yarn made from a bioabsorbable material, e.g., PGA, PLA, PCL copolymers or blends, or hyaluronic acid. The yarn is made into a felt using standard textile processing techniques consisting of crimping, cutting, carding and needling.","In another preferred embodiment PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention are seeded onto foam scaffolds that may be composite structures. In addition, the three-dimensional framework may be molded into a useful shape, such as a specific structure in the body to be repaired, replaced, or augmented.","The framework may be treated prior to inoculation to enhance attachment of the PPDCs or PPDC products. For example, prior to inoculation, nylon matrices could be treated with 0.1 molar acetic acid and incubated in polylysine, PBS, and\/or collagen to coat the nylon. Polystyrene could be similarly treated using sulfuric acid.","In addition, the external surfaces of the three-dimensional framework may be modified to improve the attachment or growth of cells and differentiation of tissue, such as by plasma coating the framework or addition of one or more proteins (e.g., collagens, elastic fibers, reticular fibers), glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans (e.g., heparin sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratin sulfate), a cellular matrix, and\/or other materials such as, but not limited to, gelatin, alginates, agar, agarose, and plant gums, among others.","In some embodiments, the scaffold is comprised of or is treated with materials that render it non-thrombogenic. These treatments and materials may also promote and sustain endothelial growth, migration, and extracellular matrix deposition. Examples of these materials and treatments include but are not limited to natural materials such as basement membrane proteins such as laminin and Type IV collagen, synthetic materials such as ePTFE, and segmented polyurethaneurea silicones, such as PURSPAN (The Polymer Technology Group, Inc., Berkeley, Calif.). These materials can be further treated to render the scaffold non-thrombogenic. Such treatments include anti-thrombotic agents such as heparin, and treatments which alter the surface charge of the material such as plasma coating.","Different proportions of the various types of collagen, for example, deposited on the framework can affect the growth of tissue-specific or other cells which may be later inoculated onto the framework or which may grow onto the structure in vivo. For example, for three-dimensional skin culture systems, collagen types I and III are preferably deposited in the initial matrix. Alternatively, the framework can be inoculated with a mixture of cells which synthesize the appropriate collagen types desired. Thus, depending upon the tissue to be cultured, the appropriate collagen type to be inoculated on the framework or produced by the cells seeded thereon may be selected. For example, the relative amounts of collagenic and elastic fibers present in the framework can be modulated by controlling the ratio of collagen-producing cells to elastin-producing cells in the initial inoculum. For example, since the inner walls of arteries are rich in elastin, an arterial scaffold should contain a co-culture of smooth muscle cells which secrete elastin.","The seeded or inoculated three-dimensional framework of the invention can be used in a variety of applications. These include but are not limited to transplantation or implantation of either the cultured cells obtained from the matrix or the cultured matrix itself in vivo. The three-dimensional scaffolds may, according to the invention, be used to replace or augment existing tissue, to introduce new or altered tissue, to modify artificial prostheses, or to join together biological tissues or structures. For example, and not by way of limitation, specific embodiments of the invention include but are not limited to, flat structures and tubular three-dimensional tissue implants for repair or regeneration, for example, of the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, blood vessels, muscles, ligaments, tendons, skin, pelvic floor, fascia, and hernias.","PPDCs and PPDC products can be inoculated onto a flat scaffold. The scaffold is preferably incubated in culture medium prior to implantation. Two or more flat frameworks can be laid atop another and sutured together to generate a multilayer framework.","For example and not by way of limitation, the three-dimensional framework can be used to construct single and multi-layer tubular tissues in vitro that can serve as a replacement for damaged or diseased tubular tissue in vivo.","The following subsections describe the use of a seeded framework to prepare tubes comprising PPDCs and\/or PPDC products that can be implanted into the body.","A scaffold can be cut into a strip (e.g., rectangular in shape) of which the width is approximately equal to the inner circumference of the tubular organ into which it will ultimately be inserted. The cells can be inoculated onto the scaffold and incubated by floating or suspending in liquid media. At the appropriate stage of confluence, the scaffold can be rolled up into a tube by joining the long edges together. The seam can be closed by suturing the two edges together using fibers of a suitable material of an appropriate diameter.","According to the invention, a scaffold can be formed as a tube, inoculated with PPDCs or PPDC products, and suspended in media in an incubation chamber. In order to prevent occlusion of the lumen, one of the open ends of the tubular framework can be affixed to a nozzle. Liquid media can be forced through this nozzle from a source chamber connected to the incubation chamber to create a current through the interior of the tubular framework. The other open end can be affixed to an outflow aperture which leads into a collection chamber from which the media can be recirculated through the source chamber. The tube can be detached from the nozzle and outflow aperture when incubation is complete. This method is described by Ballermann, B. J., et al., Int. Application No. WO 94\/25584 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/430,768, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In general, two three-dimensional frameworks can be combined into a tube in accordance with the invention using any of the following methods.","Two or more flat frameworks can be laid atop another and sutured together. This two-layer sheet can then be rolled up, and, as described above, joined together and secured.","One tubular scaffold that is to serve as the inner layer can be inoculated with PPDCs or PPDC products and incubated. A second scaffold can be grown as a flat strip with width slightly larger than the outer circumference of the tubular framework. After appropriate growth is attained, the flat framework can be wrapped around the outside of the tubular scaffold followed by closure of the seam of the two edges of the flat framework and, preferably, securing the flat framework to the inner tube.","Two or more tubular meshes of slightly differing diameters can be grown separately. The framework with the smaller diameter can be inserted inside the larger one and secured.","For each of these methods, more layers can be added by reapplying the method to the double-layered tube. The scaffolds can be combined at any stage of growth of the PPDCs, and incubation of the combined scaffolds can be continued when desirable. Scaffolds comprising PPDC products may be layered with scaffolds comprising PPDCs.","The lumenal aspect of the tubular construct can be comprised of or treated with materials that render the lumenal surface of the tubular scaffold non-thrombogenic. These treatments and materials may also promote and sustain endothelial growth, migration, and extracellular matrix deposition. Examples of these materials and treatments include but are not limited to natural materials such as basement membrane proteins such as laminin and Type IV collagen, synthetic materials such as ePTFE, and segmented polyurethaneurea silicones, such as PURSPAN (The Polymer Technology Group, Inc., Berkeley, Calif.). These materials can be further treated to render the lumenal surface of the tubular scaffold non-thrombogenic. Such treatments include anti-thrombotic agents such as heparin, and treatments which alter the surface charge of the material such as plasma coating.","Advanced bioreactors may be necessary to meet the complex requirements of in vitro engineering of functional skeletal tissues. Bioreactor systems with the ability to apply complex concurrent mechanical strains to three-dimensional matrices, for example, in conjunction with enhanced environmental and fluidic control are provided by Altman et al., 124(6):742-749 (2002); U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0062151. For example but not by way of limitation, such a bioreactor system may be used in the development of a tissue-engineered tendon or ligament, e.g., anterior cruciate ligament.","According to the present invention, any suitable method can be employed to shape the three-dimensional culture to assume the conformation of the natural organ or tissue to be simulated. For example, a framework prepared in accordance with the invention may be \u201ctrimmed\u201d to a pre-selected size for surgical repair of the damaged tissue. Trimming may be performed with the use of a sharp cutting implement, i.e., a scalpel, a pair of scissors or an arthroscopic device fitted with a cutting edge, using procedures well known in the art.","The three-dimensional frameworks can be shaped to assume a conformation which simulates the shape of a natural organ or tissue, such as soft tissue including but not limited to pelvic floor, bladder, fascia, skin, muscle, tendon, ligament, or vasculature (e.g., arteries, veins). These constructions simulate biological structures in vivo and may be readily implanted to repair hernias or to replace damaged or diseased tissues, including hernias, tendons, ligaments, skin, muscle, blood vessels, and components of the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract (e.g., urethra, ureter).","In some embodiments, PPDCs or PPDC products are seeded on the scaffold in combination (e.g., as a co-culture or as separate layers of cells) with stem cells and\/or cells of a soft tissue phenotype. The cells to be co-inoculated with the PPDCs will depend upon the tissue to be simulated. For example, PPDCs may be inoculated onto the scaffold with epithelial cells (e.g., cells of oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, nasal epithelium, respiratory tract epithelium, vaginal epithelium, corneal epithelium), bone marrow cells, adipocytes, stem cells, keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells (e.g., aortic endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, iliac artery endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, umbilical artery endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitors (e.g., CD34+, CD34+\/CD117+ cells)), bladder urothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, gastrointestinal cells, esophageal cells, larynx cells, mucosal cells, myoblasts, myocytes, stromal cells, and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells.","The three-dimensional scaffold of the invention may be used in skin grafting. Preferably, the scaffold is about 0.5 to 3 millimeter thick and is in the form of a flat sheet. The scaffold is preferably seeded with PPDCs or PPDC products. The scaffolds may be co-inoculated with at least one of stem cells, epithelial cells, dermal fibroblasts, melanocytes, and keratinocytes. In some embodiments, keratinocytes form a layer over the PPDC-seeded framework. The scaffolds of the invention preferably comprise at least one of collagen, elastin, intercellular adhesion molecules, neural cell adhesion molecules, laminin, heparin binding growth factor, fibronectin, proteoglycan, tenascin, E-cahedrin, and fibrillin.","As another example, the three-dimensional scaffold may be used to generate muscle tissue. The scaffold is preferably seeded with PPDCs or PPDC products. The scaffolds may be co-inoculated with at least one of stem cells, myocytes, and myoblasts.","The three-dimensional framework may be modified so that the growth of cells and the production of tissue thereon or therein is enhanced, or so that the risk of rejection of the implant is reduced. Thus, one or more biologically active compounds, including, but not limited to, antiapoptotic agents, anti-inflammatories, angiogenic factors, immunosuppressants or growth factors, may be added to the framework.","Therapeutic Uses for Extracellular Matrix or Cell Fractions Derived from PPDCs","As an alternative to implanting the cells of the invention, or tissue produced therefrom, a subject in need of tissue repair, replacement, or augmentation may benefit from the administration of a PPDC product, such as extracellular matrix (ECM), conditioned medium, or a cell fraction of PPDCs.","In some embodiments, coculture of PPDCs with a scaffold deposits ECM onto the framework. Once ECM is secreted onto the framework, the cells may be removed. The ECM may be processed for further use, for example, as an injectable preparation. Scaffolds comprising the ECM may be used therapeutically. Alternatively, ECM may be collected from the scaffold. The collection of the ECM can be accomplished in a variety of ways, depending, for example, on whether the scaffold is biodegradable or non-biodegradable. For example, if the framework is non-biodegradable, the ECM can be removed by subjecting the framework to sonication, high pressure water jets, mechanical scraping, or mild treatment with detergents or enzymes, or any combination of the above.","If the framework is biodegradable, the ECM can be collected, for example, by allowing the framework to degrade or dissolve in solution. Alternatively, if the biodegradable framework is composed of a material that can itself be injected along with the ECM, the framework and the ECM product can be processed in toto for subsequent injection. Alternatively, the ECM can be removed from the biodegradable framework by any of the methods described above for collection of ECM from a non-biodegradable framework. All collection processes are preferably designed so as not to denature the ECM produced by the cells of the invention.","Once the ECM has been collected, it may be processed further. The ECM can be homogenized to fine particles using techniques well known in the art such as, for example, by sonication, so that they can pass through a surgical needle. ECM components can be crosslinked, if desired, by gamma irradiation. Preferably, the ECM can be irradiated between 0.25 to 2 mega rads to sterilize and crosslink the ECM. Chemical crosslinking using agents that are toxic, such as glutaraldehyde, is possible but not generally preferred.","Cell fractions prepared from the populations of the postpartum-derived cells also have many utilities. In one embodiment, whole cell lysates are prepared, e.g., by disrupting cells without subsequent separation of cell fractions. In another embodiment, a cell membrane fraction is separated from a soluble fraction of the cells by routine methods known in the art, e.g., centrifugation, filtration, or similar methods. Use of soluble cell fractions or supernatants in vivo allows the beneficial intracellular milieu to be used in a patient without triggering rejection or an adverse response. Methods of lysing cells are well-known in the art and include various means of freeze-thaw disruption, osmotic disruption, mechanical disruption, ultrasonic disruption, enzymatic disruption (e.g., hyaluronidase, dispase, proteases, and nucleases (for example, deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease)), or chemical disruption (non-ionic detergents such as, for example, alkylaryl polyether alcohol (TRITON\u00ae X-100), octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol (Rohm and Haas Philadelphia, Pa.), BRIJ-35, a polyethoxyethanol lauryl ether (Atlas Chemical Co., San Diego, Calif.), polysorbate 20 (TWEEN 20\u00ae), a polyethoxyethanol sorbitan monolaureate (Rohm and Haas), polyethylene lauryl ether (Rohm and Haas); and ionic detergents such as, for example, sodium dodecyl sulphate, sulfated higher aliphatic alcohols, sulfonated alkanes and sulfonated alkylarenes containing 7 to 22 carbon atoms in a branched or unbranched chain), or combinations thereof. Such cell lysates may be prepared from cells directly in their growth medium and thus containing secreted growth factors and the like, or may be prepared from cells washed free of medium in, for example, PBS or other solution. Cells may also be lysed on their growth substrate. Washed cells may be resuspended at concentrations greater than the original population density if preferred. Cell lysates prepared from populations of postpartum-derived cells may be used as is, further concentrated, by for example, ultrafiltration or lyophilization, or even dried, partially purified, combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as are known in the art, or combined with other compounds such as biologicals, for example pharmaceutically useful protein compositions. In some embodiments, cellular membranes are removed from the lysate, for example by centrifugation, or ultracentrifugation, filtration, chromatograph, or sedimentation, to yield a membrane fraction and supernate fraction. The membrane fraction or the supernate may be used according to the methods of the invention. In some embodiments, cellular debris is removed by treatment with a mild detergent rinse, such as EDTA, CHAPS or a zwitterionic detergent. Cell lysates may be used in vitro or in vivo, alone or, for example, with cells or on a substrate. The cell lysates, if introduced in vivo, may be introduced locally at a site of treatment, or remotely to provide, for example needed cellular growth factors to a patient.","The amounts and\/or ratios of proteins may be adjusted by mixing the PPDC product of the invention with cells or with ECM or cell fraction of one or more other cell types. In addition, biologically active substances such as proteins, growth factors and\/or drugs, can be incorporated into the PPDC product formulation. Exemplary biologically active substances include anti-inflammatory agents and growth factors which promote healing and tissue repair. Cells may be co-administered with the PPDC products of the invention.","The above described process for preparing PPDC products is preferably carried out under sterile conditions using sterile materials. The processed PPDC product in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be injected intradermally, intraarticularly, or subcutaneously to augment tissue or to repair or correct congenital anomalies, acquired defects or cosmetic defects.","Examples of such conditions are congenital anomalies such as hemifacial microsomia, malar and zygomatic hypoplasia, unilateral mammary hypoplasia, pectus excavatum, pectoralis agenesis (Poland's anomaly) and velopharyngeal incompetence secondary to cleft palate repair or submucous cleft palate (as a retropharyngeal implant); acquired defects (post-traumatic, post-surgical, post-infectious) such as scars, subcutaneous atrophy (e.g., secondary to discoid lupus erythematosus), keratotic lesions, acne pitting of the face, linear scleroderma with subcutaneous atrophy, saddle-nose deformity, Romberg's disease, and unilateral vocal cord paralysis; cosmetic defects such as glabellar frown lines, deep nasolabial creases, circum-oral geographical wrinkles, sunken cheeks and mammary hypoplasia; hernias; tears or ruptures of a tendon or ligament; severe burns, skin ulcers (e.g., decubitus (pressure) ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers), and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers; vascular diseases such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and venous disease; muscle diseases (e.g., congenital myopathies; myasthenia gravis; inflammatory, neurogenic, and myogenic muscle diseases; and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle-muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy); and replacement and repair of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.","Use of PPDCs for In Vitro Screening of Drug Efficacy or Toxicity","The cells and tissues of the invention may be used in vitro to screen for effectiveness as a trophic support or for cytotoxicity of compounds including pharmaceutical agents, growth\/regulatory factors, and anti-inflammatory agents. To this end, the cells of the invention, are maintained in vitro and exposed to the compound to be tested. The activity of a cytotoxic compound can be measured by its ability to damage or kill cells in culture. This may readily be assessed by vital staining techniques. The effect of trophic factors may be assessed by analyzing the number of living cells in vitro, e.g., by total cell counts, and differential cell counts or by detecting a marker of differentiation. This may be accomplished using standard cytological and\/or histological techniques, including the use of immunocytochemical techniques employing antibodies that define type-specific cellular antigens. The effect of various drugs on the cells of the invention either in suspension culture or in the three-dimensional system described above may be assessed.","The cells and tissues of the invention may be used as model systems for the study of soft tissue conditions.","The cells and tissues of the invention may also be used to study the mechanism of action of cytokines, growth factors and inflammatory mediators, e.g., IL-1, TNF and prostaglandins. In addition, cytotoxic and\/or pharmaceutical agents can be screened for those that are most efficacious for a particular patient. Agents that prove to be efficacious in vitro could then be used to treat the patient therapeutically.","Use of PPDCs to Produce Biological Molecules","In a further embodiment, the cells of the invention can be cultured in vitro to produce biological products in high yield. For example, such cells, which either naturally produce a particular biological product of interest (e.g., a growth factor, regulatory factor, or peptide hormone), or have been genetically engineered to produce a biological product, could be clonally expanded using, for example, the three-dimensional culture system described above. If the cells excrete the biological product into the nutrient medium, the product can be readily isolated from the spent or conditioned medium using standard separation techniques, e.g., such as differential protein precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, electrophoresis, and high performance liquid chromatography. A \u201cbioreactor\u201d may be used to take advantage of the flow method for feeding, for example, a three-dimensional culture in vitro.","Essentially, as fresh media is passed through the three-dimensional culture, the biological product is washed out of the culture and may then be isolated from the outflow, as above.","Alternatively, a biological product of interest may remain within the cell and, thus, its collection may require that the cells are lysed. The biological product may then be purified using any one or more of the above-listed techniques.","Kits","The PPDCs and PPDC products can conveniently be employed as part of a kit, for example, for culture or in vivo administration. Accordingly, the invention provides a kit including the PPDCs and\/or PPDC products and additional components, such as a matrix (e.g., a scaffold), hydrating agents (e.g., physiologically-compatible saline solutions, prepared cell culture media), cell culture substrates (e.g., culture dishes, plates, vials, etc.), cell culture media (whether in liquid or powdered form), antibiotic compounds, hormones, a bioactive factor, a second cell type, a differentiation-inducing agent, cell culture media, and the like. While the kit can include any such components, preferably it includes all ingredients necessary for its intended use. If desired, the kit also can include cells (typically cryopreserved), which can be seeded into the lattice as described herein.","In another aspect, the invention provides kits that utilize the PPDCs, PPDC populations, products of PPDCs in various methods for augmentation, regeneration, and repair as described above. In some embodiments, the kits may include one or more cell populations, including at least PPDCs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (liquid, semi-solid or solid). The kits also optionally may include a means of administering the cells, for example by injection. The kits further may include instructions for use of the cells. Kits prepared for field hospital use, such as for military use, may include full-procedure supplies including tissue scaffolds, surgical sutures, and the like, where the cells are to be used in conjunction with repair of acute injuries. Kits for assays and in vitro methods as described herein may contain one or more of (1) PPDCs or products of PPDCs, (2) reagents for practicing the in vitro method, (3) other cells or cell populations, as appropriate, and (4) instructions for conducting the in vitro method.","Cryopreservation and Banking PPDCs","PPDCs of the invention can be cryopreserved and maintained or stored in a \u201ccell bank\u201d. Cryopreservation of cells of the invention may be carried out according to known methods. For example, but not by way of limitation, cells may be suspended in a \u201cfreeze medium\u201d such as, for example, culture medium further comprising 0 to 95 percent FBS and 0 to 10 percent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), with or without 5 to 10 percent glycerol, at a density, for example, of about 0.5 to 10\u00d710cells per milliliter. The cryopreservation medium may comprise cryopreservation agents including but not limited to methylcellulose. The cells are dispensed into glass or plastic ampoules that are then sealed and transferred to the freezing chamber of a controlled rate freezer. The optimal rate of freezing may be determined empirically. A programmable rate freezer for example, can give a change in temperature of \u22121 to \u221210\u00b0 C. per minute. The preferred cryopreservation temperature is about \u221280\u00b0 C. to about \u2212180\u00b0 C., more preferably is about \u221290\u00b0 C. to about \u2212160\u00b0 C., and most preferably is about \u2212125 to about \u2212140\u00b0 C. Cryopreserved cells preferably are transferred to liquid nitrogen prior to thawing for use. In some embodiments, for example, once the ampoules have reached about \u221290\u00b0 C., they are transferred to a liquid nitrogen storage area. Cryopreserved cells can be stored for a period of years. Alternatively, cells could be freeze-dried using agents such as but not limited to trehalose, sucrose, maltose, and sorbitol.","The cryopreserved cells of the invention constitute a bank of cells, portions of which can be \u201cwithdrawn\u201d by thawing and then used as needed. Thawing should generally be carried out rapidly, for example, by transferring an ampoule from liquid nitrogen to a 37\u00b0 C. water bath. The thawed contents of the ampoule should be immediately transferred under sterile conditions to a culture vessel containing an appropriate medium such as DMEM conditioned with 10 percent FBS.","In another aspect, the invention provides for banking of tissues, cells, PPDC derivatives, and cell populations in freeze-dried form. A trehalose pre-incubation step is necessary to achieve this. In addition to trehalose, sucrose or other additives might be used. This will allow the generation of room temperature stable products with long shelf lives.","The following examples describe several aspects of embodiments of the invention in greater detail. These examples are provided to further illustrate, not to limit, aspects of the invention described herein.","The objective of this study was to derive populations of cells from placental and umbilicus tissues. Postpartum umbilicus and placenta were obtained upon birth of either a full term or pre-term pregnancy. Cells were harvested from 5 separate donors of umbilicus and placental tissue. Different methods of cell isolation were tested for their ability to yield cells with: 1) the potential to differentiate into cells with different phenotypes, or 2) the potential to provide critical trophic factors useful for other cells and tissues.","Methods & Materials","Umbilicus Cell Derivation.","Umbilical cords were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, Pa.). The tissues were obtained following normal deliveries. The cell isolation protocol was performed aseptically in a laminar flow hood. To remove blood and debris, the umbilicus was washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in the presence of antimycotic and antibiotic (100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 micrograms\/milliliter amphotericin B) (Invitrogen Carlsbad, Calif.)). The tissues were then mechanically dissociated in 150 cmtissue culture plates in the presence of 50 milliliters of medium (DMEM-Low glucose or DMEM-High glucose; Invitrogen) until the tissue was minced into a fine pulp. The chopped tissues were transferred to 50 milliliter conical tubes (approximately 5 grams of tissue per tube). The tissue was then digested in either DMEM-Low glucose medium or DMEM-High glucose medium, each containing antimycotic and antibiotic (100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 micrograms\/milliliter amphotericin B (Invitrogen)) and digestion enzymes. In some experiments, an enzyme mixture of collagenase and dispase was used (\u201cC:D;\u201d collagenase (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.), 500 Units\/milliliter; and dispase (Invitrogen), 50 Units\/milliliter in DMEM-Low glucose medium). In other experiments a mixture of collagenase, dispase and hyaluronidase (\u201cC:D:H\u201d) was used (collagenase, 500 Units\/milliliter; dispase, 50 Units\/milliliter; and hyaluronidase (Sigma), 5 Units\/milliliter, in DMEM-Low glucose). The conical tubes containing the tissue, medium and digestion enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in an orbital shaker (Environ, Brooklyn, N.Y.) at 225 rpm for 2 hrs.","After digestion, the tissues were centrifuged at 150\u00d7g for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in 20 milliliters of Growth medium (DMEM-Low glucose (Invitrogen), 15 percent (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; defined bovine serum; Lot#AND18475; Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 0.001% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 100 Units\/milliliter of penicillin, 100 microgram\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 microgram\/milliliter amphotericin B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The cell suspension was filtered through a 70-micrometer nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences). An additional 5 milliliter rinse comprising Growth medium was passed through the strainer. The cell suspension was then passed through a 40-micrometer nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and chased with a rinse of an additional 5 milliliters of Growth medium.","The filtrate was resuspended in Growth medium (total volume 50 milliliters) and centrifuged at 150\u00d7g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in 50 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. This process was repeated twice more.","Upon the final centrifugation supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. The number of viable cells was determined using Trypan Blue staining. Cells were then cultured under standard conditions.","The cells isolated from umbilicus were seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmonto gelatin-coated T-75 cmflasks (Corning Inc., Corning, N.Y.) in Growth medium (DMEM-Low glucose (Invitrogen), 15 percent (v\/v) defined bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah; Lot#AND18475), 0.001 percent (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 micrograms\/milliliter amphotericin B (Invitrogen)). After about 2-4 days, spent medium was aspirated from the flasks. Cells were washed with PBS three times to remove debris and blood-derived cells. Cells were then replenished with Growth medium and allowed to grow to confluence (about 10 days from passage 0 to passage 1). On subsequent passages (from passage 1 to 2, etc.), cells reached sub-confluence (75-85 percent confluence) in 4-5 days. For these subsequent passages, cells were seeded at 5000 cells\/cm. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator with 5 percent carbon dioxide and 20 percent oxygen at 37\u00b0 C.","Placental Cell Isolation.","Placental tissue was obtained from NDRI (Philadelphia, Pa.). The tissues were from a pregnancy and were obtained at the time of a normal surgical delivery. Placental cells were isolated as described for umbilicus cell isolation.","The following example applies to the isolation of separate populations of maternal-derived and neonatal-derived cells from placental tissue.","The cell isolation protocol was performed aseptically in a laminar flow hood. The placental tissue was washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in the presence of antimycotic and antibiotic (100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 microgram\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 microgram\/milliliter amphotericin B; Invitrogen) to remove blood and debris. The placental tissue was then dissected into three sections: top-line (neonatal side or aspect), mid-line (mixed cell isolation neonatal and maternal or villous region), and bottom line (maternal side or aspect).","The separated sections were individually washed several times in PBS with antibiotic\/antimycotic to further remove blood and debris. Each section was then mechanically dissociated in 150 cmtissue culture plates in the presence of 50 milliliters of DMEM-Low glucose (Invitrogen) to a fine pulp. The pulp was transferred to 50 milliliter conical tubes. Each tube contained approximately 5 grams of tissue. The tissue was digested in either DMEM-Low glucose or DMEM-High glucose medium containing antimycotic and antibiotic (100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 micrograms\/milliliter amphotericin B (Invitrogen)) of PBS and digestion enzymes. In some experiments an enzyme mixture of collagenase and dispase (\u201cC:D\u201d) was used containing collagenase (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) at 500 Units\/milliliter and dispase (Invitrogen) at 50 Units\/milliliter in DMEM-Low glucose medium. In other experiments a mixture of collagenase, dispase, and hyaluronidase (C:D:H) was used (collagenase, 500 Units\/milliliter; dispase, 50 Units\/milliliter; and hyaluronidase (Sigma), 5 Units\/milliliter in DMEM-Low glucose). The conical tubes containing the tissue, medium, and digestion enzymes were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. in an orbital shaker (Environ, Brooklyn, N.Y.) at 225 rpm.","After digestion, the tissues were centrifuged at 150\u00d7g for 5 minutes, the resultant supernatant was aspirated off. The pellet was resuspended in 20 milliliter of Growth medium (DMEM-Low glucose (Invitrogen), 15% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; defined bovine serum; Lot#AND18475; Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 0.001% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), antibiotic\/antimycotic (100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 microgram\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 microgram\/milliliter amphotericin B; Invitrogen)). The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 micrometer nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences), chased by a rinse with an additional 5 milliliters of Growth medium. The total cell suspension was passed through a 40 micrometer nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences) followed with an additional 5 milliliters of Growth medium as a rinse.","The filtrate was resuspended in Growth medium (total volume 50 milliliters) and centrifuged at 150\u00d7g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. This process was repeated twice more. After the final centrifugation, supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. A cell count was determined using the Trypan Blue Exclusion test. Cells were then cultured at standard conditions.","LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.) Cell Isolation.","Cells were isolated from umbilicus in DMEM-Low glucose medium with LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.) (2.5 milligrams per milliliter, Blendzyme 3; Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, Ind.) and hyaluronidase (5 Units\/milliliter, Sigma). Digestion of the tissue and isolation of the cells was as described for other protease digestions above using a LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.)\/hyaluronidase mixture in place of the C:D or C:D:H enzyme mixture. Tissue digestion with LIBERASE (Boehringer Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.) resulted in the isolation of cell populations from postpartum tissues that expanded readily.","Cell Isolation Using Other Enzyme Combinations.","Procedures were compared for isolating cells from the umbilicus using differing enzyme combinations. Enzymes compared for digestion included: i) collagenase; ii) dispase; iii) hyaluronidase; iv) collagenase:dispase mixture (C;D); v) collagenase:hyaluronidase mixture (C:H); vi) dispase:hyaluronidase mixture (D:H); and vii) collagenase:dispase:hyaluronidase mixture (C:D:H). Differences in cell isolation utilizing these different enzyme digestion conditions were observed (Table 1-1).","Isolation of Cells from Residual Blood in the Cords.","Attempts were made to isolate pools of cells from umbilicus by different approaches. In one instance umbilical cord was sliced and washed with Growth medium to dislodge the blood clots and gelatinous material. The mixture of blood, gelatinous material, and Growth medium was collected and centrifuged at 150\u00d7g. The pellet was resuspended and seeded onto gelatin-coated flasks in Growth medium. From these experiments a cell population was isolated that readily expanded.","Isolation of Cells from Cord Blood.","Cells have also been isolated from cord blood samples attained from NDRI. The isolation protocol used here was that of International Patent Application PCT\/US2002\/029971 by Ho et al. Samples (50 milliliters and 10.5 milliliters, respectively) of umbilical cord blood (NDRI, Philadelphia Pa.) were mixed with lysis buffer (filter-sterilized 155 millimolar ammonium chloride, 10 millimolar potassium bicarbonate, 0.1 millimolar EDTA buffered to pH 7.2 (all components from Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.)). Cells were lysed at a ratio of 1:20 cord blood to lysis buffer. The resulting cell suspension was vortexed for 5 seconds, and incubated for 2 minutes at ambient temperature. The lysate was centrifuged (10 minutes at 200\u00d7g). The cell pellet was resuspended in complete minimal essential medium (Gibco, Carlsbad Calif.) containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan Utah), 4 millimolar glutamine (Mediatech Herndon, Va.), 100 Units penicillin per 100 milliliters and 100 micrograms streptomycin per 100 milliliters (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.). The resuspended cells were centrifuged (10 minutes at 200\u00d7g), the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was washed in complete medium. Cells were seeded directly into either T75 flasks (Corning, N.Y.), T75 laminin-coated flasks, or T175 fibronectin-coated flasks (both Becton Dickinson, Bedford, Mass.).","Isolation of Postpartum-Derived Cells using Different Enzyme Combinations and Growth Conditions.","To determine whether cell populations can be isolated under different conditions and expanded under a variety of conditions immediately after isolation, cells were digested in Growth medium with or without 0.001 percent (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), using the enzyme combination of C:D:H, according to the procedures provided above. Placenta-derived cells so isolated were seeded under a variety of conditions. All cells were grown in the presence of penicillin\/streptomycin. (Table 1-2).","In all conditions, cells attached and expanded well between passage 0 and 1 (Table 1-2). Cells in conditions 5 to 8 and 13 to 16 were demonstrated to proliferate well up to 4 passages after seeding at which point they were cryopreserved. All cells were banked.","Results","Cell Isolation Using Different Enzyme Combinations.","The combination of C:D:H provided the best cell yield following isolation and generated cells which expanded for many more generations in culture than the other conditions (Table 1-1). An expandable cell population was not attained using collagenase or hyaluronidase alone. No attempt was made to determine if this result is specific to the collagen that was tested.","Isolation of Postpartum-Derived Cells using Different Enzyme Combinations and Growth Conditions.","Cells attached and expanded well between passage 0 and 1 under all conditions tested for enzyme digestion and growth (Table 1-2).

In the present study Blendzyme 3 which is collagenase (4 Wunsch units\/g) and thermolysin (1714 casein Units\/g) was also used together with hyaluronidase to isolate cells. These cells expand readily over many passages when cultured in Growth medium on gelatin-coated plastic.","Postpartum-derived cells were isolated from residual blood in the cords but not from cord blood.

After removing the gelatin solution, 10 milliliters phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) were added and then aspirated.","Comparison of Expansion Potential of Postpartum-Derived Cells to Other Cell Populations.","For comparison of growth expansion potential, the following cell populations were utilized: i) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC; Cambrex, Walkersville, Md.); ii) Adipose-derived cells (U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,374 B1; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2004\/0058412); iii) Normal dermal skin fibroblasts (cc-2509 lot # 9F0844; Cambrex, Walkersville, Md.); iv) Umbilicus-derived cells; and v) Placenta-derived cells.

For subsequent passages, cell cultures were treated as follows. After trypsinization, viable cells were counted after Trypan Blue staining. Cell suspension (50 microliters) was combined with Trypan Blue (50 microliters, Sigma, St. Louis Mo.). Viable cell numbers were estimated using a hemocytometer.","Following counting, cells were seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmonto gelatin-coated T 75 flasks in 25 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. Cells were grown under standard atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide at 37\u00b0 C. The growth medium was changed twice per week. When cells reached about 85 percent confluence, they were passaged; this process was repeated until the cells reached senescence.","At each passage, cells were trypsinized and counted. The viable cell yield, population doubling [In (cell final\/cell initial)\/ln 2] and doubling time (time in culture (h)\/population doubling) were calculated. For the purposes of determining optimal cell expansion, the total cell yield per passage was determined by multiplying the total yield for the previous passage by the expansion factor for each passage (i.e., expansion factor=cell final\/cell initial).","Expansion Potential of Cell Banks at Low Density.","The expansion potential of cells banked at passage 10 was also tested. A different set of conditions was used. Normal dermal skin fibroblasts (cc-2509 lot # 9F0844; Cambrex, Walkersville, Md.), umbilicus-derived cells, and placenta-derived cells were tested. These cell populations had been banked at passage 10 previously, having been seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmand grown to confluence at each passage to that point. The effect of cell density on the cell populations following cell thaw at passage 10 was determined. Cells were thawed under standard conditions, counted using Trypan Blue staining. Thawed cells were then seeded at 1,000 cells\/cmin Growth medium (DMEM-Low glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with 15 percent (v\/v) defined bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah; Lot#AND18475), 0.001 percent 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin, 0.25 micrograms\/milliliter amphotericin B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.)). Cells were grown under standard atmospheric conditions at 37\u00b0 C. Growth medium was changed twice a week and cells were passaged as they reached about 85% confluence. Cells were subsequently passaged until senescence, i.e., until they could not be expanded any further. Cells were trypsinized and counted at each passage. The cell yield, population doubling (ln (cell final\/cell initial)\/ln 2) and doubling time (time in culture (h)\/population doubling) were calculated. The total cell yield per passage was determined by multiplying total yield for the previous passage by the expansion factor for each passage (i.e., expansion factor=cell final\/cell initial).","Expansion of Postpartum-Derived Cells at Low Density from Initial Cell Seeding.","The expansion potential of freshly isolated postpartum-derived cell cultures under low cell seeding conditions was tested in another experiment. Umbilicus- and placenta-derived cells were isolated as described herein. Cells were seeded at 1000 cells\/cmand passaged as described above until senescence. Cells were grown under standard atmospheric conditions at 37\u00b0 C. Growth medium was changed twice per week. Cells were passaged as they reached about 85% confluence. At each passage, cells were trypsinized and counted by Trypan Blue staining. The cell yield, population doubling (ln (cell final\/cell initial)\/ln 2), and doubling time (time in culture (h)\/population doubling) were calculated for each passage. The total cell yield per passage was determined by multiplying the total yield for the previous passage by the expansion factor for each passage (i.e., expansion factor=cell final\/cell initial). Cells were grown on gelatin- and non-gelatin-coated flasks.","Expansion of Clonal Neonatal or Maternal Placenta-Derived Cells.","Cloning may be used in order to expand a population of neonatal or maternal cells successfully from placental tissue. Following isolation of three different cell populations from the placenta (neonatal aspect, maternal aspect, and villous region), these cell populations are expanded under standard growth conditions and then karyotyped to reveal the identity of the isolated cell populations. By isolating the cells from a mother who delivers a boy, it is possible to distinguish between the male and female chromosomes by performing metaphase spreads. These experiments can be used to demonstrate that top-line cells are karyotype positive for neonatal phenotype, mid-line cells are karyotype positive for both neonatal and maternal phenotypes, and bottom-line cells are karyotype positive for maternal cells.","Expansion of Cells in Low Oxygen Culture Conditions.","It has been demonstrated that low Ocell culture conditions can improve cell expansion in certain circumstances (Csete et al. Low oxygen culturing of central nervous system progenitor cells. US2004\/0005704). In order to determine if cell expansion of postpartum-derived cells could be improved by altering cell culture conditions, cultures of umbilicus-derived cells were grown in low oxygen conditions. Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmin Growth medium on gelatin-coated flasks. Cells were initially cultured under standard atmospheric conditions through passage 5, at which point they were transferred to low oxygen (5% O) culture conditions.","Evaluation of Other Growth Conditions.","In other experiments, postpartum-derived cells were expanded on non-coated, collagen-coated, fibronectin-coated, laminin-coated, and extracellular membrane protein (e.g., MATRIGEL (BD Discovery Labware, Bedford, Mass.))-coated plates. Cultures have been demonstrated to expand well on each.","Results","Comparison of Expansion Potential of Postpartum-Derived Cells vs. Other Stem Cell and Non-Stem Cell Populations.","Both umbilicus-derived and placenta-derived cells expanded for greater than 40 passages generating cell yields of >1E17 cells in 60 days. In contrast, MSCs and fibroblasts senesced after <25 days and <60 days, respectively. Although both adipose-derived and omental cells expanded for almost 60 days, they generated total cell yields of 4.5E12 and 4.24E13 respectively. Thus, when seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmunder the experimental conditions utilized, postpartum-derived cells expanded much better than the other cell types grown under the same conditions (Table 5-1).","Expansion of Potential of Cell Banks at Low Density.","Umbilicus-derived, placenta-derived, and fibroblast cells expanded for greater than 10 passages generating cell yields of >1E11 cells in 60 days (Table 5-2). After 60 days under these conditions, the fibroblasts became senescent, whereas the umbilicus-derived and placenta-derived cell populations senesced after 80 days, completing >50 and >40 population doublings, respectively.","Expansion of Postpartum-Derived Cells at Low Density from Initial Cell Seeding.","Postpartum-derived cells were seeded at low density (1,000 cells\/cm) on gelatin-coated and uncoated plates or flasks. Growth potential of these cells under these conditions was good. The cells expanded readily in a log phase growth. The rate of cell expansion was similar to that observed when postpartum-derived cells were seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmon gelatin-coated flasks in Growth medium. No differences were observed in cell expansion potential between culturing on either uncoated flasks or gelatin-coated flasks. However, cells appeared phenotypically much smaller on gelatin-coated flasks, and more, larger cell phenotypes were observed on uncoated flasks.","Expansion of Clonal Neonatal or Maternal Placenta-Derived Cells.","A clonal neonatal or maternal cell population can be expanded from placenta-derived cells isolated from the neonatal aspect or the maternal aspect, respectively, of the placenta. Cells are serially diluted and then seeded onto gelatin-coated plates in Growth medium for expansion at 1 cell\/well in 96-well gelatin-coated plates. From this initial cloning, expansive clones are identified, trypsinized, and reseeded in 12-well gelatin-coated plates in Growth medium and then subsequently passaged into T25 gelatin-coated flasks at 5,000 cells\/cmin Growth medium. Subcloning is performed to ensure that a clonal population of cells has been identified. For subcloning experiments, cells are trypsinized and reseeded at 0.5 cells\/well. The subclones that grow well are expanded in gelatin-coated T25 flasks at 5,000 cells cm\/flask. Cells are passaged at 5,000 cells cm\/T75 flask. The growth characteristics of a clone may be plotted to demonstrate cell expansion. Karyotyping analysis can confirm that the clone is either neonatal or maternal.","Expansion of Cells in Low Oxygen Culture Conditions.","Postpartum-derived cells expanded well under the reduced oxygen conditions. Culturing under low oxygen conditions does not appear to have a significant effect on cell expansion for postpartum-derived cells. Standard atmospheric conditions have already proven successful for growing sufficient numbers of cells, and low oxygen culture is not required for the growth of postpartum-derived cells.","Summary.","Commercially viable cell products must be able to be produced in sufficient quantities to provide therapeutic treatment to patients in need of the treatment. Postpartum-derived cells can be expanded in culture for such purposes. Comparisons were made of the growth of postpartum-derived cells in culture to that of other cell populations including mesenchymal stem cells. The data demonstrated that postpartum-derived cell lines as developed herein can expand for greater than 40 doublings to provide sufficient cell numbers, for example, for pre-clinical banks. Furthermore, these postpartum-derived cell populations can be expanded well at low or high density. This study has demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells, in contrast, cannot be expanded to obtain large quantities of cells.","The current cell expansion conditions of growing isolated postpartum-derived cells at densities of about 5,000 cells\/cmin Growth medium on gelatin-coated or uncoated flasks, under standard atmospheric oxygen, are sufficient to generate large numbers of cells at passage 11. Furthermore, the data suggests that the cells can be readily expanded using lower density culture conditions (e.g. 1,000 cells\/cm). Postpartum-derived cell expansion in low oxygen conditions also facilitates cell expansion, although no incremental improvement in cell expansion potential has yet been observed when utilizing these conditions for growth.

For triple-stained samples, each image was taken using only one emission filter at a time. Layered montages were then prepared using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, Calif.).","Results","Umbilical Cord Characterization.","Vimentin, desmin, SMA, CK18, vWF, and CD34 markers were expressed in a subset of the cells found within umbilical cord (data not shown). In particular, vWF and CD34 expression were restricted to blood vessels contained within the cord. CD34+ cells were on the innermost layer (lumen side). Vimentin expression was found throughout the matrix and blood vessels of the cord. SMA was limited to the matrix and outer walls of the artery and vein but was not contained within the vessels themselves. CK18 and desmin were observed within the vessels only, desmin being restricted to the middle and outer layers.","Placenta Characterization.","Vimentin, desmin, SMA, CK18, vWF, and CD34 were all observed within the placenta and regionally specific.","GROalpha, GCP-2, ox-LDL R1, and NOGO-A Tissue Expression.","None of these markers were observed within umbilical cord or placental tissue (data not shown).","Summary.","Vimentin, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin 18, von Willebrand Factor, and CD 34 are expressed in cells within human umbilical cord and placenta. Based on in vitro characterization studies showing that only vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin are expressed, the data suggests that the current process of postpartum cell isolation harvests a subpopulation of cells or that the cells isolated change expression of markers to express vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin.","Postpartum-derived cell lines were evaluated in vitro for their immunological characteristics in an effort to predict the immunological response, if any, these cells would elicit upon in vivo transplantation. Postpartum-derived cell lines were assayed by flow cytometry for the expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, CD80, CD86, and B7-H2. These proteins are expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and are required for the direct stimulation of na\u00efve CD4 T cells (Abbas & Lichtman, CMI5th Ed. (2003) Saunders, Philadelphia, p. 171). The cell lines were also analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of HLA-G (Abbas & Lichtman, CMI5th Ed. (2003) Saunders, Philadelphia, p. 171), CD 178 (Coumans, et. al., (1999) 224, 185-196), and PD-L2 (Abbas & Lichtman, CMI5th Ed. (2003) Saunders, Philadelphia, p. 171; Brown, et. al. (2003) 170, 1257-1266). The expression of these proteins by cells residing in placental tissues is thought to mediate the immuno-privileged status of placental tissues in utero. To predict the extent to which postpartum placenta- and umbilicus-derived cell lines elicit an immune response in vivo, the cell lines were tested in a one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).","Materials and Methods","Cell Culture.","Cells were cultured in Growth medium (DMEM-low glucose (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.), 15% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS); (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 0.001% (v\/v) betamercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 50 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 50 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.)) until confluent in T75 flasks (Corning, Corning, N.Y.) coated with 2% gelatin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).","Antibody Staining.","Cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.) and detached with Trypsin\/EDTA (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were harvested, centrifuged, and re-suspended in 3% (v\/v) FBS in PBS at a cell concentration of 1\u00d710per milliliter. Antibody (Table 11-1) was added to one hundred microliters of cell suspension as per manufacturer's specifications and incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged to remove unbound antibody. Cells were re-suspended in five hundred microliters of PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0492","num":"0571"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00019","num":"00019"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11-1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Antibodies"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Antibody","Manufacturer","Catalog Number"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["HLA-DRDPDQ","BD Pharmingen (San Diego,","555558"]},{"entry":[{},"CA)",{}]},{"entry":["CD80","BD Pharmingen (San Diego,","557227"]},{"entry":[{},"CA)",{}]},{"entry":["CD86","BD Pharmingen (San Diego,","555665"]},{"entry":[{},"CA)",{}]},{"entry":["B7-H2","BD Pharmingen (San Diego,","552502"]},{"entry":[{},"CA)",{}]},{"entry":["HLA-G","Abcam (Cambridgeshire, UK)","ab 7904-100"]},{"entry":["CD 178","Santa Cruz (San Cruz, CA)","sc-19681"]},{"entry":["PD-L2","BD Pharmingen (San Diego,","557846"]},{"entry":[{},"CA)",{}]},{"entry":["Mouse IgG2a","Sigma (St. Louis, MO)","F-6522"]},{"entry":["Mouse IgG1kappa","Sigma (St. Louis, MO)","P-4685"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction.","Cryopreserved vials of passage 10 umbilicus-derived PPDCs labeled as cell line A and passage 11 placenta-derived PPDCs labeled as cell line B were sent on dry ice to CTBR (Senneville, Quebec) to conduct a mixed lymphocyte reaction using CTBR SOP no.

In the mixed lymphocyte reactions conducted with umbilicus-derived cell lines, the average stimulation index ranged from 6.5 to 9, and that of the allogeneic positive controls ranged from 42.75 to 70. Placenta- and umbilicus-derived cell lines were negative for the expression of the stimulating proteins HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, CD80, CD86, and B7-H2, as measured by flow cytometry. Placenta- and umbilicus-derived cell lines were negative for the expression of immuno-modulating proteins HLA-G and CD178 and positive for the expression of PD-L2, as measured by flow cytometry. Allogeneic donor PBMCs contain antigen-presenting cells expressing HLA-DP, DR, DQ, CD80, CD86, and B7-H2, thereby allowing for the stimulation of allogeneic PBMCs (e.g., na\u00efve CD4 T cells). The absence of antigen-presenting cell surface molecules on placenta- and umbilicus-derived cells required for the direct stimulation of allogeneic PBMCs (e.g., na\u00efve CD4 T cells) and the presence of PD-L2, an immuno-modulating protein, may account for the low stimulation index exhibited by these cells in a MLR as compared to allogeneic controls.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0515","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":["Bruder S P et. al.

Cells were cryopreserved at passage 11 and stored in liquid nitrogen. After thawing of the cells, Growth medium was added to the cells followed by transfer to a 15 milliliter centrifuge tube and centrifugation of the cells at 150\u00d7g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 milliliters Growth medium, and cells were counted. Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmon a T75 flask containing 15 milliliters of Growth medium and cultured for 24 hours. The medium was changed to a serum-free medium (DMEM-low glucose (Gibco), 0.1% (w\/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 50 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 50 micrograms\/milliliter streptomycin (Gibco)) for 8 hours. Conditioned serum-free media was collected at the end of incubation by centrifugation at 14,000\u00d7g for 5 minutes and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. To estimate the number of cells in each flask, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached using 2 milliliters trypsin\/EDTA (Gibco). Trypsin activity was inhibited by addition of 8 milliliters Growth medium. Cells were centrifuged at 150\u00d7g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 1 milliliter Growth Medium. Cell number was estimated using a hemocytometer.","ELISA Assay.","Cells were grown at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% carbon dioxide and atmospheric oxygen.

The amount of MCP-1, IL-6, VEGF, SDF-1a, GCP-2, IL-8, and TGF-beta2 produced by each cell sample was measured by an ELISA assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The Proteome Arrays are multiplexed sandwich ELISAs for the quantitative measurement of two to 16 proteins per well. The arrays are produced by spotting a 2\u00d72, 3\u00d73, or 4\u00d74 pattern of four to 16 different capture antibodies into each well of a 96-well plate. Following a sandwich ELISA procedure, the entire plate is imaged to capture chemiluminescent signal generated at each spot within each well of the plate. The amount of signal generated in each spot is proportional to the amount of target protein in the original standard or sample.","Results","ELISA Assay.","MCP-1 and IL-6 were secreted by placenta- and umbilicus-derived PPDCs and dermal fibroblasts (Table 12-1).

It is important that injected cells not cause thrombosis, which may be fatal. Tissue factor, a membrane-bound procoagulant glycoprotein, is the initiator of the extrinsic clotting cascade, which is the predominant coagulation pathway in vivo. Tissue factor also plays an important role in embryonic vessel formation, for example, in the formation of the primitive vascular wall (Brodsky et al. (2002) 10:299-306). To determine the potential for PPDCs to initiate clotting, umbilicus- and placenta-derived PPDCs were evaluated for tissue factor expression and their ability to initiate plasma clotting.","Methods & Materials","Human Tissue Factor.","Human tissue factor SIMPLASTIN (Organon Tekailca Corporation, Durham, N.C.) was reconstituted with 20 milliliters distilled water.

Compliance with the above Public Laws were accomplished by adhering to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR) and conforming to the current standards promulgated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 7th edition.","Mice ()\/Fox Chase SCID\/Male (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, Ind.), 5 Weeks of Age.","All handling of the SCID mice took place under a hood. The mice were individually weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 60 milligram\/kilogram KETASET (ketamine hydrochloride, Aveco Co., Inc., Fort Dodge, Iowa) and 10 milligram\/kilogram ROMPUN (xylazine, Mobay Corp., Shawnee, Kans.) and saline. After induction of anesthesia, the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with chlorhexidine diacetate, rinsed with alcohol, dried, and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1% available iodine. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying of the tissue during the anesthetic period.","Subcutaneous Implantation Technique.","Four skin incisions, each approximately 1.0 cm in length, were made on the dorsum of the mice. Two cranial sites were located transversely over the dorsal lateral thoracic region, about 5-mm caudal to the palpated inferior edge of the scapula, with one to the left and one to the right of the vertebral column. Another two were placed transversely over the gluteal muscle area at the caudal sacro-lumbar level, about 5-mm caudal to the palpated iliac crest, with one on either side of the midline. Implants were randomly placed in these sites. The skin was separated from the underlying connective tissue to make a small pocket and the implant placed (or injected for RAD16) about 1-cm caudal to the incision. The appropriate test material was implanted into the subcutaneous space. The skin incision was closed with metal clips.","Animal Housing.","Mice were individually housed in microisolator cages throughout the course of the study within a temperature range of 64\u00b0 F.-79\u00b0 F. and relative humidity of 30% to 70% and maintained on an approximate 12 hour light\/12 hour dark cycle. The temperature and relative humidity were maintained within the stated ranges to the greatest extent possible. Diet consisted of Irradiated Pico Mouse Chow 5058 (Purina Co.) and water fed ad libitum.","Mice were euthanized at their designated intervals by carbon dioxide inhalation. The subcutaneous implantation sites with their overlying skin were excised and frozen for histology.","Histology.","Excised skin with implant was fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin (Richard-Allan Kalamazoo, Mich.). Samples with overlying and adjacent tissue were centrally bisected, paraffin-processed, and embedded on cut surface using routine methods. Five-micron tissue sections were obtained by microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Poly Scientific Bay Shore, N.Y.) using routine methods.","Results","There was minimal ingrowth of tissue into foams implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice after 30 days (data not shown). In contrast there was extensive tissue fill in foams implanted with umbilicus-derived cells or placenta-derived cells (data not shown).","There was some tissue in growth in VNW scaffolds. Non-woven scaffolds seeded with umbilicus- or placenta-derived cells showed increased matrix deposition and mature blood vessels (data not shown).","Summary.","The purpose of this study was to determine the type of tissue formed by cells derived from human umbilicus or placenta in scaffolds in immune deficient mice. Synthetic absorbable non-woven\/foam discs (5.0 millimeter diameter\u00d71.0 millimeter thick) or self-assembling peptide hydrogel were seeded with either cells derived from human umbilical cord or placenta and implanted subcutaneously bilaterally in the dorsal spine region of SCID mice. The present study demonstrates that postpartum-derived cells can dramatically increase good quality tissue formation in biodegradable scaffolds.","Methods & Materials","Preparation of Cell Lysate.","Approximately 25 million human umbilicus-derived cells (UDCs) at passage 11 were seeded into gelatin-coated T225 flasks. Because of the number of cells that were necessary to complete the study, the flasks were split, for trypsinization, into two sets which were combined to prepare the cell lysate. The cells ranged from approximately 70-95% confluent. Flasks were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin\/EDTA for 5 minutes until the cells began lifting from the dish. The trypsinization process was inactivated using 15% serum containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's growth media. Cells were pelleted in growth media and then resuspended in a total volume of 40 milliliters of PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS to remove residual FBS from the growth media. This was done by centrifuging the cells for 5 minutes at 1.5 RPM and then resuspending the cells in 40 milliliters of PBS until the three washes were complete.","In order to facilitate the freeze-thaw procedure, the cells were equally divided into two tubes with PBS for the freeze\/thaw procedure. The lysates were prepared by repeated freeze\/thaw cycles. To freeze the cells, the tubes were placed in a slurry of dry ice and isopropanol for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the tubes were placed in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath for 10 minutes.","The cell suspensions were transferred to ten sterile siliconized microcentrifuge tubes, to prevent protein adsorption, and centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to separate the cell membranes from the cytosolic components. The tubes (cell pellet) were then placed on ice and the supernatant was very gently mixed by tapping the centrifuge tube to ensure uniformity. The supernatant was transferred to new siliconized tubes and placed on ice.","SEARCHLIGHT Multiplexed ELISA Assay.","Chemokines, BDNF and angiogenic factors were measured using SEARCHLIGHT Proteome Arrays (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.). The proteome arrays are multiplexed sandwich ELISAs for the quantitative measurement of two to 16 proteins per well. The arrays are produced by spotting a 2\u00d72, 3\u00d73, or 4\u00d74 pattern of four to 16 different capture antibodies into each well of a 96-well plate. Following a typical sandwich ELISA procedure, the entire plate is imaged to capture chemiluminescent signal generated at each spot within each well of the plate. The amount of signal generated in each spot is proportional to the amount of target protein in the original standard or sample.","Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0617","num":"0707"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 16-1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SEARCHLIGHT Multiplexed ELISA results.

These factors might have beneficial effects on local environment by inducing cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. In addition, pro-angiogenic factors might induce new blood vessel formation in the wound environment and stimulate extracellular matrix formation. Furthermore, the high level of TIMPs might be extremely beneficial in the chronic wound environment, since chronic wounds are known to be associated with high levels of MMPs, known to mediate extracellular matrix degradation.","Umbilicus-derived cells produce and secrete various growth factors involved in tissue regeneration, including basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). The supernatant of lysed umbilicus-derived cells also contains these growth factors. The application of the lysate to biomaterials followed by lyophilization produces a device that, upon clinical application, will release the growth factors and enhance tissue regeneration.","The purpose of the present study was to provide methods for the production of lyophilized UDC lysate. The method consistently allowed the harvest of proteins from lysed UDCs. The amount of total protein (57.53+\/\u221238.69 picograms per cell) correlates to the harvest density of the cells (R\u2014Sq (adj)=71.5%). The growth factor bFGF was present in six separate production lots of lyophilized UDC lysate averaging 3.09+\/\u22121.06 picograms per microgram of total protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of UDC lysate showed the banding pattern of protein was consistent between separate production lots, pre- and post-lyophilization, and lyophilization into a synthetic biomaterial. The current method allowed reproducible production of lyophilized material containing growth factors for application in tissue regeneration.","Methods & Materials","Cell Growth and Harvest.","UDCs were seeded at 5,000 cells per cmin gelatin-coated flasks with growth media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Media (DMEM)-low glucose, 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin\/streptomycin (P\/S), Betamercaptoethanol (BME) and expanded for 3 to 4 days (25,000 cells per cmtarget harvest density). Cells were harvested with trypsin, collected, and centrifuged at 300 rcf for 5 minutes. The trypsin\/media was removed by aspiration and cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).","Cell Wash and Aliquoting.","After washing, the cells were re-suspended at 1.0E+07 cell\/ml in PBS and delivered as 1 ml aliquots into 1.5 ml sterile siliconized micro-centrifuge tubes. The cells were centrifuged at 300 rcf for 5 minutes and the PBS was removed by aspiration. Tubes containing cell pellets were optionally stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","Cell Lysis.","Tubes containing cell pellets were immersed in liquid nitrogen (LN2) for 60 seconds. The tubes were then removed from LN2 and immediately immersed in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath for 60 seconds or until thawed (3 minute maximum incubation time). This process was repeated two additional times.","Centrifugation and Lysate Harvest.","The freeze-thawed samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rcf at 4\u00b0 C. and placed on ice. The supernatant fluid from each tube was removed by pipette and transferred to a single sterile siliconized 1.5 ml tube. This process was repeated until no additional supernatant fluid could be recovered.","Fluid Volume Measurement.","To approximate supernatant fluid volume, the 1.5 ml tube containing recovered supernatant fluid was weighed on a balance previously tared with an empty 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube (1 milligram=\u02dc1 microliter).","Protein Assay.","To determine total protein content, 10 microliters of lysate supernatant fluid was diluted into 990 microliters PBS, and the dilution was analyzed by Bradford assay (standard range 1.25-25 micrograms). This value was used to calculate the total protein per cell, the main metric used to ensure the consistency of the process.","Lysate Lyophilization.","Multiple 1.5 milliliter sterile labeled cryovials were loaded into a sterile heat transfer block. Aliquots of lysate supernatant fluid at defined total protein concentration were loaded into the cryovials. The heat block containing uncapped cryovials was aseptically loaded into an autoclaved pouch with tube openings facing the paper side of the pouch. The pouch was sealed before removal from the laminar flow hood. The pouch was loaded into the lyophilizer.","Pre-cut materials (i.e., 90\/10 PGA\/PLA non-woven) were aseptically placed into the wells of 24- or 48-well sterile, ultra low cluster cell culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning N.Y.). Lysate supernatant fluid was delivered at a defined total protein concentration onto the material. For example, a material measuring 6 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness received 2 microliters of a 15 microgram\/microliter total protein solution to create a 30 microgram lysate protein material. The lid of the dish was replaced and secured with tape. The dish with materials was loaded into the lyophilizer","Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura-Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the following ramping program.

The amount of total protein\u201457.53+\/\u221238.69 picograms per cell\u2014correlates to the harvest density of the cells (R\u2014Sq (adj)=71.5%). The growth factor bFGF was present in six separate production lots of lyophilized UDC lysate averaging 3.09\u00b11.06 picograms per micrograms of total protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of umbilicus derived cell lysate showed that the banding pattern of protein was consistent between separate production lots, pre- and post-lyophilization, and following lyophilization onto a synthetic biomaterial. This method allows reproducible production of lyophilized material containing growth factors for application in tissue regeneration.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of human umbilicus cell-derived cell lysate when delivered in a scaffold to induce cellular infiltration and tissue formation. Since this is a xenogeneic source of cells, an early time-point was chosen to evaluate the inflammatory response the cell lysate might exhibit. Two types of scaffolds (VNW and 35\/65 PCL\/PGA foam) were tested to determine their potential to act as carriers for lysate delivery. As a nonlimiting example of the invention, the cellular components of human umbilicus-derived cells (UDCs), loaded on two different scaffold types, were tested to evaluate the cell infiltration and inflammatory response elicited in a subcutaneous rat implantation study. UDC cellular lysate and cellular supernatant were prepared by different methods. In two of the methods the cell membranes remained in the preparation. In one method, the cell membranes were removed. All treatments were lyophilized prior to implantation. This study included an n of 4 per treatment, except controls, which were matched on every animal (n=28).","Several trends surfaced upon analysis of the data. The amount of ingrowth into the foams was increased in the UDC supernatant and HF cell groups. The amount of ingrowth into the VNW differed the greatest in the UDC cells (caudal) as opposed to the VNW scaffold (caudal). The cranial sites demonstrated near 100% ingrowth for all VNW treatment groups. In the cranial sites of the UDC supernatant, there was increased cellularity of ingrowth (fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold) as compared to the VNW alone. There appears to be an increase in the amount of collagen deposition within the VNW scaffold for the UDC lysate group (caudal sites), the UDC supernatant, and HF groups (cranial sites).","As expected, the Growth medium control group did not increase cell ingrowth. The amount of ingrowth into the foam and VNW (caudal sites) was diminished.","Even though no statistical conclusions can be made from this study, the data obtained suggest that the UDC supernatant preparation has a positive impact on cellular infiltration. The UDC supernatant group demonstrated increases in cellularity of ingrowth and collagen deposition in the VNW scaffold.","Methods & Materials","General Methods.","Four (4) sub-cutaneous pockets (2 cranial; 2 caudal) were created on the dorsal region of 32 rats. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. The treatments (6 mm punches) were placed flat into the subcutaneous pocket. The implants were placed approximately 1 cm caudal to the incision. Metal wound clips were used to close the incision. Four animals were included in the study for only 3 days. These animals, implanted with VNW scaffolds only, were used to determine if there was an immediate immune reaction to the human cells in the rats. Tissues were harvested from the animals on days 3 and 14. The entire scaffold and surrounding skin was excised. The excised tissue was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological processing (paraffin sections) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold, the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold, the encapsulation of the scaffold, and the inflammatory response within the scaffold.","Treatment Groups.","The VNW was purchased from Biomedical Structures (Slatersville, R.I.). The scaffolds were placed in desiccant paper pillows that were then packaged in T-vent aluminum pouches and sterilized via ethylene oxide sterilization (nominal B cycle). The scaffolds were stored at room temperature prior to use. The following treatment groups were included in the study:","1. VNW and human umbilicus-derived cells (UDC)","2. 3% 35\/65 PCL\/PGA foam (Foam) and UDC","3. VNW and human fibroblasts (HF)","4. Foam and HF","5. VNW and UDC cell lysate","6. Foam and UDC cell lysate","7. VNW and HF cell lysate","8. Foam and HF cell lysate","9. VNW and UDC cell supernatant","10. Foam and UDC cell supernatant","11. VNW and HF cell supernatant","12. Foam and HF cell supernatant","13. VNW control","14. Foam control","15. VNW Growth medium control","16. Foam Growth medium control","Lot Numbers:\n\n","Test Article Preparation","Foam Preparation.","A 5% w\/w solution of 35\/65 epsilon-Caprolactone\/Glycolide molar composition of high purity grade (99+%) 1,4-Dioxane (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.) was prepared by dissolving five parts polymer to ninety-five parts of solvent at 60\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. The polymer solution was filtered through an extra coarse thimble prior to making the foam scaffolds. This polymer solution was diluted with dioxane to make a 3% w\/w solution. A pre-determined amount of polymer solution was poured into a pre-cooled aluminum mold and lyophilized to remove the solvent from the frozen structure by phase separation resulting in the interconnecting pore structure.","Scouring of VNW.","VNWs were scoured to remove residual processing oils. The material was scoured twice. The VNW was agitated in isopropanol (IPA) in the BRANSONIC Ultrasonic Cleaner (BUC) for at least 30 minutes. The IPA was drained, and the VNW was washed with deionized water three times. The VNW was then agitated in deionized water in the BUC for an additional 30 minutes. The VNW was dried under vacuum overnight or until dry to the touch.","Sample Preparation (Scaffold+Cellular Components).","Approximately 30 million cells from each cell type (UDC and HF) were trypsinized and washed with PBS three times. Conceptually, there are multiple ways in which a cell lysate could be prepared. Cells can be lysed by sonication, freeze thaw, or any number of other methods available to those skilled in the art. In this study, three different methods of preparing a cell lysate fraction were examined. For this example, the three preps will be referred to as \u201ccell,\u201d \u201clysate,\u201d and \u201csupernatant\u201d. A cell suspension of 1\u00d710\/ml was prepared and divided into three groups. The cell groups (UDC and HF) were created from the original suspension. 100 microliters was added to each scaffold. The cell-loaded scaffolds were placed in a shaker for 20 minutes to encourage incorporation of the cells into the scaffolds. The cell-loaded scaffolds were then lyophilized, in tissue culture plates, prior to implantation in the rat.","The lysate groups were prepared by freezing and thawing cells for three cycles (\u221280\u00b0 C. for 10 min\/37\u00b0 C.) and then 100 microliters was added to each scaffold. The lysate-loaded scaffolds were placed in a shaker for 20 minutes to encourage incorporation of the lysate into the scaffolds. The lysate loaded scaffolds were then lyophilized, in tissue culture plates, prior to implantation in the rat.","The supernatant groups were prepared by freezing and thawing cells for three cycles (\u221280\u00b0 C. for 10 min\/37\u00b0 C.) and then centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant was collected and 100 microliters was added to each scaffold. The supernatant-loaded scaffolds were placed in a shaker for 20 minutes to encourage incorporation of supernatant into the scaffolds. The supernatant-loaded scaffolds were then lyophilized, in tissue culture plates, prior to implantation in the rat.","The Growth medium control group was prepared by adding 100 microliters of Growth medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum) to each scaffold; these scaffolds were washed with PBS three times after the addition of growth medium. These scaffolds were then lyophilized, in tissue culture plates, prior to implantation in the rat.","The scaffold alone groups were prepared by adding 100 microliters of PBS to each scaffold. The scaffolds were then lyophilized, in tissue culture plates, prior to implantation in the rat.","Scaffold Characterization.","The 3% w\/w 35\/65 PCL\/PGA sample was analyzed for percent porosity and pore size distribution analysis using helium picnometry and mercury porosimetry, respectively (Quantochrome Instruments (Boynton Beach, Fla.)). The percent porosity was in the range of about 97 to 98 and the mean of bimodal pore size distribution was 55.5. This scaffold batch was made from a copolymer epsilon-caprolactone\/glycolide, which was analyzed for molar composition of epsilon-caprolactone and glycolide and residual monomers. 35 mole % and 63.3 mole % were determined for epsilon-caprolactone and glycolide, respectively, and 0.11 mole % of CAP and 0.58 mole % of GLY. The morphology of pores was analyzed by SEM method.","The VNW scaffold used in this study was 2.06 mm thick. The density, as determined by Biomechanical Structures, was 108.49 mg\/cc. The percent porosity was calculated to be 92.8%. The VNW was tested in triplicate for residual IPA and residual ethylene oxide (EtO). The samples all demonstrated less than 1 ppm residual IPA. The residual EtO levels in the VNW were 8, 9, and 10 ppm. The residual EtO in each sample was much less than the 250 ppm limit.","Surgical Preparation.","Each rat was anesthetized via Isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbrosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with Chlorhexidine diacetate, rinsed with alcohol, dried and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1% available iodine. The anesthetized and surgically prepared animal was placed in the desired recumbent position.","Surgical Approach.","Four skin incisions, each approximately 1.0 cm in length, were made on the dorsum of the rat. Two cranial sites were located transversely over the dorsal lateral thoracic region, about 2 cm caudal to the palpated inferior edge of the scapula, with one to the left and one to the right of the vertebral column. Another two were placed transversely over the gluteal muscle area at the caudal sacrolumbar level, about 1 cm caudal to the palpated iliac crest, with one on either side of the midline. The skin was separated from the underlying connective tissue to make a small pocket and the implant placed about 1 cm caudal to the incision. Six mm implants were placed in these sites according to the predetermined randomized implantation scheme. The skin incisions were closed with metal wound clips.","At the predetermined time points (3 and 14 days post-implant), the animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. The animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function.","Tissue Processing.","Immediately following euthanasia, each subcutaneous implantation site with the overlying skin was excised. The wound was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin by PAI Associates (Charles River Laboratories, West Chester, Ohio).","Histological Assessments.","Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold, the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold, the encapsulation of the scaffold, and inflammatory response within the scaffold.","Results","Day 3","Samples tested at day 3 included UDC lysate, UDC supernatant, HF, and VNW scaffold. All treatments were incorporated into the VNW scaffold. The purpose of a three day time-point was to determine if there was an immediate immune response to the implanted cellular components.","Observations at Necropsy","Vascularization.","At the time of necropsy, the ventral surface of each implant was evaluated for the amount of vascularization. A difference was observed at day 3 in the degree of vascularization and position of the wound. The cranial sites were more vascularized. No clinical evidence of immune response was noted at this timepoint.","Histological Assessments","Percent Ingrowth into the Scaffold:","As expected, at day 3, all treatment groups demonstrated very limited ingrowth with some presence of inflammatory cells. Three sites (1 UDC supernatant and 2 HF) demonstrated some fibrovascular ingrowth. Two sites (1 UDC lysate and 1 VNW) demonstrated relatively acellular implants at day 3 post-implantation.","Type of Infiltrate Noted in Scaffold:","The majority (3 of 4) sites of the UDC lysate, UDC supernatant and VNW scaffold demonstrated typical ingrowth (macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) as expected on day 3 post-implantation. One site each of UDC lysate and VNW scaffold had less than the normal amount of ingrowth at day 3. One UDC supernatant site demonstrated more fibrovascular ingrowth as compared to other sites. All of the four HF sites had several clumps of large irregular cells (dark granular eosinophilic cytoplasm; nuclei were quite variable in color). Two of the four HF sites also demonstrated more fibrovascular ingrowth.","Collagen Deposition:","As expected, there was no evidence of collagen deposition at any site at day 3 post-implantation.","Inflammatory Response within the Scaffold:","All day 3 sites demonstrated an inflammatory response of \u2018minimal.\u2019","Day 14","Histological Assessments","Percent Ingrowth into the Scaffold:","The treatments incorporated into the foam scaffold demonstrated a wide range of ingrowth. The average amount of ingrowth ranged from about 31% to 90%. In general, there was more ingrowth seen in the cranial sites.","The treatments incorporated into the VNW demonstrated a narrower range of ingrowth into the scaffold. The average amount of ingrowth ranged from about 69% to 100%. All cranial sites with VNW demonstrated the same or more ingrowth than the caudal sites.","Cellularity of Ingrowth (VNW Scaffolds Only):","This measurement examined the ingrowth of fibroblasts and capillaries in between the foreign body reaction zones, more specifically around the fibrils of the VNW scaffold.

Two types of scaffolds (VNW and 35\/65 PCL\/PGA foam) were tested to determine their potential to act as carriers for lysate delivery. Both scaffolds elicited a minimal to slight inflammatory reaction.","A limited number of samples were tested at day 3 (UDC lysate, UDC supernatant, HF and scaffold alone) for potential immune\/inflammatory response. This was done because of the xenogeneic nature of the cell source. All treatments evaluated at three days were incorporated into the VNW scaffold. It had been proposed that the UDC cells are immunoprivileged but to this point they had never been implanted into a non-immunocompromised animal. No immunological responses were noted; very limited inflammatory cellular infiltrates (mainly macrophages, some residual neutrophils and rare lymphocytes) were seen at this time-point. These observations are typical after a three-day implantation period. Any inflammatory response that was seen was scored as \u2018minimal\u2019 at day three.","This study was designed so that each animal had a control of each scaffold type and one treatment group of each scaffold type. This was done because in a previous experiment, a difference was seen between the cranial and caudal implantation sites. Differences were also seen in this study at the cranial versus caudal sites. Although this study cannot be analyzed statistically due to the low n number, there were several positive findings of interest. The amount of ingrowth into the foams was increased in the UDC supernatant and HF cell groups. Additionally, the amount of ingrowth into the VNW differed the greatest in the UDC cells (caudal) as opposed to the VNW scaffold (caudal). The cranial sites demonstrated near 100% ingrowth for all VNW treatment groups. In the cranial sites of the UDC supernatant, there was increased cellularity of ingrowth (fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold) as compared to the VNW alone. There appeared to be an increase in the amount of collagen deposition within the VNW scaffold for the UDC lysate group (caudal sites), the UDC supernatant and HF groups (cranial sites).","As expected, the Growth medium control group (negative control) appeared to impact the scaffolds in a negative way. The amount of ingrowth into the foam and VNW (caudal sites) was diminished. The caudal VNW sites demonstrated no collagen deposition for the Growth medium controls.","Of particular note in this study was the effect of position on tissue ingrowth in this model. Scaffolds which were located in the cranial position, in general, had significantly more tissue ingrowth than those scaffolds located in the caudal position. The sites which were located in the caudal position could be thought of as a \u201cdelayed tissue ingrowth\u201d model since at 14 days post-implantation there was a subjective grade of 1 on a scale of 1-3 with the cranial sites equal to 2 or greater. When testing multiple methods of preparing the lysate, all caudal sites treated with three different UDC lysates showed more tissue ingrowth and collagen deposition when compared to three identical methods used to prepare lysate from Human Fibroblasts.","Even though no statistical conclusions can be made from this study, the data obtained suggest that the UDC supernatant preparation has a positive impact on cellular infiltration. The UDC supernatant group demonstrated increases in cellularity of ingrowth and collagen deposition in the VNW scaffold.","The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition in response to scaffolds treated with cell lysate would provide statistical significance when repeated with a larger number of animals per treatment group.","The cellular components of human umbilicus-derived cells (UDC), human dermal fibroblasts, and Growth medium were loaded on scaffold and were tested to evaluate the cell infiltration and inflammatory response elicited in a subcutaneous rat implantation study. These were compared to the scaffold alone. All treatments were lyophilized prior to implantation.","No immunological responses were noted in this study. The amount of inflammatory response for all groups ranged from minimal to slight.","The amount of ingrowth into the VNW was very similar across the treatment groups, both in the cranial and caudal positions. The UDC Supernatant demonstrated significantly increased cellularity of ingrowth (fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold) as compared to the GM Control and the VNW alone. The UDC Supernatant demonstrated greater cellularity of ingrowth at both the cranial and caudal sites compared to all other treatments. Collagen deposition was statistically greater for the cranial sites compared to GM Control and Scaffold Control. Additionally, the caudal sites demonstrated statistically greater collagen deposition than the Scaffold Control.","In conclusion, two subcutaneous rat studies have been completed to assess tissue ingrowth and inflammatory reaction to scaffolds treated with cell lysates from UDC or HF. In both studies, there was increased tissue ingrowth and extracellular matrix deposition in scaffolds treated with lysate according to qualitative histopathology assessment. In addition, this positive tissue response may be considered to be of \u201cgreater quality\u201d (based generally on both cellular infiltration and inflammatory response) due to the decreased inflammatory response to UDC as compared to HF.","Methods & Materials","Experimental Design.","Four (4) subcutaneous pockets (2 cranial; 2 caudal) were created on the dorsal region of 32 rats. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. The treatments (6 mm punches) were placed flat into the subcutaneous pocket. The implants were placed approximately 1 cm caudal to the incision. Metal wound clips were used to close the incision. Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 14. The entire scaffold and surrounding skin was excised. The excised tissue was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological processing (paraffin sections) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold, the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold, the encapsulation of the scaffold, and inflammatory response within the scaffold.","Treatment Groups.","The VNW was purchased from Biomedical Structures (Slatersville, R.I.). The scaffolds were placed in desiccant paper pillows that were then packaged in T-vent aluminum pouches and sterilized via EtO sterilization (nominal B cycle). The scaffolds were stored at room temperature prior to use. The following treatment groups were included in the study:","1. Human Umbilicus-derived Cell Lysate (UDC Supernatant)","2. Human Skin Fibroblast Cell Lysate (HF Supernatant)","3. Growth medium Control (GM Control)","4. VNW Scaffold Control","All treatments were lyophilized onto VNW scaffolds.","Lot Numbers:\n\n","Test Article Preparation","Scouring of VNW.","VNWs were scoured to remove residual processing oils. The material was scoured twice. The VNW was agitated in isopropanol (IPA) in the BRANSON ULTRASONIC CLEANER (BUC) for at least 30 minutes. The IPA was drained, and the VNW was washed with deionized water three times. The VNW was then agitated in deionized water in the BUC for an additional 30 minutes. The VNW was dried under vacuum overnight or until dry to the touch.","Preparation of Cell Lysate.","Human umbilicus-derived cells (UDCs) and human skin fibroblasts (HF) at passage 11 were seeded into gelatin-coated T225 flasks. Flasks were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin\/EDTA for 5 minutes until the cells began lifting from the dish. The trypsinization process was inactivated using 15% serum containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's growth media at a ratio of 4 milliliters trypsin to 4 milliliters Growth media. Twelve million cells were obtained for both UDCs and HFs. Cells were pelleted in Growth media, combined into one pellet and then resuspended in a total volume of 20 milliliters of PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS to remove residual FBS from the Growth media. This was done by centrifuging the cells for 5 minutes at 1.5 RPM and then resuspending the cells in 20 ml of PBS until the three washes were complete.","The lysates were prepared by repeated freeze\/thaw cycles. The cell pellets (UDC and HF) were resuspended in 425 microliters of PBS. To freeze the cells, the tubes were placed in a slurry of dry ice and isopropanol for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the tubes were placed in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath for 10 minutes. This procedure was repeated for a total of three cycles of freezing and thawing.","The cell suspensions were transferred to sterile siliconized microcentrifuge tubes, to prevent protein adsorption, and centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to separate the cell membranes from the cytosolic components. After removal of the cell membranes, the supernatant was gently mixed by tapping the centrifuge tube to ensure uniformity. The supernatant was transferred to new siliconized tubes and placed on ice. Approximately 425 microliters of UDC supernatant was collected. To ensure that there was enough UDC supernatant to be loaded onto the scaffolds 50 microliters of PBS was added to make a final volume of 475 microliters.","Preparation of the Treatment Groups","UDC Supernatant and HF Supernatant.","Sterile VNW scaffolds (6 mm punches) were aseptically transferred to sterile multi-well plates. 25 microliters of cell lysate supernatant (UDC or HF) were placed on the VNW; the drop of cell lysate sank into the scaffold. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.","GM Control.","Sterile VNW scaffolds (6 mm punches) were aseptically transferred to sterile multi-well plates. 30 microliters of Hayflick media was placed in the same manner onto each of the scaffolds as described above. The scaffolds were washed three times in PBS to remove residual media. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.","VNW Control.","Sterile VNW scaffolds (6 mm punches) were aseptically transferred to sterile multi-well plates. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.","The treatments were lyophilized using a 48-hour lyophilization cycle. After the lyophilization was complete, the dishes were wrapped in parafilm and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until the day of surgery. On the day of surgery, the treatments were removed from the freezer and placed into a foil-covered ice bucket to prevent proteolytic activity.","Treatment Characterization","VNW Scaffold.","VNW scaffold (Lot 355-73-1) was purchased from Biomedical Structures (Slatersville, R.I.). The VNW scaffold used in this study was 2.06 mm thick. The density, as determined by Biomedical Structures, was 108.49 mg\/cc. The percent porosity was calculated to be 92.8%. The sample demonstrated less than 1 ppm residual IPA. Residual ethylene oxide (EtO) levels were tested four times. The residual EtO levels in the VNW were 130, 132, 133 and 137 ppm. The residual EtO in the sample was much less than the 250 ppm limit.","Cell Lysate (UDC and HF).","Prior to use of the cells, preliminary pathogen testing was conducted. The cells were tested for HIV1, HIV2, HCV, HTLV, HBV and EBV. Detection of virus DNA and RNA was done via PCR. The cells tested negative for all viruses.","Implantation Scheme","This study was conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Ethicon Research & Development, Somerville, N.J.","The scaffolds were placed in desiccant paper pillows that were then packaged in T-vent aluminum pouches and sterilized via EtO sterilization (nominal B cycle). The scaffolds were stored at room temperature prior to use. The cell isolates were co-lyophilized with the scaffolds in an aseptic manner.","Each rat was anesthetized via Isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbrosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with Chlorhexidine diacetate, rinsed with alcohol, dried and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1% available iodine. The anesthetized and surgically prepared animal was placed in the desired recumbent position.","Four skin incisions, each approximately 1.0 cm in length, were made on the dorsum of the rat. Two cranial sites were located transversely over the dorsal lateral thoracic region, about 2 cm caudal to the palpated inferior edge of the scapula, with one to the left and one to the right of the vertebral column. Another two were placed transversely over the gluteal muscle area at the caudal sacrolumbar level, about 1 cm caudal to the palpated iliac crest, with one on either side of the midline. The skin was separated from the underlying connective tissue to make a small pocket and the implant placed about 1 cm caudal to the incision. Six mm implants were placed in these sites according to the predetermined randomized implantation scheme. The skin incisions were closed with metal wound clips.","Analysis","At the predetermined time point (14 days post-implant), the animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. Immediately following euthanasia, each subcutaneous implantation site with its overlying skin was excised. The wound was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin.","Histological Assessment.","Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold, the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold, the encapsulation of the scaffold, and inflammatory response within the scaffold.","Statistical Analysis.","Treatments were assigned so that the UDC Supernatant, HF Supernatant and GM Control were equally distributed over the cranial and caudal wounds. The Scaffold Control was paired to each cranial or caudal wound. Shapiro-Wilk-W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi-Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One-way ANOVA. The Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One-way ANOVA. A value of p<0.05 was used as the level of significance.","Results","Histological Assessments","Percent Ingrowth into the Scaffold.","There was no statistical difference between the treatments for the amount of in-growth into the scaffold. All treatments ranged from 92.64 to 97.94% ingrowth. The cranial sites demonstrated numerically superior amount of ingrowth than the caudal sites although the difference is not significant.

The swine model has utility because of similarity of the cutaneous architecture to that of human skin. The rat model is most often used to assess biocompatibility and tissue ingrowth. Therefore these models are the preferred models used to screen prototype devices. Based on the tissue reaction, tissue infiltration, extracellular matrix deposition, and the inflammatory response in these acute models, the efficacy of a device for chronic wound healing is inferred.","This was a randomized study to evaluate the ability of human umbilicus-derived cell lysate to stimulate cell invasion in a rat subcutaneous implantation model. Comparators in this study were human skin fibroblast-derived cell lysate, growth medium control, and scaffold control. We chose to only evaluate the VNW scaffold in this study because this scaffold is more readily infiltrated in the rat subcutaneous model than the foam. This study was designed so that each animal had a VNW control both cranially and caudally; in addition it was ensured that the other treatments were randomized equally across the cranial and caudal positions to minimize a potential difference in tissue response due to the anatomical position. This was done because in a previous experiment, a difference was seen between the cranial and caudal implantation sites. Differences were observed in this study at the cranial versus caudal sites. One possible explanation for the differences between the implantation sites is that the cranial sites are more vascularized due to the anatomical position than the caudal sites.","No immunological responses were noted in this study. The amount of inflammatory response for all groups ranged from minimal to slight. The types of cells seen were predominantly PMNs (polymorphonuclear neutrophils) and mononuclear cells. The HF Supernatant group had the most notations of inflammatory cells in association with the scaffold. Six of 14 sites had notations of PMNs and mononuclear cells within the scaffold; three additional sites had notations of PMNs alone within the scaffold. Of these nine sites, four were cranial and five were caudal sites. The GM Control group and the UDC Supernatant group had notations of inflammatory cells in 5 and 4 sites, respectively.","When comparing the overall quality of tissue which has grown into the scaffolds, several conclusions could be drawn. In 10\/14 UDC-treated sites there were significantly more \u201chigher quality\u201d tissue (e.g., having extracellular matrix and cellular components including fibroblasts and endothelial cells) when compared to the untreated scaffold within the same animal. In 9\/14 HF-treated sites there were significantly more \u201chigher quality\u201d tissue when compared to the untreated scaffold within the same animal. Importantly, when comparing the amount of inflammatory cell infiltration between the groups, it was noted that UDC-treated scaffolds exhibited only a slightly increased inflammatory response in 6\/14 sites compared to 5\/14 growth media controls. When comparing this result to the HF-treated scaffold, 9\/14 sites exhibited an increased inflammatory response. This demonstrates that inflammatory response of UDC-treated scaffold was similar to GM control scaffold, while the HF-treated groups exhibited increased inflammation.","An important consideration when examining the inflammatory response to these lysates is that this study is an example of xenogeneic transplantation with human cells being transplanted into a rodent model. It is expected that a degree of inflammation would be present as the host animal \u201creacts\u201d to the introduction of human cells. Interestingly, the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response.","The amount of ingrowth into the VNW was very similar across the treatment groups, both in the cranial and caudal positions. The UDC Supernatant demonstrated significantly increased cellularity of ingrowth (fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold) as compared to the GM Control and the VNW alone. Collagen deposition was statistically greater for the cranial sites compared to GM Control and Scaffold Control. Additionally, the caudal sites demonstrated statistically greater collagen deposition than the Scaffold Control.","The GM Control demonstrated reduced amounts of cellularity of ingrowth and greater collagen deposition than the Scaffold Control.","In conclusion, two subcutaneous rat studies have been completed to assess tissue ingrowth and inflammatory reaction to scaffolds treated with cell lysates from UDC or HF. In both studies there was increased tissue ingrowth and extracellular matrix deposition in scaffolds treated with lysate. In addition, this positive tissue response may be considered to be of \u201cgreater quality\u201d due to the decreased inflammatory response to UDCs compared to HFs.","UDCs produce various growth factors involved in tissue regeneration, including basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). The supernatant of lysed UDCs also has been demonstrated to contain these growth factors. The application of the lysate to biomaterials followed by lyophilization produces a device that, upon clinical application, will deliver the growth factors to the defect site and enhance tissue regeneration.","The present study evaluated the ability of UDC lysate, lyophilized onto a material, to increase mouse NIH\/3T3 fibroblast proliferation when co-cultured in a transwell system. Collagen\/oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) containing lyophilized UDC lysate was placed in the upper portion of a transwell system and co-cultured with mouse NIH\/3T3 fibroblasts plated at low density in the lower portion of the system. After three days the cells were harvested and counted. The transwells containing materials were transferred to new transwell systems and again co-cultured with mouse NIH\/3T3 fibroblasts plated at low density in the lower portion of the system. After an additional three days (six days total material time in culture), the cells were harvested and counted. This second culture timepoint was performed to assess the release kinetics of the UDC lysate from the biomaterial.","After three days, a near significant (t-test, p=0.06) increase in proliferation was noted in mouse NIH\/3T3 fibroblasts co-cultured with collagen\/ORC containing UDC lysate versus collagen\/ORC alone. After the transwells containing materials were transferred to new systems and co-cultured for an additional three days (six days total material time in culture), a near significant (t-test, p=0.09) increase in proliferation was again noted in mouse NIH\/3T3 fibroblasts co-cultured with collagen\/ORC containing UDC lysate versus collagen\/ORC alone.","These results demonstrate the ability of growth factors from lyophilized UDC lysate to be released from a material and exhibit biological efficacy. The ability of the materials to exhibit biological efficacy after transfer to new transwell systems demonstrated that growth factors of lyophilized UDC lysate were released over time.","Methods & Materials","Cell Lysate Preparation.","UDC lysate supernatant was prepared as set forth in Example 17.","Lysate Application and Lyophilization.","Collagen\/ORC pre-cut to 1.5\u00d71.5 cmin size were aseptically placed into the wells of 12 well sterile, ultra low cluster cell culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning N.Y.). The supernatant fluid was applied to the material as five 30 microgram aliquots. An aliquot was placed at each corner of the 1.5\u00d71.5 cmmaterial approximately 1 mm from the material edge and one aliquot was placed in the center of the material. The dish with materials was loaded into the lyophilizer.","Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura-Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program set forth in Example 17.

This study was designed to determine the cellular infiltration of full-thickness excisional defects in the presence of scaffolds that have been lyophilized with an active agent.","As demonstrated in the data obtained from quantitative histomorphometry, a statistically significant increase in granulation tissue area, average granulation tissue height, and greatest granulation tissue height when compared to all other treatment groups. However, the overall grade of the quality of the granulation tissue was poor.

This increased inflammatory cell presence may be attributed to the timepoint for analysis (7 day study) or the cell concentration in this model. When the groups were ranked to exclude one pig because of cell concentration differences, the cell lysate alone group showed an inflammatory cell presence similar to that of untreated controls with positive effects seen for epithelial tongue length, cell infiltration, greatest granulation tissue height, and average granulation tissue height.","The data generated from the two subcutaneous rat studies and this swine full thickness excisional wound model indicate that treatment of wounds\/scaffolds with cell lysate has a stimulatory effect on tissue ingrowth.","Methods & Materials","Experimental Design.","Twelve (12) full-thickness excisions (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were created on the dorsal region of four swine. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. Each animal had an equal distribution of the treatment groups. The treatment squares (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were trimmed to fit the wound, if needed, and covered with 2\u00d72 cm NU-GEL (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Arlington, Tex.).

The VNW was agitated in IPA in the BRANSONIC ULTRASONIC CLEANER (BUC) for at least 30 minutes. The IPA was drained and the VNW was washed with deionized water three times. The VNW was then agitated in deionized water in the BUC for an additional 30 minutes. The VNW was dried under vacuum overnight or until dry to the touch.","Preparation of Cell Lysate.","Approximately 25 million human umbilicus-derived cells (UDCs) at passage 11 were seeded into gelatin-coated T225 flasks. Because of the number of cells that were necessary to complete the study, the flasks were split, for trypsinization, into two sets which were combined to prepare the cell lysate. The cells ranged from approximately 70-95% confluent. Flasks were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin\/EDTA for 5 minutes until the cells began lifting from the dish. The trypsinization process was inactivated using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Growth media containing 15% serum. A total of 34 million cells were obtained from the first batch and approximately 58 million cells were obtained from the second batch; the total yield was approximately 92 million cells. Cells were pelleted in Growth media, combined into one pellet, and then resuspended in a total volume of 40 milliliters of PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS to remove residual FBS from the growth media. This was done by centrifuging the cells for 5 minutes at 1.5 RPM and then resuspending the cells in 40 milliliters of PBS until the three washes were complete.","In order to facilitate the freeze-thaw procedure, the cells were equally divided into two tubes with 9.2 ml of PBS for the freeze\/thaw procedure. The lysates were prepared by repeated freeze\/thaw cycles. To freeze the cells, the tubes were placed in a slurry of dry ice and isopropanol for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the tubes were placed in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath for 10 minutes. After two cycles, the cycle time was lengthened to 20 minutes to ensure that complete thawing\/freezing of the samples had occurred.","The cell suspensions were transferred to ten sterile siliconized microcentrifuge tubes, to prevent protein adsorption, and centrifuged at 13,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to separate the cell membranes from the cytosolic components. The tubes (cell pellet) were then placed on ice and the supernatant was very gently mixed by tapping the centrifuge tube to ensure uniformity. The supernatant was transferred to new siliconized tubes and placed on ice.","Preparation of the Treatment Groups.","Cell Lysate:","Cell lysate supernatant was pipetted into a sterile 96-well deep well dish (conical bottom). Wells were marked to indicate presence of lysate. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. At the time of surgery, the lysate from 5 million cells was reconstituted with 550 microliters of PBS. Approximately 250 microliters was applied to each of the wounds on pig one. The approximate cell lysate concentration added to the wounds on pig 1 was 2.5 million cells\/wound. Upon treatment of pig 1, it was apparent that much of the volume of the reconstituted cell lysate did not remain in the wound bed. Therefore, less volume of cell lysate was used to treat pigs 2-4.

After approximately 10 minutes, VNW had absorbed the drop contents. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.","VNW: Sterile VNW scaffolds (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were aseptically transferred to sterile multi-well plates.

A body stockinette (SPANDAGE; Medi-Tech International Corporation, Brooklyn, N.Y.) was used to hold the dressings in place. Digital images of each wound were taken at days 0, 4 and 7 post-wounding. A bandage change was done on day 4 of the study. Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 7. The entire wound and surrounding normal skin was excised. The cranial half of the excised tissue was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological processing (paraffin sections) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome (MPI Research, Mattawan, Mich.). The caudal portion of each sample was retained for possible future analysis. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold, overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue, quality of ingrowth, and inflammatory response. Measurements of granulation tissue area and epithelial tongue length were also made.","VNW scaffold was purchased from Biomedical Structures (Slaterville, R.I.). All VNW was obtained from lot 3551-73-2. The samples were foil-wrapped and sterilized via ethylene oxide sterilization and stored at room temperature prior to use. The cell lysate was obtained from cell lot CBAT 050604B.","Each pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of Telazol (4 mg\/kg), Xylazine (4 mg\/kg), and Glycopyrrolate (0.011 mg\/kg). The animal was maintained on Isoflurane via nosecone. Each pig was given a pre-operation dose of Buprenorphine (0.02 mg\/kg, IM) at the time of surgical preparation.","The animals were prepared for surgery under general anesthesia. Hair was removed from the back, shoulder, side, and flank regions. An antiseptic skin cleanser was applied.","Full-thickness excisional wounds (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were created along the dorsal paravertebral and flank areas with a scalpel. Twelve wounds were made on each animal; six per side. Each wound was submitted to a treatment regime. The scaffolds were placed into the wound bed \u2018dry\u2019 and then a few drops of sterile saline were added to the scaffold. Excised tissue measurements were recorded.","The test materials were undisturbed for the length of the study. The wounds were covered with a 2\u00d72 cm square of NU-GEL. The wounds were dressed with BIOCLUSIVE to keep the wounds moist and to keep the test articles and NU-GEL in place. Strips of polyurethane foam (RESTON) were placed between the wounds to avoid cross-contamination due to wound fluid leakage. The animals were dressed with 4\u00d74 inch squares of RAY-TEK and SPANDAGE to help keep dressings in place and the animal's back clean.","The secondary and tertiary bandages were changed on day 4 of the study. Dressing condition was evaluated daily to determine if additional bandage changes were necessary due to strikethrough, displacement, etc.","Clinical observations were performed at the end of the study under anesthesia, just prior to euthanasia. Assessments included dressing conditions (air exposure, displacement) and wound bed conditions (inflammation, re-injury, infection and wound level). At the predetermined time point (7 days post-wounding), the animals were euthanized under anesthesia with an intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium euthanasia solution (Euthasol\u00ae, Diamond Animal Health, Inc. Des Moines, Iowa, at 1 ml\/10 lbs body weight) via the marginal ear vein. Following administration of the drug, the animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function. A stethoscope facilitated this process. The femoral artery was severed to insure euthanasia.","Tissue Processing","Immediately following euthanasia, each wound along with the underlying fat and margin of surrounding skin was excised. The wound was bisected into cranial and caudal halves. The cranial half of the wound was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome.","Histological Assessments:","A computer-controlled motorized programmable slide scanning system was used in the process of image acquisition. Separate images of high magnification fields were acquired from a microscope. The images were tiled to preserve the integrity of the entire histological specimen. This allows accurate measurement of the entire tissue sample.","Images from the light microscope were captured into the computer memory via CCD camera and frame grabber board and subsequently analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software. Capturing the image of the slide and applying the calibration feature of the imaging software at 2\u00d7 magnification performed spatial calibration.","Histological evaluations for granulation tissue (area and length) and epithelialization were assessed using trichrome stained specimens using a magnification of 20-40\u00d7. Average granulation tissue height was determined by dividing the area by the length.","Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold, overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue, quality of in-growth, and inflammatory response.","Statistical Analysis:","Treatments were assigned using a Latin Square design. This was to ensure that each treatment would be assigned equally at each wound site and avoid any bias to wound position on the animal. Visual assessments were analyzed using JMP 4.0.4 software (SAS Institute Incorporated, Cary, N.C.). Shapiro-Wilk-W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi-Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One-way ANOVA. Tukey-Kramer or Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One-way ANOVA. A value of p<0.05 was used as the level of significance. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine if there were differences due to animal effects. Contrast tests with Bonferroni adjustment was used when determining significance with a two-way ANOVA.","Results","Surgery and anesthetic recovery were uneventful. All animals tolerated bandaging well. None of the surgically created wounds were healed by the day 7.","At the time of surgery, each wound was measured with a caliper to determine thickness. There were no differences between the groups for excised tissue thickness. The average excised tissue thickness ranged from 1.84 mm to 1.97 mm.","Histological Assessments","Granulation Tissue Area.","Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated a statistically significant greater amount of granulation tissue area than all other treatments (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA determined that animal 1 was statistically different than animals 2 and 3 (p<0.008, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). There were no animal\/treatment interactions determined among the groups with the Two-way ANOVA. The Cell Lysate\/VNW group averaged 36.72 mmof granulation tissue area. The other groups averaged from 15.27 mmto 22.56 mmof granulation tissue area.","Granulation Tissue Length.","Cell Lysate\/VNW and VNW demonstrated statistically significant longer granulation tissue length than Cell Lysate and Untreated (p<0.05, ANOVA followed with Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA did not determine any differences between the animals.","Granulation Tissue Height.","Two measurements of granulation tissue height were obtained, average height and greatest height. Average height is calculated by dividing the granulation tissue area by the granulation tissue length. These parameters consider the entire depth of the wound, not just what is visible above the native epidermis. Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater average granulation tissue height than VNW and Untreated (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA determined that animal 2 was statistically different than animals 1 and 4 (p<0.008, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). Taking into account the animal difference, Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater average granulation tissue height than all other treatments (p<0.003, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). The Cell Lysate\/VNW group averaged 2.45 mm for average granulation tissue height; all other treatments averaged 1.28 mm to 1.69 mm.","Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater granulation tissue height than Untreated (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA determined that animal 1 was statistically different than animal 3 and animal 2 was statistically different than animals 1 and 4 (p<0.008, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). With the animal differences, Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater granulation tissue height than VNW and Untreated (p<0.003, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). The Cell Lysate\/VNW group averaged 2.76 mm for greatest granulation tissue height; all other treatments averaged 1.65 mm to 2.10 mm.","Epithelial Tongue Length.","Untreated demonstrated statistically significant longer epithelial tongue length than Cell Lysate\/VNW (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA determined that animal 1 was statistically different than animals 3 and 4 and that animal 2 was statistically different than animal 3 (p<0.008, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). Taking into account the animal differences, Untreated demonstrated statistically significant longer epithelial tongue length than Cell Lysate\/VNW (p<0.003, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). Additionally, Cell Lysate demonstrated statically significant longer epithelial tongue length than Cell Lysate\/VNW (p<0.003, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment).","Area of Implant.","Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated in this parameter. Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater implant area than VNW (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA did not determine any differences between the animals. Cell Lysate\/VNW averaged 23.0 mmfor area of implant; the other treatments averaged 15.96 mmto 17.25 mm.","Percent Length of Wound with Exposed Scaffold.","This parameter takes into account the length of scaffold that was above the granulation tissue and epithelial tongues. This scaffold is considered exposed and will most likely be extruded from the wound. Cell Lysate\/VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater amount of exposed scaffold at the surface of the wound bed than VNW (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA did not determine any differences between the animals. Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated for this parameter.","Histopathological Assessments","Scaffold\/Tissue Interaction at the End of the Scaffold.","At each end of the scaffold, the interaction between the scaffold and the tissue was graded as follows: 1: VNW fibers were totally embedded with neo-dermis with sufficient re-epithelialization to cover the end of the scaffold; 2: Re-epithelialization had occurred over the surface of the tissue at the wound edge, but VNW fibers were embedded into the epithelial tongue; 3: Re-epithelialization was not occurring in an orderly manner at the wound edge because the epidermal cells were either within the VNW fibers or were undermining the scaffold's edge. Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated for this parameter. Due to the compact scale of this parameter, the data cannot be analyzed as continuous data and therefore Two-way ANOVA cannot be performed. The average scores for this parameter ranged from 1.56 to 2.50.","Conformation of Granulation Overgrowth of the Main Portion of Scaffold.","This parameter was scored as follows: 1: The overgrowth was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm thick with relative uniformity and complete coverage; 2: Either there was variable depth of the overgrowth or relatively uniform depth of less than 0.5 mm, but complete coverage nonetheless; 3: Any conformation of the overgrowth, but with one or more areas of lack of overgrowth totaling less than 10% of the surface area; 4: As grade 3 but with lack of overgrowth totaling approximately 10-50% of surface area; 5: As grade 4 but with lack of overgrowth totaling approximately 50-100% of the surface area; 6: There was complete lack of overgrowth of the scaffold by granulation tissue and there was exudate within the outer portion of the scaffold.","Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated for this parameter. VNW demonstrated statistically significant better grades than Cell Lysate\/VNW for conformation of granulation over-growth (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA demonstrated that animal 1 was statistically different from all other animals (p<0.008, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). Although there were differences in the animal response no additional animal\/treatment interactions were determined.","Inflammation within Overgrowth Tissue (or in Granulation Tissue Bed for Sites without Scaffolds).","This parameter was a subjective ranking of slides. The scores are: 1: The least amount in this group of slides; 2: In the mid-range for this group of slides; 3: The highest amount for this group of slides. Half grades were assigned to sites that fell in between two grades. Untreated demonstrated statistically significant less inflammation within the granulation tissue than Cell Lysate\/VNW (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA did not determine any differences between the animals.","Overall Inflammation Associated with the Scaffold Fibers.","This parameter was a subjective ranking of slides. The scores are: 1: The least amount in this group of slides; 2: In the mid-range for this group of slides; 3: The highest amount for this group of slides. Half grades were assigned to sites that fell in between two grades. Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated for this parameter. VNW demonstrated statistically significant lower ranks for inflammation associated with scaffold fibers than Cell Lysate\/VNW (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer). Two-way ANOVA demonstrated that animal 1 was statistically different from all other animals and animal 3 differed from animals 2 and 4 (p<0.008, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment). Considering the difference in animal response, VNW demonstrated statistically significant lower mounts of inflammation associated with the scaffold fibers than Cell Lysate\/VNW (p<0.003, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni Adjustment).","Qualitative Histologic Assessments (Overall Assessment).","Histopathological evaluation was determined by evaluating the following parameters: sloughing of the scaffold, overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue, inflammation within the overgrowth tissue, presence of exudate and inflammation within the scaffold.

The swine model has utility because of similarity of the cutaneous architecture to that of human skin. The rat model is most often used to assess biocompatibility and tissue ingrowth. Therefore, these models are the preferred method used to screen prototype devices for the skin tissue engineering program. Based on the tissue reaction, tissue infiltration, extracellular matrix deposition, and inflammatory response in these models, the efficacy of a device for wound healing is inferred.","The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular infiltration and inflammatory response of VNW scaffolds lyophilized with active agents. Human umbilicus cell-derived (UDC) cell lysate was the active agents tested in the porcine full-thickness excisional model.","An important consideration when examining the inflammatory response to these lysates is that this study is an example of xenogeneic transplantation with human cells being transplanted into a swine model. It is expected that a degree of inflammation would be present as the host animal \u201creacts\u201d to the introduction of human cells. Interestingly, the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response in previous studies in rodent models (Examples 18 and 19). In both of the rodent studies, no increase in inflammatory response was noted.","As demonstrated in the data obtained from quantitative histomorphometry, there was a statistically significant increase in granulation tissue area, average granulation tissue height and greatest granulation tissue height when compared to all other treatment groups. However, the overall grade of the quality of the granulation tissue was poor. This assessment was based on the increased inflammatory cell presence in the large volume of tissue which had filled the scaffolds. Several important factors need to be considered when interpreting this data. It has been demonstrated in previous rat sub-cutaneous implant studies (Example 18 and 19) that cell lysate showed increased cell infiltration and greater extracellular matrix deposition at 14 days post-implantation. The swine model was evaluated at 7 days post wounding. It is postulated that in the swine model, by 14 days, the observed increase in inflammatory cell presence may resolve. This may be reasonable to infer since it is known that in acute wound healing, the normal inflammatory process usually resolves within 10 days post wounding. In fact, the presence of inflammatory cells at day 7 may provide enhanced healing response in a chronic wound based on its ability to provide an acute inflammatory stimulus in addition to the added benefit of the growth factors and MMP inhibitors present in the lysate mixture. This strategy of adding an acute inflammatory stimulus has been used with success in recent years, in several clinical studies (Zuloff-Shani et al., 2004; 30(2):163-7; Danon et al., 1997; 32(6):633-41; Danon et al., 1998; 7(6):281-3; Frenkel et al., 2002; 128(1):59-66) which have demonstrated the utility of adding exogenous macrophage suspensions to help stimulate nonhealing wounds.","The cell concentration used in the cell lysate\/VNW treatment group was equal to 4 million cells per scaffold. This concentration was equal to the dose\/areathat was seen have to beneficial effects in the rat subcutaneous model. A cell lysate alone group was included in this study to determine the interaction of the scaffold with the \u201cactive agents.\u201d At the time of surgery, the cell lysates were reconstituted for application to the wound bed. The intent of this study was to examine the same concentration of cell lysate which was incorporated into the lysate\/VNW group to the cell lysate alone group. At the time of surgery, however, it was determined that the volume of cell lysate to be administered to the wound bed was too great to maintain the treatment in place (the volume of a 1.5\u00d71.5 cm full thickness excisional wound was determined to be approximately 100 microliters due to the depth of the wound and the contour of the pig). Therefore, the first pig was treated with approximately 2.5 million cells in 250 microliters. This was reduced further for pigs 2-4 when it was determined that this volume was also in excess of what was thought to reproducibly remain in the wound bed. The number of cells used in pigs 2-4 was approximately 0.5-1 million cells. When pig number 1 (cell concentration of 2.5 million cells) is excluded from the data, the ranking for scaffold performance demonstrates that the cell lysate alone group performed the best out of all groups (5 rel good, 1 ave) followed closely by untreated control wounds (3 good, 2 ave, 1 rel poor compared to VNW scaffold alone pigs 2-4 (3 rel poor, 3 ave). This data would seem to indicate that, in the swine full thickness wound model, a lower cell lysate concentration may have a beneficial effect if the dose was optimized for the pigs. Another important aspect to consider with regard to the cell lysate alone group is the positive effect that was noted for epithelial tongue length. In addition, the cell lysate group was also similar to untreated controls with regard to inflammation, apoptosis, and overall grade. This group demonstrated numerically superior epithelial outgrowth and showed similar tongue length to the untreated control. It may be assumed that the increased cell infiltration seen in this group, coupled with the positive epithelial tongue data, may have utility in chronic wound healing.","The data generated from the two subcutaneous rat studies and this swine full thickness excisional wound model indicate that treatment of wounds\/scaffolds with cell lysate has a stimulatory effect on tissue ingrowth.","Previous data generated in a swine model testing UDC lysate at day 7 post wounding (Example 21) demonstrated a significant increase in granulation tissue formation with a slight increase in inflammatory response. It is believed that this phenomenon was due to the time point for evaluation (7 days post wounding); it is believed that by 14 days, the observed increase in inflammatory cell presence would resolve. This is reasonable to infer since it is known that in acute wound healing, the normal inflammatory process usually resolves within 10 days post wounding.","The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular infiltration and inflammatory response of human UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a collagen\/ORC scaffold in a swine full-thickness excisional wound defect. The addition of a scaffold or the scaffold with CL was not statistically more inflammatory than an untreated wound at 14 days. As expected, there was a small mononuclear inflammatory cell response to any foreign body (scaffold) that is implanted into the body. However, the addition of CL to the scaffold did not statistically increase this response.","Interestingly, the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response in two rat subcutaneous wound studies (Examples 18 and 19) and in this swine full thickness excision model.","This study suggests that the addition of UDC lysate to a scaffold does not increase the inflammatory response in an acute wound model.","Methods & Materials","Twelve (12) full-thickness excisions (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were created on the dorsal region of eight swine. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. Each animal had an equal distribution of the treatment groups. The treatment squares (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were covered with approximately 2\u00d72 cm NU-GEL Wound Dressing (Johnson & Johnson MEDICAL Limited, Gargrave, United Kingdom). All wounds were then covered with BIOCLUSIVE* Transparent Dressing (Johnson & Johnson MEDICAL Limited, Gargrave, United Kingdom). Strips of self-adhering foam (RESTON; 3M Medical-Surgical Division, St. Paul, Minn.) were placed between sites to prevent cross-contamination due to wound fluid leakage.

Expanded cells, at 25,000 cell\/cm(passage 10), were harvested with trypsin and counted. Cells were distributed into siliconized micro-centrifuge tubes at 1.0E+07, pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Tubes containing the frozen cell pellets were placed in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath, thawed and then promptly placed in a liquid nitrogen bath. This procedure was repeated twice. Upon the last thaw, the cell pellets were centrifuged at 13,000 g, 4\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. The total protein content of the collected supernatant fluid was assessed by Bradford assay and the dose volume of supernatant fluid (30 micrograms total protein per material or 150 micrograms total protein per material) was calculated. The dose volume of supernatant fluid was applied to the material as five one-fifth total dose volume aliquots. An aliquot was placed at each corner of the 1.5\u00d71.5 cm material approximately 1 mm from the material edge and one aliquot was placed in the center of the material. This ensured even distribution of lysate within the wound bed.","Lyophilization.","Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura-Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program of Example 17.

The day before surgery, a small area was shaved at the base of the neck and the patch was applied. On the day of surgery, each pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of Telazol (4 mg\/kg), Xylazine (4 mg\/kg) and Glycopyrrolate (0.011 mg\/kg). The animal was maintained on Isoflurane via endotracheal tube.","The animals were prepared for surgery under general anesthesia. Skin depilation from the back, shoulder, side and flank regions was accomplished with an electric animal clipper equipped with a surgical shaving blade (#40). The area was vacuumed to remove hair clippings and stratum corneum debris, shaved with a razor and shaving cream and rinsed with tap water, finally the animal was prepared for surgery with an application of an antiseptic skin cleanser.","Surgical Approach","Full-thickness excisional wounds (1.5\u00d71.5 cm) were created along the dorsal paravertebral and flank areas with a scalpel. Twelve wounds were made on each animal; six per side. Each wound was submitted to a treatment regimen.

Excised tissue measurements were recorded.","Bandaging Technique.","The test materials were undisturbed for the length of the study. The wounds were covered with a 2\u00d72 cmof NU-GEL. The wounds were dressed with BIOCLUSIVE to keep the wounds moist and to keep the test articles and NU-GEL in place. Strips of polyurethane foam (Reston\u2122) were placed between the wounds to avoid cross-contamination due to wound fluid leakage. The animals were dressed with lap sponges and Spandage\u2122 to help keep dressings in place and the animal's back clean.","The secondary and tertiary bandages were changed on days 2 or 3, 5, 7, and 9 of the study. Dressing condition was evaluated daily to determine if additional bandage changes were necessary due to strikethrough, displacement, etc.","Post-Operative Care and Clinical Observations.","After recovering from surgery and general anesthesia, each pig was observed for behavioral signs of discomfort or pain. No signs of discomfort or pain were observed. Animals were returned to their cage when fully conscious and ambulatory.","The health status of each pig was determined by general appearance and attitude, food consumption, fecal and urinary excretion and the presence of abnormal discharges. Each pig was observed twice daily during the first 36 hours following surgery. Following recovery from surgery, the observations were reduced to once daily until the end of the study.","Evaluations.","Clinical observations were performed at the end of the study under anesthesia, just prior to euthanasia. Assessments included dressing conditions (air exposure, displacement) and wound bed conditions (inflammation, re-injury, infection and wound level).","Euthanasia.","At the predetermined time point (14 days post-wounding), the animals were euthanized under anesthesia with an intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium euthanasia solution (EUTHASOL at 1 ml\/10 lbs body weight) via the marginal ear vein. Following administration of the drug, the animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function. A stethoscope facilitated this process. The femoral artery was severed to assure euthanasia.","Tissue Processing.","Immediately following euthanasia, each wound along with the underlying fat and margin of surrounding skin was excised. The wound was bisected into cranial and caudal halves. The cranial half of the wound was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome by MPI Research.","Histological Assessments.","A computer-controlled motorized programmable slide scanning system was used in the process of image acquisition. Separate images of high magnification fields were acquired from a microscope. The images were tiled to preserve the integrity of the entire histological specimen. This allows accurate measurement of the entire tissue sample.","Images from the light microscope were captured into the computer memory via CCD camera and frame grabber board and subsequently analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software. The captured image of the slide was calibrated and measurements were recorded.","Quantitative histological measurements for granulation tissue (area and length) and epithelialization were assessed using trichrome stained specimens using a magnification of 20-40\u00d7. Average granulation tissue height was determined by dividing the area by the length.","Qualitative histopathology assessments were performed. Tissue sections were analyzed for the presence of the scaffold quality of in-growth and inflammatory response.","Photographic Documentation.","Digital images were taken of individual wounds on days 2, 5, 7, 9 and 14.","Statistical Analysis.","Treatments were assigned using a Latin Square design. This was to ensure that each treatment would be assigned equally at each wound site and avoid any bias to wound position on the animal. Visual assessments were analyzed using JMP 4.0.4 software. Shapiro-Wilk-W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi-Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One-way ANOVA. Tukey-Kramer or Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One-way ANOVA. A value of p<0.05 was used as the level of significance.","Results","Surgery and anesthetic recovery were uneventful. All animals tolerated bandaging well.","Excised Tissue Thickness.","At the time of surgery, each wound is measured with a caliper to determine thickness. There were no differences between the groups for excised tissue thickness.

of the similarity of the cutaneous architecture to that of human skin. This model is the preferred method used to screen prototype devices to determine whether there are effects on inflammatory cell infiltration in this acute wound healing model. However, this type study does not assess efficacy on wound closure. To determine efficacy, an impaired or delayed healing model will be used.","The purpose of this study was to determine the inflammatory response to UDC lysate lyophilized on a collagen\/ORC scaffold in the porcine full-thickness excisional model. This study demonstrates that the addition of UDC lysate to scaffolds does not increase the inflammatory response.","An important consideration when examining the inflammatory response to these lysates is that this study is an example of xenogeneic transplantation with human cells being transplanted into a swine model. It is expected that a degree of inflammation would be present as the host animal \u201creacts\u201d to the introduction of human cells. Interestingly, the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response in two rat subcutaneous wound studies (Examples 18 and 19) and in this swine full thickness excisional model.","In this acute healing model, it was unlikely that an increase in the healing rates with the addition of an active agent would be observed because acute wounds heal rapidly without intervention. As expected, no differences were observed in the rate of wound closure.","The addition of a scaffold or the scaffold with CL was not statistically more inflammatory than an untreated wound. As expected there is a small mononuclear inflammatory cell response to any foreign body (scaffold) that is implanted into the body. However, the addition of CL to the scaffold did not statistically increase this response. In general, the amount of inflammation seen in this study is innocuous and is suggestive of the typical response noted when any foreign material is implanted.","Ischemia results in impaired cutaneous wound healing by decreasing arterial perfusion at the wound site. The decrease in arterial perfusion deprives the wound site of oxygen and nutrients derived from arterial blood. An ischemic wound healing model has been developed in Sprague-Dawley rats. This model contains non-, mildly-, and highly ischemic regions in which full thickness incisional wounds are created.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effect of umbilicus-derived cell (UDC) lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a rat full thickness incisional ischemic wound healing model. In this study, UDCs were expanded in culture, harvested, lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles, applied to 90\/10 PGA\/PLA non-woven scaffolds at two protein concentrations (30 micrograms and 150 micrograms total protein per non-woven scaffold), and lyophilized. The lyophilized scaffolds were applied to rat full thickness excisional ischemic wounds.","Increased angiogenesis was observed in wounds treated with biomaterials containing UDC lysate compared to saline control with a greater than two-fold increase in the angiogenic response in the biomaterials treated with 150 micrograms UDC lysate\/scaffold when compared to the saline control. Angiogenesis is the most critical factor to healing of an ischemic wound site and of chronic wounds in general. These results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a rat full thickness excisional ischemic wound healing model.","Methods & Materials","Test materials used in this study are set forth in Table 23-1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1012","num":"1119"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00051","num":"00051"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 23-1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Test Materials"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Material","Lot Number","Cell Line"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","90\/10 PGA\/PLA non-","5248-46-1 Albany","CBAT Umb"]},{"entry":[{},"woven, 150 micrograms","International 10.50 mm","050604B P10"]},{"entry":[{},"total lysate protein","thick, 65.2 mg\/cc"]},{"entry":["B","90\/10 PGA\/PLA non-","5248-46-1 Albany","CBAT Umb"]},{"entry":[{},"woven, 30 micrograms","International 10.50 mm","050604B P10"]},{"entry":[{},"total lysate protein","thick, 65.2 mg\/cc"]},{"entry":["C","90\/10 PGA\/PLA non-","5248-46-1 Albany","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"woven","International 10.50 mm"]},{"entry":[{},{},"thick, 65.2 mg\/cc"]},{"entry":["D","Saline control","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"UDC Cell Isolation and Culture","Tissue Procurement.","Umbilical cords were obtained from The National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, Pa.) for research purposes with full patient consent.

The animals were selected without any apparent systematic bias.

An eccentric H-flap is surgically created on the dorsum of the back. Six full-thickness excisional defects are created with a 6 mm biopsy punch; two defects are placed lateral to the vertical arms of the H-flap (non-ischemic area); two defects are placed at the edge of the cranial flap (severely ischemic area) and two defects are placed at the edge of the caudal flap (mildly ischemic area). The duration of the study was 10 days.","Each animal was weighed prior to being anesthetized and at necropsy. The rats were anesthetized with either isofluorane via face mask or an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride [60 mg\/kg] and xylazine [10 mg\/kg].","After induction of anesthesia, the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with chlorhexidine diacetate, rinsed with alcohol, dried, and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1% available iodine. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying of the tissue during the anesthetic period. The anesthetized and surgically prepared animal was placed in the desired recumbent position.","An eccentric H-flap was created by making two skin incisions, parallel to the dorsal midline. The skin was separated from the body and a silicone sheet was place underneath the flap. Four stay-sutures were used to tack the corners of the silicone sheet in place. The skin was repositioned in the anatomical position. The horizontal incision was sutured at several points along that incision line. Skin staples were used to close the longitudinal skin incisions. Four full-thickness excisional wounds were created in two rows parallel to the midline via biopsy punch. Two additional defects were created lateral to the vertical arms of the flap. Four of the wounds were ischemic and two had normal blood flow. Test materials, in the form of 6 mm disks were immediately applied to each wound site, according to the designated treatment scheme. Each wound site was covered with NuGel or another similar dressing. Tincture of benzoin was painted around the periphery of the surgical site to secure the outer covering of Bioclusive.","Clinical Observations.","Each animal was observed daily after surgery as directed by the Study Director or attending veterinarian to determine its health status on the basis of general attitude and appearance, food consumption, fecal and urinary excretion and presence of abnormal discharges. All animals were observed BID (twice daily) for the first three days after surgery for the presence of pain and\/or discomfort and given analgesics (as indicated by the study director and\/or attending veterinarian) by appropriately trained LAR personnel. Analgesics were given for 3 days, starting prior to creation of the defect. Assessment for pain and distress were based on the following \u201cEvaluation of Pain\u201d: attempting to protect, move away, or bite; crying out when palpated or forced to use affected areas; licking, biting, scratching, shaking, or rubbing; pacing, lying down and getting up, or shifting weight; significant decrease in mobility; unusual length of time for recumbency; reluctance to move or difficulty in rising; and head down, tucked abdomen, hunched, facial distortion, or pallor. BID observations and treatments continued until the animals were judged to be pain free. If analgesics were given, subsequent evaluations for pain and the need for re-medication were based on the duration of action of the analgesics used, e.g., animals were evaluated every 10 to 12 hours for drugs requiring twice daily administration. Any animal demonstrating signs of severe pain was euthanized immediately. No animals involved in this study showed signs of pain.","Necropsy and Histological Preparation.","Rats were euthanized at day 10 by COinhalation. Gross observations of the implanted sites were recorded. The subcutaneous implantation sites with their overlying skin were excised and preserved in 10% buffered formalin fixative. Following fixation, each implant was marked and trimmed. These specimens were processed for paraffin embedding, then sectioned and stained with H&E and Masson's Trichrome. Histologic evaluation included assessment of the tissue reaction to the scaffold and bioactive.","Results","Implantation Scheme.","The ischemic rat model implantation scheme included control sites L1 and R2 with normal perfusion, mildly ischemic sites L2 and R1, and highly ischemic sites L3 and R3.","Histology Data.","Angiogenesis, epithelialization, granulation tissue, inflammation, and collagen

This parameter would be of most critical importance in the healing of an ischemic wound site. The granulation tissue of the 90\/10 PGA\/PLA non-woven scaffold containing UDC lysate ranged form high cellularity and fibroplasia with minimal organization to moderate cellularity, good organization, and matrix accumulation. A mixed reaction with monocytes and neutrophils was also noted with the UDC lysate biomaterials. As expected in this study, increased re-epithelialization rate was not observed in 90\/10 PGA\/PLA nonwoven\/lysate treated wounds as compared to saline controls. This is expected because in rat wound healing re-epithelialization is partially facilitated by cutaneous contraction. The retention time of 90\/10-PGA\/PLA non-woven scaffold, selected for this study as a representative synthetic biomaterial delivery device, is greater than 10 days and therefore would impede cutaneous contraction. This impedance would be exhibited as slow superficial wound closure and re-epithelialization.","These results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a rat full thickness excisional ischemic wound healing model.","Diabetic foot ulcers are the most prevalent type of non-healing chronic wounds. The db\/db mouse is a strain of diabetic mice recognized for delay in wound healing, making this animal model a valuable tool in which to study chronic wounds.","The present study evaluated the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto a synthetic biomaterial in a db\/db mouse full thickness excisional wound healing model. In this study, UDCs were expanded in culture, harvested, lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles, applied to 90\/10 PGA\/PLA knitted mesh at two protein concentrations (30 micrograms and 150 micrograms total protein per mesh), and lyophilized. A knitted mesh was chosen for use in this study because the thickness (200 microns) is comparable to the thickness of thickness of db\/db mouse dermis (\u02dc800 microns). The lyophilized meshes were applied to full thickness excisional wounds created in db\/db mice. Positive control db\/db mice were treated with collagen\/ORC and negative control db\/db mice were treated with saline. Blood glucose levels were obtained at day zero and day 14 to confirm diabetes. The study was completed on day 14 and the wounds were processed for histology.","Histological evaluation of the wounds treated with meshes containing lysate at both concentrations showed increases in granulation tissue area and granulation tissue depth as compared to saline control. Increased granulation tissue is essential to permanent wound healing without recurrence, since it is presumed that wounds which contain greater amounts of extracellular matrix would have enhanced durability. The results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate, lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial, in a db\/db mouse full thickness dermal wound healing model.","Methods & Materials","UDC Isolation and Culture","Tissue Procurement.","Umbilical cords were obtained from The National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, Pa.) for research purposes with full patient consent.

Mice were housed in groups of 5 to 10. On the first day of the study period, animals were housed in individual cages (cage dimensions 35\u00d715\u00d715 cm with sawdust bedding, changed twice weekly) in an environment maintained at an ambient temperature of 23\u00b0 C. with 12-hour light\/dark cycles. They were provided with food and water ad libitum. To acclimate the animals to their surroundings prior to experimentation, they were housed for a minimum of one week without disturbance other than to refresh their bedding and to replenish their food and water provisions. Following wounding, animals were monitored until they recovered from the procedure and then housed in individual cages for the remainder of the study period.","Creation of Full Thickness Wounds and Treatment.","Prior to anesthesia, each animal's glucose level was obtained via tail nick. The blood sample was analyzed with a glucometer. Animals were anesthetized (halothane and air) and shaved. A single standardized full thickness wound (7.5 mm\u00d77.5 mm) was created in the flank skin of each experimental animal. Wounds received one of the treatments described below (Experimental Groups). Treatments were applied directly to the surface of wounds (no pre-wetting required prior to application).

The db\/db 90\/10 PGA\/PLA knitted mesh 150 microgram treatment group showed a significant increase in granulation tissue area versus db\/db saline and (p>0.006, t test) as well as a near significant increase in granulation tissue depth versus db\/db control (p>0.06, t test). Increased granulation tissue is essential to permanent wound healing and reduced incidence of wound recurrence. Decreased wound width and increased re-epithelialization was not observed in lysate-treated wounds as compared to saline controls. This is expected because the retention time of mesh, selected for this study as a representative synthetic biomaterial delivery device with a thickness compatible with db\/db mouse skin, is greater than 14 days and therefore would slow superficial wound closure and re-epithelialization. Despite the physical presence of this structure, 75-91% of these wounds closed within the 14-day study. These results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto a synthetic biomaterial in a db\/db mouse full thickness wound healing model.","PPDC lysate has been evaluated in several in vivo models previously. Two acute models have been used, a rat subcutaneous implant model and a full-thickness excisional swine model. These studies demonstrated that cell lysate has a good biocompatibility profile, yields increased extracellular matrix formation in the rat subcutaneous implant model (Examples 18 and 19) and results in increased extracellular matrix deposition at early timepoints in the pig with a concomitant increase in inflammation which is not present at day 14 (Examples 21 and 22). Additionally, PPDC lysate has been evaluated in two delayed healing models, an ischemic rat model (Example 23) and in a full-thickness excisional wound model in db\/db mice (Example 24). In the ischemic rat model, a greater than two-fold increase in angiogenesis was observed in wounds treated with biomaterials containing PPDC lysate compared to saline control. In the previous db\/db model, although wound closure was not achieved due to the nonresorbable scaffold material bridging the wound open, enhanced granulation tissue formation was seen in the cell lysate groups.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a natural scaffold consisting of collagen\/ORC in a recognized model of delayed healing, the db\/db mouse wound healing model. The primary endpoint considered in this evaluation was the effect of this material on the increase in the healing rate (time to complete wound closure) in this impaired model since this is the key requirement set forth from the FDA Guidance for Industry for Development of Products for Treatment of Cutaneous Ulcers. Qualitative and semi-quantitative measurements of granulation tissue and inflammatory response were also assessed.","Quantitative analysis of clinical wound images showed that at days 7, 10, and 14, Collagen\/ORC scaffolds containing 90 micrograms PPDC lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than the Collagen\/ORC scaffold alone. In addition, at day 14, Collagen\/ORC containing 30 micrograms cell lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than Collagen\/ORC (p<0.05, Tukey-Kramer for all).","Methods & Materials","A single 7.5 mm\u00d77.5 mm full-thickness excisional wound was created on the left side of homozygous db\/db mice and on heterozygous control mice. 56 mice were evaluated for 14 days.","The treatments were implanted at the time of surgery and left in place throughout the study period. The treatments (approx. 1\u00d71 cm) were placed in the wound and covered with wound dressing pads sold under the tradename RELEASE (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick N.J.). The RELEASE pad was dipped into sterile saline and excess fluid was squeezed out prior to placing it on the animal. All wounds were then covered with transparent wound Dressing sold under the tradename BIOCLUSIVE (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick N.J.).","Digital images of each wound were taken at days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14 post-wounding. These images were used to evaluate wound closure over time.","Bandage changes were done on days 4, 7, and 10 of the study. Additional bandage changes were done if an animal escaped its bandage prior to a scheduled change.","Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 14. The entire wound and surrounding normal skin was excised and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The cranial half of the excised tissue was sent for histological processing (paraffin sections) and stained with H&E and Masson's trichrome. The caudal portion of each sample was retained for possible future analysis.","Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for inflammatory response and quality of repair. Measurements of granulation tissue area and epithelial tongue length were also made.","Treatment Groups","Wound dressings, sold under the tradename PROMOGRAN (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick N.J.), (Lot 1305263) was stored at room temperature prior to manipulation for this study. Cell lysate (CL) was aseptically applied to the scaffolds and then lyophilized under aseptic conditions. Scaffolds containing no CL were also lyophilized. The processed PROMOGRAN samples will be referred to as ORC\/Collagen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1108","num":"1235"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00060","num":"00060"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Complete Description","As Referred to in Report"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A.","Saline treated (heterozygous control","db\/db +\/\u2212"]},{"entry":[{},"animal)"]},{"entry":["B.","Saline","Saline"]},{"entry":["C.","Collagen\/ORC","Collagen\/ORC"]},{"entry":["D.","Collagen\/ORC + 30 ug cell lysate protein","Collagen\/ORC +"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CL Low"]},{"entry":["E.","Collagen\/ORC + 90 ug cell lysate protein","Collagen\/ORC +"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CL High"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"N = 7 per treatment"},{"entry":"The lot of cells used in treatments D & E were CBAT 120304."}]}}]}}},"Test Article Preparation","Lysate Production and Scaffold Preparation.","Human UDC lysate supernatant was prepared as in Example 22. The total protein content of the collected supernatant fluid was assessed by Bradford assay and the dose volume of supernatant fluid (30 micrograms total protein per material or 90 micrograms total protein per material) was calculated. The dose volume of supernatant fluid was applied to the material as five one-fifth total dose volume aliquots. An aliquot was placed at each corner of the 1.5\u00d71.5 cm material approximately 1 mm from the material edge and one aliquot was placed in the center of the material. This ensured even distribution of lysate within the wound bed.","Lyophilization.","Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura-Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program set forth in Example 17. All steps had a ramping rate of 2.5\u00b0 C.\/minute and a 100-mT vacuum.","Anesthesia, Analgesia and Surgical Preparation.","Each animal was weighed and tested for blood glucose level prior to anesthesia. Induction of anesthesia was accomplished by placing each mouse into a pre-charged Isoflurane anesthesia chamber. Once anesthetized, the animal was placed on a nose-cone to maintain the surgical plane of anesthesia. Eye ointment was applied to each animal to prevent corneal ulceration. No analgesics were administered due to the db\/db mouse's physiology. Each animal was carefully scrutinized to determine if they were experiencing pain. Analgesics would have been administered if signs had been demonstrated.","Skin depilation from the back, shoulder, side and flank regions was accomplished with an electric animal clipper. The area was vacuumed to remove hair clippings and stratum corneum debris. Each animal was wiped with Betadine and alcohol prior to being placed on the surgical table.","Surgical Approach.","Full-thickness excisional wounds (7.5\u00d77.5 mm) were created on the left side of each animal with a scalpel and scissors. Each wound was submitted to a treatment regimen. The scaffolds were placed into the wound bed. CL treated scaffolds were placed \u201ctop-side\u201d down.","Bandaging Technique.","The test materials were undisturbed for the length of the study. The wounds were covered with an approximate 1\u00d71 cm square of RELEASE. The RELEASE was dipped in sterile saline and the excess fluid was squeezed out prior to application. The wounds were further dressed with BIOCLUSIVE to keep the wounds moist and to keep the test articles and RELEASE in place.","The secondary bandages (RELEASE and BIOCLUSIVE) were changed on days 4, 7, and 10 of the study. Care was taken to ensure that the wound was not disturbed during the dressing changes. Additional bandage changes were performed if an animal escaped it bandages prior to a scheduled change.","Post-Operative Care and Clinical Observations","After recovering from surgery and general anesthesia, each mouse was observed for behavioral signs of discomfort or pain. No signs of discomfort or pain were observed. Animals were returned to their cage when fully conscious and ambulatory.","The health status of each mouse was determined by general appearance and attitude, food consumption, fecal and urinary excretion, the presence of abnormal discharges and bandage integrity. Each mouse was observed twice daily during the first 36 hours following surgery. Following recovery from surgery, the observations were reduced to once daily until the end of the study.","Evaluations.","At each bandage change and at the end of the study, any unique findings were recorded.","Euthanasia.","At the predetermined time point (7 and 14 days post-wounding), the animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide. The animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function.","Tissue Processing.","Immediately following euthanasia, each wound along with the underlying fat and margin of surrounding skin was excised. The wound was bisected into cranial and caudal halves. The cranial half of the wound was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for H&E and Masson's trichrome by MPI Research. The caudal half of the wound was fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin and is reserved for any future analysis.","Photographic Documentation.","Digital images were taken of individual wounds on days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14 post-wounding. These images were used to measure wound closure. Using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software, each image was calibrated using the ruler-label included in the photo. The wound was traced to determine the area that remained open. Day 0 images were used as baseline and the percentage remaining open was calculated based on the day being evaluated versus the area of that wound on day 0.","Histological Assessments.","A computer-controlled motorized programmable slide scanning system was used in the process of image acquisition. Separate images of high magnification fields were acquired from a microscope. The images were tiled to preserve the integrity of the entire histological specimen. This allows accurate measurement of the entire tissue sample.","Images from the light microscope were captured into the computer memory via CCD camera and frame grabber board and subsequently analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software.","Histological assessments were performed by a consulting pathologist. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold, granulation tissue quality and inflammatory response.","Statistical Analysis.","Treatments were assigned in a blocked fashion. Visual assessments were analyzed using JMP 4.0.4 software. Shapiro-Wilk-W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi-Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One-way ANOVA. Tukey-Kramer or Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One-way ANOVA. A value of p<0.05 was used as the level of significance.","Results","Surgery and anesthetic recovery were uneventful. All animals tolerated bandaging well.","Some differences between the diabetic groups were seen in blood glucose level, however all db\/db mice were sufficiently diabetic during the course of the study.","Clinical Observations Day 14.","On each day of bandage change and at the time of necropsy, each animal was evaluated.

natural scaffold consisting of collagen\/ORC in a recognized model of delayed healing, the db\/db mouse wound healing model. The primary endpoint considered in this evaluation was the effect on the increase in the healing rate (time to complete wound closure) in this impaired model since this is the key requirement set forth from the FDA Guidance for Industry for Development of products for treatment in cutaneous ulcers.","Quantitative analysis of clinical wound images shows that at days 7, 10 and 14, Collagen\/ORC scaffolds containing 90 microgram cell lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than the Collagen\/ORC scaffold alone. In addition, at day 14, Collagen\/ORC containing 30 microgram cell lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than Collagen\/ORC (p<0.05, Tukey-Kramer for all).","These results demonstrate the ability of UDC lysate, lyophilized onto and released from a natural biomaterial of collagen\/ORC, to increase the rate of closure in a db\/db mouse full thickness wound healing model.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of PPDCs, PPDC products, and recombinant human growth factors, following their loading on bioresorbable scaffolds and implantation in SCID mice, in meniscal avascular repair. UDCs and human fibroblasts at passage 10-11 were evaluated in this study. UDC-conditioned medium and cell lysates obtained from umbilicus-derived cells and human fibroblasts also were evaluated in this study. Also included in this study were recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and recombinant human platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). The utility of these treatments was assessed following cell seeding or loading of the growth factor and cell derivatives on scaffolds. Treatments were placed between two discs made from the avascular region of the bovine meniscus. Constructs were held together with fibrin glue and implanted into SCID mice. Scaffolds without cells or growth factor were also implanted into SCID mice as controls.","Results showed that repair tissue filled the synthetic bioresorbable scaffolds without growth factor and cells or cell derivatives. Repair tissue appeared to be fibrous with collagen matrix that stained positive with trichrome but did not stain positive with Safranin O. No striking differences were observed in scaffolds containing cells, cell derivatives, or the growth factors bFGF and PDGF-BB in terms of the quality of repair tissue and intensity of the matrix staining with trichrome compared to scaffold alone at the cell densities and growth factor concentrations tested. Also no positive staining was observed with Safranin O in these samples. Marginal differences in intensity of trichrome staining were noted in scaffolds loaded with conditioned medium derived from umbilicus-derived cells compared to scaffolds loaded with medium alone. Scaffolds loaded with 100 ng of bFGF showed marginally higher intensity of staining with trichrome than scaffolds loaded with 10 ng of bFGF.","Methods & Materials","Reagents.","Dulbecco's Modified Essential Media (DMEM), Penicillin and Streptomycin, were obtained from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was obtained from HyClone (Logan, Utah). Recombinant human bFGF and PDGF-BB were obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn. Chondrocyte growth medium comprised DMEM-High glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 20 micrograms\/milliliter of L-proline, 50 micrograms\/milliliter ascorbic acid, 100 Units\/milliliter penicillin, 100 micrograms\/milliliter of streptomycin and 0.25 micrograms\/milliliter of amphotericin B. TISSEEL fibrin sealant was obtained from Baxter (Deerfield, Ill.).","Cells and Cell Products.","Human adult fibroblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Va. and cultured in growth medium (Dulbecco's Modified Essential supplemented with 15% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin\/streptomycin (100 U\/100 mg, respectively) and 0.001% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) on gelatin-coated tissue culture plastic flasks. UDCs were obtained from CBAT Lot# Umb120304. Cells were cultured in growth media similar to fibroblasts. The cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO. Cells used for experiments were at passage 11.","Cell lysates were prepared as described in Example 17. Briefly, human UDCs were thawed from cryopreserved stocks and seeded into gelatin-coated flasks at 5,000 cell\/cm. Expanded cells, at 25,000 cell\/cm(passage 10), were harvested with trypsin and counted. Cells were distributed into siliconized microcentrifuge tubes at 1.0E+07, pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Tubes containing the frozen cell pellets were placed in a 37\u00b0 C. water bath, thawed, and then promptly placed in a liquid nitrogen bath. This freeze-thaw process was repeated two additional times. Upon the last thaw, the cell pellets were centrifuged at 13,000 g, 4\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. The total protein content of the collected supernatant fluid was assessed by Bradford assay. The cell lysate was applied to tested materials at 30 micrograms total protein per individual scaffold.","Conditioned medium from UDCs was prepared. UDCs Lot Umb022803 P12 cells were thawed and seeded at 5,000 cells\/cmon gelatin-coated flasks. Cells were cultured in Knockout Growth Medium (Knockout DMEM (Gibco) with 15% (v\/v) Knockout serum (Gibson), penicillin\/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and 0.001% (v\/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 4 days. At the end of 4th day, medium was collected and filtered through a 0.2 micron filter. Medium was concentrated using the Ultra Centrifuge filter devices 5000 MWCO from Millipore (Billerica, Mass.) following the manufacturer's specifications.","Scaffolds.","Nonwoven scaffold made of 50:50 Polyglactin 910 and Polydioxanone, 3 mm in diameter, 1 mm thick, Ethylene Oxide (ETO) sterilized, were obtained from Center for Biomaterials and Advanced Technologies (CBAT, Somerville, N.J.). Duraform scaffolds (Codman, Raynham, Mass.), 3 mm diameter, \u02dc1 mm thick were also evaluated.","Scaffold-Loading with Cells, Cell Products, and Growth Factors.","3.0 mm punches made from scaffolds were loaded with the following growth factors: bFGF, 10 nanograms\/scaffold; bFGF, 100 nanograms\/scaffold; PDGF-BB, 10 nanograms\/scaffold; PDGF-BB, 100 nanograms\/scaffold. Loaded scaffolds were lyophilized overnight. Control scaffolds received equivalent volume of vehicle. For cell lysates, scaffolds were loaded with lysate of UDCs (UDC120304 p10, scaffold containing the lysate from 1 million cells, 30 micrograms\/scaffold) or Fibroblasts (NHDF IF 1122, scaffold containing the lysate from 1 million cells, 30 micrograms\/scaffold). Cell- and lysate-loaded scaffolds were lyophilized overnight. For conditioned medium, scaffolds were loaded with 10 microliters of UDC-conditioned medium or 10 microliters of control medium alone and lyophilized. For cell loading, scaffolds were loaded with UDCs (Umb 120304 p11), at 1\u00d710cells per scaffold or Fibroblasts (NHDF IF1122, p11) at 1\u00d710cells per scaffold. Cells were seeded onto scaffolds prior to the day of the experiment. The cell-seeded scaffolds were incubated in a cell culture incubator (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO) for one day prior to placement between meniscal discs.","Bovine Meniscal Explants.","Meniscal explants 3 mm in diameter were made from menisci obtained from bovine knees of 1 to 1\u00bd year-old animals. 3 mm punches were excised from the central avascular portion of the meniscus. The excised 3 mm punch was trimmed to make discs of approximately 1 mm in thickness. Scaffolds with cells, cell products, or growth factors were placed between two meniscal avascular discs and held together using fibrin glue (50 microliters of TISSEEL). Samples were maintained in chondrocyte growth medium overnight, rinsed in phosphate buffered saline the following day, and implanted into SCID mice.","SCID Implantation.","Each SCID mouse received 2 treatments that were placed in pockets created in each hemithorax through one skin incision. Tacking sutures of 5-0 ETHIBOND* EXCEL (polyester) were used to tack the skin to musculature around each scaffold to prevent subcutaneous migration. Scaffolds were implanted for 6 weeks and then harvested. The various treatment groups implanted are outlined below.","Test Material (N=3 Per Treatment)","A. MBD+PDS\/VNW","B. MBD+Duraform","C.

Each implant was bisected in half and one half was sent to Paragon Bioservices (Baltimore, Md.) for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining with Hematoxylin\/Eosin (H\/E), Trichrome (Tri) and Safranin O (SO).","Results","New repair tissue formation was observed in the majority of the 50\/50 Polyglactin 910\/Polydioxanone (50:50 PDS\/VNW) samples including scaffold alone, scaffolds loaded with growth factor, cell-seeded scaffolds, and cell derivative-loaded scaffolds. The repair tissue was predominantly fibrous in nature and stained positive with trichrome. Collagen fiber bundles were observed in most cases.","50\/50 PDS\/VNW scaffolds loaded with cells, lysates, or conditioned medium at the concentrations tested did not appear to be strikingly different than control scaffolds. Scaffolds loaded with cells as expected appeared to be more cellular than control scaffolds. A marginal increase in intensity of trichrome staining was noted in scaffolds loaded with UDC CM when compared to scaffolds loaded with control medium.","50\/50 PDS\/VNW scaffolds loaded with 100 ng bFGF showed marginally higher intensity of staining with trichrome than scaffolds loaded with 10 ng of bFGF. No striking differences were noted between the scaffolds treated with 10 ng and 100 ng of PDGF-BB.","DURAFORM Collagen control scaffolds were not observed in any of the samples indicating that they may have been resorbed before cells could migrate into and lay down new matrix.","Expanded hUDCs are being developed as a potential cell therapy for the treatment of a number of degenerative diseases. One of the mechanisms of action by which these cells can act is through trophic factor support. Trophic factors are the proteins and other materials (such as lipids and glycosaminoglycans) that cells produce to stimulate a biological effect. It is speculated that hUDC trophic factors could be beneficial in the treatment of a number of diseases, including chronic wounds.","To assess the potency of hUDC lysate, increasing concentrations were dissolved in culture medium and applied to mouse fibroblasts and human endothelial cells. The increases in proliferation above basal media indicate lysate potency.","New repair tissue formation was observed in the majority of the 50\/50 Polyglactin 910\/Polydioxanone (50:50 PDS\/VNW) samples including scaffold alone, scaffolds loaded with growth factor, cell-seeded scaffolds, and cell product-loaded scaffolds.
