{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of and incorporates by reference U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/966,212, filed on Dec. 13, 2010.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to online and\/or mobile payments and more particularly to a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) payment system.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as, for example, the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from payees and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on-line payee or retailer and the consumer, and payment is typically made by providing credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on-line or mobile payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on-line purchases are growing very quickly.","One conventional way of making mobile payments is for payees to program an account identification number for an account on an RFID tag and provide an RFID device including that RFID tag to the account holder. The payer may then use that RFID device to transmit the account identification number to a payee so that the account may be used to make a payment. For example, RFID tags are used in toll road systems by programming the RFID tag with an account identification number for an account of a payer and then positioning an RFID device including that RFID tag in a car of the payer. When that car passes through a toll that includes a scanning antenna, the RFID tag will detect a signal from the scanning antenna and, in response, transmit the account identification number to a payee device so that the account of the payer may be charged the toll. However, such conventional systems only allow one account or funding source to be associated with the RFID tag, which may require the payer to carry around multiple physical RFID devices, each programmed and provided by particular payees, if the payer would like to make mobile payments to those payees.","Thus, there is a need for an improved RFID payment system.","According to one embodiment, a method for making a payment using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) includes associating an RFID identifier with a payer account in a database. The RFID identifier is also associated with a purchase type and an associated spending gate definition in the database. The spending gate definition is associated with at least one of a plurality of funding sources of the payer account. When a payment request is received using the RFID identifier, if the purchase type provided with the payment request is in the database as an acceptable purchase type, a payment is made using the at least one funding source of the payer account according to the spending gate definition associated with the purchase type.","In an embodiment, a plurality of payer information that is not related to the payer account is associated with the RFID identifier. The RFID identifier may be received from the payee, and the plurality of payer information may then be sent to the payee.","As a result, a payer may define a plurality of funding sources to be used, based on the type of purchase being made, when making payments using an RFID tag. The RFID tag may also be used to transmit payer information to a payee for use by the payee to provide goods and\/or services to the payer.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The present disclosure provides a system and method for making payments for a purchase using a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system or RFID tag associated with a payer account according to a plurality of spending gate definitions associated with that payer account. Each of the plurality of spending gate definitions associate at least one of a plurality of funding sources of the payer account with a purchase amount range and optionally a purchase type such that purchase amount ranges and\/or purchase types are used to define, which, when, and how funding sources are to be used to make a payment for a purchase made using the RFID tag. This allows a payer to define different funding sources for different purchases and precisely control how purchases are paid for.","The discussion below with reference to , , , , , , , , , and relates to the creation and use of spending gate definitions for purchase amount ranges. That discussion is followed by a discussion of the use of RFID devices that use such spending gate definitions.","Referring now to , , , and , a method  for making a payment is illustrated. The method  begins at block  where a payment service provider receives a plurality of spending gate definitions for a payer account. illustrates an embodiment of a screenshot of a payer account website  that allows a payer to provide a plurality of spending definitions to a payment service provider. In an embodiment, the payer account website  may be provided by the payment service provider and accessed by the payer using networked computer systems, described in further detail below. One of skill in the art will recognize that the payer may provide a variety of information (e.g., a login ID, a password, etc.) to gain access to the payer account website  having one or more web pages as described below. The payer account website  includes a My Account tab having a Profile section . The Profile section includes a Spending Gates definition section and a Funding Sources section . The Spending Gates definition section includes an editable definition having a plurality of input fields , , and , and an Add Gate button . The Funding Sources section includes a plurality of funding sources , , , , , , and . In an embodiment, the plurality of funding sources , , , , , , and include banking accounts, credit accounts, and other accounts of the payer to which the payment service provider has access in order to make payments.","The payer may use the payer account website  by filling in the plurality of input fields and of the editable definition with desired purchase amounts to create a purchase amount range (while the illustrated embodiment uses dollars for the purchase amounts, euros, yuan, and\/or a variety of other currencies known in the art may be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure) and filling in the input field with a funding source (e.g., one of the funding sources , , , , , , and ), as illustrated in . In the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has used the editable definition of to create a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 6 (OTHER)) for any purchase up to $25.00. For example, the payer may desire that small purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $0 and $25.00) be paid for using credits from an account provided by the payment service provider (i.e., ACCOUNT 6 (OTHER)), and the spending gate definition provides that instruction to the payment service provider. The payer may then select the Add Gate button in order to be presented with an Add New Gate link , an Add Gate Condition link , and a Split Gate link , as illustrated in ","The payer may select the Add New Gate link in the Add Gate button of to be presented with an editable definition that is substantially similar to the editable definition of and the payer may then fill in the plurality of input fields (substantially similar to the input fields and of ) associated with each editable definition with desired purchase amounts to create purchase amount ranges and fill in the input fields (substantially similar to the input field of ) with funding sources to create one or more spending gate definitions. One of skill in the art will recognize that the payer may use the Add New Gate link to create as many spending gate definitions as the payer desires.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has used an editable definition to create a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) for any purchase between $25.01 and $250.00. For example, the payer may desire that smaller intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $25.01 and $250.00) be paid for using a bank account (i.e., ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)), and the spending gate definition provides that instruction to the payment service provider. The payer has also used an editable definition to create a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) for any purchase between $250.01 and $500.00. For example, the payer may desire that larger intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $250.01 and $500.00) be paid for using a credit account (i.e., ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)), and the spending gate definition provides that instruction to the payment service provider. The payer has also used an editable definition to create a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 7 (OTHER)) for any purchase between $500.01 and $1000.00. For example, the payer may desire that large purchases (between $500.01 and $1000.00) be paid for using an account provided by the payment service provider that bills the payer for the purchase at a later time (e.g., a BillMeLater account known in the art and provided by PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.) (i.e., ACCOUNT 7 (OTHER)), and the spending gate definition provides that instruction to the payment service provider.","While a plurality of spending gate definitions , , , and have been illustrated and discussed, one of skill in the art will recognize that a plurality of other spending gate definitions may be created using the techniques described above without departing from the scope of the present disclosure (e.g., the spending maximum for a funding source may be unbounded for the largest purchases (e.g., purchases from \u201c$500.01 and up\u201d or \u201c$500.01 to the limits of the funding source\u201d). Furthermore, a variety of other spending gate definitions may be combined with the spending gate definitions , , , and , a few embodiments of which are discussed in further detail below.","Referring now to and , the payer may select the Add Gate Condition link in the Add Gate button of subsequent to creating any spending gate definition (e.g., the spending gate definitions , , , and .) Selection of the Add Gate Condition link presents the payer with an Add Gate Condition box  that includes a plurality of editable conditions , and , as illustrated in . The editable condition includes a plurality of input fields and , the editable condition includes a plurality of input fields and , and the editable condition includes a plurality of input fields and ","The payer may use the payer account website  by selecting one of the editable conditions , , or and filling in the plurality of input fields associated with that editable condition with the appropriate information (e.g., a day of the month for input field associated with editable condition , a dollar amount for inputs fields and associated with editable conditions and , and funding source(s) for input fields , , and .)","For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has used the editable condition of to add a spending gate condition to the spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 2 (BANK)) for any purchase up to $25.00 if the purchase is made before the 6day of a given month, and at other times to use the funding source (ACCOUNT 6 (OTHER)). For example, the payer may desire that small purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $0 and $25.00) be paid for using credits from an account provided by the payment service provider (i.e., ACCOUNT 6 (OTHER)) unless it is before the 6day of a given month and, if it is, to use the funding source (ACCOUNT 2 (BANK)) due to, for example, that funding source having a deposit that is regularly deposited at the beginning of the month, and the spending gate condition modifies the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","The payer has also used the editable condition of to add a spending gate condition to the spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)) for any between $25.01 and $250.00 if funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) is below $300. For example, the payer may desire that smaller intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $25.01 and $250.00) be paid for using a bank account (i.e., ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) unless the balance in that bank account is below $300 and, if it is, to use the funding source (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)) in order to ensure that the balance on the bank account does not get too low, and the spending gate condition modifies the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","The payer has also used editable conditions and of to create a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) for any purchase between $250.01 and $500.00 if the funding source (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) is within $25 of a spending limit, and to use funding source (ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)) for any purchase between $250.01 and $500.00 if the funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) is within $25 of a spending limit and the funding source (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) is below $1000 dollars. For example, the payer may desire that larger intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $250.01 and $500.00) be paid for using a credit account (i.e., ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) unless the credit account is close to its spending limit and, if it is, to use a bank account (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) but, if the bank account it below $1000, then to use another credit account (ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)) that may not be used often and can handle a large single purchase, and the spending gate conditions and modify the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","Referring now to and , in another embodiment, the payer may select the Add Gate Condition link in the Add Gate button of subsequent to creating any spending gate definition (e.g., the spending gate definitions , , , and .) Selection of the Add Gate Condition link presents the payer with an Add Gate Condition box  that includes a plurality of editable conditions , and , as illustrated in . The editable condition includes a plurality of input fields and along with an Add button , the editable condition includes a plurality of input fields , , and , and the editable condition includes a plurality of input fields and along with an Apply To All button ","The payer may use the payer account website  by selecting one of the editable conditions , , or and filling in the plurality of input fields associated with that editable condition with the appropriate information and using the buttons when necessary (e.g., selecting a funding source for input fields , , , , and , inputting an incentive program level in input field , inputting a payee in input field , selecting the Add button to add a funding source input field to editable condition , and selecting the Apply To All button to apply the editable condition to all the spending definitions.)","For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has used the editable condition of to add a spending gate condition to the spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use a funding source, selected from funding sources (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)), (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)), and (ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)), that has the lowest interest rate for any purchase between $25.01 to $250.00. One of skill in the art will recognize that the payer has selected the Add button of editable condition to include the three funding sources , , and in the spending gate condition and that the payer may do the same to add as many funding sources to similar spending gate conditions as is desired. For example, the payer may desire that smaller intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $25.01 and $250.00) be paid for using the credit account of the payer that has the lowest interest rate, and the spending gate condition modifies the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","The payer has also used editable condition of to create a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)) for any purchase between $250.01 and $500.00 if an incentive program associated with that funding source is below 100,000 miles, and if the incentive program is not below 100,000 miles, then to use funding source (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)). For example, the payer may desire that larger intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $250.01 and $500.00) be paid for using a credit account (i.e., ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)) until an incentive associated with that credit account (in the illustrated embodiment, airline miles) is achieved, and then once that incentive is achieved, to use a credit account (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)) that may have a different incentive program that the payer then wishes to receive an incentive from, and the spending gate conditions modifies the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","The payer has also used editable condition of to create a spending gate condition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) for any purchase from a specific payee (in the illustrated embodiment, PHONE COMPANY.) One of skill in the art will recognize that the payer has selected the Apply To All button to apply the spending gate condition to all spending gate definitions, and that similar spending gate conditions may be applied to only one or some spending gate definitions. For example, the payer may desire that any bill from a specific payee (PHONE COMPANY) be paid for with a specific funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) regardless of the payment amount, and the spending gate condition modifies all the spending gate definitions , , , and to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","While a plurality of spending gate conditions , , , , , , and have been illustrated and discussed, one of skill in the art will recognize that a plurality of other spending gate conditions may be created using the techniques described above without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, the spending gate conditions may be used alone and\/or with spending gate definitions without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to and , the payer may select the Split Gate link in the Add Gate button of subsequent to creating any spending gate definition (e.g., the spending gate definitions , , , and .) Selection of the Split Gate link presents the payer with a Split Gate box  that includes an editable gate splitter , as illustrated in . The editable gate splitter includes a plurality of input fields , , and along with a Split Further button ","The payer may use the payer account website  by selecting the editable gate splitter and filling in the plurality of input fields associated with that editable condition with the appropriate information and using the buttons when necessary (e.g., selecting a funding source for input field , inputting a percentage in input fields and , and selecting the Split Further button to add more input fields for splitting a spending definition purchase between additional funding sources.)","For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has used the editable gate splitter of to add a gate splitter to the spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) for 50% any purchase between $25.01 and $250.00 and to use funding source (ACCOUNT 2 (BANK)) for the other 50% of that purchase. For example, the payer may desire that payments for smaller intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $25.01 and $250.00) be split evenly between funding sources (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) and (ACCOUNT 2 (BANK)), and the gate splitter modifies the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","The payer has also used editable gate splitter of to add a gate splitter to the spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use funding source (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) for 50% any purchase between $250.01 and $500.00, to use funding source (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)) for 25% of that purchase, and to use funding source (ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)) for 25% of that purchase. One of skill in the art will recognize that the payer has selected the Split Further button to include the three funding sources , , and at specific percentages for payments, and that the payer may do the same to split payments between any number of funding sources at any percentages desired. For example, the payer may desire that payments for larger intermediate purchases (e.g., a purchase amount range between $250.01 and $500.00) be split between funding sources (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT), ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT), and ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)) in specific percentages, and the gate splitter modifies the spending gate definition to provide that instruction to the payment service provider.","While a plurality of gate splitters and have been illustrated and discussed, one of skill in the art will recognize that a plurality of other gate splits may be created using the techniques described above without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, the gate splitters may be used alone and\/or with the spending gate conditions and\/or spending gate definitions without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring back to , the method  then proceeds to block  where the plurality of spending gate definitions are stored in a database. The payments service provider may take all the spending gate definitions (including spending gate conditions, gate splitters, etc.) and store those in a payer database. In an embodiment, the spending gate definitions are associated with the payer account that they were created for. The method  then proceeds to block  where a payment request including a payment amount is received. Subsequent to the creation of the plurality of spending gates, the payer may make a purchase using their payer account, and in response, a payment request for that purchase that includes a payment amount for the purchase is sent to the payment service provider. For example, a payment amount of $100 for a purchase made using the payer account may be received.","The method  then proceeds to block  where it is determined that the payment amount corresponds to a purchase amount range. The payment service provider may use information from the payer account along with the payment amount to access the spending gate definitions in the database and determine that the payment amount corresponds to a purchase amount range included in one of the spending definitions. In the example where the payment amount received is $100, the payment service provider may access the database and determine that the $100 payment amount corresponds to the purchase amount range of $25.01 to $250.00. The method  then proceeds to block  where payment is made using one or more funding sources associated with the purchase amount range determined in block .","In the example where the payment amount received is $100 and the purchase amount range is $25.01 to $250.00, the payment service provider may access the spending definition illustrated in and use the funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) to make the payment. In another embodiment, the payment service provider may access the spending definition illustrated in and use the funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) to make the payment unless the funding source is below $300, and if the funding source is below $300, then use the funding source (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT) to make the payment. In another embodiment, the payment service provider may access the spending definition illustrated in and use the funding source, selected from the funding sources (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)), (ACCOUNT 4 (CREDIT)), or (ACCOUNT 5 (CREDIT)), that has the lowest interest rate to make the payment. In an embodiment, the payment service provider may have account balance information or interest rate information for the funding sources in a database, or may retrieve the account balance information or interest rate information for the funding sources over a network. In another embodiment, the payment service provider may access the spending definition illustrated in and use the funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) to make the 50% of the payment and funding source (ACCOUNT 2 (BANK)) to make the other 50% of the payment.","Thus, a system and method are described that allow a payer to define different funding sources for different purchases and precisely control how purchases are paid for. While a plurality of examples have been discussed above, one of skill in the art will recognize that the present disclosure is not so limited, and a variety of other embodiments will fall within its scope. As discussed above with respect to the spending gate definition that selects a funding source with the lowest interest rate or determines a funding source balance, the payment service provider may keep funding source information for funding sources in a database, or may retrieve such information over a network when needed. Other funding source information may include funding source spending limits, incentive program points\/miles\/etc., and a variety of other funding source information known in the art.","While the embodiment of the method above is directed to making a payment using a plurality of spending gates, the gates are not so limited and may instead be referred to as transaction gates that may define how a variety of transactions are dealt with by the payment service provider. For example, a transaction gate may define different funding sources for refunds, and when a refund is to be refunded to a payer (e.g., by a payee or the payment provider,) it will be drawn from an account determined using transaction gates that are substantially similar to the spending gates described above. In another example, a transaction gate may defined how a payment or credit should be received by defining different accounts for different payments or credits, and when a payment or credit is received, it will be deposited into an account determined using transaction gates that are substantially similar to the spending gates described above. One of skill in the art will recognize how a variety of transactions and transaction gates may be substituted for the spending gates in the embodiment of the method described above without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , , , and , a method  for making a payment using an RFID system is illustrated and will be described. In an embodiment, the payer may be provided with one or more physical RFID devices from payees, account providers, and\/or payment service providers. In an embodiment, each RFID device includes an RFID tag that has been programmed with an RFID identifier such as, for example, an account number. The RFID tag is operable to transmit the RFID identifier to a payer device as discussed above to use an account associated with the account number to pay for a purchase. In an embodiment, an RFID device may include a card with an embedded RFID tag, a keychain \u201cdongle\u201d with an embedded RFID tag, and\/or a variety of other RFID devices known in the art (e.g., a coffee shop may provide a reuseable coffee cup with an embedded RFID tag.)","The method  begins at block  where an RFID identifier is associated with a payer account in a database. illustrates an embodiment of a screenshot of a payer account website  that is similar to the payer account website  discussed above that allows a payer to provide a plurality of spending definitions to a payment service provider. As discussed above, the payer account website  may be provided by the payment service provider and accessed by the payer using networked computer systems, and one of skill in the art will recognize that the payer may provide a variety of information (e.g., a login ID, a password, etc.) to gain access to the payer account website  having one or more web pages as described below. The illustrated embodiment of the payer account website  includes a My Account tab  having an RFID preferences section . The RFID preferences section  includes a master RFID section  and a linked RFID section . The master RFID section  includes an RFID identifier input , a modify funding preferences link , and a modify information preferences links . The linked RFID section  includes a plurality of RFID identifier inputs and associated modify funding preferences links , and modify information preferences links ","As discussed above, the payer may possesses a plurality of physical RFID devices. In the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has provided a master RFID identifier in the RFID identifier input of the master RFID section , and a linked RFID identifier in each of the RFID identifier inputs in the linked RFID section . Upon receiving the master RFID identifier in the RFID identifier input of the master RFID section , the payment service provider may associate the master RFID identifier with the payer account in a database. Furthermore, upon receiving the linked RFID identifiers in the RFID identifier inputs in the linked RFID section , the payment service provider may associate those linked RFID identifiers with the master RFID identifier in the database. As discussed in further detail below, the association of the linked RFID identifiers with the master RFID identifier allows a payer to carry only one physical RFID device (i.e., the \u201cmaster\u201d RFID device that includes the master RFID identifier) and use that RFID device with a plurality of payees that may have provided the payer with linked RFID devices having the linked RFID identifiers. As also discussed in further detail below, the association of the linked RFID identifiers with the master RFID identifier may also allow a payer to provide a single set of spending definitions (e.g., associated with the master RFID identifier) that are to be applied when using any of the RFID devices (e.g., the master or linked RFID devices.)","Referring now to , , and , the method  then proceeds to blocks  and  where a plurality of purchase types and spending gate definitions are received and associated with an RFID identifier. In an embodiment, in response to the payer selecting the modify funding preferences link in the master RFID section , the payer may be presented with a master RFID spending gate section  and a funding sources section . The master RFID spending gate section  includes a purchase type input , an editable spending gate definition having a plurality of input fields , , and , and an Add Gate button . The funding sources section  includes a plurality of funding sources , , , , , , and . The purchase type input allows a payer to provide a purchase type, and the editable spending gate definition , Add gate button , and funding sources section  operate substantially similarly to the editable spending gate definition , Add Gate button , and funding sources section described above with reference to . Thus, the master RFID spending gate section  allows the payer to define purchase types and spending gate definitions to be used by the payment service provider when the master RFID identifier (or, in an embodiment, one of the associated linked RFID identifiers) is received, and those purchase types and spending gate definitions may then be sent to the payment service provider to be associated with a payer account and the master RFID identifier.","For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , the payer has used the purchase type input in to create a plurality of purchase types and , and then used the editable spending gate definition to create a spending gate definition for the purchase type and spending gate definitions , , , and for the purchase type . Thus, for purchase types categorized as \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d, the payer has created a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use a specific funding source (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) for any \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d purchase up to $1000.00. For all other purchase types, the payer has provided a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use a first funding source (ACCOUNT 6 (OTHER)) for purchases between $0.00 and $25.00, a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use a second funding source (ACCOUNT 1 (BANK)) for purchases between $25.01 and $250.00, a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use a third funding source (ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT)) for any purchase between $250.01 and $500.00, and a spending gate definition that instructs the payment service provider to use a fourth funding source (ACCOUNT 7 (OTHER)) for any purchase between $500.01 and $1000.00. Furthermore, each of the spending gate definitions may be modified using the gate conditions and gate splitting, discussed above, using the Add Gate button . The purchase types and spending gate definitions may then be sent by the payer to the payment service provider (e.g., from a payer device to the payment service provider device over a network) and associated with the payer account.","In another embodiment, purchase types and spending gate definitions may be determined by the payment service provider and provided or suggested to the payer. For example, the payment service provider may review a purchase history of a payments by the payer for a plurality of purchases and use that purchase history to provide or suggest purchase types and associated spending gate definitions. Referring to the embodiment illustrated in , the payment service provider may review the purchase history and determine that for purchases for \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d, the payer has predominantly used ACCOUNT 3(CREDIT) (and, for example, no purchase has ever exceeded $1000), and suggest or provide the purchase type and spending gate definition . The payment service provider may review the purchase history and determine that for all non \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d purchases, the payer has predominantly used ACCOUNT 6(OTHER) for purchases under $25, ACCOUNT 1 (BANK) for purchases between $25.01 and $250, ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT) for purchases between $250.01 and $500, and ACCOUNT 7 (OTHER) for purchases between $500.01 and $1000 (and, for example, no purchase has ever exceeded $1000), and suggest or provide the purchase type and spending gate definitions , , , and ","In another embodiment, the purchase types may also include times and\/or dates. For example, the payer may apply the spending gate definition for purchases made between Monday morning through Friday afternoon, while applying the spending gate definitions , , , and for purchases made between Friday afternoon and Monday morning.","While purchase types and spending gate definitions have been illustrated and described as being provided for and associated with a master RFID identifier, purchase types and spending gate definitions may also be provided for and associated with the linked RFID identifiers discussed above in substantially the same manner (e.g., using the modify funding preferences links in the linked RFID section .) Furthermore, one or more of the linked RFID identifiers may be set up to use purchase types and spending gate definitions that are associated with the master RFID identifier, which allows one set of purchase types and spending gate definitions to be created for the master RFID identifier and then used for purchases made with any of the linked RFID identifiers.","The method  then proceeds to block  where a payment request using an RFID identifier is received. In making a purchase from a payee, the payer may use a RFID device with a payee device in order to provide the RFID identifier associated with that RFID device to the payee device. In response to receiving the RFID identifier, the payee device may then transmit a payment request to the payment service provider that includes the RFID identifier, purchase information (e.g., information about what is being purchased, the amount of the purchase, etc.), and\/or payee information (e.g., the name of the payee, an identifier associated with the payee, etc.) For example, the payer may have the master RFID device in their possession, and may use that master RFID device to provide its master RFID identifier to a payee device of a payee that has previously provided the payer with one of the linked RFID devices. In another example, the payer may have a linked RFID device in their possession, and may use that linked RFID device to provide its linked RFID identifier to a payee that has previously provided the payer with that linked RFID device. In either example, the RFID identifier is received by a payment service provider device from the payee device over a network along with purchase information and\/or payee information.","The method  then proceeds to block  where it is determined that the payment request includes a purchase type associated an RFID identifier. In an embodiment, the payment service provider device may review the payment request received from the payee device to determine a purchase type being made (e.g., using the purchase information included in the payment request), and then may access a database to determine if that purchase type is associated with a spending gate definition as discussed above.","In one embodiment, the payer may only have a single RFID device that includes the purchase types and associated spending gate definitions discussed above (i.e., the payer may not have any RFID devices with linked RFID identifiers.) When that RFID device is used to make a purchase, its RFID identifier is received by the payment service provider device in a payment request that also includes purchase information with a purchase type. The payment service provider device may then use the RFID identifier to access a database to determine whether the purchase type in the payment request corresponds to any purchase types associated with that RFID identifier. If the purchase type in the payment request corresponds to a purchase type associated with the RFID identifier, the payment service provider may then retrieve the spending gate definitions associated with the purchase type. In an embodiment, the RFID identifier may include spending gate definitions with purchase amount ranges but no associated purchase type (e.g., the spending ate definitions discussed above with reference to -.) Thus, a payer may have a single RFID device that they may use to make payments from a plurality of different funding sources (according to the purchase types and\/or spending gate definitions discussed above.)","Using the example illustrated in , the payment service provider may receive a payment request including the RFID identifier \u201c1234567890\u201d that has had the purchase types and and their associated spending gate definitions , , , , and associated with it. The payment service provider device may then determine the purchase type of the purchase being made from the purchase information in the payment request. If that purchase type is \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d, the payment service provider device retrieves the spending gate definition , while if that purchase type is not \u201cGAS\/FUEL the payment service provider device retrieves the spending gate definitions , , , and ","In another embodiment, the payer may use the master RFID device to make a purchase from a payee that has previously provided the payer one of the linked RFID devices. The RFID tag in the master RFID device will transmit the master RFID identifier to a payee device, which then provides that master RFID identifier to the payment service provider device along with purchase information and payee information. The payment service provider may then use the master RFID identifier and the payee information from the payment request to determine which of the linked RFID identifiers that are associated with the master RFID identifier was provided to the payer by the payee. For example, the payment service provider device may use the master RFID identifier to determine the plurality of linked RFID identifiers associated with that master RFID identifier (as discussed above with reference to .) The payment service provider device may then use the payee information to determine which of the linked RFID identifiers is associated with the payee from whom the purchase is currently being made. The payment service provider may then use that linked RFID identifier and the purchase information in the payment request to determine if the purchase being made is for a purchase type associated with the linked RFID identifier and, if so, retrieve the spending gate definition(s) that are associated with that purchase type.","In another embodiment, the payer may use one of the linked RFID devices to make a purchase from a payee that has previously provided the payer with that linked RFID device. The RFID tag in the linked RFID device will transmit the linked RFID identifier to a payee device, which then provides that linked RFID identifier to the payment service provider device along with purchase information and payee information. The payment service provider may then use the linked RFID identifier from the payment request to determine if the linked RFID identifier is associated with a master RFID identifier that has associated purchase types and\/or spending gate definitions. For example, the payment service provider device may use the linked RFID identifier to determine if it is associated in the database with a master RFID identifier (as discussed above with reference to .) The payment service provider device may then determine whether that that linked RFID identifier has associated purchase types and\/or spending gate definitions, or whether that linked RFID identifier is set to use purchase types and\/or spending gate definitions that are associated with a master RFID identifier. If the linked RFID identifier has associated purchase types and\/or spending gate definitions, the payment service provider device may determine whether the purchase type in the payment request corresponds to any purchase types associated with the linked RFID identifier substantially as discussed above and, if so, retrieve the associated spending gate definitions. If the linked RFID identifier is set to use purchase types and\/or spending gate definitions that are associated with a master RFID identifier, the payment service provider device may determine whether the purchase type in the payment request corresponds to any purchase types associated with the master RFID identifier substantially as discussed above and, if so, retrieve the associated spending gate definitions.","The method then proceeds to block  where a payment is made using funding sources according to at least one associated spending gate definition. As discussed above, in response to receiving the payment request, the payment service provider device may use the RFID identifier and purchase type to retrieve at least one spending definition. The payment service provider device may then use a purchase amount included in the payment request to determine which of a plurality of funding sources to use to make the payment according to the at least one spending definition. Using the example illustrated in , at block , if the payment service provider device determines that the purchase type is \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d, the payment service provider device uses ACCOUNT 3 (CREDIT) to make the payment. If the payment service provider device determines that the purchase type is not \u201cGAS\/FUEL\u201d, the payment service provider device may use the purchase amount in the payment request to determine which funding source to use to make the payment (e.g., if the purchase amount is $50, ACCOUNT 1(BANK) would be used to make the payment.","Thus, a system and method are provided that allow a payer to use an RFID device to make a purchase, and the funding source used to pay for that purchase may be automatically determined based on a purchase type and\/or a purchase amount. A plurality of RFID identifiers may be associated with a single RFID identifier such that a payer need only carry one RFID device to make payments using any of a plurality of RFID identifiers associated with respective RFID devices. The association of the plurality of RFID identifiers with a single RFID identifier also allows the funding source determination for purchases made using any of the RFID identifiers to be made using spending gate definitions that have been associated with a single RFID identifier.","Referring now to , , and , a method for providing payer information to a payee is illustrated. As discussed above, the payer may be provided with one or more RFID devices from payees, account providers, and\/or payment service providers, and each RFID device includes an RFID tag that has been programmed with an RFID identifier such as, for example, an account number, that the RFID tag is operable to transmit to a payer device.","The method  begins at block  where an RFID identifier is associated with a payer account in a database. In an embodiment, block  of the method  may be carried out substantially similarly as block  of the method , described above with reference to and . The method  then proceeds to blocks  and  where a plurality of payer information is received and associated with an RFID identifier in the database. In an embodiment, the method  may involve payees registering with the payment service provider and specifying different types of information they would like payers to provide to them. Referring now to and , in an embodiment, in response to the payer selecting the modify information preferences links in one of the linked RFID sections  on the payer account webpage , the payer may be presented with a linked RFID payer information section  that, in the illustrated embodiment, has been customized for a payee that sells clothing. The linked RFID payer information section  includes a first clothing size input , a second clothing size input , a third clothing size input , a clothing style input , a name preference input , a service preference input , and a price range input . As discussed above, the payee that sells clothing may have registered with the payment service provider and requested that the payer be provided with the first clothing size input , the second clothing size input , the third clothing size input , the clothing style input , the name preference input , the service preference input , and the price range input . Thus, the payer may provide information such as a shirt size (in the first clothing size input ,) a pants size (in the second clothing size input ,), a shoe size (in the third clothing size input ,) a clothing style that the payer prefers (in the clothing style input ,) a name that the payer prefers to be addressed as (in the name preference input ,) an indication of when or how often employees of the payee should approach the payer (in the service preference input ,) and an amount that the payer typically spends (in the price range input .) The information provided by the payer may then be associated by the payment service provider with the linked RFID identifier in the database.","Furthermore, the inputs , , , , , , and , rather than being input by the payer, may be populated by the payee and\/or the payment service provider. In an embodiment, past transactions conducted using an account associated with the linked RFID identifier (and\/or other accounts funding sources associated with the payer account) may be used to determine the appropriate information to provide in the inputs , , , , , , and . For example, past transactions may indicate a payers clothing sizes, clothing style, price range, etc.","Referring now to , in another embodiment, in response to the payer selecting the modify information preferences links in one of the linked RFID sections  on the payer account webpage , the payer may be presented with a linked RFID payer information section  that, in the illustrated embodiment, is customized for a payee that sells coffee and food. The linked RFID payer information section  includes a first drink input with an associated drink modifier input and a drink time input , a second drink input with an associated drink time input , a food input with an associated food time input , and a name preference input . As discussed above, the payee that sells coffee and food may have registered with the payment service provider and requested that the payer be provided with the first drink input with the associated drink modifier input and the drink time input , the second drink input with the associated drink time input , the food input with the associated food time input , and the name preference input . Thus, the payer may provide information such as a preferred drink (in the first drink input ) with an instruction to leave room for a drink additive (in the associated drink modifier input ) and a time when that drink should be provided (in the drink time input ,) a preferred drink (in the second drink input ) with a time that drink should be provided (in the drink time input ,) a preferred food (in the food input ) with a time that food should be provided (in the associated food time input ,) and a name the payer prefers to be addressed as (in the name preference input .) The information provided by the payer may then be associated by the payment service provider with the linked RFID identifier in the database.","Furthermore, the inputs , , , , , , , and , rather than being input by the payer, may be populated by the payee and\/or the payment service provider. In an embodiment, past transactions conducted using an account associated with the linked RFID identifier (and\/or other accounts funding sources associated with the payer account) may be used to determine the appropriate information to provide in the inputs , , , , , , , and . For example, past transactions may indicate a preferred drink, drink modifier, drink time, food, etc. While a plurality of examples payer information has been described as being associated with the linked RFID indicator, they are not meant to be limiting, and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other payer information may be associated with the linked RFID identifier without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The method  then proceeds to block  where an RFID identifier is received from a payee. In an embodiment, the receiving of the RFID identifier in block  of the method  may be substantially similar to the receiving of the RFID identifier with the payment request described with reference to block  of the method , with the exception that the RFID identifier may be sent without a payment request. For example, the payer may provide an RFID device to a payee device upon entering or while located at an establishment of the payee to transmit the RFID identifier associated with that RFID device to a payee device. The payment service provider may then receive the RFID identifier and optionally payee information from the payee device over a network.","The method  then proceeds to block  where the payee is provided with payer information. In response to receiving the RFID identifier, the payment service provider may access a database and determine whether any payer information is associated with that RFID identifier. For example, the payer may posses a single RFID device that was previously provided to the payer by the payee, and upon receipt of the RFID identifier, the payment service provider device may access a database to determine if that RFID identifier includes associated payer information and, if so, provide that payer information to a payee device over the network. In another example, the payer may possess a plurality of linked RFID devices and a master RFID device, discussed above, and upon receiving the master RFID identifier, the payment service provider device may access a database and use payee information to determine if any of the linked RFID identifiers are associated with the payee information. If one of the linked RFID identifiers is associated with the payee information, the payment service provider device determines if payer information is associated with that linked RFID identifier and provides that payer information to the payee device.","Thus, a system and method are provided that allow a payer to use an RFID device to transmit payer information to a payee. A plurality of RFID identifiers may be associated with a single RFID identifier such that a payer need only carry one RFID device to be able to transmit a plurality of different payer information, each specific to a particular payee, to a plurality of different payees. The payee may use the payer information to help complete a transaction with the payer.","While the method  that allows a payer to use an RFID device to make a purchase while determining the funding source for that purchase automatically based on a purchase type and a purchase amount, and the method  for transmitting payer information to a payee have been presented separately above, one of skill in the art will recognize that these methods may be combined to provide functionality that will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, a payer may provide for a particular payee a plurality of purchase types that include associated payer information and spending gate definitions. For example, using the techniques discussed above, a payer may instruct a payee to, upon being transmitted an RFID identifier associated with that payer, provide a double espresso coffee drink if the day of the week is Monday through Friday and a triple mocha coffee drink if the day of the week is Saturday or Sunday. Furthermore, with the same RFID identifier, the payer may instruct the payment service provider to use a checking account to pay for the purchase if the purchase includes just a coffee drink, to use a credit account if the purchase includes food, and to use a savings account if the purchase is over $75.","Furthermore, the payment service provider may use payment histories of a payer to automatically associate preferences and\/or spending gates with a payer account. For example, the payment service provider may determine, using payment histories of the payer, that payments of certain amounts are made using particular accounts, payments to certain payees are made using particular accounts, payments for certain purchases are made using particular accounts, etc., and the payment service provider may then associate those accounts with those types of payments automatically. Thus, a plurality of spending gates and\/or preferences may be automatically created for a payer accounts as described above. In an embodiment, automatically-created spending gates and\/or preferences may be created as a default for a payer account and may, for example, be associated with RFID tags that have not had spending gates and\/or preferences associated with them.","In another embodiment, preferences may be associated with different accounts. For example, the payer may associate preferences (e.g., food or drink preferences, clothing preferences, etc.,) with a particular credit card, and the use of that credit card with a payee may provide those preferences to the payee. Thus, a payer may provide credit card information to a payer (e.g., by \u2018swiping\u2019 the credit card,) and that credit card information may provide the purchase details the payer wishes to make (e.g., a food order) as well as payment information for that purchase.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a networked system  used in the payment system is illustrated. The networked system  includes a payer device , a plurality of payee devices , a plurality of account provider devices , and a payment service provider device  in communication over a network . The payer device  may be any device used to access the payer account websites  and  and\/or provide the payment service provider device  with information about RFID identifiers, purchase types, and spending gate definitions, discussed above. The payee devices  may be any device used to receive RFID identifier transmissions and send those transmissions to the payment service provider device . The account provider devices  may be any device used to receive a payment from the payment service provider device . The payment service provider device  may include devices to provide the payer account websites  and , discussed above, make a payment to a payee of the payer, or access an account provider to be reimbursed for a payment made, and may be a device operated by payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal Inc. of San Jose, Calif.","The payer device , payee devices , account provider devices , and payment service provider device  (discussed in further detail below) may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein. For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and\/or external to various components of the system , and\/or accessible over the network .","The network  may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network  may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of networks.","The payer device  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over network . For example, in one embodiment, the payer device  may be implemented as a personal computer of a payer in communication with the Internet. In other embodiments, the payer device  may be a smart phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, and\/or other types of computing devices.","The payer device  may include one or more browser applications which may be used, for example, to provide a convenient interface to permit the payer to browse information available over the network . For example, in one embodiment, the browser application may be implemented as a web browser configured to view information available over the Internet.","The payer device  may also include one or more toolbar applications which may be used, for example, to provide payer-side processing for performing desired tasks in response to operations selected by the payer. In one embodiment, the toolbar application may display a user interface in connection with the browser application.","The payer device  may further include other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to the payer device . In particular, the other applications may include a payment application for payments through the payment service provider device . The other applications may also include security applications for implementing user-side security features, programmatic user applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network , or other types of applications. Email and\/or text applications may also be included, which allow the payer to send and receive emails and\/or text messages through the network . The payer device  includes one or more user and\/or device identifiers which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the browser application, identifiers associated with hardware of the payer device , or other appropriate identifiers, such as a phone number. In one embodiment, the user identifier may be used by the payment service provider device  to associate the payer with a particular account maintained by the payment service provider device  as further described herein.","The account provider device  may be maintained, for example, by an account provider that provides one or more of the funding sources for the payer account, discussed above. In this regard, the account provider device  may include a database identifying funding sources and respective funding source information for the payer account.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a computer system  suitable for implementing, for example, the payer device , the payee devices , the account provider devices , and\/or the payment service provider device , is illustrated. In various implementations, the device(s) may comprise a computing device (e.g., a computer, laptop, smart phone, PDA, etc.) capable of communicating with the network . It should be appreciated that other devices utilized by payers, account providers, and payment service providers in the payment system may be implemented as the computer system  in a manner as follows.","In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, computer system , such as a computer and\/or a network server, includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as a processing component  (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), a system memory component  (e.g., RAM), a static storage component  (e.g., ROM), a disk drive component  (e.g., magnetic or optical), a network interface component  (e.g., modem or Ethernet card), a display component  (e.g., CRT or LCD), an input component  (e.g., keyboard, keypad, or virtual keyboard), and\/or a cursor control component  (e.g., mouse, pointer, or trackball).
