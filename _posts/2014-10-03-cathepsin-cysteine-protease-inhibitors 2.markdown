humans and other mammals involve or are associated with abnormal bone resorption. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, osteoporosis, glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, Paget's disease, abnormally increased bone turnover, periodontal disease, tooth loss, bone fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteogenesis imperfecta, hypercalcemia of malignancy or multiple myeloma. One of the most common of these disorders is osteoporosis, which in its most frequent manifestation occurs in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by a low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporotic fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. As many as 50% of women and a third of men will experience an osteoporotic fracture. A large segment of the older population already has low bone density and a high risk of fractures. There is a significant need to both prevent and treat osteoporosis and other conditions associated with bone resorption. Because osteoporosis, as well as other disorders associated with bone loss, are generally chronic conditions, it is believed that appropriate therapy will typically require chronic treatment.","Cathepsins belong to the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases. These proteases function in the normal physiological as well as pathological degradation of connective tissue. Cathepsins play a major role in intracellular protein degradation and turnover and remodeling. To date, a number of cathepsin have been identified and sequenced from a number of sources. These cathepsins are naturally found in a wide variety of tissues. For example, cathepsin B, C, F, H, L, K, O, S, V, W, and Z have been cloned. Cathepsin L is implicated in normal lysosomal proteolysis as well as several diseases states, including, but not limited to, metastasis of melanomas. Cathepsin S is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and certain autoimmune disorders, including, but not limited to juvenile onset diabetes, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythemotasus, rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis; allergic disorders, including, but not limited to asthma; and allogenic immune responses, including, but not limited to, rejection of organ transplants or tissue grafts. Increased Cathepsin B levels and redistribution of the enzyme are found in tumors, suggesting a role in tumor invasion and metastasis. In addition, aberrant Cathepsin B activity is implicated in such disease states as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, pneumocystisis carinii, acute pancreatitis, inflammatory airway disease and bone and joint disorders.","Mammalian cathepsins are related to the papain-like cysteine proteases expressed by disease-causing parasites including those from the families protozoa, platyhelminthes, nematodes and arthropodes.

It is known in the literature that progressive destruction of the periarticular bone is a major cause of joint dysfunction and disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), see Goldring S R, \u201cPathogenesis of bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis\u201d. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 406-10. Analysis of joint tissues from patients with RA have provided evidence that cathepsin K positive osteoclasts are the cell types that mediate the focal bone resorption associated with rheumatoid synovial lesion, see Hou, W-S, Li, W, Keyszer, G, Weber, E, Levy, R, Klein, M J, Gravallese, E M, Goldring, S R, Bromme, D, \u201cComparison of Cathepsin K and S expression within the Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritic Synovium\u201d, Arthritis Rheumatism 2002; 46: 663-74. In addition, generalized bone loss is a major cause of morbidity associated with severe RA. The frequency of hip and spinal fractures is substantially increased in patients with chronic RA, see Gould A, Sambrook, P, Devlin J et al, \u201cOsteoclastic activation is the principal mechanism leading to secondary osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis\u201d. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 1282-9. The utility of cathepsin K inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of resorption in subarticular bone and of generalized bone loss represent a rational approach for pharmacological intervention on the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.","Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing the progression of osteoarthritis in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above. It is known in the literature that osteoarthritis (OA) is accompanied with well-defined changes in the joints, including erosion of the articular cartilage surface, peri-articular endochondral ossification\/osteophytosis, and subchondral bony sclerosis and cyst formation, see Oettmeier R, Abendroth, K, \u201cOsteoarthritis and bone: osteologic types of osteoarthritis of the hip\u201d, Skeletal Radiol. 1989; 18: 165-74. Recently, the potential contribution of subchondral bone sclerosis to the initiation and progression of OA have been suggested. Stiffened subchondral bone as the joint responding to repetitive impulsive loading, is less able to attenuate and distribute forces through the joint, subjecting it to greater mechanical stress across the articular cartilage surface. This in turn accelerates cartilage wear and fibrillate, see Radin, E L and Rose R M, \u201cRole of subchondral bone in the initiation and progression of cartilage damage\u201d, Clin. Orthop. 1986; 213: 34-40. Inhibition of excessive subarticular bone resorption by an anti-resorptive agent such as a cathepsin K inhibitor, will lead to inhibition of subchondral bone turnover, thus may have a favorable impact on OA progression.","In addition to the above hypothesis, cathepsin K protein expression was recently identified in synovial fibroblasts, macrophage-like cells, and chondrocytes from synovium and articular cartilage specimens derived from OA patients, see Hou, W-S, Li, W, Keyszer, G, Weber, E, Levy, R, Klein, M J, Gravallese, E M, Goldring, S R, Bromme, D, \u201cComparison of Cathepsin K and S expression within the Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritic Synovium\u201d, Arthritis Rheumatism 2002; 46: 663-74; and Dodd, R A, Connor, J R, Drake, F H, Gowen, M, \u201cExpression of Cathepsin K messenger RNA in giant cells and their precursors in human osteoarthritic synovial tissues\u201d. Arthritis Rheumatism 1999; 42: 1588-93; and Konttinen, Y T, Mandelin, J, Li, T-F, Salo, J, Lassus, J et al. \u201cAcidic cysteine endoproteinase cathepsin K in the degeneration of the superficial articular hyaline cartilage in osteoarthritis\u201d, Arthritis Rheumatism 2002; 46: 953-60. These recent studies thus implicated the role of cathepsin K in the destruction of collagen type II in the articular cartilage associated with the progression of osteoarthritis. The utility of cathepsin K inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of osteoarthritis as described in this invention thus comprise of two different mechanisms, one is on the inhibition of osteoclast-driven subchondral bone turnover, and two is on the direct inhibition of collagen type II degeneration in the synovium and cartilage of patients with OA.","Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating cancer in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above.

N. Lode and coworkers in PNAS USA 96: 1591-1596 (1999) have observed synergistic effects between an antiangiogenic \u03b1 v integrin antagonist and a tumor-specific antibody-cytokine (interleukin-2) fusion protein in the eradication of spontaneous tumor metastases. Their results suggested this combination as having potential for the treatment of cancer and metastatic tumor growth. \u03b1\u03b2integrin receptor antagonists inhibit bone resorption through a new mechanism distinct from that of all currently available drugs. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The \u03b1 and \u03b2 integrin subunits interact non-covalently and bind extracellular matrix ligands in a divalent cation-dependent manner. The most abundant integrin on osteoclasts is \u03b1\u03b2(>10\/osteoclast), which appears to play a rate-limiting role in cytoskeletal organization important for cell migration and polarization. The \u03b1\u03b2antagonizing effect is selected from inhibition of bone resorption, inhibition of restenosis, inhibition of macular degeneration, inhibition of arthritis, and inhibition of cancer and metastatic growth.","\u201cAn osteoblast anabolic agent\u201d refers to agents that build bone, such as PTH. The intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or its amino-terminal fragments and analogues have been shown to prevent, arrest, partially reverse bone loss and stimulate bone formation in animals and humans. For a discussion refer to D. W. Dempster et al., \u201cAnabolic actions of parathyroid hormone on bone,\u201d Endocr Rev 14: 690-709 (1993). Studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of parathyroid hormone in stimulating bone formation and thereby increasing bone mass and strength. Results were reported by R M Neer et al., in New Eng J Med 344 1434-1441 (2001).","In addition, parathyroid hormone-related protein fragments or analogues, such as PTHrP-(1-36) have demonstrated potent anticalciuric effects [see M. A. Syed et al., \u201cParathyroid hormone-related protein-(1-36) stimulates renal tubular calcium reabsorption in normal human volunteers: implications for the pathogenesis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy,\u201d JCEM 86: 1525-1531 (2001)] and may also have potential as anabolic agents for treating osteoporosis.","\u201cVitamin D\u201d includes, but is not limited to, vitamin D(cholecalciferol) and vitamin D(ergocalciferol), which are naturally occurring, biologically inactive precursors of the hydroxylated biologically active metabolites of vitamin D: 1\u03b1-hydroxy vitamin D; 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. Vitamin Dand vitamin Dhave the same biological efficacy in humans. When either vitamin Dor Denters the circulation, it is hydroxylated by cytochrome P-vitamin D-25-hydroxylase to give 25-hydroxy vitamin D. The 25-hydroxy vitamin D metabolite is biologically inert and is further hydroxylated in the kidney by cytochrome P450-monooxygenase, 25 (OH) D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase to give 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. When serum calcium decreases, there is an increase in the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium homeostasis and increases plasma calcium levels by increasing the conversion of 25-hydroxy vitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.","1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D is thought to be responsible for the effects of vitamin D on calcium and bone metabolism. The 1,25-dihydroxy metabolite is the active hormone required to maintain calcium absorption and skeletal integrity. Calcium homeostasis is maintained by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D by inducing monocytic stem cells to differentiate into osteoclasts and by maintaining calcium in the normal range, which results in bone mineralization by the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite onto the bone surface, see Holick, M F, Vitamin D photobiology, metabolism, and clinical applications, In: DeGroot L, Besser H, Burger H G, et al., eds. 3ed., 990-1013 (1995). However, elevated levels of 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy vitamin Dcan result in an increase of calcium concentration in the blood and in the abnormal control of calcium concentration by bone metabolism, resulting in hypercalcemia. 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy vitamin Dalso indirectly regulates osteoclastic activity in bone metabolism and elevated levels may be expected to increase excessive bone resorption in osteoporosis.","\u201cSynthetic vitamin D analogues\u201d includes non-naturally occurring compounds that act like vitamin D.","\u201cNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u201d or NSAIDs, inhibit the metabolism of arachidonic acid to proinflammatory prostaglandins via cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2.

The solutions may be introduced into a patient's bloodstream by local bolus injection.","When a compound according to this invention is administered into a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient's symptoms.","In one exemplary application, a suitable amount of compound is administered to a mammal undergoing treatment for a cathepsin dependent condition. Oral dosages of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 mg per kg of body weight per day (mg\/kg\/day) to about 100 mg\/kg\/day, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg\/day, and most preferably 0.1 to 5.0 mg\/kg\/day.

Furthermore, preferred compounds for the present invention may be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.","The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other agents useful for treating cathepsin-mediated conditions. The individual components of such combinations can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term \u201cadministering\u201d is to be interpreted accordingly. It will be understood that the scope of combinations of the compounds of this invention with other agents useful for treating cathepsin-mediated conditions includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical composition useful for treating disorders related to estrogen functioning.","The scope of the invention therefore encompasses the use of a compound of Formula I in combination with a second agent selected from: an organic bisphosphonate; a selective estrogen receptor modulator; an androgen receptor modulator; an inhibitor of osteoclast proton ATPase; an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase; an integrin receptor antagonist; an osteoblast anabolic agent, such as PTH; Vitamin D; a synthetic Vitamin D analogue; a Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor; an inhibitor of interleukin-1 beta; a LOX\/COX inhibitor and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and mixtures thereof.","These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the teachings contained herein.","Definitions","The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. Unless a specific stereochemistry is indicated, the present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.","The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.","If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.","Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.","In the compounds of Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of generic Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within generic Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates.","Tautomers of compounds defined in Formula I are also included within the scope of the present invention. For example, compounds including carbonyl \u2014CHC(O)\u2014 groups (keto forms) may undergo tautomerism to form hydroxyl \u2014CH\u2550C(OH)\u2014 groups (enol forms). Both keto and enol forms are included within the scope of the present invention.","When any variable (e.g. R, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents represent that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms. If the ring system is bicyclic, it is intended that the bond be attached to any of the suitable atoms on either ring of the bicyclic moiety.","It is understood that one or more silicon (Si) atoms can be incorporated into the compounds of the instant invention in place of one or more carbon atoms by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art from readily available starting materials. Carbon and silicon differ in their covalent radius leading to differences in bond distance and the steric arrangement when comparing analogous C-element and Si-element bonds. These differences lead to subtle changes in the size and shape of silicon-containing compounds when compared to carbon. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that size and shape differences can lead to subtle or dramatic changes in potency, solubility, lack of off-target activity, packaging properties, and so on.

If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase \u201coptionally substituted with one or more substituents\u201d should be understood as meaning that the group in question is either unsubstituted or may be substituted with one or more substituents.","As used herein, \u201calkyl\u201d is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having one to ten carbon atoms unless otherwise specified.
