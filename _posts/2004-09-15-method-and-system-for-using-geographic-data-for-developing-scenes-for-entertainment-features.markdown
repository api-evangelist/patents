No. 10\/798,459, \u201cAPPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE FOR GEOGRAPHIC DATA IN COMPUTER GAMES\u201d, Ser. No. 10\/798,531, \u201cGEOGRAPHIC AREA TEMPLATES FOR COMPUTER GAMES\u201d, Ser. No. 10\/798,632, and \u201cCOMPUTER GAME DEVELOPMENT FACTORY SYSTEM AND METHOD\u201d, Ser. No. 10\/798,703, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to a system and method that facilitate development of entertainment features, such as motion pictures and television shows. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method that use geographic data to facilitate development of scenes for entertainment features that depict actual, real world geographic areas or fictional geographic areas, including the road networks in the geographic areas.","Some motion pictures and television shows (i.e., entertainment features) are produced that include scenes created using computer graphics (CG). These motion pictures or television shows may include both CG-created scenes and live action scenes or alternatively, some motion pictures or television shows may be produced entirely of CG-created scenes. In some cases, CG created scenes are used as a background with live actors or props superimposed over the background. In other cases, the images of the actors themselves may be created using CG.","One of the advantages of using CG to create scenes for motion pictures or television shows is the ability to depict things that would be difficult or impossible to show otherwise. Another advantage of using CG to create scenes for motion pictures or television shows is that it may be less expensive than filming the scene live on location. For example, filming on location may require significant expenses for travel for the actors and film crew, obtaining the necessary permits, cordoning off the area, hiring stunt performers, hiring security, catering, and other logistical expenses. In addition, filming on location may be delayed due to weather, traffic or other reasons, resulting in additional expenses.","Although using CG to create scenes for use in motion pictures or television shows has advantages, there are considerations to be addressed. One consideration relates to making the scenes look realistic. Making scenes look realistic may require the collection and processing of large amounts of data. The collection and processing of such large amounts of data may be expensive and time consuming, thereby offsetting the benefits of using CG to create scenes of physical places for use in motion pictures or television shows.","Accordingly, it is an objective to facilitate using CG to make scenes for entertainment features, such as motion pictures or television shows, that depict actual or imaginary physical places.","To address these and other objectives, the present invention includes a system and method for facilitating development of scenes for entertainment features, such as motion pictures or television shows, that depict actual, real world or imaginary geographic areas. A source database contains data that represent geographic features in a region including roads in the region. The data in the source database includes attributes suitable for use for providing navigation-related functions. In addition to providing data from the source database for navigation-related functions, data from the source database are also provided for facilitating development of scenes for entertainment features that depict actual, real world or imaginary geographic areas. An application programming interface, as well as other tools for handling geographic data, is provided for accessing and processing of the geographic data.","The embodiments disclosed herein relate to developing scenes for entertainment features, such as motion pictures or television shows, that are created using computer graphics (CG) and that depict real or imaginary geographic locales. For example, a scene may depict a car chase through the streets of Miami, Fla., an aircraft flight over Texas, and so on. In the embodiments disclosed herein, the CG-created scenes are produced using geographic data and appropriate rendering software. The geographic data is obtained from a map data developer. In these embodiments, the map data developer collects, confirms, updates, processes and distributes geographic data for other, non-entertainment related purposes, such as navigation.","Referring to , a master or source version of a geographic database  is owned and developed by a geographic database developer  (also referred to as a \u201cmap developer\u201d, a \u201cmap data developer\u201d or the like). (Although only one source database and geographic database developer are shown, the embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to only a single source database or a single geographic database developer.) The master version of the geographic database  contains data  (also referred to a \u201cgeographic data\u201d or \u201cspatial data\u201d) that represent geographic features in a coverage area . The coverage area  may correspond to an entire country, such as the United States. Alternatively, the coverage area  may correspond to several countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Mexico, or France, Germany, and Italy, and so on. According to another alternative, the coverage area  of the master version of the geographic database  may represent only a single region within a country, such as the West Coast or the Midwest of the U.S. Although the master version of the geographic database  includes data that represent geographic features in the entire coverage area , there may be parts of the coverage area  that contain geographic features that are not represented by data in the geographic database, or for which the representation of geographic features is sparse.","The master version of the geographic database  includes data about a road network  located in the coverage area . The data about the road network  include various kinds of information, such as the geographic coordinates of positions of the roads, street names of the roads, address ranges along the roads, turn restrictions at intersections of roads, and so on. The master version of the geographic database  also includes data about points of interest in the covered area . Points of interest may include hotels, restaurants, museums, stadiums, offices, automobile dealerships, auto repair shops, etc. The master version of the geographic database  may include data about the locations of these points of interests. The master version of the geographic database  may also include data about places, such as cities, towns, or other communities, and other geographic features, such as bodies of water, mountain ranges, etc. The master version of the geographic database  may include other kinds of information.","There are different ways used by the geographic database developer to collect data. These ways include obtaining data from other sources, such as municipalities. In addition, the geographic database developer may employ field personnel to travel by vehicle along roads throughout the geographic region to observe features and record information about them. The data collected by the geographic database developer are stored in the master version of the geographic database .","The geographic database developer  continues to collect data that represent the features in the geographic coverage area  on an ongoing basis. One reason that the geographic database developer continues to collect data is that the features in the coverage area  change over time. Accordingly, the geographic database developer collects data about the same features in order to update or confirm the previously collected data about the features. Another reason that the geographic database developer continues to collect data is to expand the coverage and\/or detail of the master version of the geographic database . For example, at one point in time the master version of the geographic database  may include data that represents only a portion of the entire coverage area . After that point in time, the geographic database developer collects data about features in areas that were not previously represented in order to expand the coverage of the master version of the geographic database .","The master version of the geographic database  is maintained as the copy that has the most up-to-date data relating to the coverage area . Accordingly, the master version of the geographic database  is updated, expanded, and\/or otherwise modified on a regular and continuing basis. To facilitate these operations, the master version of the geographic database  is stored in a format that facilitates updating, maintenance, and development. For example, the data in the master version  may be uncompressed. Examples of suitable formats include the VSAM format and the GDF format, although other kinds of formats, both proprietary and non-proprietary, may be suitable. In general, the format of the master database  is not suitable for use in navigation systems.","A copy of the master version of the geographic database  is physically located at a first location . In one embodiment, the master version of the geographic database  is stored on one or more hard drives, tapes or other media, and accessed with an appropriate computer . Any suitable computer may be used, such as a mainframe computer, a plurality of networked microcomputers, etc.","A. First Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","110","110","111"]},"The compiled database products  may include only portions of all the data in the master version of the geographic database . For example, the compiled database products  may include data that relate to only one or more specific sub-areas within the coverage area  of the master version of the geographic database . Further, the compiled database products  may include fewer than all the data attributes that describe geographic features represented in the master version of the geographic database .","The compiled database products  are used on various kinds of computing platforms. For example, the compiled database products  are used in computing platforms  used for navigation. The computing platforms  used for navigation include in-vehicle navigation systems, hand-held portable navigation systems, personal computers (including desktop and notebook computers), and other kinds of devices, such as personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, pagers, telephones, etc. The compiled database products  are also used on networked computing platforms and environments, including systems connected to the Internet.","The compiled database products  that are used in computing platforms used for navigation are stored on suitable media. For example, the complied database products may be stored on CD-ROM disks, hard drives, DVD disks, flash memory, or other types of media that are available now or that become available in the future.","On the computing platforms  used for navigation, the compiled database products  are used by various software applications. For example, the compiled database products  may be used by software applications that provide navigation-related functions, such as route calculation, route guidance, vehicle positioning, map display, and electronic yellow pages, as well as other kinds of functions.","In addition to producing compiled database products for use on computing platforms used for navigation, the geographic database developer  produces one or more compiled database products  for use by an entertainment feature producer or developer . The compiled database product  used by the entertainment feature developer  may be the same as or similar to the compiled database products  used in the computing platforms  used for navigation. The compiled database product  used by the entertainment feature developer  may be provided on a suitable media, such as one or more CD-ROM disks, DVD disks, or hard drives. Alternatively, the compiled database product  used by the entertainment feature developer  may be provided over a network connection.","The entertainment feature developer  uses some or all the data from the compiled geographic database , along with other data and components (as explained below), to create scenes  for entertainment features , such as motion pictures or television shows. The scenes for entertainment features  created using the data from the geographic database  visually depict geographic features located in some or all the coverage area of the geographic database , and may include some or all the road network represented by the geographic database .","Referring to , the entertainment feature developer  uses a tool set . In one embodiment, the tool set  includes a geographic data API (application programming interface)  and geographic data tools  to access and use data contained in the compiled geographic database . The tool set  includes software applications written in an appropriate computer programming language and stored on a computer-readable medium. The applications in the tool set  are read from the medium, loaded into a memory of a suitable computer platform, and run as needed to perform their respective functions. In one embodiment, the geographic database API  and data tools  are similar or identical to the interface layer and related navigation applications described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,974,419, 5,953,722, 5,968,109 and 6,047,280, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. In general, the geographic data API  provides a library of functions that facilitate accessing the data contained in the compiled geographic database .","The geographic data API  and data tools  provide various ways that the data in the geographic database  can be accessed. Some of these ways the geographic data API  and data tools  provide for accessing the geographic database  include the following:","1. Spatial","Referring to , among the functions provided by geographic data API  and data tools  is a spatial search function . The spatial search function  supports spatial queries. Spatial queries return data records of a specified type (e.g., data that represent road segments) based on location criteria included in the query. For example, a spatial query may request all the data records that represent road segments that are within 5 km of a given latitude and longitude. Another spatial query may request all the data records that represent restaurants that are within a rectangular area having specified geographic boundaries. The spatial search function  returns all the data records that meet these criteria.","2. Extraction (Slicing)","The geographic API  and data tools  provide an extraction function . The extraction function  supports extraction of slices of data from the geographic database . The entertainment feature developer  may want to make a scene that provides for representation of only a portion of the coverage area of the geographic database . As an example, the geographic database  may have a coverage area of Florida (i.e., includes data that represents the entire state of Florida); however, the entertainment feature developer  wants to create scenes showing a drive along only the streets of Miami. Using the extraction function , the entertainment feature developer  can extract from the geographic database  the data that represents only the city of Miami.","3. Filter","The data in the geographic database  may be provided with a high level of detail and\/or accuracy. For example, the data in the geographic database  may represent the locations of roads in a geographic region with a level accuracy of \u00b15 meters. This high level of detail is appropriate for navigation-related functions, such as vehicle positioning. However, providing a high level of detail requires a relatively large amount of data. For some motion picture or television show scenes, a high level of detail may be unnecessary. Reducing the level of detail and\/or accuracy reduces the amount of data needed to represent a geographic area. Furthermore, reducing the level of detail and\/or accuracy may also facilitate processing of the data.","Accordingly, another function provided by the geographic API  and tools  is a filter function . The filter function  filters the geographic data obtained from the geographic database . The filter function  selectively eliminates portions of the geographic data obtained from the geographic database , while maintaining a given coverage area. According to one embodiment, the filter function  eliminates some of the data used to represent the shape of road segments (e.g., shape point data). The shape data are thinned out so that the entire road is still represented, but not necessarily with the same level of accuracy. For example, instead of representing a road with a level of accuracy of \u00b15 meters, the filter function  deletes shape point data so that the road is represented with a level of accuracy of \u00b125 meters. This reduction in accuracy results in a corresponding decrease in the amount of data needed to represent a geographic area. In another embodiment, the filter function  can be operated to eliminate entire classes of roads, such as all side streets.","Using the filter function , the entertainment feature developer can obtain data from the geographic database that suitably represents a geographic area, without having more data than is needed to represent a geographic area with the desired level of detail and\/or accuracy for purposes of the scenes for the motion picture or television show.","4. 3D Conversion","The geographic API  and data tools  also include a 3D conversion function . The 3D conversion function  supports conversion of the data obtained the geographic database  so that it can be displayed as a 3D (perspective view) image. The 3D image may represent the geographic area in the scene from various points of view, as determined by the entertainment feature developer. The view may be an overhead view. (This 3D function may be incorporated here in the geographic API  and data tools  or may be incorporated into another application such as the composing and rendering application , described below.)","5. Transformation","The geographic API  and data tools  also include a transformation function . The transformation function  converts the data obtained the geographic database  into a different format. The different format may be one that is suitable for use by the composing and rendering application . For example, the data may be transformed so that it is more suitable for 3D display. As another example, the data may be transformed so that it can be rendered quickly, i.e., to simulate a vehicle moving at high speed.","6. Integration","The geographic API  and data tools  include an integration function . The integration function  provides for associating data obtained from the geographic database  with other, new types of data. Among the new types of data that are associated with the geographic data are road models and 3D models. The road models and 3D models are stored in a road model database  and a 3D model database , respectively.","The data in the road model database  are representations used for visual appearance and rendering of road-related things, such as road pavement, lane stripes, curbs, sidewalks, signs, lampposts, lane dividers, traffic signals, speed bumps, crosswalks, and so on. These road model representations are associated with data representation of the road network obtained from the geographic database . As stated above, the data in the geographic database  is (or is derived from) a representation of a road network used for navigation. As such, the data in the geographic database  may not indicate what roads, or things associated with a road, look like. For example, in the geographic database , a data representation of a road for navigation purposes may indicate the locations (e.g., geographic coordinates) of intersections, and possibly the locations of points along a road segment between intersections, the legal (and illegal) connections between roads, the names of roads, the addresses ranges along roads, the type of road surface, and so on. However, in the database  a data representation of a road for navigation purposes may not contain information that indicates the actual visual shapes, colors, dimensions, etc., of these road-related things. For example, in the database  a data representation of a road for navigation purposes may not indicate the colors of a road, curbs, sidewalks, what a sign looks like, and so on. The road model database  includes these types of information.","The integration function  provides for associating data in the road model database  with data from the geographic database  that represents the road network. The integration function  may associate road model data with specific locations along a road segment (as represented by data from the geographic database ) or with lengths along a road segment. As an example, the integration function  may provide for showing curbs (using a model for what a curb looks like from the road model database ) along all side streets (represented by data from the geographic database ). In another example, the integration function  may provide for showing barriers along all the sides of expressways (using a model for barriers from the road model database ) as represented by data from the geographic database . The integration function  may also provide for associating data models for traffic signals at intersections.","The road related things in the road models database may include any kind of spatial data, including random things, such as graffiti.","The data representations of road-related things in the road models database are also used for providing other properties of the represented things, such as the physical and audio properties. For example, causing a simulated vehicle to move over a simulated curb causes the simulated vehicle to \u201cbump.\u201d Similarly, a simulated vehicle \u201chitting\u201d a simulated lamppost causes a simulated crashing sound.","The road model database  may include a variety of different data models for some types of road-related things. For example, there may be a number of different types of traffic signal configurations. These different types of traffic signal configurations are used to provide variety and to make the representation of the road network appear more realistic, i.e., so that all the traffic signal configurations do not look the same.","The entertainment feature developer uses the integration function  to combine data from the road model database  with data from the geographic database  to provide a realistic appearing and acting road network. The road model database  is not intended to represent the actual road-related things, such as the exact locations of signs, the exact text on signs, the exact configuration of traffic signals, etc. Neither the geographic database  nor the road model database may contain information that represents the actual location of signs or the exact configuration of traffic signals. However, the road model database  provides data for visually representing these road-related things in a manner that would be typical for the geographic area. So, for a residential neighborhood, the road model database would include models for sidewalks, cross walks, stop signs, etc., which would be associated with appropriate locations along the road network as defined by the geographic database . The integration function  and the road model database  provide for both the density (how many signs per mile or how many lampposts per block) and the style (shape, height, sign text wording) of these road related things.","As mentioned above, the integration function  associates data from the 3D model database  with the road network represented by the geographic database . The 3D model data in the 3D model database  includes representations used for visual appearance and rendering of cityscape- and landscape-related things, such as buildings fences, trees, shrubbery, lawns, fences, clouds, scenery, and so on. Like the road models, these 3D model representations are associated with locations along the road network data as represented by data from the geographic database .","The cityscape and landscape related things in the 3D models database may include any kind of spatial data, including random things, such as graffiti.","The data representations of cityscape and landscape-related things in the 3D models database are also used for providing the other properties (e.g., physical and audio) of the represented things. For example, causing a simulated vehicle to strike a simulated building causes the simulated vehicle to stop and make a crashing sound. As another example, a simulated vehicle can drive over a simulated shrub, but not a simulated tree.","After the entertainment feature developer  has used the API  and geographic data tools  to extract, transform, filter, and integrate the data from the database  with the data from the road model database  and 3D model database , as appropriate, a data product  representing a geographic area and suitable for use in the composing and rendering application  is formed. The entertainment feature developer  uses the composing and rendering application  to create scenes . In the composing and rendering application , data from the data product  is combined with other entertainment feature-related components and inputs  to create scenes . Among the other entertainment feature-related components and inputs  are data and programs that provide and\/or represent characters, logic, vehicles, and so on. Creation of visual scenes from these types of data is known to those of skill in the art. The scenes  produced by the composing and rendering application  are used in an entertainment feature production process  to make entertainment features , such as movies and television shows.","B. Second Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["130","100","118","100","100","130","200","200","140","100","200"]},"A. First Template Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIGS. 2 and 4"],"b":["100","111","110"]},"For some motion pictures or television shows, the entertainment feature developer may want to include CG scenes that do not depict an actual geographic locale. Instead, the entertainment feature developer may want to include scenes that depict a locale which is similar to an actual geographic locale, or which is totally different from any real locales. Therefore, the geographic database developer  produces one or more geographic template products  for use by the entertainment feature developer . In this embodiment, the geographic template products  are produced by the geographic database developer  using a template compiler program , described below. The geographic template products  may be similar to the compiled database products  or the compiled database products  that represent actual places, except that the geographic template products  do not represent actual, real world places. The geographic template products  may be provided on a suitable media, such as one or more CD-ROM disks, DVD disks, or hard drives. Alternatively, the geographic template products  may be provided over a network connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["208","204","202","208","101"]},"The imaginary geographic locale represented by the geographic template product may be similar to one or more actual locales. For example, the imaginary locale may be a typical southern California city. The imaginary geographic locale may also be a fantasy locale. The imaginary geographic locale may also be an actual locale but set at a different historical period (past or future) than the present.","In a first step of the process , one or more geographic locales are selected (Step ). In this step, the locales may include metropolitan areas, such as a southern California metropolitan area like the Los Angeles metropolitan area or the San Diego metropolitan area. Alternatively, the locales may include metropolitan areas, such as Midwestern metropolitan areas like the Chicago metropolitan area and the Detroit metropolitan area. These locales may be selected manually, e.g., by a human operator selecting the areas. Alternatively, the locales may be selected automatically using a computer program that automatically uses the data in the master geographic database  to select locales within a selected region that have similar geographic characteristics like road density. For example, if an operator selects a region, e.g., southern California, a program automatically identifies major urban areas in the region.","Once the geographic locales have been selected, data that represent the locales are obtained from the geographic database  (Step ). In one embodiment, all the data in the master geographic database  that represent the selected locales are obtained. Alternatively, only some of the data in the master geographic database  that represent the selected locales are obtained. For example, only selected attributes that represent the locales may be obtained.","After the data that represents the selected locales has been obtained, certain parameters of the geographic locales are determined (Step ). These parameters characterize the locales. These parameters are obtained by comparison of the corresponding data from the different locales. (If only a single locale is selected in Step , the parameters are determined from data that represents only the single locale.)","Examples of the types of parameters that are determined include the following:","Overall size. For example, one parameter that is determined indicates the average overall size of the locales. This parameter may be determined by calculating the average of the overall areas of the locales for which data have been obtained.","Road density (by type). Another parameter is a road density distribution. Some geographic locales have large (in area) sections with densely-spaced streets.","Road shape. Another parameter is a road shape. Some geographic locales tend to have road with lots of curves, whereas other locales tend to roads that are relatively straight.","Road widths. Another parameter indicates the different types of road widths and the percentage of each type.","Expressway density. Some geographic locales have a relatively large number of expressways.","Road orientation. Some locales tend to have roads all aligned in a north-south, east-west grid pattern.","Road alignment. Some locales tend to have a lot of roads that do not meet at right angles.","Altitude variety. Some locales tend to have many altitude changes, e.g., lots of hills.","Geographic features. These parameters indicate the types, sizes, shapes, number of geographic features, such as lakes, rivers, mountains, etc.","Open spaces. This parameter indicates the type, number, size, density, etc., of open spaces in a locale. These may include parks, golf courses, etc.","POIs. This parameter indicates the types, density, number, etc., of the points of interest in the locales. These points of interest include businesses, government buildings, monuments, stadiums, airports, etc.","Buildings. This parameter indicates the types, sizes, shapes, etc., of the buildings located in a locale.","Signage. This parameter indicates the types of signs, the text on different signs, sign shape, sign layout, the density and placement of signs, etc.","There may be other parameters that are determined in addition to these. A parameter can be determined for any type of data contained in the geographic database .","Once the parameters have been determined for the locales in the selected region, a template  is formed (Step ). The template has a structure similar to a geographic database that represents an actual region. However, the template does not represent an actual locale. Instead, the template is based on the parameters so that its characteristics are similar to those of all the locales in the selected region. For example, if the selected region is southern California, and the selected locales include Los Angeles and San Diego, a parameter for expressway density would indicate relatively many expressways per square mile. A template formed for this region would have an expressway density that corresponds to this parameter.","One way to form the template database is to start with one of the actual databases and transform the data. For example, starting with a database that represents Los Angeles, each data entity representing a road segment (or groups of data entities representing groups of road segments) would be modified to alter the location of the represented road segment. Some techniques that may be employed to form the template database from the actual database include moving the locations of roads by varying distances, switching the relative vertical ordering of roads that cross each other at different elevations, forming mirror images of roads located in an area, performing horizontal or rotational transformations of the location of groups of roads, and so on. Quality assurance testing would be used to insure that the modification maintained database integrity, including connectivity of the modified road network.","A similar process would be used for data that represented other kinds of represented features, such as points of interest, geographic features, such as lakes, rivers, etc., buildings, and so on.","In one embodiment, sponsored points of interest (or other features) are included in the template. According to this aspect of this embodiment, a company wishing to advertise its products or services contracts with the map developer to sponsor features to be included in the template. For example, a company may advertise its products or services by having its stores or outlets included as points of interest or locations in the template. As an example, a restaurant chain may have restaurant locations in the template. (Since the template does not depict an actual geographic location, these are not actual restaurant locations.) In addition to stores or outlet locations, companies may also sponsor other types of features that are included in the template, such as signs (e.g., advertising billboards) or vehicles (e.g., trucks) with company names on their sides.","Once this information has been prepared and stored in the template geographic database, names are determined for the represented geographic features (Step ). In determining street names, a thesaurus function may be used to obtain similar names that correspond to real world names. For example, if streets in the real world database are named \u201cOak\u201d and \u201cPine\u201d, the template database may include corresponding streets named \u201cElm\u201d and \u201cPoplar.\u201d","After the name information is added to the template , other compilation steps may be performed on the template  (Step ). These other compilation steps may be similar to the steps performed on the geographic database products  used for navigation purposes.","Referring again to , the template  is provided to the entertainment feature developer . The template  is used by the entertainment feature developer  in a similar manner as an actual geographic database would be used, as explained above. The entertainment feature developer  uses the data in the template , along with other data and components, to create CG scenes for a motion picture or television show .","In creating scenes for a motion picture or television show, the entertainment feature developer  may include some or all the data from the template . Alternatively, the scenes for a motion picture or television show may include data derived from or based on data from the template .","The scenes  created using the data from the template  provide for representing geographic features. However, the geographic features depicted in the scenes are not actual, real world geographic features, but are similar to the kinds of actual features that a person would find in a typical locale in a given geographic region. These depicted features include a road network, which is similar to the kind of road network a person would find in a typical locale in the given geographic region. This simulated road network in the template can be provided with the same level of accuracy and detail as a real road network.","Road model data and 3D model data, described above, may be added to the geographic template by the entertainment feature developer or by the geographic database developer. Adding road model data and 3D model data may be done in a similar manner as described above in connection with the embodiments that use geographic data that represents actual places.","As in the previously described embodiments, the scenes  are used in an entertainment feature production process  to produce entertainment features , such as movies or television shows.","B. Alternative Template Embodiments","In the embodiments disclosed above, it was described how template geographic databases could be developed so that the imaginary places represented by the template geographic databases resembled or possessed the style of types of actual, real world places, such as a southern Californian city. In alternative embodiments, template geographic databases can be developed that represent other types of imaginary places, such as fantasy places or historical (past or future) actual places. For example, using an embodiment disclosed herein, a template geographic database can be developed that represents New York City in the 1930's.","In the embodiments disclosed above, it was described how a template that represents an imaginary locale for use in entertainment features could be derived from data that represents actual geographic places and which is used for other functions, such as navigation. In an alternative embodiment, a template for use in entertainment features may be derived from data collected specifically for the purpose of use in motion pictures or television shows. According to this embodiment, the template could represent an actual or an imaginary locale and would be sold or licensed to entertainment feature developers for use in creating CG scenes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIGS. 2","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["4","5","100","111","110","130","300","300","310","320","330","340","300","350"]},"In the embodiment of , the map products inventory  includes a plurality of the different map database products . (The map database products  in the map products inventory  may correspond to the compiled geographic databases  or the templates  used for entertainment features, described above.) The map database products  include representations of geographic features in different locales. The types of geographic features that are represented include, for example, the road networks, points of interest, lakes, administrative boundaries, and other geographic features. In the embodiment of , the map products inventory  includes separate map products  (i.e., geographic databases) that represent the road networks and other geographic features in different geographic locales. For example, the map products inventory  includes geographic database products that represent the different locales of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris. (There may be map products that represent various other locales in addition to these.) Some of the different locales represented by map data products may overlap each other. For example, there may be separate map data products for Los Angeles, Calif., and the United States.","For some of the locales, the map products inventory  includes separate map products that represent features in that locale differently. For example, for some of the locales there are separate database products that represent the features with high accuracy, with medium accuracy, with low accuracy, for pedestrians, for aircraft, and for bicycles. (There may be map products that represent various other types in addition to these.) The high accuracy database products include a relatively large amount of detail about the geographic features in the respective locales and also represent the geographic features relatively accurately. The medium accuracy database products include a relatively lesser amount of detail about the geographic features in the respective locale and represent the features with a relatively lower accuracy. The low accuracy database products include an even lesser amount of detail about the geographic features in the respective locale and represent the features with an even relatively lower accuracy. The pedestrian database products include geographic data pertinent to travel on foot in the respective locale. For example, the pedestrian map database products include information about sidewalks, footpaths, hiking trails, etc., but may not include information about expressways. The aircraft database products may include information about terrain, airport runways, building heights, etc., but may exclude street names, address ranges, etc. The bicycle database products may include information about bike paths, etc., but exclude airport runways. As stated above, there may be map products for many other locales and many other types of map products in the map products inventory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["360","312","360","101","360","130"]},"In a first step of the process , a geographic locale is selected (Step ). The locale may be a metropolitan area, a state, province, or country. Alternatively, the locale may be an arbitrarily defined area, e.g., an area defined by specified geographic boundaries.","After the locale is selected, a type is selected (Step ). The type may include standard (auto), pedestrian, aircraft, bicycle, etc. Other types may be defined.","After the type is specified, an accuracy level is selected (Step ). Levels may be specified in general terms (e.g., \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201clow\u201d) or specific terms (e.g., 1 meter, 5 meter, 100 meter).","Once the locale, type, and accuracy levels are specified, data are retrieved from the master geographic database  that match the specified criteria (Step ). For example, a spatial query is used to identify and retrieve data records that represent geographic features located in the specified locale. Similarly, other queries are used to limit the retrieved data to only those records of the specified type and accuracy.","Once the data that meet the specified criteria have been obtained from the master database , the data are organized into an appropriate format (Step ). This may include compiling the data into a format in which it can be accessed and used on a given hardware platform for developing scenes for an entertainment feature. This process may include the formation of new types of data, the addition of indexes, parcelization, spatial organization and compression. Processes for forming a compiled database product are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,974,419, 5,953,722, 5,968,109 and 6,047,280, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.","In addition to including map database products that represent actual, real world locales, the map products inventory  may include map products that represent imaginary locales, e.g., templates, as described above.","Referring again to , the inventories  also includes the road models inventory . The road models inventory  includes a plurality of road model databases. As described above in connection with the other embodiments, the data in the road model databases include representations used for visual appearance and rendering of road-related things, such as road colors, road pavement, lane stripes, curbs, sidewalks, signs, lampposts, lane dividers, traffic signals, speed bumps, crosswalks, and so on. Each road model database may include a variety of different data models for some types of road-related things. For example, a road models database include several different types of traffic signal configurations. These different types of traffic signal configurations are used to provide variety and to make the representation of the road network appear more realistic, i.e., so that all the traffic signal configurations do not look the same.","The road models inventory  includes a plurality of different road model databases. Each of these different road models databases includes models that are appropriate for a different type of locale. For example, a road models database for London will include data models for the way road signs look in London, whereas a road models database for New York will includes data models for the way road signs look in New York.","The 3D model inventory  includes a plurality of 3D model databases. As described above in connection with the other embodiments, the 3D model data in the 3D model databases includes representations used for visual appearance and rendering of cityscape and landscape-related things, such as buildings, fences, trees, shrubbery, lawns, fences, clouds, scenery, and so on. Like the road models, these 3D model representations are associated with locations along the road network data as represented by data from the geographic database . Furthermore, like the road models databases, there are a plurality of 3D models databases that include 3D models appropriate for different types of locales. For example, a 3D models database for Paris will include 3D data models for the way buildings look in Paris, whereas a 3D models database for Texas will include data models for the way buildings look in Texas.","The data representations of cityscape and landscape-related things in the 3D models database are also used for providing the other properties (e.g., physical and audio) of the represented things. For example, causing a simulated vehicle to strike a simulated building causes the simulated vehicle to stop and make a crashing sound. As another example, a simulated vehicle can drive over a simulated shrub, but not a simulated tree.","The data inventories  also include an engines inventory . The engines inventory  includes a plurality of different software programs (e.g., including applications or routines and\/or their associated libraries). The software engines  perform specific, regularly performed tasks and operate on an as-needed basis (e.g., continuously) during scene rendering. An engine program may run continuously waiting to receive some input and, in response to the input, may change some output. Examples of software engines include audio engines, logic engines, rules engines, animation engines, graphics engines, navigation engines (application) and so on. The software engines inventory  may include several different software engines of a given type. For example, there may be several different audio engines, several different graphics engines, etc. The navigation engines include applications that make specific use of geographic data, such as a route calculation application that determines a route for part of a scene. Each of these different engines of a given type is suitable for a different kind of computer platform and\/or scene.","The inventories  also includes the platform configuration parameters repository . The platform configuration parameters repository  includes a plurality of entries specifying configuration parameters for different computer platforms.  shows several general categories of computer platforms in the platform configuration parameters repository . (The platform configuration parameters repository  may include additional categories.)","Operation","The entertainment feature developer uses this embodiment to integrate selections from the inventories of map data products, road models, 3D models, and various engines (e.g. physics, visual), as well as story lines, plot details, character descriptions, etc., to create draft movies, sequence depictions, or completed titles. Configuration parameters identify which components to select from the inventories to produce movie\/television scene footage. The entertainment feature developer uses this embodiment to produce CG scenes for entertainment features, as described above.","In the embodiments disclosed above, it was described how geographic data could be used by an entertainment feature developer to create scenes for movies and television shows. The entertainment feature developer may be a professional or non-professional. Further, the entertainment feature may be commercial or non-commercial. As an example, a person (non-professional) may use geographic data for making scenes for a feature for personal (non-commercial) use.","The embodiments disclosed herein describe use of geographic data for making CG scenes for entertainment features, such as motion pictures and television shows. Entertainment features may also include commercials, movie trailers, training videos, school projects, documentaries, animated features, and the like.","When using any of the disclosed embodiments for making entertainment features, a relatively high visual accuracy may be required and therefore attributes that provide for relatively high visual accuracy may be needed. However, for creating some scenes, some types of attributes may not be required or fewer of some types of attributes may be required.","The embodiments disclosed herein may use geographic data obtained from multiple sources, e.g., more than one source of geographic database. In these embodiments, the data from the multiple source geographic databases may be combined by the entertainment feature developer or by another party.","As mentioned above, in some embodiments road model data or 3D model data can be combined with road data to create realistic looking scenes. In a further alternative, realistic scenes can be created using a procedural driven build model as a substitute for, or in addition to, a road model database or a 3D model database. According to this alternative, generalized rules are used to define models for a given locale. These models are then generated and associated with the data that represents a road network. As an example, a procedural model may include a rule that states that a building is 24 stories high and has a window every 14 feet or that a given geographic locale has, as a whole, 1% hills averaging 12 meters in height. A procedural model can also be used as a substitute for, or in addition to, a 3D model database. Procedural models may be more efficient in terms of storage and rendering.","Another alternative embodiment includes interactive movies. In an interactive movie, a person watching the movie can participate (e.g., provide input) that affects the storyline, scenario, scene selection, etc., of the movie. According to one version of this embodiment, a person watching the movie can choose to have scenes take place in different geographic areas. For example, instead of having a car chase in Los Angeles, the chase can take place in London. In another example, the person watching the movie can view the action in a scene from different viewpoints, e.g., overhead, street level, window level, etc. In another example, a scene can be extended, viewed in real time, viewed in slow motion, etc. In these embodiments, geographic data for different locations are included with the movie. An application programming interface (similar to the application programming interface used by the entertainment feature developer, as described above) is included with the movie. The user operates a user interface to select different locations, points of view, etc. The application programming interface included with the movie is used to access geographic data included with the movie to change locations, points of view, etc.","It is intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting and that it is understood that the following claims including all equivalents are intended to define the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
