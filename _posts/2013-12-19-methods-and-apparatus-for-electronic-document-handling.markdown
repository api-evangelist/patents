title: Methods and apparatus for electronic document handling
abstract: A method for electronic document handling utilizing a browser apparatus communicatively coupled to a document execution server comprises downloading an unsigned electronic document from the document execution server to the browser apparatus and downloading a front-end program including zoom instructions from the document execution server to the browser apparatus. The front-end program may be separate from or part of the unsigned electronic document. The method also includes displaying the unsigned electronic document on the display screen of the browser apparatus. This displaying includes displaying fields to be filled in by the operator of the browser apparatus using the pointing apparatus and the data entry apparatus. The method also includes running the front-end program downloaded from the document execution server to zoom into or out of at least one of the displayed fields.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for facilitating the completion of electronic documents and more particularly to methods and apparatus for facilitating the entry of information and\/or signatures into such documents. The disclosures of all of the following provisional and utility patent applications are incorporated by reference herein: U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/253,778, filed Oct. 21, 2009, entitled \u201cImproved Systems and Methods for Document Signing\u201d; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/908,827, filed on Oct. 20, 2010, entitled \u201cDocument Signing Systems and Methods,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/908,840, filed on Oct. 20, 2010, entitled \u201cComputer Form Action Zone Summary System and Method,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/908,847, filed on Oct. 20, 2010, entitled \u201cForm Completion Rate Enhancement System and Method.\u201d This application does not rely for priority on the U.S. patent applications listed above nor is a claim made of benefit from the filing date of the U.S. provisional patent application.","Businesses and individuals rely on legally executed documents in a variety of contexts, from completion of complex forms used by governments and institutions (e.g., insurance forms, car loan and purchase forms, and the like), to simple contracts between individuals (e.g., lease agreements, wills, and a host of miscellaneous arrangements), with a range of contracts in between.","Documents signed by overnight envelope take a minimum of one day to reach the recipient and an additional day to be returned. Due to intra-office distribution delays and recipients' tendency to put paper documents in to-do piles, the average cycle time using overnight envelopes is 5-7 days. Documents signed by fax have an average cycle time of 2-3 days, due to intra-office delays, procrastination of paper document tasks, and fax machine mishaps. Faced with the burden of signing a paper document and returning it by fax, scan, or mail, many recipients put it down on their desk and forget about it.","As a result, users are increasingly turning to exchanging executed documents online. These documents not only include a field for including a signature, such as the type described above, but may be more complex to include additional fields that may require the signer to initial, sign, or take some other action. However, in a large document, signers may easily lose track of how many such fields they are required to complete (i.e., sign, initial, fill with data), and how many they already have completed. Thus, when users of an online document exchange program encounter problems, such as a signer not completing a document, or a signer not understanding what actions are required, they turn to customer support. This not only slows down the completion progress of a signing event, but also increases the load on customer support.","For such complex electronic documents, signer users typically are provided with limited guidance. The signer user is expected to use general navigation techniques, such as scrollbars, arrow keys, tab buttons, and the like, to move from one information field to the next. More particularly, and in the present contexts, entry of data into information fields is hindered by the use of small screens on many devices. For example, laptop and sub-laptop computers may have screens of 11 inches (about 28 cm) diagonally measured), popularly-priced tablet computers may have screens of 7 inches (about 18 cm) or less, and, although some smart phones are being made with screens of up to about 6.4 inches (about 16 cm), many popular smart phone screens measure only 5 inches (12.7 cm) or less.","When a data entry field small enough to be seen in the context of a document is selected on such small screens and data is typed in or graphical information (such as a handwritten signature) is entered, the user may be frustrated. For example, the number of keystrokes, mouse clicks, and\/or multi-finger gestures required to zoom into the field, enter data, and then zoom out so that the document can be read again may become annoying. Yet if the person who is entering this data fails to enlarge the field enough, he or she may not be able to see errors being made while typing data. Additionally, signatures or other graphic data may not be digitized accurately enough to be identifiable. Also, if a person's figure or stylus slips outside the field limits, unintended results may occur, including the termination of data entry.","Thus, there remains a need for apparatus and methods to facilitate completion of electronic documents with form fields.","The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of certain embodiments of the present invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. To the extent that the figures illustrate diagrams of the functional blocks of various embodiments, the functional blocks are not necessarily indicative of the division between hardware circuitry.","As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and proceeded with the word \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d should be understood as not excluding plural said elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly stated. Furthermore, references to \u201cat least one embodiment\u201d of the present invention are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. Moreover, unless explicitly stated to the contrary, embodiments \u201ccomprising\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d an element or a plurality of elements having a particular property may include additional such elements not having that property. Also, it will be observed that a large number of features are recited in various combinations. To recite all the possible combinations of features that may be found in every embodiment would result in an excessively lengthy description. Therefore, the description herein is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to only the various combinations recited herein. The scope of the invention should instead be understood to include all possible combinations of features recited herein except those specifically excluded herein and those that have features that are inherently incompatible with one another. It will be understood that not all embodiments will necessarily achieve all the possible advantages recited herein.","Generally, the present system and method are directed to facilitating completion of an electronic document via a signer user over the internet or similar network. In particular, the present system and method facilitates completion of a scaffold electronic document that includes multiple information entry fields, which may include signature fields associated with signature entry pads, which requires completion by a signer user.","As used herein, a signer user  as seen in  may be the document sender or one or more third parties. In addition, the term \u201csignature field\u201d, as used herein, includes entry fields for information or data that may include signatures, signer name, unique signer identifiers, signature initials, addresses, or any other information that a document sender may identify as being acceptable forms of information for a particular signature field. For example, in one real estate transaction document, one signature field type may require entry of the signer user's full, legal name, another signature field type may require entry of the target real property address, another signature field type may include date data, and such. Thus, for example only and not by way of limitation, a \u201csignature field\u201d may be provided as an entry field for some form of identification, or it may be provided as a simple text entry field where a signer user  may insert anything.","In addition, the term \u201csignature\u201d includes any biometric action by a signer user, such as: freehand motion using a mouse, electronic pen, touch-screen, or any other method for detecting and recording (either temporarily or in a stored location) graphics unique or capable of being associated with a particular signer user. It may also include iris or other eye scan data, fingerprints, vocal sound or voiceprints, or other available biometrics. The freehand motion may either approximate, electronically, the signer user's traditional signature (i.e., as performed with a pen or pencil on paper), or may be a graphic that is quite dissimilar from the signer user's traditional signature.","For present purposes, a \u201csignature field\u201d can be thought of as a generic term for different types of fields. Examples of \u201csignature fields\u201d include, a \u201cdata entry field,\u201d or synonymously, an \u201cinformation entry field\u201d into which text is typed (for example), a \u201csignature entry field\u201d into which graphical or other data uniquely associated with a particular signer user is entered, and a \u201cbiometric field\u201d into which a signature or other type of biometric data that is uniquely associated with a particular signer user is entered. The term \u201cbiometric field\u201d may be considered a more generic form of a \u201csignature entry field.\u201d The term \u201csignature entry field\u201d should, however, be distinguished from the more generic term \u201csignature field.\u201d It may help to illustrate the hierarchy:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"13.63mm","wi":"71.63mm","file":"US09507760-20161129-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"For example and referring to , with respect to the signing of an unsigned electronic document, some embodiments of the present system  include a document execution server (DES)  in communication with a document and authentication data storage device , a document summary server , and a document flag server . The document execution server  is configured to receive over a network  from a document sender  a scaffold document  that contains one or more information entry fields , together with additional data representative of the identities of signer users (who are to sign the electronic document) and parties to be copied (the \u201cenvelope\u201d information).","As further shown in , some embodiments  also include a document summary server  in communication with the document execution server  and associated with a scaffold electronic document  via network , described in further detail below. The document summary server  facilitates the entry by a signer user  of information into the one or more information entry fields  in the scaffold document .","The system  further includes a document flag server  in communication with the document execution server  and associated scaffold electronic document  via network , described in further detail below. Referring now to  and , the document \u201cflag\u201d server  associates one or more \u201cflags\u201d (a signal or alert, such as a graphical representation of a \u201csign here\u201d flag)  with signature fields  in an unsigned electronic document , so that a signer user  can easily identify where a signature or other information is required to be entered in the document. In an embodiment, the document execution server  obtains flag data from the document flag server , and associates a visual flag  in a location on the unsigned electronic document  with the unsigned electronic document  prior to sending the document to a signer user .","Additionally, referring now to , and returning now to the document execution server , that server sends, or otherwise makes available the unsigned electronic document , with or without including an information summary indicator  from the document summary server  and\/or a flag  from the document flag server , to one or more signer users , identified by the document sender . Once each target signer user  completes all designated signature fields for that signer user, the document execution server  converts the original unsigned electronic document  into an at least signed electronic document . Once all target signer users  have completed all designated signature fields, the input is combined to generate a signed electronic document . The signed electronic document  may be logged and stored in the document and authentication data storage device  for future use.","The document execution server  may send notifications to the document sender  as well as other designated signer users , indicating the progress of the signing activity. For example, the notifications may identify signature fields in the electronic document still requiring entry of data by one or more of the signer users.","In some example embodiments and referring to , a screenshot of an unsigned electronic document  is presented with a graphical flag  in the left margin of the screen displaying the document. In some of these embodiments, the flag is a brightly-colored \u201ctab\u201d that includes the text \u201crequired\u201d, to identify for the signer user  that there is a signature field  along the same visual line on the screen that requires the signer user to complete. In some embodiments, the flags  are a graphical equivalent of a sticky label, which appear to stick out of or wrap around the edge of the document as an indicator to the signer user. In some embodiments and referring to , a display of an unsigned electronic document  having multiple signature fields  is provided. The unsigned electronic document  includes content displayable to a signer user  as text, graphics, or a combination of text and graphics. The unsigned electronic document  includes one or more signature fields , into which data is entered by signer users  at one or more locations on the pages of the electronic document  using online signature entry pads  (shown in ) associated with each signature entry field , as described in further detail below. The location, type, and number of signature fields  per document are specified by the document sender  to the document execution server . The document execution server  associates the signature fields  identified by the document sender , and presents the unsigned electronic document , including all signature fields , to the respective signer users  identified by the document sender . In some embodiments and referring to the right side of , the progress in signing (or otherwise completing the signature fields for a signer user) is indicated by an information summary indicator , which is shown in this  as a \u201cthermometer-type\u201d graphic. The example electronic document  shown in  is for a Chief Executive Officer signer user, displaying a signature field .","In at least one example embodiment, the document execution server  converts the original unsigned electronic document  into an unsigned web-ready document , having the same information and signature fields  as the original document. Unsigned web-ready documents are ready for dynamic entry of information into the signature fields  by one or more signer users . This web-ready conversion of the original documents may be achieved using standard conversion software and algorithms readily available and known to those skilled in the relevant art. For example, a Microsoft Word Document can be opened in the OpenOffice Application, exported as a PDF and then, using pdf2swf from SWFTOOLS.org, exported in Flash format, which readily is displayable in most generally commercially available web browsers. In at least one embodiment, the unsigned electronic document  is exported using similar tools into PNG files, which are supported by commercially available web browsers, and which technology is available in services such as DOCSTOC.com and SCRIBD.com.","After receiving the original unsigned electronic document  and, as applicable, converting the document to an unsigned web-ready document , in an example embodiment, the document execution server  makes available, via a network, either the original, unsigned electronic document  or the unsigned web-ready document  to a signer user , together with an online signature entry pad  associated with each signature field  in the unsigned electronic document . In an embodiment, the document execution server  makes the unsigned electronic document  available to multiple signer users , either simultaneously or serially, depending on instructions from the document sender , or other external, predetermined parameters and input. In at least one example embodiment, the document execution server  delivers the unsigned electronic document  (or a link thereto) via an application programming interface (API) for access by predetermined signer users. In another example embodiment, document execution server  delivers the unsigned web-ready document  (or a link thereto) via the API.","In at least one embodiment, also as shown in , the document summary server  may send a scaffold document  via email or other electronic transmission to one or more signer users . The same scaffold document  is made available to multiple signer users  either in a web ready format, via email, via a link through an API, or using other electronic means, as may be desirable for each signer user , as is the case with any unsigned electronic document. For example, in one embodiment, a link to a document  is emailed by document summary server  to one or more signer users , where the link provides access to a webpage containing or otherwise providing access to a web-ready document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["118","118","110","120","130","120","130","120"],"sup":"th ","sub":["i","1","2,1 ","1,1 "]},"In response to receipt of the signature data from one or more of the signer users , the document execution server  generates a signed (or otherwise \u201cfilled-in\u201d or completed) electronic document  corresponding to the unsigned electronic document  and including the signature data.","In an embodiment, the signed electronic document  then is made available by the document execution server  to all or a predetermined subset of the signer users  and to the document sender  for verification, confirmation, and other predetermined actions. In an embodiment, the document execution server  transmits the signed (or otherwise completed) electronic document  (in a \u201clocked\u201d form) to a document and authentication data storage device .","In an embodiment, the document summary server  establishes a group index i for each of the m groups of information entry fields F . For purposes of this document, we use the following definitions. With respect to signer users , m=number of users\/groups of user fields, (e.g. the number of participant signer users), wherein 1<=i<=m. In addition, Urepresents the isigner user. In referencing signature field groups for a signer user, Fis the group of fields required to be \u201cfilled in\u201d by the signer user U, i.e., for the isigner user. Iis the incomplete (i.e., not \u201cfilled in\u201d) required fields for U. Cis the required fields completed by U. When a field Fis fully filled in, then Ibecomes an empty entry which is ignored for counting purposes and skipped when iterating through elements. The same is true for C. Counts are represented as: |F| is the total required field count for U; |I| is the incomplete required field count for U; and |C| is the completed required field count for Uall at any given time.","Individual fields are represented as: Fis the field j for U; Pis the page number on which Iappears; Lis the actionable link to bring Fto the viewport (for example, if Fis offscreen to a signer user , clicking a link Lwill bring Finto the middle of the user screen and make the field active for input by the sender user ; and Zis the visual indicator of next Ito be completed by the signer user. Thus, 1<=j<=|F|.","Upon receiving a scaffold document , from a document sender , the document summary server  establishes a group index i for each of the m groups of information entry fields, where 1\u2266i\u2266m, and establishes a subgroup index jfor the igroup of information entry fields Iof the respective m groups, where 1\u2266i\u2266m and where 1\u2266j\u2266n, wherein and jfor the iuser have initial values equal to 1 for the scaffold electronic document, and i and jhave maximum values equal to m and nrespectively for the scaffold electronic document. The document summary server  makes available over the network , a version of the scaffold document  to one or more signer users . The scaffold document  is displayable to each signer user  to allow the signer user  to identify the information entry fields . As used herein, the term \u201cinformation entry field\u201d has the same meaning as \u201csignature field;\u201d however, the term \u201cinformation entry fields\u201d is preferred in reference to scaffold documents, and the term \u201csignature fields\u201d is preferred in reference to any unsigned electronic document.","The flowchart of  further illustrates an embodiment of the present method. As shown, a document sender accesses  the document execution server  via a network, such as the internet. The document sender then uploads  the original electronic document to the document execution server (DES). The document sender then indicates  the name and contact information of each signer user, each entity that will receive a copy of either the unsigned electronic document and\/or the signed electronic document, and any order in which the signature fields contained in the subject document are to be completed by the designated signer users. The document sender also indicates  at this time, the locations of signature fields within the unsigned electronic document, together with instructions regarding which signer user is required to complete which corresponding signature field. With multiple signer users, different signer users generally are required to complete different signature fields, as well as different signature field types. For example, in a real estate transaction, the buyer may be required to provide a signature, a personal address, and a date, whereas an escrow agent may be required to provide a signature, a license number, and financial information.","As shown in , in an embodiment, the document execution server prepares  a web-ready version of the original document. The document execution server also may generate thumbnail displays, flags, or other indicia, associated with the various signature fields for easier review by the signer user and a more expedient signer user completion of the designated signature fields.","Turning to , once the document execution server receives the original document, together with the additional document information from the document sender, the document execution server follows  the signing order instructions sent by the document sender. For each designated signer user, the document execution server in effect prepares  an unsigned electronic document associated with the original document, and a signature entry pad for each signature field. All such information regarding the signer user and instructions related to the document, are collectively referred to the \u201cenvelope\u201d of the electronic document. Additional envelope information may include data associated with the identity of the signer user, such as email address, IP address, SMS address, facsimile number, or other electronic forms of address or identification. This envelope is integrally associated with the original document and, as such, remains part of the associated electronic and web-ready versions of the same document as such are generated by the document executive server.","In at least one embodiment, an API user, such as another internet-based device, is the document sender, which submits at  the original document, and the associated signer user, copied users, signing order, signature field locations, and signature field authorizations to the document execution server. In an embodiment, the API user receives delivery of the unsigned web-ready documents on behalf of the designated signer users.","Once the unsigned electronic document is prepared, the document execution server delivers at  an internet link, code, or embedded HTML via a network to the designated signer users. The network includes SMS, email, facsimile, and other available technologies for distributing data. At a proximal time the document execution server in effect transmits the unsigned electronic document to the signer users. The document execution server may deliver updates  of the event to the document sender and other designated entities to be copied on such transmission. In this manner, the document sender can begin to track the progress of the document as the designated signer users complete the signature events.","Once the link, code, embedded HTML, or other contact is made by the document execution server to a signer user, that signer user then accesses at  the unsigned electronic document by following such link, returning to the website interface for the document execution server, interacts with the embedded HTML code from the API user, or otherwise opens the unsigned electronic document. The document execution server locates at  the unsigned electronic document, together with its associated envelope information, and presents the same to each signer user.","In an embodiment, web ready unsigned document versions are readied at  by document execution server .","As shown in , the signer user views at  the unsigned electronic document, and enters the information requested in each of the signer user's respective signature fields. Information is entered into the signature field by the dynamic online signature entry pad associated with each signature field. Signature entry pads are dynamic fields that appear on the GUI to facilitate signer user entry of information required for the associated signature field. Such information may be entered using a touch pad, mouse, touch-screen, voice entry, and other technologies generally commercially available.","Upon receipt of the entered information, the document execution server creates at  a graphical representation of the signature field input received from the signer user. The document execution server then (or at desired times) in effect combines at  the graphical representations with the unsigned electronic document to generate a signed electronic document, to define a signed event. In parallel with receiving the signature field input from the signer users, and with generating each signed electronic document, the document execution server delivers  updates on the progress of the signing events to those entities identified as \u201ccc\u201d, or copied entities, as well as to the document sender. Once all signers have completed signing the document, all graphical representations of all signature field input received from all signers is combined  into a single signed document.","In some embodiments, and as shown in , the document execution server then delivers at  a copy of the signed electronic document to each of the designated, or selected ones of the signer users associated with that document. In an embodiment, the document execution server optionally locks and stores at  a copy of the signed electronic document, or may send a copy to a document and authentication data storage device for storage. In an embodiment, the document execution server generates  authentication data associated with the signed electronic document. Such authentication data may be data incorporated into the signed electronic document, it may be part of the document envelope, or may be some additional data used only for authentication purposes.","In at least one embodiment of the present method in which a document summary server is used, and referring to , once the document summary server receives at  a scaffold electronic document and m groups of information entry fields, the scaffold and fields Fthen are displayed at  to a user U. The display step includes displaying  a visual representation of steps-to-go, representing |F|, |C|, and |I|. Such visual representation may be permanent, dynamic representations, such as text, appearing at the top or side of the screens, or user-selective representations, such as text appearing in pull-down menus on the screen. In at least one embodiment, such visual representations may be in the form of dynamic graphical displays, such as a \u201cthermometer\u201d-type graphic, a numerical, button, or other graphic countdown display, color displays, such as red \u201cbuttons\u201d representing incomplete information entry fields and green \u201cbuttons\u201d representing completed information entry fields. On receipt  of data for F(i.e., the jfield for the iuser), at  the user receives an updated display , with the steps-to-go indicator iteratively adjusted to reflect the number of information entry fields remaining to be completed and\/or the number of information entry fields completed.","An example of an embodiment of the type described in the preceding paragraph updates progress indicators (i.e., indicators showing a user Uhow many fields remain to be filled in) are updated in \u201creal time.\u201d In this example, \u201creal time\u201d means the progress indicators comprise \u201cfront-end\u201d code, wherein field data filled in by user Uis not transmitted to a server immediately, but rather is stored temporarily in a data store local to and accessible by the browser (i.e., the \u201cfront end\u201d) used by user U, and the progress indicators update in accordance with the temporarily stored data. After all required data fields are filled and the user Uclicks on a \u201csubmit\u201d button in the browser, the browser submits all of the data field data from the local store to the server at once. In such embodiments, the phrase \u201con receipt of data\u201d in step  refers to the receipt of data by the browser and the update of the \u201csteps to go\u201d indicator requires only the \u201cfront-end\u201d code running in the user's browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["400","402","404","406","408","410","408","412","404"],"sub":["1 ","n","i+1 ","1 ","n ","i ","i","n "]},"In at least one embodiment, the flags  are successively located in the unsigned electronic document  with increasing index i, or are located in the unsigned electronic document  independent of the index i.

In another embodiment, a page with multiple signature fields  may include several flags  indicating simultaneously all signature fields  on the page. Then, when a signer user  completes a signature field , the associated flag  disappears\u2014all flags  disappear once all signature fields  in the unsigned electronic document  are completed by the signer user . In a scaffold document , the flags  may be different graphical colors or shapes to indicate different information entry fields . For example, flags associated with information entry fields requiring name data graphically appear as blue flags, flags associated with information entry fields requiring date data graphically appear as green flags, and the like.","In at least one example embodiment of the present method, the scaffold document  is one selected from predetermined template documents created by third party entities, or the administrator of the present method, and stored in the document execution server for use by customer\/document senders via API. In such an embodiment, as shown in , a document sender, or an application used by a document sender, requests  a list of template electronic documents. Such template documents have predetermined signature fields, which are not generally changed or changeable by the document sender. An example of such an embodiment would be form lease agreements, or other standard forms. In another example embodiment of the present invention, template documents are sent via a web user interface (UI) as opposed to an application programming interface (API). In yet another example embodiment, template documents can be sent either via a web user interface (UI) or by an application programming interface (API).","Upon receiving the request, the document execution server delivers  via API (or via UI), a list of available templates to the sender user. The sender user application selects  a template. Upon receipt of the sender user template choice , the document execution server performs document package pre-process . This pre-process generates a document ID associated with the template. It is possible that many document ID's are associated with each template, and each unique document (having an assigned unique document ID) likely will have a unique envelope. The API then delivers  the merge fields and roles associated with the envelope for the designated template. The sender user application provides  merge data, information relating to the signer users, and other information and data required for the designated template. In this example, the template is the unsigned electronic document identified and discussed above. The document execution server processes  the unsigned template document, in a manner similar to that described above, and sends links , via email to each designated signer user. Each designated signer user provides , the information required for each signature field. For signature fields designated as optional to one or more signer users by the sender user, the information may be left blank by the associated signer user(s). Upon receipt of all required signature field data (and whatever optional signature field data that may be entered), such data is incorporated into an unsigned template document, and the document execution server locks  the resulting signed electronic document, as described above in further detail.","At that point, the signed electronic document may be stored  in a document and authentication data storage device, and copies of the signed electronic document sent at and to the document sender at , and others as designated by the document sender at ","In some embodiments, sender users select a template unsigned electronic document from a website, from the user's own library, or from secondary sources. In at least one embodiment, the step of processing the document  is followed by an API (or UI) delivery of embedded signing codes. In at least one embodiment, all communications between the document sender and the document execution server, or between the document execution server and one or more of the designated signer users, is via email, facsimile, SMS, and other electronic communications methods generally available. As used herein, an \u201cembedded signing code\u201d is a code that is inserted into the HTML code of an existing third party webpage to display a document signing event (e.g., in an iFrame) inside the third party webpage. This type of code may be similar to, but not necessarily the same as, an embedded code provided by YT\u00ae.","In at least one embodiment, as shown in , the document execution server, prior to delivering  the unsigned electronic document to the signer user, modifies  the unsigned electronic document to include flag data to successively identify to each respective signer user the signature fields in that unsigned electronic document which required data entry. This flag data is removed in one example embodiment when the document execution server combines  the unsigned document and graphical representations of signature field data to create the signed electronic document.","In at least one embodiment, as shown in , the document execution server, prior to or contemporaneous with delivering  the unsigned electronic document to the signer user, modifies  the unsigned electronic document to include summary data, represented by an information summary indicator , associated with the document to assist signer users identify the locations of signature fields in the electronic document. Such information summary indicator  is presented in a side menu to the document, appears visually on the same page as a signature field, or is presented anywhere on the visual periphery of document pages. The information summary indicator includes such indicators as the total number of signature fields in the subject document, the number of signature fields that have been completed, the number of signature fields remaining to be completed, or any combination of such data. In at least one embodiment, the information summary indicator  is presented graphically as a bar, as buttons, as text, as color indicators (e.g., red for incomplete signature fields; green for completed signature fields), and the like. In an embodiment, the information summary indicator  is static, by presenting location identification data (e.g., page, paragraph information) associated with each signature field, or by presenting the total number of signature fields contained in the subject document. In at least one embodiment, the information summary indicator  is dynamic, changing as the signer user completes each signature field. In some embodiments, information summary indicator  is superimposed on the unsigned electronic document itself. For example, an entire page of a document may be color tinted to indicate the density of fields, or a colored vertical bar is imposed on one side of a page, e.g., the right side.","Turning now to , this series of screen shots shows an exemplary embodiment of the present system and method.  shows a start-up\/home screen for a website using the present system and method.

In an embodiment, some information entry fields  are identified as being required to be completed, whereas other fields  are optional. In an embodiment, the workflow order is adjusted in accordance with the type of document to be completed, the number and nature of the signer users  involved, and other variations based on the preferences set by the document sender . In one such embodiment, the document sender  is a set workflow order requiring one signer user  to complete one or more information entry fields  before certain other identified signer users. The document summary server  may include workflow order restrictions for an unsigned electronic document  requiring iterative, serial actions. For example, a document sender  may instruct that signer user 1 Ucomplete information entry field 1 F, followed by the completion by signer user 2 Uof information entry field 2 F, before signer user 1 Ucompletes information entry field 2 F, and so forth until all information entry fields are complete.","In a more simplified embodiment, the document summary server assigns a workflow order that requires a first signer user Ucomplete all information entry fields F prior to the document being sent to another signer user U. In another embodiment, the document summary server  requires that each signer user complete the information entry fields in a predetermined order; for example, for signer user 1, U, F, THEN F, and the like.","At least one embodiment includes various forms of exclusivity. For example, information entry fields may be shared by one or more signer user, such that either signer user may complete one or more designated information entry fields. This may be done on a per-field basis, or for all fields in an entire document. In another embodiment, information entry fields are shared by one or more signer users, such that each signer user individually completes a designated information entry field, and the information provided by each such signer user is concatenated to complete a single information entry field.","At least one embodiment of the present apparatus and method includes variations on graphical updating of the summary data, represented by an information summary indicator . Also, in at least one embodiment, upon receipt of the Fdata, the graphical representation of the information summary indicator  is updated immediately to the user U. Furthermore, in at least one embodiment, upon receipt of the Fdata, the graphical representation of the information summary indicator  is NOT updated immediately to the user U. In at least one embodiment, upon receipt of the Fdata, the graphical representation of the information summary indicator  is updated immediately for future users, i.e., U.","In at least one embodiment of the present system and method, one or more Fhave default values that cannot be modified by a sender user. For example, \u201cDate\u201d information entry fields automatically fill with the current date. In at least one embodiment, at least one of the information entry fields have default values that can be modified by all or certain identified signer users. In at least one embodiment, some information entry fields may be filled using a merge function, and are thus denominated as \u201cmerge fields.\u201d These embodiments have merge fields that are filled in by the document sender before sending rather than the signer user. The data in the merge fields in these embodiments is merged into the document before the signer user sees it, and thus may be viewed as the sender \u201cpre-filling\u201d these fields before sending the document. In at least one embodiment, some multiple Fare completed by information input only one time by the signer user; for example, a single signature event then is automatically input simultaneously into potentially many Fidentified either by a signer user, or the document sender.","Further, at least one embodiment includes displaying to each signer user  different types and amounts of information relating to a scaffold document . For example, the screen display of an unsigned electronic document  includes the total number information entry fields |F| and the number of complete information entry fields |C|, but not the total number of incomplete information entry fields for a specified document. In at least one embodiment, the screen display of an unsigned electronic document  includes the total number information entry fields |F| and the number of incomplete information entry fields |I|, but not the total number of complete information entry fields |C| for a specified document.","In at least one embodiment, the screen displays the page numbers Pon which the next incomplete information entry field Iappears.","In at least one embodiment, the display for a display screen on which the scaffold document  or the unsigned electronic document  appear includes a conventional moveable window that is slidable over the display of the unsigned electronic document to make available for viewing only that portion of the document underlying the region of the window. At least one embodiment includes an actionable link Lthat is displayed to bring the next information entry field to the viewport. In at least one embodiment, an actionable link Lis displayed for the incomplete required information entry fields I. In at least one embodiment, a visual indicator of the next incomplete required information entry fields Zis displayed for incomplete required information entry fields I. In at least one embodiment, the visual indicator of the next incomplete required information entry field Zis displayed for I, and includes an actionable link to bring the target information entry field into the viewport; for example, the visual indicator is an arrow on one side of the display screen, which arrow is clickable.","In addition, at least one embodiment includes various ways of displaying to one or more signer user what information is entered by one or more of the other signer users. For example, the information summary indicator may display to one signer user which information entry fields are completed by the other signer user, and which remain incomplete. In this embodiment, for example, the completed information entry field by one user Cappears as a green box on the unsigned electronic document displayed to a second signer user, whereas an incomplete information entry field by one user Iis displayed as a red box on the unsigned electronic document displayed to the second user.","The various methods described above may be embodied in, and fully automated by, software code modules (in some cases, for example, front end browser code running in a browser) executed by one or more general purpose computers, tablet computers, and\/or special purpose computers. The code modules may be stored in any type of computer storage device or devices (hard disk storage, solid state RAM, and the like). The steps may be implemented using any type of computer storage device or devices, and using any type or types of data repositories (relational databases, flat files, caches, and the like) to store any data. The flow of data through a network as well as the division and separation of data, controlled access to the data by the various parties involved, and verification of data over a distributed and\/or public or private network are considered distinguishing features of the present invention. However, these features are not necessarily present in whole or in part in every embodiment, nor are they considered the only distinguishing features.","For example, in at least one embodiment and referring to , a signature field  with a \u201czoom on entry feature\u201d is provided, wherein a signature field  along with a displayed portion  of an unsigned electronic document  (or a partially signed electronic document ) is magnified. This magnification occurs when signature field  is selected for entry of any data by a signer user  when the unmagnified signature field  is deemed or otherwise determined to be too small for the signer user  to comfortably see or enter data therein. In some embodiments of the present invention, magnification occurs every time a user selects a field. Magnification occurs when the unmagnified signature field  into which data is to be entered is clicked on by the signer user  using a mouse cursor  over the unmagnified signature field , by signer user  tapping a touchpad, touching a touchscreen, and\/or tapping a pen or stylus on a drawing tablet. In some embodiments, magnification occurs when a user simply hovers a mouse or other pointing device having a representation on the screen over a field, whether or not the field is clicked. Embodiments of the present invention may include one or more \u201czoom on entry\u201d activation methods as may be appropriate for the user device or devices being used to display documents  (or ). The zoom on entry feature is provided in some embodiments by front-end code sent to the user's browser via the document execution server . In some of these embodiments, the size of the user's browser window is used to determine the amount of magnification provided and\/or the size of the entry field provided to the user. Thus, the zoom amount in some embodiments need not be fixed magnification, and the browser software and associated processor performs the mathematics needed to perform the zoom feature. One non-exclusive example of a front-end language suitable for use in writing such applications for browsers is J\u00ae, a product available from Oracle America, Inc. Corporation Delaware 500 Oracle Parkway Redwood Shores Calif. 94065.","When the \u201czoom on entry\u201d feature is activated, the display of document  (or ), including the signature field , is \u201czoomed\u201d to a comfortable magnification for entry of the data into the signature field . For example, in an embodiment in which typed text is to be entered into a signature field , the document  (or ) and the signature field  are zoomed so that typed data appears at least at a point size deemed viewable in the smallest size display screen  that a signer user  is anticipated to use. The point size can be parameterized. For example, in some embodiments, information about the actual size of display screen  (or information from which the actual screen size may be determined) is sent to the document execution server  before the document  (or ) is sent to the user. In this manner, for example, a document  (or ) suitable for displaying and signing on a so-called \u201csmart phone\u201d may be zoomed to a different factor than one appearing on a moderate size tablet computer or a full-screen laptop or desktop computer. This information can frequently be determined, or at least intelligently estimated, by a browser and\/or operating system identification string sent to the document server upon the initial request for the document. In many instances, parameterization of the smallest point size will allow a smart phone application to enlarge the input field, but prevent a full-size laptop or desktop display from being enlarged uncomfortably and\/or unnecessarily.","In some embodiments, the smallest point size is set globally by the service provider (e.g., the provider of the document execution server ). In other embodiments, the smallest point size is set per document  or per document type (e.g., in the document \u201clibrary\u201d shown in ) or even per signer user  or per signature field  by the composer of the scaffold electronic document . In still other embodiments, a global setting by the service provider is used unless overridden by the composer of the scaffold electronic document . In yet other embodiments, some or all smallest point sizes are set by default but are overridden by more specific document, user or signature field settings.","In some embodiments of the present invention, to return to the pre-zoomed magnification and referring to , a virtual button  (i.e., a GUI button or other type of active region) is provided. This virtual button  helps ensure that accidental mouse clicks, finger touches, etc. do not cause the display of electronic document  (or ) to revert back to an unviewable text size and\/or terminate input prematurely. A virtual button  for returning to the pre-zoomed magnification is particularly useful because it allows a signer user  to return to his or her own selected magnification. Pressing on the virtual button  permits further reading or scanning of the document  (or ) without having to scroll or otherwise press several buttons to return to the same pre data entry magnification preferred by the signer user for that purpose. In the embodiment represented by , virtual button  is a button labeled \u201csigned!\u201d to prompt the signer user  to click on the button when he or she is finished entering data into the signature field . However, the use of different labels is contemplated, when appropriate, for other signature fields . In the embodiment represented by , for example, a second virtual button  labeled \u201czoom out\u201d is provided on the display screen GUI. This \u201czoom out\u201d button can be used as an escape in the event the signer user  does not intend or decides not to sign a particular signature field , perhaps because he or she activated the zoom on entry feature by accident. In some embodiments in which zoom occurs simply by hovering a pointer over a field, the field is returned to its pre-zoomed magnification when the pointer is moved and no longer hovering over the field. In other embodiments, the field is returned to its pre-zoomed magnification occurs clicking or touching anywhere outside of the pre-zoomed magnification field. In some embodiments, the field is returned to its pre-zoomed magnification when, for example, the browser front end code (supplied by the document execution server) running on the user's browser apparatus determines that the field has been completed (e.g., the tenth digit is entered in a phone number field, or a signature was drawn in a signature box).","The use of a virtual button  in some embodiments of the present invention facilitates non-text entry, such as freehand drawings or hand-written signatures, into a signature field , but is not required in all embodiments of the present invention. For example, one might expect that pressing or taping a pen or stylus (or even a finger on a touchscreen) outside of a signature field  would have the effect of zooming or moving the document  (or ). However, in one embodiment that requires that the virtual button  be pressed instead, a signature or other drawing will not be prematurely terminated if the signature or drawing inadvertently extends beyond the boundary of the signature field  while it is being entered.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a mouse click or the push of a physical button of a touchpad, a drawing pad, or a stylus or a pen used with a drawing pad is programmed to perform the same function as the pressing of the virtual button .","For example, and referring to , in one embodiment of the present inventive method, a signer user  is provided with a browser apparatus  communicatively coupled to a document execution server  via a network such as the Internet . The coupling may utilize any known coupling means such as Ethernet, fiber, or radio. Non-exclusive examples of browser apparatus  include a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, or a smartphone including a display screen , a pointing apparatus  capable of manipulating a virtual button on display screen  such as a mouse trackball, or stylus and stylus pad, or a touch-sensitive portion of display screen  (which may be the entire display screen). Browser apparatus  also includes a data entry apparatus , which may be integral to the display screen, such as the touch-sensitive display screen  itself, a virtual keyboard or writing area of display screen , a separate device, such as a computer keyboard, or a device that comprises the stylus and stylus pad, and a processor  with or in communication with non-transient memory  that is configured to execute a browsing program.","It will be appreciated that configurations of the \u201czoom on entry\u201d feature can be used for any of various types of electronic documents having entry fields.","It is also to be observed that the \u201czoom on entry\u201d feature can be embodied as a software and\/or hardware module either in the document execution server  or in a document  (or ) sent or emailed to a signer user . For example and referring back to , in at least one embodiment, HTML code embedded within the document  (or ) is provided that sends information regarding the portion of document  (or ) being displayed, along with information regarding mouse clicks, screen touches, and\/or pen or stylus touches or clicks to the document execution server . The document execution server  is responsive to such information to send a new view of the document  (or ) to the computer or other display device used by the signer user. This new view is one that zooms into the signature field  if information regarding the currently displayed document indicates that the display of the signature field  and the displayed document portion  around it should be zoomed. Prior to zooming in, a cookie is set in at least one embodiment to preserve information about the pre-zoomed state of the document  (or ). The display code sent to the signer user includes a graphical user interface (GUI) button  that is responsive to user input (e.g., a mouse click, a screen touch, or a pen or stylus click on a tablet computer) to restore the screen zoom prior to the occurrence of the zoom based upon the value of the cookie. In at least one embodiment, the information in the cookie is sent directly to the document execution server  and the information saved by the cookie is used directly by the document server to restore the pre-zoomed state. Also, in at least one embodiment, the information in the cookie is used by the signer user's browser to restore the pre-zoomed state.","In at least one embodiment, the document  (or ) received by the signer user  includes embedded HTML, Javascript, and\/or Java code, or some other suitable front end code executable in a web browser or the display program or plug-in that is being used to display the document at the signer user's own display screen . The user's computer, phone, or table computer is used to execute this code locally in order to zoom in and to zoom back out.","Thus, in one embodiment of the invention and referring now to , a method is provided for electronic document handling utilizing a browser apparatus  communicatively coupled to a document execution server , the browser apparatus  including a display screen , a pointing apparatus , a data entry apparatus , a processor , and non-transient memory  configured to execute a browsing program on processor . The method  starts at box  and includes, at box , downloading an unsigned electronic document  from the document execution server  to the browser apparatus  At box , the method further includes downloading a front-end program including zoom instructions from the document execution server  to the browser apparatus , wherein the front-end program is either separate from or part of the unsigned electronic document. The method further includes displaying, at box , the unsigned electronic document  on the display screen  of the browser apparatus  using the browsing program within the browser apparatus, wherein displaying the unsigned electronic document  includes displaying fields to be filled in by the operator of the browser apparatus using the pointing apparatus  and the data entry apparatus . Also included in the method, at box , is running the front-end program downloaded from the document execution server  to zoom into or out of at least one of the displayed fields.","In some embodiments of the present invention, running the front-end program to zoom into or out of at least one of the displayed fields at box  further comprises zooming the at least one of the displayed fields when the pointing apparatus  is hovered over the field. Also, in some embodiments of the present invention, running the front-end program to zoom into or out of at least one of the displayed fields at box  further comprises providing a button, such as virtual button , on the display screen  and zooming out of zoomed displayed field when the button is pressed.","In some embodiments of the present invention, zooming out of a zoomed displayed field at box  comprises zooming out to an original magnification, i.e., using the magnification of the screen at a time immediately before a zoom occurs.","Also in some embodiments of the present invention, the displayed field is a field into which a drawing or signature is entered, and zooming out of the displayed field comprises inhibiting the zooming out of the displayed field until a virtual button is pressed to prevent premature termination of the entry of the drawing or the signature.","In yet further embodiments of the present invention, zooming into at least one of the displayed fields in box  comprises the browser apparatus  determining a size of the browsing window and zooming in by a factor dependent upon the size of the browsing window. Also in some embodiments, zooming into at least one of the displayed fields comprises zooming in by at least one factor dependent upon either or both of a predetermined fixed width supplied by the front-end code and a size of the displayed field to be filled in.","Some embodiments of the present invention comprise a browser apparatus  that is configured to perform the inventive steps of the preceding methods. It will be understood that the configuration of browser apparatus  to perform such steps may comprise selecting a processor  and a program to run in non-transient memory  that instructs browser apparatus  to perform the necessary steps using processor  to run the program.
