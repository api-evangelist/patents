Research and development in the existing technologies can take a myriad of different directions.","As users become more empowered with the growth of mobile location based service devices, new and old paradigms begin to take advantage of this new device space. There are many technological solutions to take advantage of this new device location opportunity. One existing approach is to use location information to provide navigation services such as a global positioning system (GPS) for a car or on a mobile device such as a cell phone, portable navigation device (PND) or a personal digital assistant (PDA).","Location based services allow users to create, transfer, store, and\/or consume information in order for users to create, transfer, store, and consume in the \u201creal world\u201d. One such use of location based services is to efficiently transfer or route users to the desired destination or service.","Navigation systems and location based services enabled systems have been incorporated in automobiles, notebooks, handheld devices, and other portable products. Today, these systems aid users by incorporating available, real-time relevant information, such as maps, directions, local businesses, or other points of interest (POI). The real-time information provides invaluable relevant information.","However, application sharing without considering the criteria for selecting which application to select has become a paramount concern for the consumer. Selecting the application without the criteria not most optimal for the user by the navigation system decreases the benefit of using the tool.","Thus, a need still remains for a navigation system with conditional based application sharing mechanism to select an application best suited for the circumstance. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.","Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.","The present invention provides a method of operation of a navigation system including: determining a service type of a first application for interacting with a first pairing device; determining a second application for interacting with a second pairing device in which the second application is also of the service type; selecting the second application with the second application meeting or exceeding a selection condition, otherwise the first application is selected; and generating an execution result for executing the second application for displaying on the first pairing device.","The present invention provides a navigation system, including: an application one detector module for determining a service type of a first application for interacting with a first pairing device; an application two detector module, coupled to the application one detector module, for determining a second application for interacting with a second pairing device in which the second application is also of the service type; an application selector module, coupled to the application two detector module, for selecting the second application with the second application meeting or exceeding a selection condition, otherwise the first application is selected; and a result access module, coupled to the application selector module, for generating an execution result for executing the second application for displaying on the first pairing device.","Certain embodiments of the invention have other steps or elements in addition to or in place of those mentioned above. The steps or elements will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The following embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the invention.

Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation. The embodiments have been numbered first embodiment, second embodiment, etc. as a matter of descriptive convenience and are not intended to have any other significance or provide limitations for the present invention.","One skilled in the art would appreciate that the format with which navigation information is expressed is not critical to some embodiments of the invention. For example, in some embodiments, navigation information is presented in the format of (X, Y), where X and Y are two ordinates that define the geographic location, i.e., a position of a user.","In an alternative embodiment, navigation information is presented by longitude and latitude related information.

The first device  can be a standalone device, or can be incorporated with a vehicle, for example a car, truck, bus, or train. The first device  can couple to the communication path  to communicate with the second device .","For illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is described with the first device  as a mobile computing device, although it is understood that the first device  can be different types of computing devices.

The second device  can have a means for coupling with the communication path  to communicate with the first device . The second device  can also be a client type device as described for the first device .","In another example, the first device  can be a particularized machine, such as a mainframe, a server, a cluster server, rack mounted server, or a blade server, or as more specific examples, an IBM System z10\u2122 Business Class mainframe or a HP ProLiant ML\u2122 server. Yet another example, the second device  can be a particularized machine, such as a portable computing device, a thin client, a notebook, a netbook, a smartphone, personal digital assistant, or a cellular phone, and as specific examples, an Apple iPhone\u2122, Palm Centro\u2122, or Moto Q Global\u2122.","For illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is described with the second device  as a non-mobile computing device, although it is understood that the second device  can be different types of computing devices. For example, the second device  can also be a mobile computing device, such as notebook computer, another client device, or a different type of client device. The second device  can be a standalone device, or can be incorporated with a vehicle, for example a car, truck, bus, or train.","Also for illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is shown with the second device  and the first device  as end points of the communication path , although it is understood that the navigation system  can have a different partition between the first device , the second device , and the communication path . For example, the first device , the second device , or a combination thereof can also function as part of the communication path .","The communication path  can be a variety of networks. For example, the communication path  can include wireless communication, wired communication, optical, ultrasonic, or the combination thereof.

For example, the communication path  can include direct connection, personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN) or any combination thereof.","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of a first pairing device  and a second pairing device  paired. The first pairing device  is defined as a device as defined by first device  of  or the second device  of . The second pairing device  is defined as a device as defined by first device  or the second device .","For a specific example, the first pairing device  can be a smartphone. For another example, the second pairing device  can be an in-vehicle GPS navigation system.","A pairing criteria  is defined as the condition, criteria, threshold, or a combination thereof required for the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  to be paired. For a further definition, being paired is defined as a relationship between the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  where the two devices are connected via the communication path  of  or some portion thereof.","For example, the pairing criteria  can be that the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  both have Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. For another example, the pairing criteria  can be that the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  are within a predefined physical distance from each other. For a different example, the pairing criteria  can be set as an availability of a service type  in the first pairing device , the second pairing device , or a combination thereof.","The service type  is defined as the type of application available on the first pairing device , the second pairing device , or a combination thereof. For further definition, an application is defined as function running on the first pairing device , the second pairing device , or a combination thereof. More specifically, the service type  can be of a same type of application or of a different type of application that is compatible.","For example, computer software with the service type  of a navigation program can execute a function to generate a travel route . For another example, the service type  can be a media player that can play audio files, video files, or a combination thereof.","For further examples, the second pairing device  or the in-vehicle GPS navigation system can include the application with the service type  of a speedometer, a fuel gauge, or a combination thereof. The first pairing device  or the smartphone, as an example, can include the application with the service type  that permits a touch sensitive input, a voice input, or a combination thereof. The two applications can be of different types, but are compatible, because the user, the navigation system , or a combination thereof can access the fuel information with a voice input.","The travel route  is defined as the path the navigation system  travels along to reach a target destination . The target destination  is defined as the final stopping where the navigation system  ends its travel.","The first pairing device  can run a first application . The first application  is defined as an application running on the first pairing device . For example, the first application  can represent an inertia based navigation program.","The second pairing device  can run a second application . The second application  is defined as an application running on the second pairing device . For example, the second application  can represent a GPS based navigation program.","As an example, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can run the same application, complementary application, the same application but complementary components, or a combination thereof. For a specific example, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can both run the first application  concurrently. More specifically, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can run the first application  representing a GPS based navigation program.","For another example, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can run complementary application. More specifically, the first pairing device  can run the first application  representing a speedometer. The second pairing device  can run the second application  representing a GPS based navigation program. The first application  and the second application  are different type of the service type  but are complementary. For example, the first application  and the second application  can complement each other by providing the navigation system  with a current physical location  of the navigation system  in the geographic region and the speed, which the navigation system  is traveling along the travel route .","For another example, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can run the same function but complementary components. More specifically, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can run the first application  representing a GPS based navigation program. The first pairing device  can execute the function for generating the travel route  of the first application . The second pairing device  can execute the function of the first application  that generates the map of the geographic region where the navigation  is traveling.","The first pairing device  can access an execution result  of the second pairing device  executing the second application  based on a selection condition . In contrast, the second pairing device  can access the execution result  of the first pairing device  executing the first application  based on the selection condition .","The execution result  is defined as the result of executing the first application , the result of executing the second application , or a combination thereof. For example, the execution result  can represent the travel route  from the current physical location  of the navigation system  to the target destination . The current physical location  is the present physical location of the navigation system  along the travel route .","The selection condition  is defined as the condition, criteria, threshold, or a combination thereof required to determine whether to access the execution result  generated by the first application , the second application , or a combination thereof. For example, the selection condition  can be the granularity of the execution result . The first application  can represent an inertia based navigation program. The second application  can represent a GPS based navigation program.","As illustrated in , the second application  can generate the execution result  that represents navigation information that includes the buildings and restaurants along the travel route  to the target destination . In contrast, the first application  can generate the execution result  that represents navigation information that only includes the travel route  and the target destination . Under the selection condition , the navigation system  can select the second application , because the execution result  of the second application  is more granular than the first application .","For another example, the selection condition  can represent the availability of the service type . For a specific example, the first pairing device  may not have the service type  representing a speedometer. The second application  can represent a speedometer. Based on the selection condition  as the availability of the service type  for speedometer, the first pairing device  can access the execution result  generated by the second application .","A default condition  is defined as the selection condition  set as a default in the navigation system . For example, for the navigation system  that runs a GPS based navigation program can have the default condition  of an inertia based navigation program. More specifically, when the navigation system  travels in a geographic region where there is no reception from the GPS satellite or no navigation service, the navigation system  can attempt to access a device that runs an inertia based navigation program as a default. Some examples of navigation services include cellular triangulation, WiFi signals without GPS satellite, or a combination thereof.","The shortcoming  is defined as a weakness in the application that results in an incomplete solution. For example, the first application  can represent an inertia based navigation program. The execution result  of the first application  can be the travel route  to the target destination  without any granularity as to the details of the geographic area where the navigation system  is traveling, because the inertia based navigation program may not be able to locate the current physical location  of the navigation system  within a geographic region. The shortcoming  of the first application  can be the inability to provide the navigation information that includes the current physical location .","In contrast, the second application  can represent a GPS based navigation program. The execution result  of the second application  can be the travel route  to the target destination  with granularity as to the details of the geographic area where the navigation system  is traveling, because a communication with the GPS satellite aided the navigation system  to pin point the current physical location  within the geographic region. The shortcoming  of the second application  can be the inability to provide the navigation information if the navigation system  is not in communication with the GPS satellite.","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the second pairing device  generating the execution result  generated by the first application  of the first pairing device . For a more specific example, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can be paired by the pairing criteria  representing Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. The second application  can represent a GPS based navigation program.","For example, the selection condition  can represent an availability of an inertia based navigation program, because the navigation system  is running the second application  representing a GPS based navigation program. Furthermore, the navigation system  is traveling in a geographic region where there is no reception from the navigation service. Furthermore, the non-availability of the service type  representing a navigation program can be represented as an unavailable application .","The unavailable application  is defined as a status or type for representing the inaccessibility of a particular type of the service type . For example, the service type  representing a navigation program for the second application  can be the unavailable application  as illustrated in .","As a result, the second pairing device  can access the execution result  generated by the first application  of the first pairing device , since the navigation program in the second pairing device  is the unavailable application . For a specific example, the second pairing device  can display the travel route  where the navigation system  is traveling along the travel route  towards the target destination .","The first pairing device  can also display or not display the execution result  generated by the first application  after the second pairing device  accessed the execution result . The dotted lines can represent the execution result  not displayed on the first pairing device , but accessed and displayed by the second pairing device .","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the first pairing device  generating the execution result  generated by the second application  of the second pairing device . For a more specific example, the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can be paired by the pairing criteria  representing Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. The first application  and the second application  can have the service type  representing a navigation program.","As illustrated in , the selection condition  can represent an availability of the GPS based navigation program, because the navigation system  may require the current physical location  of the first pairing device  within the geographic region at the beginning of the travel. For example, the navigation program installed in the first pairing device  can be inertia based navigation program that cannot locate the current physical location  of the first pairing device . Subsequently, the first pairing device , such as a smartphone, can access the execution result  generated by the second application , an in-vehicle navigation system, after the user carrying the smartphone leaves the vehicle. Furthermore, the navigation system  can run the second application . For a specific example, the first pairing device  can display the travel route  from the current physical location  of the first pairing device  to the target destination  generated by the second application .","The second pairing device  can also display or not display the execution result  generated by the second application  after the first pairing device  accessed the execution result . The dotted lines can represent the execution result  not displayed on the second pairing device , but accessed and displayed by the first pairing device .","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of the second pairing device  entering a command input  into the first pairing device . The command input  is defined as an entry made by the user, the navigation system , or a combination thereof that influences, dictates, or a combination thereof the applications running on the first pairing device , the second pairing device , or a combination thereof. The command input  can be made by manual typing, verbal commands, selection from a list, or a combination thereof.","The command input  can include the selection condition , a service selection , a device selection , or a combination thereof for inputting into the first pairing device . The user of the navigation system  can also enter the service selection , the selection condition , the device selection , or a combination thereof in the second pairing device .","The service selection  is defined as the selection made by the user, the navigation system , or a combination thereof regarding the desired application the device should access. For example, if the user chooses the service selection  to be the GPS based navigation program, the first pairing device  can access the execution result  generated by the second application  of , because the second application  can be the service type  of  representing a GPS based navigation program.","The device selection  is defined as a choice made by the user, the navigation system , or a combination thereof as to which device accesses the execution result . For example, if the second pairing device  can choose the first pairing device . Subsequently, the first pairing device  can access the execution result  generated by the second pairing device  for displaying on the first pairing device . For a specific example, the first pairing device  can display the travel route  to the target destination .","Referring now to , therein is shown an example of pairing between the first pairing device  that is integrated with a vehicle and the second pairing device  representing a mobile device. For example, the first pairing device  can run the service type  of  representing an in-vehicle navigation system. The second pairing device  can represent the smartphone with the service type  representing a digital audio player and navigation program.","The first pairing device  and the second pairing device  can be paired by communicating via the communication path  representing Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. The selection condition  of  can be the granularity of the execution result .","Although the second pairing device  can generate navigation information, because the navigation information generated by the first pairing device  is more granular, the second pairing device  can access and receive the execution result  representing the navigation information generated by the first pairing device . The second pairing device  can access the execution result  from the first pairing device  via Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. The execution result  can include the current physical location  of the navigation system , the current traveling speed of the vehicle, the current fuel level of the vehicle, or a combination thereof.","The second pairing device  can stream audio by sending the execution result  representing an audio music to the first pairing device  via Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. The selection condition  can represent an availability of a noise control capability on the speaker. For a specific example, the first pairing device  can be equipped with active noise reduction capability. The second pairing device  may not be equipped with active noise reduction capability. If the first pairing device  and the second pairing device  are paired, the second pairing device  can send the execution result  to stream the audio file and play the music on the first pairing device . The first pairing device  can play the audio file with less noise due to its active noise reduction capability.","The second pairing device  can receive the command input  even if the second pairing device  is paired to the first pairing device . The second pairing device  can receive the command input  in the form of manual inputs, oral commands, or a combination thereof.","Referring now to , therein is shown an exemplary block diagram of the navigation system . The navigation system  can include the first device , the communication path , and the second device . The first device  can send information in a first device transmission  over the communication path  to the second device . The second device  can send information in a second device transmission  over the communication path  to the first device .","For illustrative purposes, the navigation system  is shown with the first device  as a client device, although it is understood that the navigation system  can have the first device  as a different type of device.
