title: Protection of data in a mixed use device
abstract: Data management techniques are provided for handling information resources. A data management process can account for attributes of information resources by analyzing or interpreting the workspace location, source, channel and device associated with an information resource, and effectuating policies, based on the attributes. Rules govern the attribute determination and policies for access restriction to the information resource. The attributes and policies determined are tagged to the information resource and is dynamically updated based on the attributes related to the information resource within different workspaces, such as a corporate workspace and a personal workspace.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure relates to controlling data and more specifically to systems and methods to control attributes and knowledge tags of data.","Devices used in the office at work and in the security of one's own home no longer have a clear separation. Employees bring devices into work, and, in turn, bring work devices home. According to estimates of at least one survey, about fifty percent of more than 3,000 workers among ten different countries operate smart phones for both work and personal use. With technology becoming increasingly personalized and accessible, a global trend is increasing towards a mixed-use world with devices that are work-home devices. As new client devices (e.g., smart phones, netbooks, palm-held digital assistants, etc.) and mobile technologies emerge, client mobility is increasing in popularity and ease, thus, enabling users to move between offices, labs, homes, and access IT environments with a multitude of different devices.","Clear advantages exist with the rapidly growing mixed-use trend of personal and work devices. However, new paths rarely arrive without new challenges. Providing smart phones to employees, for example, allows an urgent response to client requests and a potential competitive advantage over competition. What companies are realizing is that allowing employees with personally owned devices to access corporate email and other resources, increases productivity, while at a same time saving expenses by offloading cost onto the employee. On the other hand, workplace benefits are increased by when smart devices are provided to employees that extend to personal use outside the office.","Regardless of the advantages, imminent risks are present to security without attention to the dangers. For example, many companies are not even aware of the number of mobile devices (e.g., Windows Mobile, Palm, iPhone, Symbian, etc.) accessing their corporate network unauthorized. Adding to such risks, one estimated survey illustrates that in London alone at least 10,000 phones are left in the backs of taxis, every month. In addition, the British Transport Police report that approximately 45 percent of thefts on London's underground train system are of mobile phones. Furthermore, smart phones carrying data plans and other subscription data services are frequently eligible for upgrade at low or no cost. Phones are traded back to the phone companies, upgraded and replaced without attention to where the information travels. The issues raised beg the question: How long does data on smart devices remain at risk after leaving the user's control, either from a loss of the device that houses the data or a transfer of the data to a different location?","At the most basic level, enterprises of today are driven by their information assets. Any entity or person that values information obtained or created has a stake in keeping information in their control. The alternative option, to treat information itself as \u201cout-of-sight, out-of-mind\u201d is innate with risks that are potentially indefinite. Without a clear separation between corporate and personal data worlds with devices brought into the office, employees could easily put company data at risk, even without intending as much. As boundaries between these worlds continue to erode, investments into protecting data are unavoidable. However, as the lines between personal space and corporate space for a user's data are increasingly blending, the distinction can still be important, and thus, ways to seamlessly manage data are valuable.","The above-described deficiencies in the handling of data are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.","In an example embodiment, a method for data management comprises determining a set of attributes related to an information resource at a first workspace location of a computing system, associating a first tag to the information resource based on a set of rules governing the set of attributes, and detecting an input of a set of inputs to initiate a control function that alters one or more attributes of the set of attributes. The method includes modifying the set of attributes with a set of control function attributes related to the control function in response to the detecting of the input, and associating a second tag to the information resource based on the modified set of attributes. The set of attributes can be used to define a level of restriction based on the set of rules to control the information resource differently at the first workplace and a second workplace. In addition, the method can further comprise analyzing data within the information resource to modify the set of attributes with a set of data attributes, and modifying the set of attributes with the set of data attributes in order to implement policies for different levels of restriction.","In another example embodiment, a computing device comprises an attribute component configured to dynamically determine a set of attributes corresponding to an information resource, a monitoring component configured to monitor a set of inputs corresponding to control functions received by the computing device, a tagging component configured to attach one or more tags to the information resource to control access to the information resource at different levels for different workspaces depending upon the set of attributes, and a policy component configured to associate a set of policies with the set of attributes determined at the different workspaces. The set of attributes include workspace attributes based on a source of the information resource, a workspace location at a creation or first receipt of the information resource and control function attributes that relate to modifying the information resource after the creation or first receipt.","In another example embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium comprises computer-readable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing device to perform operations, comprising determining a set of attributes related to an information resource being created on or first received by a first workspace. The set of attributes includes at least one location attribute, at least one channel attribute, and at least one source attribute that relates to the information resource. The operations further include generating a tag profile from a set of rules based on the set of attributes, generating an extension of the information resource with the tag profile, detecting an input of a set of inputs to initiate a control function that alters one or more attributes of the information resource, and modifying the set of attributes with a set of control function attributes related to the control function in response to the detecting of the input. The operations then update the tag profile based on the set of rules according to the set of attributes.","Other embodiments and various non-limiting examples, scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.","Overview","As indicated in the background, any entity or person that values information obtained or created has a stake in keeping information in their control, which applicable even when data leaves a person's imminent control or has the potential to be acted on after leaving the workplace. For example, information allows for business strategic objectives. Information technology objectives and security, such as intrusion detection systems, extrusion detection systems, antivirus software, firewalls, information resource policy enforcement tools, audit tools, and virtual private networks (VPNs), etc., are to the efficient protection of systems that implement these objectives. Enterprises or corporations are driven by their information assets, which are valuable assets as information represents the know-how of the enterprise, business processes operate on information, and trusted relationships are maintained by information exchange.","Information and security services are linked directly to the information resource that represents the data to be protected. For example, a tagging component configured to attach one or more tags to the information resource to control access to the information resource at different levels for different workspaces depending upon the set of attributes determined at the different workspaces. A first workspace, for example, includes a corporate or employer workspace, in which a mixed use device (e.g., a smart phone or other mobile device) operates for corporate uses. A second workspace can include a personal workspace, in which the mixed use device also operates for personal uses. As the information resources are moved across workspaces, the information resources can have varying levels of access to enable a smooth transition for the user.","In one exemplary aspect of an embodiment, a method manages and protects data stored in a personal workspace and a corporate workspace. The method creates a tag (e.g., a knowledge tag) associated with any information or information resource that is being tracked to enable how a user can interact with the data, makes a decision by employing a policy to either trust the incoming request of a device or not to trust it, and applies an access restriction level (e.g., a lock symbol for a high business interest data item) over a view of data when data is inappropriate for a given context or labels the data as green or red. In other aspects, the method provides an ability to link to a session for accessing the data only if the user has trusted credentials. The method employs a policy component and a rules component for providing transparency between different workspaces about when a user is in compliance, out of compliance, or somewhere in a range, and further tags copyright or watermark data of information resources.","For instance, in one example, a tag component of a system in a cloud network, a server, an application or an operating system, for example, generates a tag profile from a set of rules based on a set of attributes related to an information resource. The set of rules are processed in a rules component that is operatively connected to a policy component that provides a policy designating a level of restriction from a set of policies with corresponding access restrictions to the tag profile. When the information resource is exported, communicated or copied to another location digital right management is applied by detecting the level of access restriction from the tag profile, which is attached to or otherwise integrated as an extension to the information resource.","An example of the system would be to secure a sensitive engineering document being distributed in an environment where the document's recipients could not necessarily be trusted, such as in a personal workspace as opposed to a corporate workspace (e.g., corporate network, corporate server connected session, corporate cloud structure, operating system or application on the corporate cloud or network). Alternatively, an e-mail could be secured with the policy component, so if the email is accidentally forwarded to an un-trusted party, only authorized users would gain access. The system does not necessarily limit the ability for information to be shared; rather rules are only enforced when attempts to gain access are at different workspaces than a corporate workspace, for example. Thus, sensitive information (e.g., information resources) can be shared with users who legitimately have access, and the tag profile can facilitate the easy request of access back to the business owners. In addition, offline use of the information resources allows for employees to create\/access tagged documents having a high business interest or strict level of access restriction without needing network access for certain periods of time.","In the example above, access to the information resources is controlled by the tag component, the rules component, an attribute component and a monitoring component at levels of restriction that differs among the first workspace and a second workspace based on the policy from the set of policies corresponding to corporate workspaces and other personal workspaces. The components of the system operate to restrict access to each information resource by defining the level of restriction in the tag profile, and controlling access to the information resource with the tag profile. For example, if an email sends the information resource to another workspace location, the tag profile is attached with it in order for the employee mixed use device to implement policies within the tag or for other systems on other devices, in which the information resources becomes located at to also implement the same policies. A different workspace location can include, for example, a different directory path, a different network, a different computing system, or a different physical location than the original or corporate workspace.","Personal Space (Data) V. Corporate Space (Data)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","102","104","108","102","108","104"]},"At the creation side , at least one input , such as a create input, is received by a computer device  from a user  to create an information resource, or the information resource is first received across a network, cloud, from a memory location, directory path, etc. The information resource  (e.g., a corporate work template or document) is created in response to the create input or received from a communication channel. The information resource  contains data that could be in various forms or types of value to a corporate entity or an individual for personal use. The creation side  further includes a tagging component  for tagging different attributes among a set of attributes determined or modified over the life of the document, at creation and at any action manipulating the information resource after creation.","Exemplary systems can be configured to create and monitor the information resource , which can comprise data, such as digital, type data, graphical, etc., and can be configured to analyze and\/or interpret the data in the information resource comprising information, about which various attributes can be determined based on the analysis and\/or interpretation performed by an attribute component . Although the information resource  is discussed as being created by the input  from the user , the information resource , as discussed above, may also originate from a transmission channel. For example, an email transmission, portable storage device, or some other mechanism may have transferred the information resource to a workspace, such as a corporate workspace or a personal workspace from a personal device. Thus, the information resource , prior to being received by the computing device , can comprise one or more unknown or unassociated attributes that can be determined and\/or associated with the data at or after creation or first receipt.","The information resource  can comprise attributes such as a timestamp designating a creation time, channel attributes regarding any information about a channel  that the information resource arrived or is transmitted to or from, source attributes such as a directory path in which it is stored or the application properties by which the information resource is created from, as well as attributes regarding the author, the author's credentials (e.g., log-in credentials), the type of data within the information resource  (e.g., type, graphical, numerical, subject nature, etc.), applications for access, the workspace generated at and the like. Other attributes are also envisioned and the examples herein are not meant to exhaust all attributes determined herein, and will be discussed in more detailed below (e.g., spatial information and\/or other qualities such as version, source, destination, one or more potential uses or analyses intended, probability or fact of a causal relation to another item or set of the data collection, control function attributes, etc.) about the information resource .","The tagging component  is operatively connected to an attribute component  that determines the various attributes at the creation side  and at the action side , a policy component  and a rule component . Based on inputs from the attribute component , the policy component  and the rule component , the tagging component  attaches a set of attributes to the information resource in a tag , such as a knowledge tag or a tag profile.","The tag , for example, can be a knowledge tag profile that includes a meta-information that describes or defines some aspect of the information resource . The tag  includes more than traditional non-hierarchical keywords or terms. Rather, the tag  can include metadata that captures knowledge in the form of descriptions, categorizations, classifications, semantics, comments, notes, annotations, hyperdata, hyperlinks, or references that are collected in a profile, such as in a tag profile stored in the tag . The tag  includes information or attributes about the information resource  in order to control sharing away from the workspace (e.g., corporate workspace or personal workspace) based upon attributes of the information resource , policies of the workspace originating the information resource (e.g., the user or employee) regarding permissions and restrictions, and rules governing the attributes.","Different policies, for example, can be encoded in the policy component  and enacted based upon the different natures of the devices providing the resources for the information resource , settings provided by a user, or policies governing the corporate information technology departments. In particular, where, for example, the computing device  is a smart phone having multiple purposes and uses, a policy may correspond with greater scrutiny since the device  will potentially cross between the corporate workspace and the private workspace frequently. Other policies could indicate that the information resource  are tagged as a high business importance, based on the set of attributes determined by the attribute component , rules governing the policies and actions allowed to be taken with the information resource .","Eventually, the information resource  may be acted upon past the point of creation (the creation side ) by some input of a set of inputs that controls certain control functions that manipulate or alter the information resource  further. For example, the information resource  could be manipulated by various control functions, such as being saved, edited beyond the original, moved, uploaded, emailed, published, sent, or any other actionable control function used to manipulate the data (e.g., save to, copy and paste, print screen, etc.). After creation, a monitoring component  monitors a set of inputs to determine whether attributes have changed, been added to or deleted in response to any control function inputs that may alter the information resource . In response to detecting these control functions, the monitoring component  can request the tag  to be updated to reflect the actions that have changed, edited or manipulated the information resource . For example, a history of actions could be recorded within the tag .","For example, in response to the user  conducting an action or control, such as moving, editing, saving, etc. with the information resource  the attribute component  on the action side  modifies or further determines a set of attributes related to the control function performed. For example, attributes that may be further modified in the set of attributes includes time of last entry, time of save, last action performed, where last saved, where previously saved, etc.","Each new and old attribute is collected and stored within a set of attributes by the attribute component . Accordingly, as the information resource  is altered, saved, moved, changed, transmitted, etc. throughout the life of the document, security at different workplaces can also be modified. Some attributes may not be applicable to implementing a security protocol that is high, for example. In some cases, when an attribute changes, such as being saved at a new directory path (e.g., a corporate secure workspace), the security level or restriction level attached to the information resource  may be changed such as with a second tag , which can be an upgraded tag that is attached to the information resource . Alternatively, the security level or restriction level may be lessened depending upon a number of variables governing policy, policy rules, and the attributes of the information resource at any given time, or location on a device or network.","Other configurations of the system are also envisioned and the present disclosure is not limited to any one particular configuration. For purposes of discussing an ordering of components and associated processes, the creation side  and the action side  are delineated. Similar to the creation side , the action side  further includes the attribute component , a tagging component , a policy component , and a rule component  that operatively communicate to enable security at the data level with knowledge tags that follow the information resource  dynamically throughout the digital life of the information resource . These components can comprise hardware and\/or software provided by the operating system, applications, a network or cloud streaming and the like.","In one embodiment, the tag  and the tag  include a tag profile that comprises attributes determined by the attribute components , , and further includes policies of the policy components ,  to restrict access to the information resource  independent of the location of the information resource . For example, a location could be a physical location that is determined from a global positioning system (GPS) device  or other geographical locating mechanism. Alternatively, the location of the information resource  could vary according to a directory path. For example, the information resource , after creation or origination from a communication channel, is saved by an input that is generated on the action side . Upon detecting that the information resource  has been acted on (e.g., a save to), the monitoring component  detects the save input and communicates with the attribute component  to reconfigure or further determine or populate the set of attributes in order to accurately reflect the attributes in an upgrade (e.g., a file path or directory path change or physical location change).","In another embodiment, the rules in the rules components , and  are also encapsulated in the tag ,  or a knowledge tag profile that is continuously modified and updated to reflect both past actions and attributes, but also illustrate current attributes, which could be used for a later policy at a later action (e.g., edit, save, move, send, upload, download, etc) taken towards the information resource , or be used for a current policy implementation by the policy component , and .","The rule components  and  are configured to implement various sets of rules for different functions. In one example the rule components  and  are configured to implement a set of rules for the attribute component  to select various attributes for policy consideration or encoding in the tag , . For example, some attributes may be of such small concern, such as what font the information resource  contains in cases where the information resource  comprises a word document or a typed resource to be accessed. Other attributes that relate to the type of applications use to access the information resource  or a set of data attributes related to the kind of data and applications for the type of data, as well as copyrighted material or sections to be watermarked may be of relevant importance to the corporate policies.","The rule components  and  are also configured to implement a set of rules for the policy component to determine a level of restriction. For example, a set of frame based logic, or rule based logic may contain various \u201cIf, then,\u201d or \u201cif, and, then\u201d statements and the like that encode weight according to a range of a metrics for different attributes. These weights can include any scale from 1 to 10, for example, decimal points, binary limits and the like that can then be communicated to the policy components  and  to determine a level of access restriction based on a set of policies. The weighting can be configured based on an averaging or other means to attach importance to attributes of the information resource .","In another embodiment, the tag  and the tag  comprise the same knowledge tag with a different profile over time. In other words, the tag  includes the same profile information related to the information resource  as the tag , but could have additional attributes or different attributes considered by the rules in the rules component . As stated above, the tag , for example, may include the set of attributes, the set of policies and the set of rules or results contained by the tag , and each set could follow in the history of the profile encapsulated by the knowledge tag . The tag  is thus upgraded to record pertinent attributes throughout the life cycle of the information resource . Attributes, policies and rules determined or modified from previous locations (e.g., different physical or digital pathways), could be saved in a breadcrumb view within the profile of the knowledge tag , for example.","While not all attributes, policies, and rules may be fully encapsulated in the tag , , certain the fundamental ones, as determined by corporate policies may become inherent as an extension in order to not lose the original intent of the creator for restricting access. For example, where an information resource originates on a network or a workspace that considers information created on zones or file locations designated as the corporate workspace with high security, the policies for the information resource  may be fixed within the knowledge tag ,  in order to maintain the particular access restrictions attached to the data of the information resource , regardless of being transported, communicated, published, shared, or otherwise used for other uses than residing in a file path of the corporate network.","Referring now to , illustrates an exemplary system  that manages and protects an information resource . The information resource  can reside on a network cloud, a server, a database or a memory at a directory or file path, in which it was created or stored after being communicated, such as by email, external drive or other computer storage media. The information resource  is any digital information having data that may be of value to an owner of the system or memory where the information resource  resides. For example, the information resource  could be a Word document, a digital picture, a JPEG, TIFF, PDF, or other file or document type having a filename extension applied to indicate specific encoding or file format of the contents or usage.","The system  includes an attribute component , a rule component , a policy component , and a tagging component  that are operatively connected to one another to provided security to the information resource  at the data level so that access restrictions and policies dynamically update and follow with the information resources of a corporate workspace. As a result, the information resource  is sharable with employee work-home devices (e.g., smart phones, laptops, etc.), which are used at work and elsewhere outside of work, without losing security to the information resource  regardless of the location and provide a seamless security to the data of the information resource . The system , for example, may reside at an operating system level, in conjunction with or as a file manager system that provides a user interface to work with file systems. Alternatively, a server or a cloud network could host the system  to protect each information resource according to different attributes, rules and policies that integrate with each information resource regardless of a location. The cloud network, for example, could provide the system  as an application stream in a certain protocol (e.g., HTTP, CIFS, RTSP, etc.). In another embodiment, the system could be encapsulated in a fully virtualized application and executed as if it were fully installed on each device interfacing with a corporate workspace having corporate data.","The policy component  includes a restriction level setting component  and a manual setting component . The policy component  summarizes regulations that are addressed in access security to the information resource  with a tag profile . For instance, the restriction level setting component  defines how the information resource  is controlled and protected through defined classifications according to what purpose, ability to be shared, conditions for sharing, location for storage, timeframes for storing, safeguarding levels, subset security for information within the information resource , distortion levels of the data or watermarking of the data and the like.","The policy component  summarizes business or corporate policies of information resources on the devices or systems operating on the corporate network or cloud structure. Policies and regulations are described in a set of policies and procedures for different information resource classes, for example. The corporate policies and regulations are expressed in the restriction level access component . For example, user obligations, levels of access and definitions can be controlled and set in the restriction level access component . For example, metrics, such as key risk indicators or the like are capable of defining that the information resource  is of high business impact or subject to a risk that meets, exceeds or is subject to a probability threshold to a risk as defined in the restriction level access component, as well as weight certain attributes. The policy component  is configured to define classifications for the information resource, such as high business impact, advisable, moderate, or low levels of risk and associate levels of security or risk to the restriction level settings component  to implement access controls or settings or communicate the levels of security within a tag profile . Other different classifications or settings are also envisioned and can be implemented in various ways, such as providing an encryption lock to the information resource  for high levels of access.","In one embodiment, the policy component provides a color indication to the document of being a high risk (red) and communicate that a higher level of restriction is associated with the information resource , than levels requiring less restrictions to access. The restrictions, for example, provide locks based on the color indications (e.g., green, yellow, red) that lock the data from being acted upon, such as printed, uploaded, transmitted, re-located, edited, print-screened, other control functioning inputs and the like. A lower level of restriction, for example, may allow personal sharing through emailing, relocating, uploading, reading, editing as well as other manipulation of the information resource. The policy component  includes a manual settings component  that provides manual settings to be entered and weighted by the corporation policy or the IT departments, for example, such as by a key risk indicator. The policy component  including the restriction level settings component  and the manual settings component  are operationally connected to identify the overall information resource governance for a corporate workspace and distinguish levels of corporate information assets with personal levels of access on a device, such as a smart phone or other work-home device, for example.","The rules component  is communicatively connected to the policy component  and the attributes component , and is configured to provide logical rules governing the policy component  and the attribute component . The rules component , for example, includes an access rules component  that governs indicators (e.g., key risk indicators) for the policy component  to factor in to the policies for information resources on the corporate workspace (e.g., corporate network, cloud, server, devices, etc.). Information resource classifications and policy rules are encoded in information resource rules processed according to the access rules component . For example, information resources can be classified according to ownership (e.g., employee credentials, workspace, etc.), origin (e.g., source), and location.","The attribute rule component  is configured to provide rules for determining and classifying attributes related to the information resource . Rules for classifying attributes according to device, communication channels, origination or sources of the information resource  are communicated to the attributes component , which, in turn, determines attributes related to the classifications. Attributes of the information resource  are thus classified according to predetermined criteria, which may be provided by the corporate owner, or other personal owner of the information resource. The information resource  has a defined ownership, such as the corporate workspace, and data otherwise in-between or not wholly owned by the corporate workspace is designated as such. The ownership, for example, is usually expressed in the business purposes, in the case of corporate ownership.","The attribute component  of the system  determines and modifies the membership of a set of attributes related to information resources present on a workspace or corporate workspace according to data rules of the rule component . Each workspace may include a memory location, such as a zone of memory or a network database, or a network database managed by a server for a corporate workplace. Employees may be provided credentials to log-in or otherwise access the business workspace environments through their computing devices. A personal workspace, for example, may include a file or directory that allows a user or employee to gather various source code files and resources to work with, which may further include a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer users for development. In either case, a workspace acts as an environment where a user can work, isolated from external components for the duration of a task.","The attribute component  dynamically determines a set of attributes depending upon the environment of the information resource  and based on the rules received from the attribute rule component  of the rule component . The set of attributes include source attributes  that are based on workspace attributes of the information resource , such as application type being used to open, create or save the information resource, location data related to the file space or directory path, in which the information resource is saved to, a temporal attribute (e.g., a time stamp), authorship (e.g., the user and user credentials used to access or create the information resource), a version attribute (e.g., Word 2003), a network location, storage location, a relation to other information resources, a prospective use of the information resource, and the like. In other words, the source attributes  determined by the attribute component  describe the information resource  according to the data's origination (e.g., Google apps, Word, some other application, a work SharePoint, website, etc.), such as with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). In addition, the source attributes  include descriptors or descriptions of who owns the data, such as the credentials used to access the system supporting, storing or allowing creation of the information resource (e.g., an employee credential, job title, security level of the user, etc.). Further, source attributes  can include the entity or corporate identification that controls the data or may have legal rights to the data created on the device.","The attribute component  is further configured to determine a set of channel attributes  and a set of device attributes . The set of channel attributes  includes attributes or characteristics related to the data used to communicate the information resource , such as in a digital bit stream (e.g., from a sender). For example, header information is determined in the set of channel attributes  that includes supplemental data (e.g., the sender or recipient's IP address, the protocol governing the payload format and other formats, etc.) that is often placed at the beginning of information resources or the payload, which is stored or transmitted when the information resource  is received from a network, external server, etc.","The device attributes  are also modified by the attribute component  to include characteristics related to the device that received or otherwise created the information resource . For instance, device attributes can include the device name used on the network that downloaded, received, created, or stored the information resource. A time of creation, device network address, device status, operating system, applications used for the information resource , name of a job associated with the device, link type, origin node name, the device system identification, and the like may be attributes determined by the attribute component  and dynamically modified in the set of device attributes  throughout the life of ownership or of the information resource  itself.","As the information resource  becomes shared or otherwise communicated, the set of device attributes  is dynamically upgraded or modified to reflect attributes of shared devices that also change, as with the set of source attributes  and the set of channel attributes , for example. Thus, attributes related to the information resource  determined in the set of source attributes , the set of channel attributes  and the set of device attributes  is dynamically upgraded based on the current status, location, device and person communicating or controlling the information resource  (e.g., spatial information and\/or other qualities such as version, source, destination, one or more potential uses or analyses intended, probability or fact of a causal relation to another item or set of the data collection, etc.).","The policy component , the rule component  and the attribute component  communicate their respective outputs to the tagging component , which creates the tag profile  and attaches the tag profile  to the information resource  as an integrated set of properties or extension(s). For example, a permissions restriction tag component  receives policies to set or encapsulate according to the policy component . Levels of restrictions set according to policies in the policy component  are determined to be tagged by the permissions restriction tag component  according to various mechanisms, such as locks, masks, color labels and the like, for example, which are then communicated to a tag extension populater  of the tagging component .","The tagging component  further comprises a rule tag component  that further determines the rules and attributes in which the rules apply and communicates each to the tag extension populater . The knowledge tag profile then becomes populated by the tag extension populater  and integrated with the information resource .","In one embodiment, the system  further includes a monitoring component  that comprises a control function action mechanism  and an input interface . The monitoring component , for example, is communicatively coupled to the attribute component  and is configured to monitor a set of control function inputs at the input interface . The set of inputs monitored include any input that provides an action or enacts a control function toward the information resource, such as a save as, saving to, sending, uploading, downloading, editing, further tagging, etc. The monitoring component  is configured to observe accesses to the information resource  and allow authorization to perform the inputs provided by a user based on the policy incorporated within knowledge tag profile .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","302","302"]},"For instance, in still further non-limiting embodiments, exemplary systems  can be configured to perform various operations on information resources including further analyses, interpretation, and inference, determining relationships between attributes such as possibility, probability, causality, and so on, creating and associating further policies, data organization, data retention, data collocation, creating indices, creating statistical or other summaries, and so on, etc., by employing information resource attributes, interval, and\/or policies. Thus,  depicts information resource tag  comprising information resource tag  as well as any attributes that are determined and\/or assigned or associated with information resource tag , any computed and\/or assigned intervals, and\/or determined, created, and\/or associated policies related to intervals and\/or attributes.","Note that while  depicts the information resource tag  as comprising a one to one correlation between attributes and policies (e.g., each attribute shown with a corresponding policy), the subject application is not so limited. For instance, policies can concern more than one attribute and or interval and any combination. Thus, exemplary systems  can flexibly and dynamically analyze data, attributes, and intervals, can create policies, and can facilitate performing unstructured operations and analyses thereon, whereas conventional systems such as vector clocks and temporal databases would be limited by their inherent rigid structural specifications.","As a result the information resource tag  received by exemplary systems  can be enriched according to various aspects of the subject application to facilitate dynamically creating insights into attributes of information resources and relationships therein, perform stream analysis, perform root cause analysis, generate trust-based results, data organization, aging, and retention, creating inferences from big data streams, and so on. Further note that while the information resource tag  is depicted as comprising the information resource tag  and corresponding attributes and policies, various embodiments of the subject application are not so limited. In other words, further non-limiting embodiments can associate attributes, intervals, policies, and so on by appending or modifying such information into the data or otherwise (e.g., tracking by means of a file system, database system, data management rights system, etc.).","As a non-limiting example, in a social networking analysis regarding data concerning a user's friends, a user can be interested in updates that have happened recently. However, updates that are relatively old data are typically treated with the same priority as regards storage and retention as the new updates (e.g., only the presentation aspects of new data are given priority). In a further non-limiting example regarding analysis and correlation of financial stock trends, the user can be interested in recent developments and updates concerning a stock, to the exclusion of developments more remote in time. For example, while a historical Form 10-K annual report for a company is conventionally disregarded in the presentation of stock price data, recent news developments concerning litigation against the company, can restore relevance of the historical 10-K in the analysis of stock price data trends. As a further illustration, flat representation of temporal attributes would typically treat the historical Form 10-K data as a file perhaps having a timestamp, and which may even have a conventional temporal interval associated with it of one year or one quarter (e.g., until the next update). However, it is clear that litigation attributes of the data (e.g., parties and subject of the litigation, type of litigation, etc.) can have a longer event horizon, and thus a longer temporal significance or relevance than simple financial attributes of the historical Form 10-K data. In addition, data concerning a recent news story that names the same parties, subject of the litigation, or type of litigation can be causally connected or of great relevance to and\/or change the significance of the historical Form 10-K data in the context of reviewing stock price trend data. Accordingly, various embodiments of subject application facilitate accounting for such disparate and changing significance of different attributes and enable the creation of policies for various functions (e.g., collocating data, creating indices over data, aging the impact of data out of the data collection, and so on, etc.) that conventional systems have heretofore failed to consider.","In one non-limiting example, in determining whether events are causally related versus merely correlated, exemplary systems can employ intervals such as temporal intervals to determine the possibility of causal relationships, correlations, and so on. For instance, for two pieces of data or events occurring sequentially in time, e.g., a precedent and an antecedent, the precedent and antecedent can be correlated or uncorrelated. In addition, the precedent can be causally related to the antecedent (e.g., the precedent is the cause of the antecedent), but the antecedent cannot be the cause of the precedent, because the precedent occurs prior in time, or prior in the temporal interval than the antecedent. Accordingly, in various non-limiting embodiments, exemplary systems can employ intervals such as temporal intervals to determine causal relationships in addition to correlations, and so on, as described herein. In a similar manner regarding physical proximity of data or information resources in space, two pieces of data or events occurring sequentially in time may be precluded from having a causal relationship due to a lack of physical proximity. Thus, the subject application can advantageously facilitate distinguishing between causal relationships and correlations as described above.","In a non-limiting of exemplary embodiments, attributes and intervals regarding temporal can employ a simple linear ordering in time such that vector clock systems can be used, such that inferences can be made from this vector clock time not rather than absolute clock time or some similar notion such as system clock time. In other exemplary embodiments other notions of time can be employed, such as relative time based on a sequence of events (e.g., treating data as a sequence of events that can be causally related), GPS clock time, etc. In addition, such notions of time can be employed to create inferences such as Bayesian inferences to update uncertainty associated with data (and predictions or inferences) in a probability model, according to a further non-limiting aspect.","Thus, in non-limiting embodiments, exemplary systems  can dynamically generate or learn temporal intervals (e.g., as the data or events come into the system, etc.) of relevance for data or events, for such purposes as determining causality as described above. It can be understood that time data, such as timestamps, like spatial data, such as GPS coordinates, are generally considered fixed values or hard values that are relatively absolute in relation to associated data or events. However, temporal intervals of relevance can be highly dependent upon a number of factors. As a further illustration, temporal intervals of relevance can be dependent upon non-limiting factors including usage or intended usage of the data or event, the user or users of the data or event, the environment of the data or event (e.g., geospatial location of the data or event), etc.","In other non-limiting embodiments, exemplary systems  can generate or learn temporal intervals for causality purposes over time. Thus, in various embodiments, for an event or data, rather than simply being time stamped when it came into the system, exemplary systems can dynamically determine (e.g., via a temporal Bayesian network, etc.) temporal intervals such as how long to remember that the data or event holds (e.g., the probability of the data or event remaining true, remains in adherence to a temporal interval based policy, etc.) based on the type of analysis. For example, as described above, an observation or analysis related to information resource attributes or events can become less precise overtime, such that the desire for retention or inclusion of the data or event related to the observation or analysis becomes less desirable.","In addition, as further described above, different attributes of the data or events can have different timelines over which the attributes age (e.g., the significance of the attribute or associated data become less relevant over time compared to other attributes or data). Thus, in further non-limiting embodiments, exemplary systems can employ the dynamically determined temporal intervals for other purposes such as (e.g., data organization, reorganization, restriction access and\/or retention on size limited devices or components such as disk storage, memory, etc.). Accordingly, exemplary systems  can automatically tune themselves to remember data or events and\/or attributes, intervals, and\/or policies for a predetermined period of time (e.g., according to a temporal interval based policy, according to intended, predetermined, and\/or inferred prospective uses or analyses, according to determined and\/or inferred relationships with other data or events, etc.).","It is noted that, while the above assumes that the initial location-based data is simply updated with a new workspace or location-based data point, it can also be that, based on inferences made by exemplary systems , a location attribute is updated for the location-based data due to understanding of relations with information resource tag  or other data.","The same applies to discussions of attributes relating to source of data (e.g., data source, number of sources, number of sources that affirm or disaffirm an inference, etc.) within the discussion of confidence in data. An initial data point of the information resource tag  or information resource tag  can have a source attribute and can have device attributes, channel attributes, data attributes and the like associated with it. Confidence in the attributes of the data can depend on an initially presumed reliability. Confidence in the data, source attribute, and the like can depend on such things as the passage of time (e.g., firms go out of business, people switch cell phones, URLs (uniform resource locators) can change, etc.). In addition, further data from new sources can reaffirm or disaffirm data, the relative numbers of which can impact, not only confidence in the data itself, but also inferences drawn therefrom, source attributes of the initial data point, intervals, and confidence therein. Thus, if there are many affirming data sources, it may be desired to unequally weight data from a particular source to accomplish data organization, policy retention for access restrictions, data analysis, and so on. Thus, various embodiments of the subject application can employ weighting functions, for example, to facilitate weighting of information resource attributes (e.g., down-weighting of aged data, etc.) according to various policy considerations and attributes related to information resources.","Referring to , an exemplary system  is illustrated to enable security at a data level. As discussed above, information resources shared among different locations and with mixed use devices, such work-home devices (e.g., smart phones, laptops, etc.) are shared with security integrated into each information resource. For example, corporate data is separated from personal data to enable different levels of restriction to access the information resource in order to make both accessible from multiple device platforms.","A server  and a client  are communicatively coupled across a network channel  for applications and data to be synchronized. When connected to the server , an operating system  and applications  are updated and processed with a processor . The operating system  and applications  are virtualized and streamed to the client . For example, applications are encapsulated and portions of the application's code, data and settings are delivered when client devices needed them, instead of a complete application being delivered before the startup of the client .","In one example, the exemplary system  dynamically enables applications available to users to define data of an information resource and policies controlling how the data is used. The system , for example, includes the server  where software and data for a corporate business are stored. The network channel  provides delivery of applications such as from a cloud network where the provisioning of dynamically scalable and virtualized resources (e.g., the operating system  and applications ) are communicated and synchronized. The client  receives a virtualized operating system , applications  and user data . Additionally, a personal virtualized operating system  with user applications  and user personal data  is encapsulated in separate containers either on a client device, such as a mixed use work-home device (e.g., corporate smart phone), or on a personal cloud. The corporate data  is thus stored securely in a corporate container, for example, and managed in accordance with the corporate policies, which can be identified for each information resource within a tag profile, as discussed above.","Referring to , is another exemplary system  that includes a corporate server  that synchronizes corporate data and services with a client device  and a corporate device . Users can be provided corporate data and services along with personal data and services to a mix of devices from a cloud network . An operating system  and applications  can differentiate between data items and data of an information resource  (e.g., Word document for home versus Word document for work). In this regard, a same or similar application has different versions depending on a corporate workspace or a personal workspace. A tag component  having location capability such as with a GPS or other location information can facilitate determinations of categories of use as part of the context the application uses to make decisions about information resources, for example. Information resources are treated differently, for example, depending on the source of the information resource , a user, and a device operating on a workspace.","The information resource  is attached with a knowledge tag  according to the tag component . A rules component , a policy component , a monitoring component , and an attribute component  operate synergistically to provide access restrictions to the information resource  through the knowledge tag . The monitoring component  monitors changes made and observes accesses to the information resource . The policy component  in turn determines whether policies allow or deny a certain operation based on a data category, which is classified according to attributes determined in the attribute component . The rules component provides rules for attributes determined and classifies the data according to source attributes, device attributes and channel attributes associated with the information resource .","In one embodiment, the knowledge tag  of the information resource  is dynamically altered as the data is altered or the workspace changes. For example, where the information resource is emailed to different domains, the policy component  could determine that the information resource  is personal or corporate and provide appropriate access restrictions based on the domains. These access restrictions can then be encapsulated within the knowledge tag  of the information resource  upon attachment or upload.","Exemplary system  can be further configured to determine, create, and\/or associate one or more policies related to one or more attributes with the data. In a non-limiting embodiment, exemplary system  can facilitate attaching significance to data (e.g., policies associated with attributes that allow data in the past or a different location to be lower ranked based upon personal preferences, the specification of a personal ranking system, weighting of historical data, etc.), which can facilitate weighting data so it can become less relevant to subsequent analyses, and so on via an algorithm, such as a Fuzzy logic or Fuzzy means algorithm. In a further non-limiting example, various embodiments can enable the attachment of temporal significance to data to facilitate weighting historical data as it ages so it can become less relevant, and so on. In yet other non-limiting embodiments, policies related to one or more attributes with the data can be employed by exemplary systems  to facilitate data organization, data retention, data collocation, creating indices, creating statistical or other summaries, and so on, etc. within the knowledge tag .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610"]},"At , a set of inputs that initiate control functions altering one or more attributes of the information resource are detected. For example, a save to, move, edit, copy and paste, upload, attach, print screen, etc. are detected. At , the set of attributes is modified with a set of control function attributes related to the input to one or more control functions detected. The set of attributes is updated based on the editing or controls that manipulated or changed the information resource, for example. At , a second tag is associated to the information resource based on the modified set of attributed.","Exemplary Networked and Distributed Environments","One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the various embodiments for data management described herein can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment, and can be connected to any kind of data store.
