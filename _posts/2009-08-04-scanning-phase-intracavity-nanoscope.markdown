abstract: A Scanning Phase Intracavity Nanoscope as a measurement system can be realized with a reference laser cavity and a sample laser cavity superimposed upon each other to operatively propagate two laser beams. The sample laser cavity is operatively formed by the sample to be measured. A measurement of the sample is based on differences in the reference laser cavity and the sample laser cavity determined from difference in the two laser beams.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTEREST STATEMENT","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/137,893, filed 4 Aug. 2008, which application is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. NSF ECS-0601612. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to lasers and measurements using lasers.","The quest to visualize ever smaller, fainter structures has driven much scientific progresses. Spatial resolution and contrast, essential factors in imaging, are limited by the wavelength and the intensity noise, respectively. While shorter wavelengths (X-rays, electron beams) can improve resolution and fluorescent labeling can increase contrast, these benefits come at the expense of harmful radiation and invasive sample preparation.","The \u201cState of the Art\u201d in conventional optical microscopy is limited by the wavelength. There have been attempts to \u201cbreak the barrier\u201d of the wavelength. These attempts reach fraction of wavelength resolution. The general trend for improved resolution has been to develop sources and techniques at much shorter wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength, the more harmful the radiation. Most of the techniques with shorter wavelength radiation require complex environmental condition (for instance, in vacuum for the electron microscope), and most generally sophisticated sample preparation.","The resolution of a traditional optical microscope is limited by the maximum spatial frequency that can be transmitted by a microscope objective, leading to a resolution limit of \u03bb\/(2n), where nis the numerical aperture of the microscope objective, which is \u2248250 nm for visible light microscopy. Current methods that seek to build three-dimensional reconstructions of a sample using the diffraction of light by index of refraction variations, such as Optical Diffraction Tomography (ODT), are ultimately limited by this resolution limit. In addition, in living cells, many structures of interest are either too small or do not have an index difference large enough for suitable contrast. For this reason, fluorescence microscopy has become the most widely used optical technique for studying living cells.","In fluorescence microscopy, the cellular component of interest is labeled with a fluorophore for specificity and contrast. Upon excitation with (usually) visible light, the fluorophore is excited and emits at a longer wavelength, a Stoke's shifted emission that is collected by a microscope objective and separated from the excitation light. For studies of extra-cellular membrane components, fluorescent probes can be pre-conjugated to ligands or antibodies. Ligand and antibody probes have difficulty passing the cell membrane. Thus for studies of cytoplasmic or nuclear components, cells are typically transfected to express chimeric proteins-proteins containing an additional fluorescent protein such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) or other variants. As expression levels in transfected cells can vary significantly, it becomes difficult to label more than two intra-cellular components simultaneously. In all cases, labeling procedures must be verified to not interfere with normal function.","During imaging, excited fluorophores can undergo a transition from an excited singlet state to a much longer lived triplet state. This long lived state has an increased probability to interact with molecular oxygen, which can both irreversibly chemically alter the fluorophore (photo-bleaching) and create a free radical singlet oxygen that can further damage other molecules in the cell. The destruction of the fluorophore by photo-bleaching limits the amount of emitted and collected photons from each probe, placing restrictions on long term studies and the super-resolution techniques discussed below, which require high signal to noise.","Several techniques have been demonstrated that improve the resolution of the fluorescence microscope. Techniques such as 4\u03c0 microscopy and IM provide a near uniform lateral and z-axis resolution of near 100 nm, using coherent collection by two opposing high-numerical aperture microscope objectives and deconvolution. However, these techniques still rely on a linear response of the probe to excitation light, and merely extend the resolution limit, but do not break it. Both Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) and saturated patterned excitation microscopy make use of the non-linearity inherent in fluorescence saturation to break the diffraction limit, and both have demonstrated a resolution of better than 50 nm. Recently, several techniques that rely on the photo-activable or photo-switchable fluorescent probes have been demonstrated to give better than 20 nm resolution by building images through the localization of sparse sets of individual fluorescent probes. Localization of single probes can be performed with accuracy of better than 10 nm with relatively few collected photons (<1000), however repetitively preparing (by photo-activation) and imaging a sparse set of emitters leads to collection times of minutes at best. All of these techniques require a fluorescent probe, are limited by signal to noise and are ultimately constrained by photo-bleaching.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, various example embodiments of the invention. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these and other embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized, and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made to these embodiments. The various embodiments are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one or more other embodiments to form new embodiments. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.","In various embodiments, apparatus comprise a Scanning Phase Intracavity Nanoscope (SPIN). SPINs can be configured with the carrier frequency of two mode-locked pulse trains used to associate the position of a sample with that of a reference plane. By arranging for the two pulse trains to interfere, a beat note at a frequency proportional to the difference in their position is produced.","In various embodiments, an optical instrument is based on making differential measurements on the phase of two circulating ultrashort laser pulses in order to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. The underlying physical principles include the conversion of phase (or distance) as small as a billionth (10) of a wavelength inside a laser to a measurable frequency and the discovery that the injection of even one trillionth (10) of one pulse into the other is sufficient to change measurably the frequency of the latter. Equipped with mechanical nano-positioners, a complete instrument, which can be called a Scanning Phase Intracavity Nanoscope (SPIN), is unique and provides a novel approach in imaging. Such imaging can have a variety of applications. For example, such imaging can be applied, but not limited to monitoring and controlling drug dynamics at the intra-cellular level.","In various embodiments, the Scanning Phase Intracavity Nanoscope can be realized as a compact instrument that can provide three dimensional images of a biological object, with a spatial resolution of 1 nm, in vivo, using light. The whole instrumentation may be inside an ultrashort pulse laser. The sample to be observed can be in any host material, water or tissue; there is no sample preparation required. It is generally thought that the resolution of an optical microscope is limited by the wavelength of light, about 1 micron. To image smaller objects, the trend has been to go to shorter wavelength (electron microscope, x-rays, etc . . . ), which implies samples in vacuum, and their exposure to harmful radiation. Laser sources from the early days of their existence had been employed in medical, industrial and scientific applications. Their employment, even in most sophisticated fluorescence microscope, was focused on using the energy and color of such sources, ultimately leaving phase, the most delicate property of such sources untamed.","In various embodiments, a method is based on a well established realization that a laser cavity is a unique environment in which a minute change in phase can be converted in a measurable frequency. Unlike existing interferometric metrology, that are based on monitoring the amplitude and hence inherit intensity noise, this method translates a spatial information into frequency, independent of the intensity of the laser pulses. This method is realized by a design to generate optical pulses circulating simultaneously in a laser cavity, labeled as reference and sample pulses, each one switched to its proper destination (reference or sample) at the tail of the cavity. In an example embodiment, the laser runs with 10such pulses per second, where on a detector the differential phase is converted to a \u201cbeat\u201d signal, proportional to the phase change introduced by the sample. As opposed to classical interferometry, where a difference between the intensity of two beams is detected, it is here the difference between two optical frequencies that is detected. A detected beat signal change of 1 Hz corresponds to a phase change of 10, of a displacement resolution of 10m (or 0.01 pm or 0.0001 \u212b).","In various embodiments, an intracavity phase technique provides a unique sensitivity to very small scattering at a desired crossing point. The pulse operation provides a specific coupling localization of the order of the pulse length. This technique can be capable of measuring a reflection of an interface of less than one part in 10. A manifestation of this property is the SPIN potential to reduce the light level on the sample, and observe a weak return, at the expense of reduced but more desirable spatial resolution (a spatial resolution of 1 nm is more useful than 0.01 pm).","In various embodiments, the transfer of a one-dimensional, sub nm spatial resolution, to all three dimensions with nm resolution can be realized. This can be achieved by scanning the beam not only along transverse coordinates, but rotationally along all directions. The key words in these embodiments, Scanning, Phase, and Intracavity make for the name of such an instrument, Scanning Phase Intracavity Nanoscope or SPIN.","A SPIN can be applied to providing ultrahigh-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) images of objects, biological and others such as semiconductor structures, on the nanoscale, while using light. By exploiting the high sensitivity of the carrier laser frequency to a small perturbation in its cavity, a 1 dimensional (1D) resolution of 1 pm can be achieved. In 3D scanning with one \u03bcm wavelength light, the maximum expected resolution is 1 nm, which is a factor 1000\u00d7 better than the resolution of any optical imaging system. A phase to frequency conversion in a laser cavity leads to sensitivity up to 1\/10000000 of the optical wavelength.","An instrument for Intracavity Phase Interferometry (IPI) involves the following steps:\n\n","In classical interferometry, one measures the intensity difference resulting from the superposition of two monochromatic beams of difference phase, as shown in . In the intracavity interferometry, a sample cavity and a reference cavity are superimposed. The slight difference in length of each cavity results in a difference in wavelength or optical frequency, as shown in . Superimposing the two, one can see a \u201cMoire pattern,\u201d as shown in , which can immediately tell the difference in wavelength. A difference of wavelength as small as \u03bb\/L\u00d7\u03bb corresponds to 1 millionth of the wavelength, or 1 picometer. Instead of observing a Moire pattern of two superimposed standing waves, one makes the time domain equivalent: the reference laser is an electric field oscillating at the optical frequency v=c\/(\u03bb), the sample laser is an electric field oscillating at the optical frequency \u2212v=c\/(\u03bb), one mixes the two signals on a detector to record v\u2212v, which is an optical frequency that can be as small as 1 Hz.","When a need arises to perform a length measurement with higher accuracy, interferometric measurements are typically performed. An example of such an arrangement is the Michelson interferometer sketched in , where a 50% beam splitter  sends equal parts of the laser beam from laser  to a reference mirror (REF)  and a sample mirror\u2014(S) . If the two mirrors ,  are at equal distance from the beam splitter , a detector (D)  sees a large signal V corresponding to the constructive interferences of the beams reflected by both mirrors. If the sample mirror is given a small (<<\u03bb) displacement \u0394l, the change in detector signal is V[1\u2212cos(2\u03c0\u0394l\/\u03bb)]\u22482V(\u03c0\u0394l\/\u03bb). A change of 1 \u03bcV over 1 V would imply a displacement of \u0394l=0.35\u00b710\u03bcm.","By contrast,  illustrates a technique in which both a reference mirror  and a sample mirror  are part of the same laser cavity  having gain medium  and beam splitter , and therefore determine the optical frequency of the laser beams impinging on them. The laser frequency v=c\/\u03bb should be such that the wavelength \u03bb is an exact submultiple of the cavity length, L hence \u03bb=2L\/N. If L is the length of the laser cavity with mirror REF , and L+\u0394l the length of the cavity with the sample mirror S , the detector D  in  will see a modulation at the difference frequency \u0394v=v\u0394l\/L, or a 70 kHz signal (L\u22481 m) for the displacement of 0.35 nm cited above. Such a signal is considerably easier to detect than an amplitude change of 1 \u03bcV over 1 V. A frequency change of only 1 Hz can be detected, corresponding to an elongation \u0394l of only 5\u00b710nm.","Nanoscopy can include converting a distance measurement into a phase differential between the two pulses, extending a depth resolution to the transverse dimensions, where tomography is applied, and creating a laser source in which two pulses circulate independently.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","401","403","402","410","420","400","470","480"]},"At each passage of a pump pulse  through an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) crystal , a signal pulse  is generated. In this arrangement, there are two pulses circulating in the signal cavity . Each pulse is controlled by a combination of Pockels cell  and polarizing beam splitter (P)  into the reference arm and the sample arm S, which receives the probe pulse. An electro-optic phase modulator (EOM)  in the reference arm takes control of a phase coupling between the two pulses (electro-optic dithering). The two intracavity pulses are extracted from cavity  via an intracavity beam splitter , and, with appropriate delay, are interfered on a detector D . The latter records a pulse train modulated at the \u201cbeat frequency\u201d (as shown in the circle ), which is the difference between the carrier frequencies of the two pulse trains.  shows the Fourier transform of the reading of the frequency difference having a bandwidth of 1 Hz, corresponding to the sampling time interval (approximately 1 second).","In various embodiments, SPIN achieves higher resolution based on the ability to measure a fraction ( 1\/10) of a wavelength, instead of reducing wavelength to achieve higher resolution. In SPIN, the position of the sample with that of a reference plane is associated with the carrier frequency of two mode-locked pulse trains. Making the two pulse trains interfere produces a beat note at a frequency proportional to the difference in their position. SPIN uses the conversion of phase or sub-wavelength displacement into a beat frequency.","The beat note bandwidth, which is a measure of the spatial resolution of the system, can be quite narrow if the two pulses are correlated. Such is the case if the two pulses originate from the same cavity. The value of the beat note has a lower bound set by the dead band, which itself is an indication of the coupling between the two pulses. The correlation between the dead band and scattering of the surface can be applied to study samples with extreme low reflectivity.","Embodiments of a design of an SPIN, as sketched in , can include one or more of the following characteristics:","1. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers can be used as a gain medium in the pump cavity. This arrangement can provide high gain, high intracavity average power (50 W), and fast gain recovery. Optically pumped vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) can be used for high power and beam quality.","2. Wavelength tuning across the visible or near IR can be realized.","3. Multiple quantum wells (MQW), tailored to any pump wavelength, can be used for mode-locking at the pump wavelength.","4. Circulation of two pulses in the same spatial mode of a linear or ring cavity can be achieved through the use of a mode-locked intracavity pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO can be arranged for orthogonality of the repetition rate and mode-frequency control of the pulse trains, which makes the OPO a unique design for stabilization. A 25 mm long periodically poled crystal may be used for the OPO. However, periodically poled crystal can be used.","5. Differentiation of the two pulses circulating in the cavity to a sample arm of a sub-cavity and a reference arm of another sub-cavity can be controlled with a Pockels cell driven by a phase locked loop at the cavity round trip frequency.","6. An electro-optic phase modulator can be used to control coupling between sample and reference arms.","7. Various resolution enhancement techniques can be implemented for various measurement of a sample. Enhancement of the resolution can be attained using dielectric or metallic nanotips.","8. Nanopositioning of various cavity components and scanning of the sample can be implemented for 3D image reconstruction.","For a pure reflector, the response of the instrument, as shown in , is a beat note:\n\n\u0394(\u0394)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere \u0394l is the displacement of the sample with respect to the reference surface, v is the light frequency, and L is the cavity length. This response is for the ideal case where the Pockels cell sends 100% of the probe pulse to the sample. Corresponding to \u0394l is a phase shift per round-trip \u0394\u03c6=2\u03c0\u0394l\/\u03bb, and the beat note can be expressed as \u0394v=\u0394\u03c6(2\u03c0\u03c4) where \u03c4=L\/c is the half cavity round-trip time. By applying a smaller voltage to the Pockels cell, the probe pulse intensity becomes only a fraction \u03b5 of the intracavity pulsed field. If the sample (field) reflectivity is \u03c1, the returning pulse field is \u03be(t)[(1\u2212\u03b5)+\u03b5\u03c1e], which leads to the beat note:\n\n\u0394=(\u03b5\u03c1\u0394\u03c6)\/(\u03c4)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nThe Fourier transform recording of  shows that beat notes can be measured with an accuracy of 1 Hz, which translates into a depth resolution \u0394l=0.5\u00b710m for a wavelength of 1.5 \u03bcm and a cavity length of L=1 m. In the case of a membrane interface, having a reflectivity of \u03c1\u22481%, with only 1% of the laser power (\u03b5=0.01), the minimum measurable depth variation is \u0394l\u22480.5\u00b710m or 0.05 nm.\n","Existing techniques for nano-imaging can be divided in two main branches of optical and electron or atomic particles, such as scanning tunneling microscope (STM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Various embodiments, SPIN may operate to generate one or more characteristics that are not typically attainable by the abovementioned conventional techniques. SPIN may attain a resolution of 10m in one dimension, and 1 nmin three dimensions. The information extracted from SPIN is not limited to the surface. SPIN does not require a vacuum, and can operate in nearly any transparent environment. SPIN is not limited to metallic surfaces, thus does not require special sample preparation. SPIN does not require \u201cmarking\u201d by fluorescent dyes, such as is used for a fluorescence nanoscope. SPIN can use lower energy radiation (1 eV) than STM, SEM, or AFM, which can translate to less damage to samples being measured. SPIN can be implemented with appropriate optics to can operate from 800 to 2000 nm, which can provide color information. Unlike other techniques, SPIN is positioned for 3D imaging of proteins in evolving lipids bilayers. In addition, recognizing that the SPIN is a laser instrument that can be sensitive to environmental parameters, such as acceleration, magnetic fields, air currents etc, the SPIN is positioned for combination with sensors of acceleration, rotation, and\/or magnetic fields that may result in an essentially totally autonomous instrument.","SPIN can be applied to a one-dimensional measurements ranging from measurement of an essentially perfect reflector to measurement of a low reflectivity surface. Combining the depth scanning with lateral scanning of near field microscopy can result in a full three dimensional reconstruction of a sample. Even though each additional dimensionality can compromise the resolution of measurement, a 3-D instrument including an embodiment of an SPIN may have a resolution of 1 nmor 1\/1000 of the wavelength of the illuminating source.","As discussed for the high reflector samples, the beat note response is solely dependent on the sample position, independent of the value of the (field) reflectivity \u03c1. The beat note response to the differential cavity length is linear, and the principle of superposition applies. Thus, the spectrum of the beat note contains information on the longitudinal structure of a sample.","Since the repetition rate is stabilized through the pump cavity, one can stabilize the reference arm to keep the mode position constant. Direct measurement of the beat note frequency provides the displacement of the \u201csample arm\u201d with respect to the reference arm. Relative vibrations of the two arms of the OPO cavity, which can inject noise in the beat note, should be eliminated or significantly reduced. In another measurement technique, related to control of the reference arm, consists of controlling the movement of the reference mirror using a piezo-element in contact with the reference are and using a feedback loop to maintain the beat note at a constant value. The displacement of the sample mirror can then be inferred from the current in the feedback loop.","Another parameter that can be scanned is the position of the reference mirror. The value of the beat note can be function of the displacement and the beam splitting ratio at the polarizer P, shown in . A scaling factor can be introduced by the reflectivity p of the sample and the beam splitting ratio \u03b5. Hence, the depth measurements can be combined with material imaging. For a low reflector sample, measurements may include detailed analysis of the tip positioning and sample environment.","A Pockels cell is used to switch periodically each of the intracavity pulses towards a different subcavity, one serving as reference, the other as \u201csample\u201d. The non-limiting examples that follow and  pertain to a laser, or any gain medium, operating at a cavity round-trip rate of 90 MHz (pulse repetition rate 180 MHz).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["606","610","608","620","640","630","645","608","620"]},"Even for a one dimensional measurement, the sample is not necessarily a single 100% reflector, nor is it desirable to deflect the whole power of the laser pulse into it. A cavity length around 1.7 m (round-trip frequency of 90 MHz) can be used. A shorter cavity length may be preferable.","Assume a cavity round-trip frequency of 90 MHz. Two approaches to driving the modulator are outlined in following subsections. The two approaches include a modulator operating at 90 MHz and a modulator operating at 45 MHz. For a modulator operating at 90 MHz, a 180 MHz signal from a photodiode  is divided by 2, amplified, sent through an adjustable delay , an amplifier , and the modulator, as sketched in .","In , the laser configuration includes reference mirror , sample , modulator , beam splitter , Pockels cell , delay , OPO , detector , and detector . As shown in , since there are two pulses, pulse  and pulse , circulating in the cavity, the detectors Dor Drecord a signal at 180 MHz, which is divided by 2, phase adjusted, amplified before being sent to the Pockels cell . Unless the two pulses returning to the polarizing beam splitter  are exactly dephased by \u03c0 (relative displacement of \u03bb\/4 of the two mirrors of the end-cavity interferometer) pulse  will be attenuated as sketched in . Because of the reduction of intensity of pulses , a component at 90 MHz appears in the spectrum analyzer recording of the pulse train on detector D. That 90 MHz component is used in a feedback loop to maintain the bias of the phase modulator  for the minimum loss condition.  shows the voltage on modulator at 90 MHz.","The signal from the fast photodetector Dis sent through a high pass filter, a TTL converter, divided by 2. An accurate delay line is used to ensure that the zero and maximum voltages in the modulator correspond to the arrival time of the optical pulses. A couple of amplifiers are used to boost up the signal to the half-wave voltage. The pulse train is monitored through detector Dwith an oscilloscope, frequency counter and spectrum analyzer. With the present system, the mode-locking is considered \u201cgood\u201d when repetition rate fluctuations on the frequency counter are less than 100 Hz.","The electrical drive at 90 MHz should ideally be a square wave as shown in . Such a wave could be approximated by adding some odd harmonics. It may be possible that the third harmonic at 270 MHz would be sufficient.","The 90 MHz signal to the modulator is from zero to a half wave voltage (90 degree rotation of the polarization). In the case of the tantalate modulator that we have, the \u201czero\u201d requires a bias of \u221250V, to which we have to add a peak to peak voltage of 170 V.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 7"],"sub":"\u03c0"},"In , the laser configuration includes reference mirror , sample , modulator , beam splitter , Pockels cell , delay , OPO , detector , detector , detector , phase adjust , and amplifier . The signal recorded by detector Dis now divided by 4. Pulse  crosses the modulator at the null of the electric field. Pulse  crosses at the (+) and (\u2212) peaks of the modulation.  shows pulse intensity at modulator (180 MHz).  shows voltage  on modulator (90 MHz) and preferred drive waveform .","The purpose of the calculations below is to show how the depth resolution is compromised against the power that is sent to the \u201csample\u201d. If the entire power of one pulse is deflected to the sample, the beat note is considerably higher than if only a small fraction is deflected (for the same displacement of the sample).","Before entering the modulator, the light is vertically polarized, along an axis y, orthogonal to a horizontal axis x. The initial field is E=0, E=1\u00b7exp(i\u03c9t). We project that field on the main axis yand xof the modulator (oriented at 45\u00b0):\n\ncos \u03b8=(1\/\u221a2)\n\nsin \u03b8=(1\/\u221a2)\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nThe modulator introduces a difference in phase (which we will put on the axis y) \u0394. At the output of the modulator:\n\nsin \u03b8=(1\/\u221a2).\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nAfter the modulator, we project again on vertical y horizontal x axis:\n\n=\u00bd(1\u2212)\n\n=\u00bd(1+)\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nAfter the beam has been split by the polarizing beam splitter, the returning beams recombine after having been given a relative phase shift \u03c6:\n\n=\u00bd(1\u2212)\n\n=\u00bd(1+)\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nThe beam returns towards the modulator. Projecting on the modulator axis:\n\n=(1\/\u221a2)()=(1\/2\u221a2)[1+(1\u2212)]\n\n=(1\/\u221a2)()=(1\/2\u221a2)[1\u2212(1+)]\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nThe modulator imparts another phase change of \u0394 on the ym component E\u2192E\u00d7exp(i\u0394). The components along yand xof the pulse re-entering the main cavity are thus:\n\n=(1\/4)[(1\u2212)+(1+)+(1\u2212)\u2212(1+)]\n\n=(1\/4)[(1+)+(1\u2212)+(1+)\u2212(1\u2212)],\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nwhich can be re-written:\n\n=(1\/4)[(1\u2212)(1+)(1+)]\n\n=(1\/4)[(1+)(1\u2212)].\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nFrom this last set of equations, it is obvious that \u03c6=\u03c0 returns the correct polarization independently of \u0394. E=0 and E=exp(i\u0394), which implies a huge value of the beat note \u0394\/\u03c4.\n","There are two special limits to the phase shift \u0394: near zero and \u03c0. The ideal value is \u0394=\u03c0, which corresponds to a rotation of the polarization by 90\u00b0, consistent with the set of Eqs. (5). For \u0394=\u03c0:\n\nE=0\n\nE=e.\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nLet us now consider a small departure from this ideal condition: \u0394=\u03c0\u2212\u03b5. For small \u03b5, the set of Eqs. (9) becomes:\n\n=(1\/4)[\u03b5(2\u2212)(1+)]\n\n=(1\/4)[(\u03b5)(2\u2212\u03b5)].\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nThe x component of the field represents a loss of the order of \u03b5 in field, \u03b5in intensity. Besides the loss of the y component of the field to the x component, it has a phase shift that remains equal to \u03c6 to first order.\n","Feedback can be introduced to maintain the x component zero. The imposes that we set \u03c6=\u03c0+\u03b7, where \u03b7 is a small value (\u03c6 being maintained near \u03c0 by a feedback loop, \u03b7 being a small phase modulation imposed by a phase modulator. The set of Eqs. (9) becomes:\n\n\u2248\u03b5\u03b7(2\u2212\u03b5)\n\n.\u2003\u2003(12)\n\nThe price to pay for a smaller loss, in the case of \u03c6 close to \u03c0, is a reduced beat note. The loss should be maximum rather than minimum in order to have a beat note equal or close to \u03c6. Indeed, the intensity loss is:\n\n|=(1\u2212cos 2\u0394)(1+cos \u03c6)\u2003\u2003(13)\n\nwhich is maximum for \u03c6 close to zero, minimum for \u03c6 close to \u03c0.\n","The small \u0394 approximation of Eqs.

(13), and a phase shift which is a not so straightforward function of \u0394 and \u03c6. If \u03c6 is close to \u03c0, the losses are practically zero. The phase shift is proportional to the product of \u0394 and \u03c6.\n","Complete information on the reflection and depth of an interface is extracted from the knowledge of the voltage applied to the Pockels cell the power (attenuation) of the laser, and the beat note frequency.","A SPIN instrument is based on a robust implementation of the structure of . There are two stringent conditions to be met. First, the two beams should essentially overlap perfectly in the common branch of the laser. Second, there should be essentially no coupling between the phases of the laser beams.","The second condition can be met by having two ultrashort pulses circulating in either cavity, and ensuring that they never meet in any location where scattering takes place. This implies that the pulses should not overlap near a solid or an interface. This property of null coupling is related to the absence of dead band in a laser gyroscope operating with ultrashort pulses. The laser sketched in  has a gain element (labelled OPO ) that creates two individual pulses in the resonator. Pulse  uses the subcavity with the mirror REF , while pulse  uses the subcavity S sample .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 3","FIG. 15","FIG. 16"],"b":["1406","1410","1408","1420","1440","1430","1445","1408","1420","1611","1613"]},"The optical frequency \u03bd=N c\/2L of each of these pulses is such that there are an integer number N of wavelengths \u03bb=c\/\u03bd the corresponding cavity.

A main advantage of using visible lasers for imaging biological objects would be lost if we had to focus the full power of the laser onto the sample. It is desirable to sample only a fraction \u2208 of the laser beam towards the sample, which will reflect only a fraction p. Both \u2208 and p are field reflection coefficients; the intensity reflection coefficients being \u2208and p. The problem of locating an interface (relative to the position of the reference mirror) becomes now two dimensional: both the \u201cdisplacement\u201d \u0394l and the reflection coefficient \u03c1 are unknown. The technique to extract these parameters is based on the influence that minute backscattering has on the operation of the laser, in particular the beat note.","To determine these parameters another element is added to the instrument: a phase modulator, PM,  in  (which is an expanded view of the end laser cavity). In , phase modulator  is inserted between the reference mirror  and the polarizing beam splitter . Phase modulator  introduces an artificial displacement \u03b4 of the reference mirror. The amplitude of the signal applied to the Pockels cell can be controlled, such that only a fraction \u2208 of the signal is sent to the sample interfaces S , which in turn reflect only a fraction p of the light.","The beat note that is being measured is the difference in phase experienced by the pulse  propagating in the arm , \u03c6(subscript red refers to pulse ) and the phase of the pulse  propagating in the arm , \u03c6, (subscript red refers to pulse ), divided by the round-trip time Tof the cavity: \u0394\u03bd=(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6)\/(2\u03c0\u03c4). If the difference between cavity lengths \u0394L=\u0394l+\u03b4 is less than a wavelength, the fields will add, resulting in a beat note \u0394\u03bd=\u03b5p\u03bd\u0394L\/L. Despite the reduced response, the sensitivity is still remarkable: with 1% light sent to the sample (\u03b5=0.1) and a reflectivity of 11,100,000,000 (p=10), we still have a resolution of 1 nm. By scanning the phase shift \u03b4, the variation of the beat note follows the curve shown in , which is similar to the \u201clock-in\u201d characteristics of a laser gyro. Measurements of the beat note versus \u03b4 make it possible to determine the two unknowns p and \u0394l. There is a linear relationship for small beat notes; the zero beat note corresponding to \u03b4\u2212\u0394l. As the beat note increases, the injection of the arm S into the arm REF unlocks when \u0394\u03bd=p\u2208\/(2\u03c0\u03c4). The zero and maximum of the recording \u0394\u03bd(\u03b4) leads thus to he determination of \u0394l and the reflectivity p.","Even for a perfectly localized metallic reflector, there is a finite width to the response of the instrument represented by the Fourier Transform in . This uncertainty in position may be related to mechanical vibrations of laser components and can be minimized through appropriate stabilization. Correction to fluctuations in length of the reference cavity should affect equally either of the two pulses circulating in the laser.","In contrast to existing conventional systems, the signal in SPIN has two dimensions: frequency and intensity. Beat note frequencies give a direct handle on the longitudinal structure while any variation of reflectivity across the sample relates directly to transverse structure. Different options for achieving the highest transverse resolution can be implemented. Such options include, but are not limited to, use of fiber tips, use of high numerical aperture objectives combined with local field enhancement techniques, and use of \u201cnanojet\u201d concentration of light achieved with microspheres.","Focused ion beam milling can be used to improve the use of tapered fiber probes. Dithering the fiber tip in a controlled, fine motion can be used as a means to achieve sub-wavelength transverse resolution. Such sub-pixel-level displacements have recently been demonstrated as a practical technique to reduce aliasing from detector-sub-sampled images. The use of multiple-core fibers can combine high beam throughput with high spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution can be extracted from a detailed analysis of mode and field patterns.","Fine metal tips may be used to enhance locally\u2014within the focal area of the high aperture microscope objective\u2014the backscattered field.  shows a schematic of the imaging of a microlens exploiting the local field enhancement of a metallic needle. The sharp metal tip localizes the optical radiation near the apex of the tip, which implies a larger backscattered radiation from that area. As applied to a micro-lens, scanning the tip under the microlens, one should be able to reconstruct the shape of the grooves of the micro-lens pattern.","In the case of fiber tip illumination, different angles of view can be obtained simply by rotating the tip. In the case of microscope objective illumination, a hemisphere covering the sample can be used, similar to the \u201cnumerical aperture increasing lens\u201d designed by Goldberg, et al.  shows the depth scanning and views under different angles for tomographic reconstruction. A modified tomographic reconstruction algorithm is designed to extend the depth resolution [longitudinal \u201cgrid\u201d in the sketch of ] to the transverse dimension, which otherwise is limited to the diameter of the circle in .","These different angle views can be obtained by scanning of an aperture above a hemispherical lens, as shown in . Angular scanning can be obtained by scanning an aperture between the microscope objective and the lens, as sketched in .","With respect to use of microspheres, a microsphere acts as a microlens for a plane wave incident on it, resulting in a concentration of the radiation in a volume of nanosize or \u201cnanojet\u201d. Such microspheres can be implemented in the laser cavity of the SPIN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 23"],"b":["2370","2317","2340","2310","2320","2330","2309"]},"Two pulses\/round-trip are created in the signal cavity if two-counter-propagating pump pulses are sent into the OPO crystal at each round-trip. This configuration has may be unstable. However, the insertion of a frequency doubling inside the OPO cavity can remove the instability.","SPIN includes data acquisition and manipulation. The method of SPIN provides the desired depth measurement with sub-nm resolution, while the transverse resolution is that of a scanning near-field microscope. Analysis includes disentangling sub-nm depth resolution from sub-\u03bcm transverse resolution. Qualitatively, the measured (or raw) depth resolution is that which is obtained by PSF (point-spread function) averaging of the fine depth resolution over the lateral dimensions of the beam. The problem is akin to that of optical super resolution, where resolution exceeding the optical diffraction limit can sometimes be attained in the presence of sufficient prior knowledge about the image by means of image processing. The acquisition of many different rotated views of the sample at high depth resolution should facilitate the use and development of novel 3D tomographic reconstruction techniques to solve this disentanglement problem. The basic principle is sketched in .

A rigorous microscopic point-dipole analysis of probe-sample interaction can serve as basis to the polarization response of the instrument. As for the wavelength response, the wavelength of the OPO can be tuned within the range of reflectivity of the optics. Alternatively, a design can include a laser with interchangeable optics. The ability to operate at various wavelengths is particularly important for biological samples. In some instances, one might desire to select a wavelength for which the sample is most transparent (in order to detect interfaces below other layers). Another consideration is to select a wavelength for which a resonant enhancement of the index of refraction exists, hence increasing the contrast of the image.","The SPIN device is intrinsically a scanning instrument that will generate and have to process vast amounts of data in a rapid tomographic fashion to realize its principal goal of ultrahigh 3D resolution. This requires a high-performance computational platform directly interfaced with the optical instrument and processing information as it is acquired by the instrument.","SPIN can have direct application to real biological problems. The responses of a biological cell to its surrounding environment result largely from the transduction of signals from the outer cell surface to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Strict regulation of signal transduction is crucial for cell survival, differentiation, proliferation and other activities. Unregulated signaling is an important component in the pathogenesis of many diseases, especially cancer. However, many aspects of how the cell maintains spatio-temporal control of signaling pathways remain unclear.","In the above detailed description, reference may be made to specific examples by way of drawings and illustrations.
