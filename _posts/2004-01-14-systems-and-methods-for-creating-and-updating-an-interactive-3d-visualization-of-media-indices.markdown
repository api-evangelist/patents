Field of Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods for creating and updating interactive 3D visualizations.","2. Description of Related Art","There are a number of conventional methods for indexing media. One popular two-dimensional method arranges hierarchically-organized content on various pages. These conventional methods utilize user interfaces with a number of hyperlinks allowing a user to navigate among the various pages. Many web pages on the Internet are organized in this fashion.  show one example of this type of conventional index, in which training material is organized.  shows the highest-level organization of the media. As shown in , there are 9 modules, each having a hyperlink  that allows a user to access the structure of the module.  shows the tree structure  within module  that depicts the organization of the various media within the module. For instance,  shows leaves , branches  and root . Each leaf  of the tree links the user to a media page. Examples of the media pages  and  are shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","501","502","503","504","505","506","507","508","506","507"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","601","604","602","601","603","604"]},"There are a number of problems with the type of two-dimensional media index shown in . The complicated hierarchical structure is time-consuming to navigate. Furthermore, only a limited amount of information is displayed to the user at any one time. Therefore, it becomes very easy to lose sight of the overall organization of the indexed media, necessary for a complete understanding of the indexed media. For instance, the tree page , shown in , cannot show all of the leaf media, while the module page , shown in , cannot show all of the tree structure. Because the interaction for such a conventional indexing system is limited to invoking the hyperlinks  and  and to page turning, using buttons , ,  and\/or , easily moving from one media page in one module to another media page in another module requires that the user navigate a number of hyperlinks  and\/or  and\/or buttons , ,  and\/or .","Furthermore, learning paths based on the above-described conventional indices are inflexible, because they are dependent upon the pre-defined tree structure. As such, instructors or users cannot create a customized path or syllabus. Finally, note taking, content rating, and knowledge sharing are not supported.","The types of meeting media indices shown in  share similar problems. The indices are limited to one meeting per page. As such, a user is unable to effectively cross-reference between related meetings. Furthermore, there is no distinction between one users' personal notes and bookmarks, and other users' notes and bookmarks.","There are a number of conventional 3D interactive landscapes for information visualization such as SDM, WWW3D, WebPath, VR-VIBE or Information Animation. These 3D landscapes use a single, above the ground landscape. Therefore, they are not able to effectively provide the user with separate indices in the same 3D visualization. In some of the conventional 3D systems, negative values for an index are displayed below the ground plane. However, these negative values come from the same function that calculated the above ground values and do not provide a separate type of indices for visualizing a different set of properties.","This invention provides a double-sided 3D interactive visualization of two separate types of indexes.","This invention separately provides for the indexes to be organized in a table structure defined by two axes.","This invention separately provides for the visualization of one index to be located above the ground plane, and the other index to be located below the ground plane.","This invention separately provides for each index to include various links that link to the various media of each index.","This invention separately provides for the various links to visually describe various characteristics of the media to which they link.","This invention separately provides for the various links to visually describe various personal or group ratings of the media.","This invention separately provides for the point of view of the visualization to be inclined at any angle and positionally adjusted in three dimensions.","This invention separately provides for a user to define a path throughout the various links that make up each index.","This invention separately provides for a user to transpose the indices such that the index that was previously below the ground plane is above the ground plane and the index that was previously above the ground plane is below the ground plane.","This invention separately provides for a user to superimpose the indices such that both indices are above the ground plane.","These and other features and advantages of various exemplary embodiments of systems and methods according to this invention are described in, or are apparent form, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.","For ease of explanation various exemplary embodiments of this invention will be described with reference to three specific examples: a first example, which is based on a table data model that is shown in ; a second example, which is based on a timeline data model, that is shown in ; and a third example, which is based on a search results data model. Each specific example is intended to provide a frame of reference in which the more general exemplary embodiments will be described. However, these specific examples are not intended to limit the exemplary embodiments or disclosed invention.","The first specific example, shown in , shows a 3D visualization of a training syllabus. In the first example, the indexed media is similar to the leaves  and  shown in  and may contain text, graphics, video, etc. The ground plane is defined by a number of tiles , each tile defined by its position according to two axes  and . The first axis  represents part names, while the second axis  represents task types. Each tile  has a first link  above the ground plane that provides a link to the multimedia content indexed by the tile  and a second link  that provides a separate link to group content related to the corresponding first link  for the same tile. Spaces between the tiles  allow the user to see the links  and  both above and below the ground plane. Both the first links  and the second links  are tethered to the tiles  by strings , which help a user determine which ones of the links  and  are associated with each tile .","In the first specific example, the sizes of the first links  and the second links  reflect the amount of multimedia data represented by the tile , and the amount of group content related to the tile , respectively. In this first specific example, a height of the first link  is determined by a user's rating of the importance of the multimedia content indexed by the associated tile . The height of a second link , which, in the embodiment shown in  is the distance below the plane of the tiles , is determined by a defined group of users' combined rating of the multimedia content indexed by the tile  corresponding to that second link . In various exemplary embodiments, the users' combined rating of the multimedia content is determined by averaging the personal ratings of the multimedia content of the various users within the defined group. The color or colors of the fist links  represent the type of multimedia data indexed by the tile . For instance, one color may represent text data, while another color represents graphic data, and a third color represents video data. When more than one type of multimedia data is represented by a tile , the first link will be more than one color, such as, for example, the colored areas  and  of the first link  shown in .","In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, it is useful for a viewer to know whether a link has been visited and that its content viewed. Therefore, in the first specific example shown in , a link that has been visited has a red circle  superimposed on the corresponding tile . Additionally, the first specific example shows a pipe  that connects various first links  in a predetermined order. For instance, a course instructor may have defined a path, represented by the pipe , through the indexed media that the instructor would like a defined group such as, for example, a class being taught, to follow. Alternatively, a user may have defined a path through the indexed media, again represented by the pipe , that the user has determined to be beneficial.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 11 and 12","FIGS. 5 and 6","FIGS. 11 and 12","FIGS. 7\u201310"],"b":["810","801","820","800","700","820","820","801","730","820","760","770","730","820","790","820","790"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["901","910","920","901","910","730","740"]},"As indicated above, the three specific examples are described to provide a reference within which the more generalized exemplary embodiments may be described. Again, the specific embodiments are only provided for reference and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 14 and 15"},"As shown in , operation of the flowchart begins in step S and continues to step S, where the data to be visualized is input. According to various exemplary embodiments of the method for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, any set of data in which the data may be divided into portions and those portions represented by tiles with at least two values assigned to each tile, may be visualized using systems and methods according to this invention. Then, in step S, the tile type is determined based on the input data. For instance, in , the tiles  are square tiles defined by the values along each axis  and . In , the tiles  are rectangular tiles defined by a value along the axis  and a length, in this case time, along the axis . Finally, in , the tiles  represent search results defined by the values along each axis, in this case, first letter and creation month. It should be appreciated that each tile , , and  is capable of being defined along two axes.","Next, in step S, a tile layout is created based on the data to be visualized and the determined tile type. When the values on the axes can be defined in equal increments, the tiles are typically square, as in  and . Alternatively, at least one of the axes may define a value in which the size of the tile along that axis represents a quality of the data, as in , where one axis  is defined by time and the size of the tile along that axis  represents a duration of time for the data represented by that tile . Operation continues to step S.","In step S, a first or next tile is selected as the current tile. Then, in step S, the height of a first index link is determined for the current tile. Various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention are capable of showing two values, or index links, for each tile, one above a ground plane defined by the tiles, and one below the ground plane. In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, the height of the first index value represents the importance of that link. However, the height may represent some other quality of the data represented by the tile. Next, in step S, a size of the first index link for the current tile is determined. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, one or more colors for the first index link for the current tile are determined. In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, each of the one or more colors for the first index link represent a quality of the data, such as, for instance, the type of data, where different colors are used for graphic data, text data, video data, etc. However, the color or colors of the first index link may represent any other salient characteristic of the data being visualized. Next, in step S, the brightness of the first index link for the current tile is determined. In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, the brightness of the first index link may represent any quantifiable characteristic of the data being visualized, represented by the current tile, that may be compared to the same characteristic of other tiles. In various exemplary embodiments, the greater the brightness assigned to a given first link, the larger quantum of that characteristic the corresponding tile has. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made whether, the user has visited the portion of the data represented by the current tile. It should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments, the first index provides a link to the data represented by the current tile. Therefore, if data represented by the current tile has been visited by the user, operation continues to step S. If the first index has not been visited by the user, operation directly jumps to step S. In step S, the current tile is marked as visited. For example, in the first specific example, a tile  is marked with a red circle  to indicate that it has been visited. However, various other methods of marking the current tile may be used. Furthermore, in various other exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, a tile representing data that has not been visited may be marked instead of a tile representing data that has been visited. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, a height of a second index link for the current tile is determined. In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, the height or more generally, the distance from the ground plane, of the second index value represents an average of the importance of the data represented by the current tile as determined by other group members. However, the height may represent any other quantifiable quality of the data represented by the current tile. Next, in step S, the brightness of the second index link for the current tile is determined. In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, the brightness of the second index link represents any quantifiable characteristic of the data being visualized. In various exemplary embodiments, the brighter tile has the larger quantum of that characteristic. For example, in the first and second specific examples, the brightness of the second link indicates the number of people in a defined group that have rated the media represented by the current tile. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made whether all of the tiles have been selected as the current tile. If all of the tiles have not been selected as the current tile, operation returns to step S, where the next tile is selected as the current tile. However, if all of the tiles have been selected as the current tile, operation continues to step S. Where a determination is made whether a path through the first indices has been defined. If a path has not been defined, operation jumps directly to step S. If a path has been defined through the first indices, operation continues to step S, where the path through the first indices is displayed. Next, in step S, a determination is made whether a path through the second indices has been defined. If a path has not been defined, operation jumps directly to step S. If a path has been defined through the second indices, operation continues to step S, where the path through the second indices is displayed. Then, in step S, operation of the flowchart terminates.","It should be appreciated that, in various other exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, many other qualities of the first index links may defined as well, such as pattern, texture, or any other visually discernable characteristic. Similarly, it should be appreciate that, in various other exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, other qualities of the second index links may defined, such as size, color, pattern, texture, or any other visually discernable characteristic. Furthermore, in various other exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, the value defining the characteristic for one or more second index links may be determined as an average of the values of the corresponding characteristic of the corresponding first link over a defined group of users.","In various exemplary embodiments of methods for creating an interactive 3D visualization according to this invention, the 3D visualization is implemented using a graphical user interface with which a user may align the data. Therefore, the data to be visualized and the 3D visualization periodically communicate with one another. Any changes made to the data to be visualized are reflected in the 3D visualization. The data to be visualized may be changed in a number of ways. For instance, the user may interact with the visualization and any changes to the visualization, such as for instance, a user visiting a previously un-visited tile or a path being defined through the fist links, are reflected in the data to be visualized. Alternatively, the data to be visualized itself may be changed. For example, another user may interact with a separate visualization and that other user's interaction can affect the group data represented by the second indices, for instance, the other user may rate the media represented by a tile. As a result, the rating will now become part of the groups average rating for that tile. Every set of data to be visualized within the group will be altered to reflect the updated average rating.","When implementing various exemplary embodiments of the above-described 3D visualization according to this invention using a graphical user interface, various exemplary embodiments provide a number of functions that facilitate the effective viewing and interaction with the various portions of the 3D visualization. Various exemplary embodiments enable a user of the 3D visualization to change the viewing angle. For example,  shows the visualization of the first specific example, in which the view has been aligned with the ground plane to facilitate viewing both the first links  and the second links . A user may change the viewing angle by, for example grabbing the visualization and rotating it with a pointing device, a touch screen, or using virtual reality interaction devices such a glove, using keyboard commands, or using any other known or later-developed input device.","Various exemplary embodiments of the 3D visualization, when implemented using a graphical user interface, include a transpose indices feature. The transpose indices feature is shown in  with respect to the first specific example. The transpose index feature allows a user to switch the first index, represented by the first links , and the second index, represented by the second links , such that the second index is shown above the ground plane and the first index is shown below the ground plane. The transpose indices feature allows a user to view the second index above the ground plane, without the disorientation that may result from viewing the index from below the ground plane, where the indices will be a mirror of the indices from above the ground plane.","Finally, various exemplary embodiments of the 3D visualization, when implemented using a graphical user interface, include a superimpose indices feature. The superimpose indices feature is shown in  with respect to the first specific example. The superimpose index feature allows a user to overlay the second index, represented by the second links , on top of the first index, represented by the first links , such that a user can more easily compare the two indices. In various exemplary embodiments, when the superimpose indices feature is used, one or both of the index's links are rendered as semi-transparent graphical objects to facilitate viewing both indices when they overlap.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 16\u201319","FIGS. 16\u201319"],"b":["200","202","204","206","208","228"]},"In step S, a tile is created and placed in the visualization for each new portion or element of the data that now requires a tile in the updated visualization but for which there was not a tile in the current visualization. Then, in step S, a first or next new tile is selected as the current tile. Then, in step S, a height of a first index link is determined for the current tile. As described above, in various exemplary embodiments, the height of the first index value may represent the importance of the portion of the data to be visualized that is associated with the current tile. However, the height may represent some other quantifiable characteristic of the portion of the data represented by the current tile.
