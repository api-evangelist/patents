{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to a vehicular light control system, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for controlling the brake-lights and the reverse (i.e. backup) lights on automobiles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, and the like.","When the use of motor vehicles as a means of transportation became commonplace, it soon became obvious that such vehicles should be equipped with a warning system to alert the driver of a vehicle that an anterior vehicle is stopping or braking so as to prevent rear end collisions resulting in possible damage to the vehicles involved and injury to the vehicle's occupants. To this end, the well known brake-light was widely adopted and is illuminated when an operator of a vehicle steps on or depresses the vehicles brake pedal to stop or slow the vehicle. Such brake-lights are now generally required to be operational on a vehicle before such vehicle may be legally operated on a public thoroughfare. Such brake-lights convey a clear, unambiguous alert to following vehicles that a driver is braking.","In addition to brake-lights, vehicles are now generally equipped with reverse (i.e. backup) lights to assist an operator of a vehicle when the operator is backing the vehicle up (i.e. operating the vehicle in reverse gear or mode). Such reverse-lights are typically activated (i.e. illuminated) when the vehicle is placed in reverse gear. For example, the reverse-lights may be activated when a PRNDL (pronounced \u201cprendel\u201d) selector indicates that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in reverse gear. The letters P, R, N, D, L associated with the PRNDL selector indicate PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, DRIVE, AND LOW gears.","It should be clear from the above that the well known brake and reverse lighting systems provide valuable assistance to vehicle operators and enhance vehicle safety. It has been realized, however, that additional intelligence may be incorporated into such systems so as to warn drivers of other possible safety hazards and\/or dangerous conditions. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved brake-light\/reverse-light warning system that is responsive to additional driving safety considerations.","According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a light control system for use on a vehicle having a brake-light and a headlight. The system comprises a vehicle speed sensor and a control unit coupled to the brake-light, to the headlight, and to the vehicle speed sensor. The control unit illuminates the brake-light when the headlight is on and the vehicle is not moving.","According to the further aspect of the invention there is provided a light control system for use on a vehicle having a brake-light, and a PRNDL selector capable of selecting at least PARK and REVERSE modes of operation. The system also comprises a vehicle speed sensor, a control unit coupled to the brake-light, to the PRNDL selector, and to the vehicle speed sensor for illuminating the brake-light when the vehicle is not in PARK and is not moving.","According to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a light control system for use on a vehicle having a reverse-light. The system comprises a vehicle speed sensor, a PRNDL selector capable of selecting at least PARK and REVERSE modes of operation, and a control unit coupled to the reverse-light, to the vehicle speed sensor, and to the PRNDL selector, for illuminating the brake-light when the vehicle is not in PARK and is not moving.","According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for controlling the lights on a vehicle having a brake-light and a headlight. The method comprises monitoring the speed of the vehicle, determining if the headlight is on or off, and illuminating the brake-light when the headlight is on and the vehicle is not moving.","According to still another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling lights on a vehicle having a brake-light and a PRNDL selector of the type which is capable of selecting at least PARK and REVERSE modes of operation. The method comprises sensing the speed of the vehicle, monitoring the PRNDL selector, and illuminating the brake-light when the vehicle is not in PARK and is not moving.","According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling lights on a vehicle having a reverse-light and having a PRNDL selector capable of selecting at least PARK and REVERSE modes of operation. The method comprises sensing the speed of the vehicle, monitoring the state of the PRNDL selector, and illuminating the reverse-light when the vehicle is not in REVERSE and is moving backwards.","The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any express or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary, or the following detailed description.","Referring now to , there is shown a top view of vehicle  illustrating the general position of lights on a vehicle such as an automobile, truck, etc. As can be seen, the front  of vehicle  may be equipped with first and second headlights , parking lights , and turn signal lights . Proximate the rear  of vehicle , there may be found turn signal lights , brake-lights , tail lights , and reverse-lights . Of course, the exact arrangement of operating lights on different vehicles or models thereof may vary somewhat. For example, front parking lights  and turn signal lights  may, if desired, share the same lamp. Similarly, rear turn signals  and brake-lights  may share the same lamp.","As stated previously, brake-lights  are generally illuminated when an operator of a vehicle steps on the vehicle's brake pedal to initiate stopping or slowing of the vehicle. This alerts following drivers that the vehicle in front is slowing. Reverse or backup lights  are typically illuminated when the operator of the vehicle places the vehicle in REVERSE gear in order to move the vehicle in a backward direction; as, for example, when backing out a driveway. The reverse or backup lights  serve two functions. First, if ambient light is low (e.g. in the evenings), the backup lights visually assist the operator of the vehicle. Second, the mere fact that the reverse-lights are illuminated will alert the drivers of other vehicles in the immediate vicinity that the vehicle is or will be moving in a rearward direction.","Unfortunately, there are other situations which merit alerting the operators of other nearby vehicles. For example, it would be desirable to illuminate the vehicle's brake-lights if the vehicle is decelerating at a rate which exceeds a predetermined threshold. Thus, even though the vehicle's brakes have not been applied, the following vehicles are alerted that the vehicle in front if decelerating. It would also be appropriate to illuminate the brake-lights when the vehicle is not in PARK and is not moving or when the vehicle's head lamps are on and the vehicle is not moving. Either of these scenarios could indicate, for example, a vehicle stalled in the middle of the road. Illuminating the brake-lights under these conditions would warn other drivers in the vicinity of a possible dangerous condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","30","30","32","34","36","38"]},"Engine control module  is an onboard, preferably micro-processor based, computer that operates to control and manage the overall operation of the vehicle's engine. Engine control module  may include a memory as well as a number of inputs and outputs for interfacing with various sensors and systems. As is well known, engine control module  preferably includes one or more control algorithms for controlling various aspects of engine operation.","As stated previously, engine control module  includes a number of inputs and outputs for communicating with various other systems. For example, engine control module  is bi-directionally coupled to body control module , transmission control module , and anti-lock brake system  by means of bi-directional data buses , , and  respectively. In this manner, engine control module may receive data relating to intake manifold temperature, intake manifold pressure, differential pressure, etc. Engine control module  may also output data for controlling one or more engine functions; e.g. controlling the flow of re-circulated exhaust gas from an exhaust manifold to an intake manifold, controlling turbo-charger swallowing capacity and\/or efficiency, etc. Engine control modules of this type are well known and further discussion is not deemed necessary. However, the interested reader is referred to U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,261 issued Sep. 16, 2003 entitled \u201cSYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING AN OPERATING CONDITION OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE\u201d assigned to Cummins, Inc., the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Body control module  is another well known onboard microprocessor-based module whose function it is to monitor and control the vehicles body systems, such as HVAC climate control, displays, power windows, power locks, vehicle lighting, etc. For further discussion, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,383 entitled \u201cAUTOMATIC VENTING SUPPLEMENTAL INFLATABLE RESTRAINT SYSTEM\u201d issued Jun. 14, 1994 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Transmission control module  is coupled via serial communication link  to engine control module . Among other things, transmission control module  may communicate the engine torque limit to engine control module . Transmission control module  communicates with body control module  by means of bidirectional communication link . For a further discussion, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,399 entitled \u201cTORQUE AND POWER CONTROL IN A POWERTRAIN\u201d issued Jan. 28, 2003 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","As can be seen, anti-lock braking system  communicates with engine control module , body control module , and transmission control module  by means of bi-directional communication links ,  and  respectively. When the brakes of the vehicle are applied, a braking force is generated between the wheel and the road surface that is dependant upon various parameters including road surface conditions and the amount of slip between the wheel and the road surface. The braking force increases as slip increases until a critical slip value is surpassed beyond which the braking force decreases and the wheel rapidly approaches a lock-up condition. To achieve stable braking, an anti-lock braking control system attempts to keep wheel slip at or near the critical value. Such anti-lock brake systems are well known and further discussion is not deemed necessary at this time; however, the interested reader is referred to U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,394 entitled \u201cANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM WITH CONTROLLED PRESSURE AUGMENTATION\u201d issued Jan. 31, 1995 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Referring again to , it can be seen that a PRNDL switch or selector  has an output coupled to the input of transmission control module . Transmission control module  in turn provides an output  to engine control module  which comprises a PRNDL signal and indicates to engine control module  what mode (i.e. PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, DRIVE, LOW) the vehicle is currently operating in.","Speed sensor system  has an output coupled to an input of anti-lock brake system  and provides information thereto indicative of vehicle speed. Anti-lock brake system  in turn provides speed related data to engine control module  over communication link . A head lamp switch or selector  is coupled to body control module  for the purpose of supplying body control module  with information relating to the state of the vehicle's head lamps (i.e. are the head lamps on or off). Body control module  in turn provides information to engine control module  regarding the state of the headlamps via communication link .","Engine control module  receives PRNDL data from transmission control module  via communication link , speed data from anti-lock brake system  via communication link , and head lamp data from body control module  via communication link . Engine control module  computes the vehicle's deceleration rate and determines if it is greater than a predetermined threshold. From this data, engine control module  generates an illuminate brake-light signal (IB) and an illuminate reverse-light signal (IR) and supplies these signals to body control module  via communication links  and  respectively. In turn, body control module  generates signals that turn the brake-lights on (TOB) and turn the reverse-lights on (TOR) via lines  and  respectively, which in turn results in illuminating the brake-lights and\/or reverse-lights as the case may be.","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the inventive light control system will cause the brake-lights to be illuminated not only when the brake pedal is depressed but also when the vehicle is decelerating at a predetermined rate, the headlights are on and the vehicle has no forward or rearward velocity, or when the vehicle has no forward or rearward velocity and the vehicle is not in PARK. Engine control module  will cause the reverse-lights to be illuminated not only when the vehicle is in REVERSE, but also when the vehicle has a rearward velocity independent of the state of the PRNDL selector. The generation of these signals can be produced in engine control module  by means of an algorithm, circuitry, or a combination of both. One example of a logic circuit for carrying out the required logical functions in order to illuminate the brake-lights and reverse-lights at the appropriate times is shown in .","A brake-light illumination function may be represented by the logical function\n\n()\n\nwhere each of the variables are capable of assuming a high state (e.g. a logical one) or a low state (e.g. a logical zero). In the case of equation 1, VB is high when the vehicle in question has a rearward velocity, VF is high when the vehicle has a forward velocity, P is high when the vehicle's PRNDL selector is in PARK, H is high when the vehicle's head lamps are illuminated, B is high when the operator of the vehicle is slowing the vehicle using the brake pedal, and DC is high when the vehicle is decelerating at a predetermined rate.\n","In a similar manner, a reverse-light illumination function may be represented by\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nThat is, the reverse-lights will be illuminated when either the PRNDL selector is in the REVERSE position or the vehicle has a rearward velocity.\n","Referring to , there is shown a logical implementation of equations 1 and 2. The circuit comprises first, second and third OR-gates ,  and  respectively, AND gate , and inverters , , and . The reverse-light illumination function appears at the output of OR-gate . OR-gate  has a first input coupled to R (vehicle is in REVERSE) and a second input coupled to VR (vehicle has a rearward velocity). Thus, reverse-lights will be illuminated when either the PRNDL select mode is in REVERSE or the vehicle has a rearward velocity.","The brake-light illumination function appears at the output of OR-gate . That is, the brake-light will be illuminated if the brake pedal has been depressed or the vehicle is decelerating above a predetermined threshold, or the vehicle is not in PARK and is not moving, or the vehicle's headlamps are on and the vehicle is not moving.","To generate the brake-light illumination function appearing at the output of OR-gate , a first input of OR-gate  is coupled to DC (vehicle is decelerating at a predetermined threshold), a second input is coupled to B (the operator has depressed the brake pedal to slow the vehicle), and a third input is coupled to an output of AND gate . AND gate  has first, second and third inputs coupled respectively to the output of inverter , the output of inverter , and the output of OR-gate . OR-gate  has a first input coupled to H (head lamp is on) and a second input coupled to the output of inverter . The input of inverter  is coupled to VR, the input of inverter  is coupled to VF (the vehicle has a forward velocity), and the input of inverter  is coupled to P (the vehicle is in PARK).","Thus, there has been provided an intelligent light control system for use on vehicles such as automobiles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, and the like, which results in the illumination of the vehicle's reverse or back-up lights not only when the vehicle has been placed in REVERSE but also when the vehicle has a rearward velocity irrespective of the position of the PRNDL selector. Furthermore, the intelligent light control system causes the vehicle's brake-lights to be illuminated not only when the operator of the vehicle is slowing the vehicle in the customary manner as by braking, but also when (1) the vehicle is decelerating above a predetermined rate or (2) the vehicle's headlights are on but the vehicle is not moving, or (3) when the vehicle is not in PARK and the vehicle is not moving.","While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. For example, many algorithms or logic circuit configurations or combinations of both may be utilized to those skilled in the art of designing such systems in order to achieve the desired reverse-light control function and brake-light control function. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient roadmap for implementing the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood the various changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims and the legal equivalence thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the following drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like elements, and",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
