R. and Campbell, I. D. 5: 114-121 (1995); Silvennoinen, O. and Ihle, J. N. (1996) SHCR) represents a set of proteins with similar structural characteristics. While there are still more members of the family yet to be identified, some members of the family include the following: growth hormone, prolactin, placental lactogen, erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12 (p35 subunit), IL-13, IL-15, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, alpha interferon, beta interferon, gamma interferon, omega interferon, tau interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (\u201cthe GH supergene family\u201d). Members of the GH supergene family have similar secondary and tertiary structures, despite the fact that they generally have limited amino acid or DNA sequence identity. The shared structural features allow new members of the gene family to be readily identified.","One member of the GH supergene family is feline erythropoietin (fEPO). Naturally-occurring erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone of molecular weight 34 kilo Daltons (kDa) that is produced in the mammalian kidney and liver. EPO is a key component in erythropoiesis, inducing the proliferation and differentiation of red cell progenitors. EPO activity also is associated with the activation of a number of erythroid-specific genes, including globin and carbonic anhydrase. See, e.g., Bondurant et al., 5:675-683 (1985); Koury et al., 126: 259-265 (1986).","The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is a member of the hematopoietic\/cytokine\/growth factor receptor family, which includes several other growth factor receptors, such as the interleukin (IL)-3, -4 and -6 receptors, the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor as well as the prolactin and growth hormone receptors. See, Bazan, 87: 6934-6938 (1990). Members of the cytokine receptor family contain four conserved cysteine residues and a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine motif positioned just outside the transmembrane region. The conserved sequences are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. See, e.g., Chiba et al., 184: 485-490 (1992).","U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,441,868; 5,547,933; 5,618,698; and 5,621,080 describe DNA sequences encoding human EPO and the purified and isolated polypeptide having part or all of the primary structural conformation and the biological properties of naturally occurring EPO.","The biological effects of EPO derive from its interaction with specific cellular receptors. The interaction between EPO and extracellular domain of its receptor (EPObp) is well understood. High-resolution x-ray crystallographic data has shown that EPO has two receptor binding sites and binds two receptor molecules sequentially using distinct sites on the molecule. The two receptor binding sites are referred to as Site I and Site II. Site I includes the carboxy terminal end of helix D and parts of helix A and the A-B loop, whereas Site II encompasses the amino terminal region of helix A and a portion of helix C. Binding of EPO to its receptor occurs sequentially, with site I binding first. Site II then engages a second EPO receptor, resulting in receptor dimerization and activation of the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cellular responses to the hormone.","Recombinant human EPO is used as a therapeutic and has been approved for the treatment of human subjects. EPO deficiency leads to anemia, for example, which has been successfully treated by exogenous administration of the hormone.","Anemias can be broadly divided into two categories: regenerative and non-regenerative. Regenerative anemias tend to be caused by blood loss, or as a result of red blood cell destruction by the immune system. Non-regenerative anemias, on the other hand, are those in which the bone marrow does not or cannot respond to the anemia. A common cause of anemia is chronic renal failure (CRF) with most of the remaining cases being due to infection with the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). These two disorders are the number 1 (FeLV) and number 2 (CRF) causes of death in pet cats. hEPO has been used in treatment of feline anemia. Unfortunately, there are concerns regarding immunogenicity when using hEPO to treat feline anemia and around 25% to 33% of hEPO treated cats developed red cell aplasia (RCA). Studies have been done, including a study of 11 cats and 6 dogs with CRF treated with recombinant hEPO, and although there was some demonstrated ability to increase red blood cell (RBC) and reticulocyte countes, 5\/11 cats developed anti-r-hEPO antibody (L D Cowgill, et al., 1998 Feb. 15; 212(4):521-8). A study of the safety and efficacy of recombinant feline erythropoietin (rfEPO) was done with 26 test subject cats and found that although again RBC and reticulocyte counts were raised, eight out of the 26 cats (i.e. more than 30%) developed anti-r-fEPO antibodies (J E Randolph, et al, 2004 Oct.; 65(10):1355-66). In another study, a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector containing feline erythropoietin cDNA was administered in a study group of 10 cats and they found that rAAV2 antibodies were detected in all vector-treated cats, one cat suffered pure RBC aplasia, and cats treated with lesser amounts showed no effect (M C Walker, et al., 2005 Mar.; 66(3):450-6).","Covalent attachment of the hydrophilic polymer poly(ethylene glycol), abbreviated PEG, is a method of increasing water solubility, bioavailability, increasing serum half-life, increasing therapeutic half-life, modulating immunogenicity, modulating biological activity, or extending the circulation time of many biologically active molecules, including proteins, peptides, and particularly hydrophobic molecules. PEG has been used extensively in pharmaceuticals, on artificial implants, and in other applications where biocompatibility, lack of toxicity, and lack of immunogenicity are of importance. In order to maximize the desired properties of PEG, the total molecular weight and hydration state of the PEG polymer or polymers attached to the biologically active molecule must be sufficiently high to impart the advantageous characteristics typically associated with PEG polymer attachment, such as increased water solubility and circulating half life, while not adversely impacting the bioactivity of the parent molecule.","PEG derivatives are frequently linked to biologically active molecules through reactive chemical functionalities, such as lysine, cysteine and histidine residues, the N-terminus and carbohydrate moieties. Proteins and other molecules often have a limited number of reactive sites available for polymer attachment. Often, the sites most suitable for modification via polymer attachment play a significant role in receptor binding, and are necessary for retention of the biological activity of the molecule. As a result, indiscriminate attachment of polymer chains to such reactive sites on a biologically active molecule often leads to a significant reduction or even total loss of biological activity of the polymer-modified molecule. R. Clark et al., (1996), 271:21969-21977. To form conjugates having sufficient polymer molecular weight for imparting the desired advantages to a target molecule, prior art approaches have typically involved random attachment of numerous polymer arms to the molecule, thereby increasing the risk of a reduction or even total loss in bioactivity of the parent molecule.","Reactive sites that form the loci for attachment of PEG derivatives to proteins are dictated by the protein's structure. Proteins, including enzymes, are built of various sequences of alpha-amino acids, which have the general structure HN\u2014CHR\u2014COOH. The alpha amino moiety (HN\u2014) of one amino acid joins to the carboxyl moiety (\u2014COOH) of an adjacent amino acid to form amide linkages, which can be represented as \u2014(NH\u2014CHR\u2014CO)\u2014, where the subscript \u201cn\u201d can equal hundreds or thousands. The fragment represented by R can contain reactive sites for protein biological activity and for attachment of PEG derivatives.","For example, in the case of the amino acid lysine, there exists an \u2014NHmoiety in the epsilon position as well as in the alpha position. The epsilon \u2014NHis free for reaction under conditions of basic pH. Much of the art in the field of protein derivatization with PEG has been directed to developing PEG derivatives for attachment to the epsilon \u2014NHmoiety of lysine residues present in proteins. \u201cPolyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Advanced PEGylation\u201d, Nektar Molecular Engineering Catalog, 2003, pp. 1-17. These PEG derivatives all have the common limitation, however, that they cannot be installed selectively among the often numerous lysine residues present on the surfaces of proteins. This can be a significant limitation in instances where a lysine residue is important to protein activity, existing in an enzyme active site for example, or in cases where a lysine residue plays a role in mediating the interaction of the protein with other biological molecules, as in the case of receptor binding sites.","A second and equally important complication of existing methods for protein PEGylation is that the PEG derivatives can undergo undesired side reactions with residues other than those desired. Histidine contains a reactive imino moiety, represented structurally as \u2014N(H)\u2014, but many derivatives that react with epsilon \u2014NHcan also react with \u2014N(H)\u2014. Similarly, the side chain of the amino acid cysteine bears a free sulfhydryl group, represented structurally as \u2014SH. In some instances, the PEG derivatives directed at the epsilon \u2014NHgroup of lysine also react with cysteine, histidine or other residues. This can create complex, heterogeneous mixtures of PEG-derivatized bioactive molecules and risks destroying the activity of the bioactive molecule being targeted. It would be desirable to develop PEG derivatives that permit a chemical functional group to be introduced at a single site within the protein that would then enable the selective coupling of one or more PEG polymers to the bioactive molecule at specific sites on the protein surface that are both well-defined and predictable.","In addition to lysine residues, considerable effort in the art has been directed toward the development of activated PEG reagents that target other amino acid side chains, including cysteine, histidine and the N-terminus. U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,281. \u201cPolyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Advanced PEGylation\u201d, Nektar Molecular Engineering Catalog, 2003, pp. 1-17. Cysteine residue can be introduced site-selectively into the structure of proteins using site-directed mutagenesis and other techniques known in the art, and the resulting free sulfhydryl moiety can be reacted with PEG derivatives that bear thiol-reactive functional groups. This approach is complicated, however, in that the introduction of a free sulfhydryl group can complicate the expression, folding and stability of the resulting protein. Thus, it would be desirable to have a means to introduce a chemical functional group into bioactive molecules that enables the selective coupling of one or more PEG polymers to the protein while simultaneously being compatible with (i.e., not engaging in undesired side reactions with) sulfhydryls and other chemical functional groups typically found in proteins.","As can be seen from a sampling of the art, many of these derivatives that have been developed for attachment to the side chains of proteins, in particular, the \u2014NHmoiety on the lysine amino acid side chain and the \u2014SH moiety on the cysteine side chain, have proven problematic in their synthesis and use. Some form unstable linkages with the protein that are subject to hydrolysis and therefore decompose, degrade, or are otherwise unstable in aqueous environments, such as in the blood stream. Some form more stable linkages, but are subject to hydrolysis before the linkage is formed, which means that the reactive group on the PEG derivative may be inactivated before the protein can be attached. Some are somewhat toxic and are therefore less suitable for use in vivo. Some are too slow to react to be practically useful. Some result in a loss of protein activity by attaching to sites responsible for the protein's activity. Some are not specific in the sites to which they will attach, which can also result in a loss of desirable activity and in a lack of reproducibility of results. In order to overcome the challenges associated with modifying proteins with poly(ethylene glycol) moieties, PEG derivatives have been developed that are more stable (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,498) or that react selectively with thiol moieties on molecules and surfaces (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,281). There is clearly a need in the art for PEG derivatives that are chemically inert in physiological environments until called upon to react selectively to form stable chemical bonds.","Recently, an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been reported, which promises to overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically, new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote () (e.g., L. Wang, et al., (2001), 292:498-500) and the eukaryote () (e.g., J. Chin et al., 301:964-7 (2003)), which has enabled the incorporation of non-genetically encoded amino acids to proteins in vivo. A number of new amino acids with novel chemical, physical or biological properties, including photoaffinity labels and photoisomerizable amino acids, keto amino acids, and glycosylated amino acids have been incorporated efficiently and with high fidelity into proteins in and in yeast in response to the amber codon, TAG, using this methodology. See, e.g., J. W. Chin et al., (2002), 124:9026-9027; J. W. Chin, & P. G. Schultz, (2002), 11:1135-1137; J. W. Chin, et al., (2002), 99:11020-11024: and, L. Wang, & P. G. Schultz, (2002), 1-10. These studies have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively and routinely introduce chemical functional groups, such as alkyne groups and azide moieties, that are not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively to form stable covalent linkages.","The ability to incorporate non-genetically encoded amino acids into proteins permits the introduction of chemical functional groups that could provide valuable alternatives to the naturally-occurring functional groups, such as the epsilon \u2014NHof lysine, the sulfhydryl \u2014SH of cysteine, the imino group of histidine, etc. Certain chemical functional groups are known to be inert to the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids but react cleanly and efficiently to form stable linkages. Azide and acetylene groups, for example, are known in the art to undergo a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction in aqueous conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper. See, e.g., Tornoe, et al., (2002) 67:3057-3064; and, Rostovtsev, et al., (2002) 41:2596-2599. By introducing an azide moiety into a protein structure, for example, one is able to incorporate a functional group that is chemically inert to amines, sulfhydryls, carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups found in proteins, but that also reacts smoothly and efficiently with an acetylene moiety to form a cycloaddition product. Importantly, in the absence of the acetylene moiety, the azide remains chemically inert and unreactive in the presence of other protein side chains and under physiological conditions.","The present invention addresses, among other things, problems associated with the activity and production of EPO, and also addresses the production of a hEPO polypeptide with improved biological or pharmacological properties, such as improved therapeutic half-life.","This invention provides fEPO polypeptides comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.","In some embodiments, the fEPO polypeptide is linked to a second fEPO polypeptide.","In some embodiments, the non-naturally encoded amino acid is linked to a water soluble polymer.

Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention or for any other reason.","The term \u201csubstantially purified\u201d refers to fEPO that may be substantially or essentially free of components that normally accompany or interact with the protein as found in its naturally occurring environment, i.e. a native cell, or host cell in the case of recombinantly produced fEPO. fEPO that may be substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1% (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the fEPO or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein may be present at about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, about 10%, about 5%, about 4%, about 3%, about 2%, or about 1% or less of the dry weight of the cells.

IRES is a region of a nucleic acid molecule e.g., an mRNA molecule, that allows internal ribosome entry\/binding sufficient to initiate translation in an assay for cap-independent translation, such as the bicistronic reporter assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,715,821. The presence of an IRES within an mRNA molecule allows cap-independent translation of a linked protein-encoding sequence that otherwise would not be translated. IRES's were first identified in picornaviruses, and are considered the paradigm for cap-independent translation. The 5\u2032 UTRS of all picornaviruses are long and mediate translational initiation by directly recruiting and binding ribosomes, thereby circumventing the initial cap-binding step.","IRES elements are frequently found in viral mRNAS, and are rarely found in non-viral mRNAs. To date, the non-viral mRNAS shown to contain functional IRES elements in their respective 5\u2032 UTRS include those encoding immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BIP) (Macejak, D. J. et al., Nature 353:90-94 (1991)); Drosophila Antennapedia (Oh, S. K. et al., Genes Dev. 6:1643-53 (1992)); and Ultrabithoran (Ye, X. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 17:1714-21 (1997)); fibroblast growth factor 2 (Vagner et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:35-47 (1915); initiation factor (Gan et al., J. Biol.

Oncogene 16:423-8 (1998)); Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Stein J. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 18:3112-9 (1998)). Cellular IRES elements have no obvious sequence or structural similarity to IRES sequences or to each other and therefore are identified using translational assays.

Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.","For brevity, the term \u201caryl\u201d when used in combination with other terms (including but not limited to, aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term \u201carylalkyl\u201d is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (including but not limited to, benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (including but not limited to, a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (including but not limited to, phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).","Each of the above teams (including but not limited to, \u201calkyl,\u201d \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d \u201caryl\u201d and \u201cheteroaryl\u201d) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Exemplary substituents for each type of radical are provided below.","Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: \u2014OR\u2032, \u2550O, \u2550NR\u2032, \u2550N\u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, -halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NRSOR\u2032, \u2014CN and \u2014NOin a number ranging from zero to (2m\u2032+1), where m\u2032 is the total number of carbon atoms in such a radical. R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033 and R\u2033\u2033 each independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, including but not limited to, aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033 and R\u2033\u2033 groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R\u2032 and R\u2033 are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \u201calkyl\u201d is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (including but not limited to, \u2014CFand \u2014CHCF) and acyl (including but not limited to, \u2014C(O)CH, \u2014C(O)CF, \u2014C(O)CHOCH, and the like).","Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, but are not limited to: halogen, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2550O, \u2550NR\u2032, \u2032N\u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, -halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033R\u2033\u2033)\u2550NR\u2033\u2033, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NRSOR\u2032, \u2014CN and \u2014NO, \u2014R\u2032, \u2014N, \u2014CH(Ph), fluoro(C-C)alkoxy, and fluoro(C-C)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033 and R\u2033\u2033 are independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033 and R\u2033\u2033 groups when more than one of these groups is present.","As used herein, the term \u201cmodulated serum half-life\u201d means the positive or negative change in circulating half-life of a modified biologically active molecule relative to its non-modified form. Serum half-life is measured by taking blood samples at various time points after administration of the biologically active molecule, and determining the concentration of that molecule in each sample. Correlation of the serum concentration with time allows calculation of the serum half-life. Increased serum half-life desirably has at least about two-fold, but a smaller increase may be useful, for example where it enables a satisfactory dosing regimen or avoids a toxic effect. In some embodiments, the increase is at least about three-fold, at least about five-fold, or at least about ten-fold.","The term \u201cmodulated therapeutic half-life\u201d as used herein means the positive or negative change in the half-life of the therapeutically effective amount of a modified biologically active molecule, relative to its non-modified form. Therapeutic half-life is measured by measuring pharmacokinetic and\/or pharmacodynamic properties of the molecule at various time points after administration. Increased therapeutic half-life desirably enables a particular beneficial dosing regimen, a particular beneficial total dose, or avoids an undesired effect. In some embodiments, the increased therapeutic half-life results from increased potency, increased or decreased binding of the modified molecule to its target, or an increase or decrease in another parameter or mechanism of action of the non-modified molecule.","The term \u201cisolated,\u201d when applied to a nucleic acid or protein, denotes that the nucleic acid or protein is substantially free of other cellular components with which it is associated in the natural state. It can be in a homogeneous state. Isolated substances can be in either a dry or semi-dry state, or in solution, including but not limited to an aqueous solution. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. A protein which is the predominant species present in a preparation is substantially purified. In particular, an isolated gene is separated from open reading frames which flank the gene and encode a protein other than the gene of interest. The term \u201cpurified\u201d denotes that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to substantially one band in an electrophoretic gel. Particularly, it means that the nucleic acid or protein is at least 85% pure, at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, or at least 99% pure or greater.","The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (including but not limited to, degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and\/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., 260:2605-2608 (1985); and Cassol et al. (1992); Rossolini et al., 8:91-98 (1994)).","The terms \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d \u201cpeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to naturally occurring amino acid polymers as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is a non-naturally encoded amino acid. As used herein, the terms encompass amino acid chains of any length, including full length proteins (i.e., antigens), wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.","Antibodies are proteins, which exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three or four CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)).","The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, antibodies or immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4; IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3 and \u03bc, respectively. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes, only human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgM are known to activate complement.","In vivo, affinity maturation of antibodies is driven by antigen selection of higher affinity antibody variants which are made primarily by somatic hypermutagenesis. A \u201crepertoire shift\u201d also often occurs in which the predominant germline genes of the secondary or tertiary response are seen to differ from those of the primary or secondary response.","The affinity maturation process of the immune system may be replicated by introducing mutations into antibody genes in vitro and using affinity selection to isolate mutants with improved affinity. Such mutant antibodies can be displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage or microorganisms such as yeast, and antibodies can be selected by their affinity for antigen or by their kinetics of dissociation (off-rate) from antigen. Hawkins et al. J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992). CDR walking mutagenesis has been employed to affinity mature human antibodies which bind the human envelope glycoprotein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Barbas III et al. PNAS (USA) 91: 3809-3813 (1994); and Yang et al. J. Mol. Biol. 254:392-403 (1995)); and an anti-c-erbB-2 single chain Fv fragment (Schier et al. J. Mol. Biol. 263:551567 (1996)). Antibody chain shuffling and CDR mutagenesis were used to affinity mature a high-affinity human antibody directed against the third hypervariable loop of HIV (Thompson et al. J. Mol. Biol. 256:77-88 (1996)). Balint and Larrick Gene 137:109-118 (1993) describe a computer-assisted oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed scanning mutagenesis whereby all CDRs of a variable region gene are simultaneously and thoroughly searched for improved variants. An \u03b1v\u03b23-specific humanized antibody was affinity matured using an initial limited mutagenesis strategy in which every position of all six CDRs was mutated followed by the expression and screening of a combinatorial library including the highest affinity mutants (Wu et al. PNAS (USA) 95: 6037-6-42 (1998)). Phage displayed antibodies are reviewed in Chiswell and McCafferty TIBTECH 10:80-84 (1992); and Rader and Barbas III Current Opinion in Biotech. 8:503-508 (1997). In each case where mutant antibodies with improved affinity compared to a parent antibody are reported in the above references, the mutant antibody has amino acid substitutions in a CDR.","By \u201caffinity maturation\u201d herein is meant the process of enhancing the affinity of an antibody for its antigen. Methods for affinity maturation include but are not limited to computational screening methods and experimental methods.","By \u201cantibody\u201d herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the antibody genes. The immunoglobulin genes include, but are not limited to, the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Antibody herein is meant to include full-length antibodies and antibody fragments, and include antibodies that exist naturally in any organism or are engineered (e.g. are variants).","By \u201cantibody fragment\u201d is meant any form of an antibody other than the full-length form. Antibody fragments herein include antibodies that are smaller components that exist within full-length antibodies, and antibodies that have been engineered. Antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fc, Fab, and (Fab\u2032), single chain Fv (scFv), diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, bifunctional hybrid antibodies, CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, combinations of CDR's, variable regions, framework regions, constant regions, and the like (Maynard & Georgiou, 2000, Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2:339-76; Hudson, 1998, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9:395-402).","The term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally encoded amino acids are the 20 common amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and pyrolysine and selenocysteine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, such as, homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (such as, norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid.","Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.","\u201cConservatively modified variants\u201d applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, \u201cconservatively modified variants\u201d refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.","As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \u201cconservatively modified variant\u201d where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.","The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another:","1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G);","2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);","3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);","4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);","5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);","6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);","7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and","8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M)","(see, e.g., Creighton, (W H Freeman & Co.; 2nd edition (December 1993)","The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or percent \u201cidentity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Sequences are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d if they have a percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., about 60% identity, optionally about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% identity over a specified region), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. This definition also refers to the complement of a test sequence. The identity can exist over a region that is at least about 50 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or over a region that is 75-100 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or, where not specified, across the entire sequence or a polynucleotide or polypeptide.","For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.","A \u201ccomparison window\u201d, as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, including but not limited to, by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1970) 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., (1995 supplement)).","One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1977) 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al. (1990) 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=\u22124 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1989) 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124 and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm is typically performed with the \u201clow complexity\u201d filter turned off.","The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.","The phrase \u201cselectively (or specifically) hybridizes to\u201d refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA).","The phrase \u201cstringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to conditions of low ionic strength and high temperature as is known in the art. Typically, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, , \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (T) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tis the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at T, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions may be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. for short probes (including but not limited to, 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60\u00b0 C. for long probes (including but not limited to, greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal may be at least two times background, optionally 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as following: 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42\u00b0 C., or 5\u00d7SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65\u00b0 C., with wash in 0.2\u00d7SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. Such washes can be performed for 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, or more minutes.","As used herein, the term \u201ceukaryote\u201d refers to organisms belonging to the phylogenetic domain Eucarya such as animals (including but not limited to, mammals, insects, reptiles, birds, etc.), ciliates, plants (including but not limited to, monocots, dicots, algae, etc.), fungi, yeasts, flagellates, microsporidia, protists, etc.","\u201cEukaryotic cell\u201d and \u201ceukaryotic cells\u201d include by way of example mammalian cells such as CHO, myeloma, BHK, immune cells, insect cells, avian cells, amphibian cells, e.g., frog oocytes, fungal and yeast cells.

These and other patents further describe promoters, terminators, enhancers, signals sequences, and other regulatory sequences useful for facilitating heterologus gene expression in yeast, e.g., protein genes as in the present invention.","As used herein, the term \u201ctransformation\u201d shall be used in a broad sense to refer to any introduction of DNA into a recipient host cell that changes the genotype and consequently results in a change in the recipient cell.","As used herein, the term \u201cnon-eukaryote\u201d refers to non-eukaryotic organisms. For example, a non-eukaryotic organism can belong to the Eubacteria (including but not limited to, , etc.) phylogenetic domain, or the Archaea (including but not limited to, such as and species NRC-1, , etc.) phylogenetic domain.","The term \u201csubject\u201d as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who is the object of treatment, observation or experiment.","One of skill in the art will be able to develop and use the same methods given below, for the composition of feline erythropoietin and related methods, for compositions and methods related to canine erythropoietin (cEPO) (SEQ ID NO: 31 mature amino acid sequence, SEQ ID NO: 30 full-length amino acid sequence) and equine erythropoietin (eEPO) (SEQ ID NO: 33 mature amino acid sequence, SEQ ID NO: 32 full-length amino acid sequence), for cEPO and eEPO with an unnatural, non-natural, and\/or non-naturally encoded amino acid incorporated into the cEPO and eEPO polypeptides.

In certain embodiments of the invention, EPO with at least one unnatural amino acid includes at least one post-translational modification. In one embodiment, the at least one post-translational modification comprises attachment of a molecule (including but not limited to, a dye, a polymer, including but not limited to a derivative of polyethylene glycol, a photocrosslinker, a cytotoxic compound, an affinity label, a derivative of biotin, a resin, a second protein or polypeptide, an antibody or antibody fragment, a metal chelator, a cofactor, a fatty acid, a carbohydrate, a polynucleotide (including but not limited to, DNA, RNA), etc.) comprising a second reactive group to the at least one unnatural amino acid comprising a first reactive group utilizing chemistry methodology that is known to one of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for the particular reactive groups. For example, the first reactive group is an alkynyl moiety (including but not limited to, in the unnatural amino acid p-propargyloxyphenylalanine, where the propargyl group is also sometimes refer to as an acetylene moiety) and the second reactive group is an azido moiety, and [3+2] cycloaddition chemistry methodologies are utilized. In another example, the first reactive group is the azido moiety (including but not limited to, in the unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine) and the second reactive group is the alkynyl moiety. In certain embodiments of the modified fEPO of the present invention, at least one unnatural amino acid (including but not limited to, unnatural amino acid containing a keto functional group) comprising at least one post-translational modification, is used where the at least one post-translational modification comprises a saccharide moiety. In certain embodiments, the post-translational modification is made in vivo in a eukaryotic cell or in a non-eukaryotic cell.","In certain embodiments, the protein includes at least one post-translational modification that is made in vivo by one host cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by another host cell type. In certain embodiments, the protein includes at least one post-translational modification that is made in vivo by a eukaryotic cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by a non-eukaryotic cell. Examples of post-translational modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like. In one embodiment, the post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide to an asparagine by a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage (including but not limited to, where the oligosaccharide comprises (GlcNAc-Man)-Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc, and the like). In another embodiment, the post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide (including but not limited to, Gal-GalNAc, Gal-GlcNAc, etc.) to a serine or threonine by a GalNAc-serine, a GalNAc-threonine, a GlcNAc-serine, or a GlcNAc-threonine linkage. In certain embodiments, a protein or polypeptide of the invention can comprise a secretion or localization sequence, an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine tag, a GST fusion, and\/or the like.","The protein or polypeptide of interest can contain at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or ten or more non-natural amino acids. The unnatural amino acids can be the same or different, for example, there can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more different sites in the protein that comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more different unnatural amino acids. In certain embodiments, at least one, but fewer than all, of a particular amino acid present in a naturally occurring version of the protein is substituted with an unnatural amino acid.","The present invention provides methods and compositions based on members of the GH supergene family, in particular fEPO, comprising at least one non-naturally encoded amino acid. Introduction of at least one non-naturally encoded amino acid into a GH supergene family member such as fEPO can allow for the application of conjugation chemistries that involve specific chemical reactions, including, but not limited to, with one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids while not reacting with the commonly occurring 20 amino acids. In some embodiments, the GH supergene family member such as fEPO comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid is linked to a water soluble polymer, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), via the side chain of the non-naturally encoded amino acid. This invention provides a highly efficient method for the selective modification of proteins with PEG derivatives, which involves the selective incorporation of non-genetically encoded amino acids, including but not limited to, those amino acids containing functional groups or substituents not found in the 20 naturally incorporated amino acids, including but not limited to an azide or acetylene moiety, into proteins in response to a selector codon and the subsequent modification of those amino acids with a suitably reactive PEG derivative. Once incorporated, the amino acid side chains can then be modified by utilizing chemistry methodologies known to those of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for the particular functional groups or substituents present in the naturally encoded amino acid. Known chemistry methodologies of a wide variety are suitable for use in the present invention to incorporate a water soluble polymer into the protein. Such methodologies include but are not limited to a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction (see, e.g., Padwa, A. in , Vol. 4, (1991) Ed. Trost, B. M., Pergamon, Oxford, p. 1069-1109; and, Huisgen, R. in 1,3-, (1984) Ed. Padwa, A., Wiley, N.Y., p. 1-176) with, including but not limited to, acetylene or azide derivatives, respectively.","Because the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition method involves a cycloaddition rather than a nucleophilic substitution reaction, proteins can be modified with extremely high selectivity. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature in aqueous conditions with excellent regioselectivity (1.4>1.5) by the addition of catalytic amounts of Cu(I) salts to the reaction mixture. See, e.g., Tornoe, et al., (2002) 67:3057-3064; and, Rostovtsev, et al., (2002) 41:2596-2599; and WO 03\/101972. A molecule that can be added to a protein of the invention through a [3+2] cycloaddition includes virtually any molecule with a suitable functional group or substituent including but not limited to an azido or acetylene derivative. These molecules can be added to an unnatural amino acid with an acetylene group, including but not limited to, p-prop argyloxyphenylalanine, or azido group, including but not limited to p-azido-phenylalanine, respectively.","The five-membered ring that results from the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition is not generally reversible in reducing environments and is stable against hydrolysis for extended periods in aqueous environments. Consequently, the physical and chemical characteristics of a wide variety of substances can be modified under demanding aqueous conditions with the active PEG derivatives of the present invention. Even more important, because the azide and acetylene moieties are specific for one another (and do not, for example, react with any of the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids), proteins can be modified in one or more specific sites with extremely high selectivity.","The invention also provides water soluble and hydrolytically stable derivatives of PEG derivatives and related hydrophilic polymers having one or more acetylene or azide moieties. The PEG polymer derivatives that contain acetylene moieties are highly selective for coupling with azide moieties that have been introduced selectively into proteins in response to a selector codon. Similarly, PEG polymer derivatives that contain azide moieties are highly selective for coupling with acetylene moieties that have been introduced selectively into proteins in response to a selector codon.","More specifically, the azide moieties comprise, but are not limited to, alkyl azides, aryl azides and derivatives of these azides. The derivatives of the alkyl and aryl azides can include other substituents so long as the acetylene-specific reactivity is maintained. The acetylene moieties comprise alkyl and aryl acetylenes and derivatives of each. The derivatives of the alkyl and aryl acetylenes can include other substituents so long as the azide-specific reactivity is maintained.","The present invention provides conjugates of substances having a wide variety of functional groups, substituents or moieties, with other substances including but not limited to water soluble polymers such as PEG, proteins, drugs, small molecules, biomaterials, or any other desirable compound or substance. The present invention also includes conjugates of substances having azide or acetylene moieties with PEG polymer derivatives having the corresponding acetylene or azide moieties. For example, a PEG polymer containing an azide moiety can be coupled to a biologically active molecule at a position in the protein that contains a non-genetically encoded amino acid bearing an acetylene functionality. The linkage by which the PEG and the biologically active molecule are coupled includes but is not limited to the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition product.","It is well established in the art that PEG can be used to modify the surfaces of biomaterials (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,281; Mehvar, R., J. Pharmaceut. Sci., 3(1):125-136 (2000) which are incorporated by reference herein). The invention also includes biomaterials comprising a surface having one or more reactive azide or acetylene sites and one or more of the azide- or acetylene-containing polymers of the invention coupled to the surface via the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition linkage. Biomaterials and other substances can also be coupled to the azide- or acetylene-activated polymer derivatives through a linkage other than the azide or acetylene linkage, such as through a linkage comprising a carboxylic acid, amine, alcohol or thiol moiety, to leave the azide or acetylene moiety available for subsequent reactions.","The invention includes a method of synthesizing the azide- and acetylene containing polymers of the invention. In the case of the azide-containing PEG derivative, the azide can be bonded directly to a carbon atom of the polymer. Alternatively, the azide-containing PEG derivative can be prepared by attaching a linking agent that has the azide moiety at one terminus to a conventional activated polymer so that the resulting polymer has the azide moiety at its terminus. In the case of the acetylene-containing PEG derivative, the acetylene can be bonded directly to a carbon atom of the polymer. Alternatively, the acetylene-containing PEG derivative can be prepared by attaching a linking agent that has the acetylene moiety at one terminus to a conventional activated polymer so that the resulting polymer has the acetylene moiety at its terminus.","More specifically, in the case of the azide-containing PEG derivative, a water soluble polymer having at least one active hydroxyl moiety undergoes a reaction to produce a substituted polymer having a more reactive moiety, such as a mesylate, tresylate, tosylate or halogen leaving group, thereon. The preparation and use of PEG derivatives containing sulfonyl acid halides, halogen atoms and other leaving groups are well known to the skilled artisan. The resulting substituted polymer then undergoes a reaction to substitute for the more reactive moiety an azide moiety at the terminus of the polymer. Alternatively, a water soluble polymer having at least one active nucleophilic or electrophilic moiety undergoes a reaction with a linking agent that has an azide at one terminus so that a covalent bond is formed between the PEG polymer and the linking agent and the azide moiety is positioned at the terminus of the polymer. Nucleophilic and electrophilic moieties, including amines, thiols, hydrazides, hydrazines, alcohols, carboxylates, aldehydes, ketones, thioesters and the like, are well known to the skilled artisan.","More specifically, in the case of the acetylene-containing PEG derivative, a water soluble polymer having at least one active hydroxyl moiety undergoes a reaction to displace a halogen or other activated leaving group from a precursor that contains an acetylene moiety. Alternatively, a water soluble polymer having at least one active nucleophilic or electrophilic moiety undergoes a reaction with a linking agent that has an acetylene at one terminus so that a covalent bond is formed between the PEG polymer and the linking agent and the acetylene moiety is positioned at the terminus of the polymer. The use of halogen moieties, activated leaving group, nucleophilic and electrophilic moieties in the context of organic synthesis and the presparation and use of PEG derivatives is well established to practitioners in the art.","The invention also provides a method for the selective modification of proteins to add other substances to the modified protein, including but not limited to water soluble polymers such as PEG and PEG derivatives containing an azide or acetylene moiety. The azide- and acetylene-containing PEG derivatives can be used to modify the properties of surfaces and molecules where biocompatibility, stability, solubility and lack of immunogenicity are important, while at the same time providing a more selective means of attaching the PEG derivatives to proteins than was previously known in the art.","The following proteins include those encoded by genes of the growth hormone (GH) supergene family (Bazan, F., 11: 350-354 (1991); Bazan, J. F. 257: 410-411 (1992); Mott, H. R. and Campbell, I. D., 5: 114-121 (1995); Silvennoinen, O. and Ihle, J. N., SHCR(1996)): growth hormone, prolactin, placental lactogen, erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12 (p35 subunit), IL-13, IL-15, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, alpha interferon, beta interferon, gamma interferon, omega interferon, tau interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (\u201cthe GH supergene family\u201d). It is anticipated that additional members of this gene family will be identified in the future through gene cloning and sequencing. Members of the GH supergene family have similar secondary and tertiary structures, despite the fact that they generally have limited amino acid or DNA sequence identity. The shared structural features allow new members of the gene family to be readily identified. Given the extent of structural homology among the members of the GH supergene family, non-naturally encoded amino acids may be incorporated into any members of the GH supergene family using the present invention.","Structures of a number of cytokines, including G-CSF (Hill, C. P., 90:5167-5171 (1993)), GM-CSF (Diederichs, K., et al. 154: 1779-1782 (1991); Walter et al., 224:1075-1085 (1992)), IL-2 (Bazan, J. F. 257: 410-411 (1992); McKay, D. B. 257: 412 (1992)), IL-4 (Redfield et al., 30: 11029-11035 (1991); Powers et al., 256:1673-1677 (1992)), and IL-5 (Milburn et al., 363: 172-176 (1993)) have been determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR studies and show striking conservation with the GH structure, despite a lack of significant primary sequence homology. EPO is considered to be a member of this family based upon modeling and mutagenesis studies (Boissel et al., 268: 15983-15993 (1993); Wen et al., 269: 22839-22846 (1994)). A large number of additional cytokines and growth factors including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), thrombopoietin (TPO), oncostatin M, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, and alpha, beta, omega, tau and gamma interferon belong to this family (reviewed in Mott and Campbell, 5: 114-121 (1995); Silvennoinen and Ihle (1996) SHCR). All of the above cytokines and growth factors are now considered to comprise one large gene family.","In addition to sharing similar secondary and tertiary structures, members of this family share the property that they must oligomerize cell surface receptors to activate intracellular signaling pathways. Some GH family members, including but not limited to; GH and EPO, bind a single type of receptor and cause it to form homodimers. Other family members, including but not limited to, IL-2, IL4. and IL-6, bind more than one type of receptor and cause the receptors to form heterodimers or higher order aggregates (Davis et al., (1993) 260: 1805-1808; Paonessa et al., 1995) EMBO J. 14: 1942-1951; Mott and Campbell, 5: 114-121 (1995)). Mutagenesis studies have shown that, like GH, these other cytokines and growth factors contain multiple receptor binding sites, typically two, and bind their cognate receptors sequentially (Mott and Campbell, 5: 114-121 (1995); Matthews et al., (1996) 93: 9471-9476). Like GH, the primary receptor binding sites for these other family members occur primarily in the four alpha helices and the A-B loop. The specific amino acids in the helical bundles that participate in receptor binding differ amongst the family members. Most of the cell surface receptors that interact with members of the GH supergene family are structurally related and comprise a second large multi-gene family. See, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,608,183.","A general conclusion reached from mutational studies of various members of the GH supergene family is that the loops joining the alpha helices generally tend to not be involved in receptor binding. In particular the short B-C loop appears to be non-essential for receptor binding in most, if not all, family members. For this reason, the B-C loop may be substituted with non-naturally encoded amino acids as described herein in members of the GH supergene family. The A-B loop, the C-D loop (and D-E loop of interferon\/IL-10-like members of the GH superfamily) may also be substituted with a non-naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acids proximal to helix A and distal to the final helix also tend not to be involved in receptor binding and also may be sites for introducing non-naturally-occurring amino acids. In some embodiments, a non-naturally encoded amino acid is substituted at any position within a loop region, including but not limited to, the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more amino acids of the A-B, B-C, C-D or D-E loop. In some embodiments, a non-naturally encoded amino acid is substituted within the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more amino acids of the A-B, B-C, C-D or D-E loop.","Certain members of the GH family, including but not limited to, EPO, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF, TPO, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-13, IL-15 and beta-interferon contain N-linked and O-linked sugars. The glycosylation sites in the proteins occur almost exclusively in the loop regions and not in the alpha helical bundles. Because the loop regions generally are not involved in receptor binding and because they are sites for the covalent attachment of sugar groups, they may be useful sites for introducing non-naturally-occurring amino acid substitutions into the proteins. Amino acids that comprise the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in the proteins may be sites for non-naturally-occurring amino acid substitutions because these amino acids are surface-exposed. Therefore, the natural protein can tolerate bulky sugar groups attached to the proteins at these sites and the glycosylation sites tend to be located away from the receptor binding sites.","Additional members of the GE gene family are likely to be discovered in the future. New members of the GH supergene family can be identified through computer-aided secondary and tertiary structure analyses of the predicted protein sequences. Members of the GH supergene family typically possess four or five amphipathic helices joined by non-helical amino acids (the loop regions). The proteins may contain a hydrophobic signal sequence at their N-terminus to promote secretion from the cell. Such later discovered members of the GH supergen family also are included within this invention.","Reference to fEPO polypeptides in this application is intended to use fEPO as an example of a member of the GH supergene family. Thus, it is understood that the modifications and chemistries described herein with reference to fEPO can be equally applied to any other members of the GH supergene family, including those specifically listed herein.","Described herein are novel expression systems for producing single or multiple gene products of interest from a single expression construct or from multiple expression constructs. In one embodiment the present invention includes a eukaryotic suppression expression system in which suppressed protein genes of interest are transcribed from a single vector encoding all elements necessary for suppression to include an artificial amino acid. In particular, the expression system contains a vector capable of expressing proteins in eukaryotic host cells such that the said protein(s) contains an artificial amino acid. The expression system contains a vector capable of expressing proteins in eukaryotic host cells such that the said protein(s) contains a non-natural amino acid or unnatural amino acid. The expression system contains a vector capable of expressing proteins in eukaryotic host cells such that the said protein(s) contains a non-naturally encoded amino acid such as but not limited to p-acetylphenylalanine (pAF). The expression vectors may comprise the following elements operably linked: single or multiple copies of a suppression tRNA sequence, including promoters and transcription terminators operable in a eukaryotic cell; a promoter linked to a DNA sequence encoding any gene of interest to be expressed (suppressed); and a promoter linked to a mammalian functional tRNA synthetase coding region. An embodiment of the present invention are mammalian cells containing the suppression expression vector, and a method of producing functional suppressed proteins in mammalian cells transfected with the suppression expression vector.","This invention also pertains to the suppression expression of functional proteins at adequate levels of expression via an expression system in a eukaryotic host cell. In one embodiment, the invention relates to the suppression expression of functional proteins in eukaryotic cells, preferably mammalian cells, fungal or yeast cells and still more preferably (Chinese Hamster Ovary) CHO cells, using a suppression expression system.","More specifically, one embodiment of the present invention relates to the suppression expression of functional proteins in eukaryotic cells, for example mammalian cells, fungal or yeast cells using a suppression expression system wherein all suppression elements are contained on a single vector. One embodiment of the present invention relates to the suppression expression of functional proteins in (Chinese Hamster Ovary) CHO cells (ATCC banked cells, as well as known variants and cells and\/or cell lines which those of skill in the art would know can be used in place of CHO cells), using a suppression expression system wherein all suppression elements are contained on a single vector. In one aspect of this embodiment of the invention, the suppression expression of functional proteins in mammalian cells comprises using a suppression expression system comprising tRNA, tRNA synthetase, and protein of interest transcriptional\/translationals elements.","Another embodiment of the invention provides the option of including single or multiple tRNA elements in independent transcriptional orientation to effectively modulate intracellular expression levels. In another embodiment, the invention provides the option of including a single transcriptional unit which encodes a single protein of interest into which the artificial amino acid is to be introduced. Another embodiment of the invention provides the option of including a multiple transcriptional units which encode multiple proteins of interest or subunits of therein (such as antibody light and heavy chains) into which the artificial amino acid is to be introduced into either on or both proteins.","Another embodiment of the invention is a eukaryotic cell line, such as a CHO cell line, that secretes the suppressed protein, wherein expression of said protein is via the suppression expression system described herein. In some embodiments, the eukaryotic cell is a CHO cell or a yeast cell, e.g., . Another embodiment of the invention is a culture of mammalian or yeast cells comprising a suppression expression system capable of producing functional suppressed proteins. Vectors containing suppression expression sequences according to the invention may be introduced into the mammalian or yeast cells. During cell culturing, desired exogenous DNA sequences may be introduced to target mammalian or yeast cells, such that exogenous DNA is inserted into the genome of the mammalian or yeast cells randomly or via homologous recombination. Depending upon the sequences employed, functional suppressed proteins may be recovered from the biomass of the cell culture or from the cell culture medium.","Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a method of producing functional suppressed proteins comprising culturing eukaryotic cells, preferably mammalian or yeast cells containing a suppression expression system that expresses antibody light and heavy chain sequences, and recovering functional antibodies from the cell culture. The functional antibodies may be produced in batch fed cell cultures at levels suitable for therapeutic use under conditions optimized for maximal commercial output. For example, CHO cells grown in batch fed cultures in which glucose levels are continuously controlled can produce recombinant protein for at least 12 days or more. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,401 for a discussion relating to the output of recombinant protein by cells grown in batch fed cultures.","A variety of different types of proteins may be expressed according to the instant invention. Types of proteins include single polypeptides or multiple assembled polypeptides such as but no limited to antibodies. For the purposes of this invention, numerous suppression expression vector systems may be employed. For example, a suppression expression vector may contain DNA elements which are derived from bacteria, such as, but not limited to: ; animal viruses such as bovine papillomavirus virus, polyoma virus, adenovirus, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, retroviruses (RSV, MMTV or MOMLV) or SV40 virus. Additionally, cells which have integrated the suppression expression construct DNA into their chromosomes may be selected by introducing one or more markers which allow selection of transfected host cells. The marker may provide for any means known to those skilled in the art for selection, including but not limited to, prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, biocide resistance (e.g., antibiotics) or resistance to heavy metals such as copper. The selectable marker gene can either be directly linked to the DNA sequences to be expressed, or introduced into the same cell by cotransformation. Additional elements that may be used in optimizing synthesis of mRNA may include splice signals, as well as transcriptional promoters, enhancers, and termination signals.","More generally, once the vector or DNA sequence encoding the protein subunit has been prepared, the expression vector may be introduced into an appropriate host cell. That is, the host cells may be transformed. Introduction of the plasmid into the host cell can be accomplished by various techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These include, but are not limited to, transfection (including electrophoresis and electroporation), protoplast fusion, calcium phosphate precipitation, cell fusion with enveloped DNA, microinjection, PEI, and infection with intact virus. See, Ridgway, A. A. G. \u201cMammalian Expression Vectors\u201d Chapter 24.2, pp. 470-472 Vectors, Rodriguez and Denhardt, Eds. (Butterworths, Boston, Mass. 1988). Most preferably, for stably integrated vectors, plasmid introduction into the host is via electroporation. The transformed cells are grown under conditions appropriate to the production of the protein and assayed for protein synthesis. Exemplary assay techniques for identifying and quantifying gene products of interest include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), or fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS), immunohistochemistry and the like.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the host cell line used for protein expression is of mammalian origin. Those skilled in the art can readily deter nine host cells or cell lines which would be suited for expression of a desired gene product. Exemplary host cell lines include, but are not limited to, DG44 and DUXB11 (Chinese Hamster Ovary lines, DHFR minus), CHO-K1 derivatives, CHO-S, HELA (human cervical carcinoma), CVI (monkey kidney line), COS (a derivative of CVI with SV40 T antigen), R1610 (Chinese hamster fibroblast) BALBC\/3T3 (mouse fibroblast), HAK (hamster kidney line), SP2\/0 (mouse myeloma), P3.times.63-Ag3.653 (mouse myeloma), BFA-1c1BPT (bovine endothelial cells), RAJI (human lymphocyte) and 293 (human kidney). CHO cells are particularly preferred. Host cells or cell lines are typically available from commercial services, the American Tissue Culture Collection or from published literature.","In vitro production allows scale-up to give large amounts of the desired polypeptide produced using the suppression expression system. Techniques for eukaryotic, e.g., mammalian and yeast cell cultivation under tissue culture conditions are known in the art and include homogeneous suspension culture, e.g. in an airlift reactor or in a continuous stirrer reactor, or immobilized or entrapped cell culture, e.g. in hollow fibers, microcapsules, on agarose microbeads or ceramic cartridges. For isolation and recovery of the antibodies, the immunoglobulins in the culture supernatants may first be concentrated, e.g. by precipitation with ammonium sulphate, dialysis against hygroscopic material such as PEG, filtration through selective membranes, or the like. If necessary and\/or desired, the concentrated solutions of multivalent antibodies are purified by the customary chromatography methods, for example gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, chromatography over DEAE-cellulose or (immuno-) affinity chromatography.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the eukaryotic cells used for expression are mammalian or yeast cells. In another embodiment of the present invention, the eukaryotic cells used for expression are CHO cells. In an additional embodiment of the present invention, the eukaryotic cells used for expression are other cells that can be efficiently cultured for high level protein production. As noted above, the obtaining or cloning of protein genes for incorporation into suppression expression systems according to the invention is within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art. As noted, such protein genes may encode mature genes, full-length proteins, or the genes may be modified, e.g., by chimerization, humanization, domain deletion or site-specific mutagenesis.

Such embodiments are used, including but not limited to, for protein expression or during the generation of variants, derivatives, expression cassettes, or other sequences derived from a fEPO polypeptide. In some embodiments, the sequences encoding the polypeptides of the invention are operably linked to a heterologous promoter. Isolation of hEPO is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence may be prepared by chemical synthesis, including but not limited to, by using an oligonucleotide synthesizer, wherein oligonucleotides are designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired polypeptide, and preferably selecting those codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide will be produced. For example, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide may be synthesized and assembled by PCR, ligation or ligation chain reaction.

Host cells are genetically engineered (including but not limited to, transformed, transduced or transfected) with the polynucleotides of the invention or constructs which include a polynucleotide of the invention, including but not limited to, a vector of the invention, which can be, for example, a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector can be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a bacterium, a virus, a naked polynucleotide, or a conjugated polynucleotide. The vectors are introduced into cells and\/or microorganisms by standard methods including electroporation (From et al., 82, 5824 (1985), infection by viral vectors, high velocity ballistic penetration by small particles with the nucleic acid either within the matrix of small beads or particles, or on the surface (Klein et al., 327, 70-73 (1987)).","The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for such activities as, for example, screening steps, activating promoters or selecting transformants. These cells can optionally be cultured into transgenic organisms.

These include: fusion of the recipient cells with bacterial protoplasts containing the DNA, electroporation, projectile bombardment, and infection with viral vectors (discussed further, below), etc. Bacterial cells can be used to amplify the number of plasmids containing DNA constructs of this invention. The bacteria are grown to log phase and the plasmids within the bacteria can be isolated by a variety of methods known in the art (see, for instance, Sambrook). In addition, a plethora of kits are commercially available for the purification of plasmids from bacteria, (see, e.g., EasyPrep\u2122, FlexiPrep\u2122, both from Pharmacia Biotech; StrataClean\u2122, from Stratagene; and, QIAprep\u2122 from Qiagen). The isolated and purified plasmids are then further manipulated to produce other plasmids, used to transfect cells or incorporated into related vectors to infect organisms. Typical vectors contain transcription and translation terminators, transcription and translation initiation sequences, and promoters useful for regulation of the expression of the particular target nucleic acid. The vectors optionally comprise generic expression cassettes containing at least one independent terminator sequence, sequences permitting replication of the cassette in eukaryotes, or prokaryotes, or both, (including but not limited to, shuttle vectors) and selection markers for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Vectors are suitable for replication and integration in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, or preferably both. See, Giliman & Smith, 8:81 (1979); Roberts, et al., 328:731 (1987); Schneider, B., et al., 6435:10 (1995); Ausubel, Sambrook, Berger (all supra).

(Chicago, Ill. available on the World Wide Web at expressgen.com), Operon Technologies Inc. (Alameda, Calif.) and many others.","Selector Codons","Selector codons of the invention expand the genetic codon framework of protein biosynthetic machinery. For example, a selector codon includes, but is not limited to, a unique three base codon, a nonsense codon, such as a stop codon, including but not limited to, an amber codon (UAG), or an opal codon (UGA), an unnatural codon, a four or more base codon, a rare codon, or the like. It is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that there is a wide range in the number of selector codons that can be introduced into a desired gene, including but not limited to, one or more, two or more, more than three, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more in a single polynucleotide encoding at least a portion of fEPO.","In one embodiment, the methods involve the use of a selector codon that is a stop codon for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids in vivo in a eukaryotic cell. For example, an O-tRNA is produced that recognizes the stop codon, including but not limited to, UAG, and is aminoacylated by an O-RS with a desired unnatural amino acid. This O-tRNA is not recognized by the naturally occurring host's aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis can be used to introduce the stop codon, including but not limited to, TAG, at the site of interest in a polypeptide of interest. See, e.g., Sayers, J. R., et al. (1988), 5\u2032,3\u2032 --791-802. When the O-RS, O-tRNA and the nucleic acid that encodes the polypeptide of interest are combined in vivo, the unnatural amino acid is incorporated in response to the UAG codon to give a polypeptide containing the unnatural amino acid at the specified position.","The incorporation of unnatural amino acids in vivo can be done without significant perturbation of the eukaryotic host cell. For example, because the suppression efficiency for the UAG codon depends upon the competition between the O-tRNA, including but not limited to, the amber suppressor tRNA, and a eukaryotic release factor (including but not limited to, eRF) (which binds to a stop codon and initiates release of the growing peptide from the ribosome), the suppression efficiency can be modulated by, including but not limited to, increasing the expression level of O-tRNA, and\/or the suppressor tRNA.","Selector codons also comprise extended codons, including but not limited to, four or more base codons, such as, four, five, six or more base codons. Examples of four base codons include, including but not limited to, AGGA, CUAG, UAGA, CCCU and the like. Examples of five base codons include, but are not limited to, AGGAC, CCCCU, CCCUC, CUAGA, CUACU, UAGGC and the like. A feature of the invention includes using extended codons based on frameshift suppression. Four or more base codons can insert, including but not limited to, one or multiple unnatural amino acids into the same protein. For example, in the presence of mutated O-tRNAs, including but not limited to, a special frameshift suppressor tRNAs, with anticodon loops, for example, with at least 8-10 nt anticodon loops, the four or more base codon is read as single amino acid. In other embodiments, the anticodon loops can decode, including but not limited to, at least a four-base codon, at least a five-base codon, or at least a six-base codon or more. Since there are 256 possible four-base codons, multiple unnatural amino acids can be encoded in the same cell using a four or more base codon. See, Anderson et al., (2002) 9:237-244; Magliery, (2001) --307: 755-769.","For example, four-base codons have been used to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins using in vitro biosynthetic methods. See, e.g., Ma et al., (1993) 32:7939; and Hohsaka et al., (1999) 121:34. CGGG and AGGU were used to simultaneously incorporate 2-naphthylalanine and an NBD derivative of lysine into streptavidin in vitro with two chemically acylated frameshift suppressor tRNAs. See, e.g., Hohsaka et al., (1999) 121:12194. In an in vivo study, Moore et al. examined the ability of tRNALeu derivatives with NCUA anticodons to suppress UAGN codons (N can be U, A, G, or C), and found that the quadruplet UAGA can be decoded by a tRNALeu with a UCUA anticodon with an efficiency of 13 to 26% with little decoding in the 0 or \u22121 frame. See, Moore et al., (2000) 298:195. In one embodiment, extended codons based on rare codons or nonsense codons can be used in the present invention, which can reduce missense readthrough and frameshift suppression at other unwanted sites.","For a given system, a selector codon can also include one of the natural three base codons, where the endogenous system does not use (or rarely uses) the natural base codon. For example, this includes a system that is lacking a tRNA that recognizes the natural three base codon, and\/or a system where the three base codon is a rare codon.","Selector codons optionally include unnatural base pairs. These unnatural base pairs further expand the existing genetic alphabet. One extra base pair increases the number of triplet codons from 64 to 125. Properties of third base pairs include stable and selective base pairing, efficient enzymatic incorporation into DNA with high fidelity by a polymerase, and the efficient continued primer extension after synthesis of the nascent unnatural base pair. Descriptions of unnatural base pairs which can be adapted for methods and compositions include, e.g., Hirao, et al., (2002) 20:177-182. Other relevant publications are listed below.","For in vivo usage, the unnatural nucleoside is membrane permeable and is phosphorylated to form the corresponding triphosphate. In addition, the increased genetic information is stable and not destroyed by cellular enzymes. Previous efforts by Benner and others took advantage of hydrogen bonding patterns that are different from those in canonical Watson-Crick pairs, the most noteworthy example of which is the iso-C:iso-G pair. See, e.g., Switzer et al., (1989) 111:8322; and Piccirilli et al., (1990) 343:33; Kool, (2000) 4:602. These bases in general mispair to some degree with natural bases and cannot be enzymatically replicated. Kool and co-workers demonstrated that hydrophobic packing interactions between bases can replace hydrogen bonding to drive the formation of base pair. See, Kool, (2000) 4:602; and Guckian and Kool, (1998) 36, 2825. In an effort to develop an unnatural base pair satisfying all the above requirements, Schultz, Romesberg and co-workers have systematically synthesized and studied a series of unnatural hydrophobic bases. A PICS:PICS self-pair is found to be more stable than natural base pairs, and can be efficiently incorporated into DNA by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF). See, e.g., McMinn et al., (1999) 121:11586; and Ogawa et al., (2000) 122:3274. A 3MN:3MN self-pair can be synthesized by KF with efficiency and selectivity sufficient for biological function. See, e.g., Ogawa et al., (2000) 122:8803. However, both bases act as a chain terminator for further replication. A mutant DNA polymerase has been recently evolved that can be used to replicate the PICS self pair. In addition, a 7AI self pair can be replicated. See, e.g., Tae et al., (2001) 123:7439. A novel metallobase pair, Dipic:Py, has also been developed, which forms a stable pair upon binding Cu(II). See, Meggers et al., (2000) 122:10714. Because extended codons and unnatural codons are intrinsically orthogonal to natural codons, the methods of the invention can take advantage of this property to generate orthogonal tRNAs for them.","A translational bypassing system can also be used to incorporate an unnatural amino acid in a desired polypeptide. In a translational bypassing system, a large sequence is incorporated into a gene but is not translated into protein. The sequence contains a structure that serves as a cue to induce the ribosome to hop over the sequence and resume translation downstream of the insertion.","In certain embodiments, the protein or polypeptide of interest (or portion thereof) in the methods and\/or compositions of the invention is encoded by a nucleic acid. Typically, the nucleic acid comprises at least one selector codon, at least two selector codons, at least three selector codons, at least four selector codons, at least five selector codons, at least six selector codons, at least seven selector codons, at least eight selector codons, at least nine selector codons, ten or more selector codons.","Genes coding for proteins or polypeptides of interest can be mutagenized using methods well-known to one of skill in the art and described herein under \u201cMutagenesis and Other Molecular Biology Techniques\u201d to include, for example, one or more selector codon for the incorporation of an unnatural amino acid. For example, a nucleic acid for a protein of interest is mutagenized to include one or more selector codon, providing for the incorporation of the one or more unnatural amino acids. The invention includes any such variant, including but not limited to, mutant, versions of any protein, for example, including at least one unnatural amino acid. Similarly, the invention also includes corresponding nucleic acids, i.e., any nucleic acid with one or more selector codon that encodes one or more unnatural amino acid.","Nucleic acid molecules encoding a protein of interest such as fEPO may be readily mutated to introduce a cysteine at any desired position of the polypeptide. Cysteine is widely used to introduce reactive molecules, water soluble polymers, proteins, or a wide variety of other molecules, onto a protein of interest. Methods suitable for the incorporation of cysteine into a desired position of the fEPO polypeptide are well known in the art, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,608,183, which is incorporated by reference herein, and standard mutagenesis techniques.","A very wide variety of non-naturally encoded amino acids are suitable for use in the present invention. Any number of non-naturally encoded amino acids can be introduced into fEPO. In general, the introduced non-naturally encoded amino acids are substantially chemically inert toward the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids (i.e., alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine). In some embodiments, the non-naturally encoded amino acids include side chain functional groups that react efficiently and selectively with functional groups not found in the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, azido, ketone, aldehyde and aminooxy groups) to form stable conjugates. For example, a fEPO polypeptide that includes a non-naturally encoded amino acid containing an azido functional group can be reacted with a polymer (including but not limited to, poly(ethylene glycol) or, alternatively, a second polypeptide containing an alkyne moiety to form a stable conjugate resulting for the selective reaction of the azide and the alkyne functional groups to form a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition product.","The generic structure of an alpha-amino acid is illustrated as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0222"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"11.01mm","wi":"19.56mm","file":"US08278418-20121002-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A non-naturally encoded amino acid is typically any structure having the above-listed formula wherein the R group is any substituent other than one used in the twenty natural amino acids, and may be suitable for use in the present invention.

Example phenylalanine analogs that may be suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, para-substituted phenylalanines, ortho-substituted phenylalanines, and meta-substituted phenylalanines, where the substituent comprises, including but not limited to, a hydroxy group, a methoxy group, a methyl group, an allyl group, an aldehyde, an azido, an iodo, a bromo, a keto group (including but not limited to, an acetyl group), a benzoyl, an alkynyl group, or the like. Specific examples of unnatural amino acids that may be suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, a p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-propargyloxyphenylalanine, O-methyl-L-tyrosine, an L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, a 3-methyl-phenylalanine, an O-4-allyl-L-tyrosine, a 4-propyl-L-tyrosine, a tri-O-acetyl-GleNAc\u03b2-serine, an L-Dopa, a fluorinated phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, a p-acyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine, an L-phosphoserine, a phosphonoserine, a phosphonotyrosine, a p-iodo-phenylalanine, a p-bromophenylalanine, a p-amino-L-phenylalanine, and an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, p-propargyloxy-phenylalanine, and the like. Examples of structures of a variety of unnatural amino acids that may be suitable for use in the present invention are provided in, for example, WO 2002\/085923 entitled \u201cIn vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids.\u201d See also Kiick et al., (2002) 99:19-24, for additional methionine analogs.","In one embodiment, compositions of fEPO that include an unnatural amino acid (such as p-(propargyloxy)-phenyalanine) are provided. Various compositions comprising p-(propargyloxy)-phenyalanine and, including but not limited to, proteins and\/or cells, are also provided. In one aspect, a composition that includes the p-(propargyloxy)-phenyalanine unnatural amino acid, further includes an orthogonal tRNA. The unnatural amino acid can be bonded (including but not limited to, covalently) to the orthogonal tRNA, including but not limited to, covalently bonded to the orthogonal tRNA though an amino-acyl bond, covalently bonded to a 3\u2032OH or a 2\u2032OH of a terminal ribose sugar of the orthogonal tRNA, etc.","The chemical moieties via unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated into proteins offer a variety of advantages and manipulations of the protein. For example, the unique reactivity of a keto functional group allows selective modification of proteins with any of a number of hydrazine- or hydroxylamine-containing reagents in vitro and in vivo. A heavy atom unnatural amino acid, for example, can be useful for phasing x-ray structure data. The site-specific introduction of heavy atoms using unnatural amino acids also provides selectivity and flexibility in choosing positions for heavy atoms. Photoreactive unnatural amino acids (including but not limited to, amino acids with benzophenone and arylazides (including but not limited to, phenylazide) side chains), for example, allow for efficient in vivo and in vitro photocrosslinking of protein. Examples of photoreactive unnatural amino acids include, but are not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine and p-benzoyl-phenylalanine. The protein with the photoreactive unnatural amino acids can then be crosslinked at will by excitation of the photoreactive group-providing temporal control. In one example, the methyl group of an unnatural amino can be substituted with an isotopically labeled, including but not limited to, methyl group, as a probe of local structure and dynamics, including but not limited to, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy. Alkynyl or azido functional groups, for example, allow the selective modification of proteins with molecules through a [3+2] cyclo addition reaction.","Chemical Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids","Many of the unnatural amino acids suitable for use in the present invention are commercially available, e.g., from Sigma (USA) or Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis., USA). Those that are not commercially available are optionally synthesized as provided herein or as provided in various publications or using standard methods known to those of skill in the art.

Other carbonyl-containing amino acids can be similarly prepared by one skilled in the art.","In some embodiments, a polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid is chemically modified to generate a reactive carbonyl functional group. For instance, an aldehyde functionality useful for conjugation reactions can be generated from a functionality having adjacent amino and hydroxyl groups. Where the biologically active molecule is a polypeptide, for example, an N-terminal serine or threonine (which may be normally present or may be exposed via chemical or enzymatic digestion) can be used to generate an aldehyde functionality under mild oxidative cleavage conditions using periodate. See, e.g., Gaertner, et. al., 3: 262-268 (1992); Geoghegan, K. & Stroh, J., 3:138-146 (1992); Gaertner et al., 269:7224-7230 (1994). However, methods known in the art are restricted to the amino acid at the N-terminus of the peptide or protein.","In the present invention, a non-naturally encoded amino acid bearing adjacent hydroxyl and amino groups can be incorporated into the polypeptide as a \u201cmasked\u201d aldehyde functionality. For example, 5-hydroxylysine bears a hydroxyl group adjacent to the epsilon amine. Reaction conditions for generating the aldehyde typically involve addition of molar excess of sodium metaperiodate under mild conditions to avoid oxidation at other sites within the polypeptide. The pH of the oxidation reaction is typically about 7.0. A typical reaction involves the addition of about 1.5 molar excess of sodium meta periodate to a buffered solution of the polypeptide, followed by incubation for about 10 minutes in the dark. See, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,423,685.","The carbonyl functionality can be reacted selectively with a hydrazine-hydrazide-, hydroxylamine-, or semicarbazide-containing reagent under mild conditions in aqueous solution to form the corresponding hydrazone, oxime, or semicarbazone linkages, respectively, that are stable under physiological conditions. See, e.g., Jencks, W. P., 81, 475-481 (1959); Shao, J. and Tam, J. P., 117:3893-3899 (1995). Moreover, the unique reactivity of the carbonyl group allows for selective modification in the presence of the other amino acid side chains. See, e.g., Cornish, V. W., et al., 118:8150-8151 (1996); Geoghegan, K. F. & Stroh, J. G., 3:138-146 (1992); Mahal, L. K., et al., 276:1125-1128 (1997).","B.

The unique reactivity of hydrazide, hydrazine and semicarbazide functional groups makes them significantly more reactive toward aldehydes, ketones and other electrophilic groups as compared to the nucleophilic groups present on the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine or the amino groups of lysine and the N-terminus).","C. Aminooxy-Containing Amino Acids","Non-naturally encoded amino acids containing an aminooxy (also called a hydroxylamine) group allow for reaction with a variety of electrophilic groups to form conjugates (including but not limited to, with PEG or other water soluble polymers).

Other aminooxy-containing amino acids can be prepared by one skilled in the art.","D. Azide and Alkyne Reactive Groups","The unique reactivity of azide and alkyne functional groups makes them extremely useful for the selective modification of polypeptides and other biological molecules. Organic azides, particularly alphatic azides, and alkynes are generally stable toward common reactive chemical conditions. In particular, both the azide and the alkyne functional groups are inert toward the side chains (i.e., R groups) of the 20 common amino acids found in naturally-occurring polypeptides. When brought into close proximity, however, the \u201cspring-loaded\u201d nature of the azide and alkyne groups is revealed and they react selectively and efficiently via Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to generate the corresponding triazole. See, e.g., Chin J., et al., 301:964-7 (2003); Wang, Q., et al., 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Chin, J. W., et al., 124:9026-9027 (2002).","Because the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction involves a selective cycloaddition reaction (see, e.g., Padwa, A., in COS, Vol. 4, (ed. Trost, B. M., 1991), p. 1069-1109; Huisgen, R. in 1,3-DCC, (ed. Padwa, A., 1984), p. 1-176) rather than a nucleophilic substitution, the incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids bearing azide and alkyne-containing side chains permits the resultant polypeptides to be modified selectively at the position of the non-naturally encoded amino acid. Cycloaddition reaction involving azide or alkyne-containing fEPO can be carried out at room temperature under aqueous conditions by the addition of Cu(II) (including but not limited to, in the form of a catalytic amount of CuSO) in the presence of a reducing agent for reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I), in situ, in catalytic amount. See, e.g., Wang, Q., et al., 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Tornoe, C. W., et al., 67:3057-3064 (2002); Rostovtsev, et al., 41:2596-2599 (2002). Exemplary reducing agents include, including but not limited to, ascorbate, metallic copper, quinine, hydroquinone, vitamin K, glutathione, cysteine, Fe, Co, and an applied electric potential.","In some cases, where a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between an azide and an alkyne is desired, the fEPO polypeptide comprises a non-naturally encoded amino acid comprising an alkyne moiety and the water soluble polymer to be attached to the amino acid comprises an azide moiety. Alternatively, the converse reaction (i.e., with the azide moiety on the amino acid and the alkyne moiety present on the water soluble polymer) can also be performed.","The azide functional group can also be reacted selectively with a water soluble polymer containing an aryl ester and appropriately functionalized with an aryl phosphine moiety to generate an amide linkage. The aryl phosphine group reduces the azide in situ and the resulting amine then reacts efficiently with a proximal ester linkage to generate the corresponding amide. See, e.g., E. Saxon and C. Bertozzi, 287, 2007-2010 (2000). The azide-containing amino acid can be either an alkyl azide (including but not limited to, 2-amino-6-azido-1-hexanoic acid) or an aryl azide (p-azido-phenylalanine).","Exemplary water soluble polymers containing an aryl ester and a phosphine moiety can be represented as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0255","num":"0254"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"13.89mm","wi":"34.46mm","file":"US08278418-20121002-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["2","3","3","2","2","2","3 ","2","3","3","3","2","3"]},"The azide functional group can also be reacted selectively with a water soluble polymer containing a thioester and appropriately functionalized with an aryl phosphine moiety to generate an amide linkage.

See, e.g., by March (Third Edition, 1985, Wiley and Sons, New York).","E. Aminothiol Reactive Groups","The unique reactivity of beta-substituted aminothiol functional groups makes them extremely useful for the selective modification of polypeptides and other biological molecules that contain aldehyde groups via formation of the thiazolidine. See, e.g., J. Shao and J. Tam, 1995, 117 (14) 3893-3899. In some embodiments, beta-substituted aminothiol amino acids can be incorporated into fEPO polypeptides and then reacted with water soluble polymers comprising an aldehyde functionality. In some embodiments, a water soluble polymer, drug conjugate or other payload can be coupled to a fEPO polypeptide comprising a beta-substituted aminothiol amino acid via formation of the thiazolidine.","Cellular Uptake of Unnatural Amino Acids","Unnatural amino acid uptake by a eukaryotic cell is one issue that is typically considered when designing and selecting unnatural amino acids, including but not limited to, for incorporation into a protein. For example, the high charge density of \u03b1-amino acids suggests that these compounds are unlikely to be cell permeable. Natural amino acids are taken up into the eukaryotic cell via a collection of protein-based transport systems. A rapid screen can be done which assesses which unnatural amino acids, if any, are taken up by cells. See, e.g., the toxicity assays in, e.g., the application Ser. No. 60\/435,821 entitled \u201cProtein Arrays,\u201d filed on Dec. 22, 2002; and Liu, D. R. & Schultz, P. G. (1999) 96:4780-4785. Although uptake is easily analyzed with various assays, an alternative to designing unnatural amino acids that are amenable to cellular uptake pathways is to provide biosynthetic pathways to create amino acids in vivo.","Biosynthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids","Many biosynthetic pathways already exist in cells for the production of amino acids and other compounds. While a biosynthetic method for a particular unnatural amino acid may not exist in nature, including but not limited to, in a eukaryotic cell, the invention provides such methods. For example, biosynthetic pathways for unnatural amino acids are optionally generated in host cell by adding new enzymes or modifying existing host cell pathways. Additional new enzymes are optionally naturally occurring enzymes or artificially evolved enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of p-aminophenylalanine (as presented in an example in WO 2002\/085923 entitled \u201cIn vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids\u201d) relies on the addition of a combination of known enzymes from other organisms. The genes for these enzymes can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell by transforming the cell with a plasmid comprising the genes. The genes, when expressed in the cell, provide an enzymatic pathway to synthesize the desired compound. Examples of the types of enzymes that are optionally added are provided in the examples below. Additional enzymes sequences are found, for example, in Genbank. Artificially evolved enzymes are also optionally added into a cell in the same manner. In this manner, the cellular machinery and resources of a cell are manipulated to produce unnatural amino acids.","A variety of methods are available for producing novel enzymes for use in biosynthetic pathways or for evolution of existing pathways. For example, recursive recombination, including but not limited to, as developed by Maxygen, Inc. (available on the world wide web at www.maxygen.com), is optionally used to develop novel enzymes and pathways. See, e.g., Stemmer (1994), 370(4):389-391; and, Stemmer, (1994), 91:10747-10751. Similarly DesignPath\u2122, developed by Genencor (available on the world wide web at genencor.com) is optionally used for metabolic pathway engineering, including but not limited to, to engineer a pathway to create O-methyl-L-trosine in a cell. This technology reconstructs existing pathways in host organisms using a combination of new genes, including but not limited to, identified through functional genomics, and molecular evolution and design. Diversa Corporation (available on the world wide web at diversa.com) also provides technology for rapidly screening libraries of genes and gene pathways, including but not limited to, to create new pathways.","Typically, the unnatural amino acid produced with an engineered biosynthetic pathway of the invention is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but not limited to, a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other amino acids or exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in vivo in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05 mM. Once a cell is transformed with a plasmid comprising the genes used to produce enzymes desired for a specific pathway and an unnatural amino acid is generated, in vivo selections are optionally used to further optimize the production of the unnatural amino acid for both ribosomal protein synthesis and cell growth.","Polypeptides with Unnatural Amino Acids","The incorporation of an unnatural amino acid can be done for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, tailoring changes in protein structure and\/or function, changing size, acidity, nucleophilicity, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobicity, accessibility of protease target sites, targeting to a moiety (including but not limited to, for a protein array), etc. Proteins that include an unnatural amino acid can have enhanced or even entirely new catalytic or biophysical properties. For example, the following properties are optionally modified by inclusion of an unnatural amino acid into a protein: toxicity, biodistribution, structural properties, spectroscopic properties, chemical and\/or photochemical properties, catalytic ability, half-life (including but not limited to, serum half-life), ability to react with other molecules, including but not limited to, covalently or noncovalently, and the like. The compositions including proteins that include at least one unnatural amino acid are useful for, including but not limited to, novel therapeutics, diagnostics, catalytic enzymes, industrial enzymes, binding proteins (including but not limited to, antibodies), and including but not limited to, the study of protein structure and function. See, e.g., Dougherty, (2000) 4:645-652.","In one aspect of the invention, a composition includes at least one protein with at least one, including but not limited to, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or at least ten or more unnatural amino acids. The unnatural amino acids can be the same or different, including but not limited to, there can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more different sites in the protein that comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more different unnatural amino acids. In another aspect, a composition includes a protein with at least one, but fewer than all, of a particular amino acid present in the protein is substituted with the unnatural amino acid. For a given protein with more than one unnatural amino acids, the unnatural amino acids can be identical or different (including but not limited to, the protein can include two or more different types of unnatural amino acids, or can include two of the same unnatural amino acid). For a given protein with more than two unnatural amino acids, the unnatural amino acids can be the same, different or a combination of a multiple unnatural amino acid of the same kind with at least one different unnatural amino acid.","Proteins or polypeptides of interest with at least one unnatural amino acid are a feature of the invention. The invention also includes polypeptides or proteins with at least one unnatural amino acid produced using the compositions and methods of the invention. An excipient (including but not limited to, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient) can also be present with the protein.","By producing proteins or polypeptides of interest with at least one unnatural amino acid in eukaryotic cells, proteins or polypeptides will typically include eukaryotic posttranslational modifications. In certain embodiments, a protein includes at least one unnatural amino acid and at least one post-translational modification that is made in vivo by a eukaryotic cell, where the post-translational modification is not made by a prokaryotic cell. For example, the post-translation modification includes, including but not limited to, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, glycosylation, and the like.

In certain embodiments, the protein comprises a secretion or localization sequence, an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine tag, a GST fusion, or the like.","One advantage of an unnatural amino acid is that it presents additional chemical moieties that can be used to add additional molecules. These modifications can be made in vivo in a eukaryotic or non-eukaryotic cell, or in vitro. Thus, in certain embodiments, the post-translational modification is through the unnatural amino acid. For example, the post-translational modification can be through a nucleophilic-electrophilic reaction. Most reactions currently used for the selective modification of proteins involve covalent bond formation between nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction partners, including but not limited to the reaction of \u03b1-haloketones with histidine or cysteine side chains. Selectivity in these cases is determined by the number and accessibility of the nucleophilic residues in the protein. In proteins of the invention, other more selective reactions can be used such as the reaction of an unnatural keto-amino acid with hydrazides or aminooxy compounds, in vitro and in vivo. See, e.g., Cornish, et al., (1996) 118:8150-8151; Mahal, et al., (1997) 276:1125-1128; Wang, et al., (2001) 292:498-500; Chin, et al., (2002) 124:9026-9027; Chin, et al., (2002) 99:11020-11024; Wang, et al., (2003) 100:56-61; Zhang, et al., (2003) 42:6735-6746; and, Chin, et al., (2003) , in press. This allows the selective labeling of virtually any protein with a host of reagents including fluorophores, crosslinking agents, saccharide derivatives and cytotoxic molecules. See also, patent application Ser. No. 10\/686,944, entitled \u201cGlycoprotein synthesis\u201d filed Jan. 16, 2003, which is incorporated by reference herein. Post-translational modifications, including but not limited to, through an azido amino acid, can also made through the Staudinger ligation (including but not limited to, with triarylphosphine reagents). See, e.g., Kiick et al., (2002) 99:19-24.","This invention provides another highly efficient method for the selective modification of proteins, which involves the genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids, including but not limited to, containing an azide or alkynyl moiety into proteins in response to a selector codon. These amino acid side chains can then be modified by, including but not limited to, a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction (see, e.g., Padwa, A. in 4, (1991) Ed. Trost, B. M., Pergamon, Oxford, p. 1069-1109; and, Huisgen, R. in 1,3-, (1984) Ed. Padwa, A., Wiley, New York, p. 1-176) with, including but not limited to, alkynyl or azide derivatives, respectively. Because this method involves a cycloaddition rather than a nucleophilic substitution, proteins can be modified with extremely high selectivity. This reaction can be carried out at room temperature in aqueous conditions with excellent regioselectivity (1.4>1.5) by the addition of catalytic amounts of Cu(I) salts to the reaction mixture. See, e.g., Tornoe, et al., (2002) 67:3057-3064; and, Rostovtsev, et al., (2002) 41:2596-2599. Another method that can be used is the ligand exchange on a bisarsenic compound with a tetracysteine motif, see, e.g., Griffin, et al., (1998) 281:269-272.","A molecule that can be added to a protein of the invention through a [3+2] cycloaddition includes virtually any molecule with an azido or alkynyl derivative. Molecules include, but are not limited to, dyes, fluorophores, crosslinking agents, saccharide derivatives, polymers (including but not limited to, derivatives of polyethylene glycol), photocrosslinkers, cytotoxic compounds, affinity labels, derivatives of biotin, resins, beads, a second protein or polypeptide (or more), polynucleotide(s) (including but not limited to, DNA, RNA, etc.), metal chelators, cofactors, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and the like. These molecules can be added to an unnatural amino acid with an alkynyl group, including but not limited to, p-propargyloxyphenylalanine, or azido group, including but not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine, respectively.","The fEPO polypeptides of the invention can be generated in vivo using modified tRNA and tRNA synthetases to add to or substitute amino acids that are not encoded in naturally-occurring systems.","Methods for generating tRNAs and tRNA synthetases which use amino acids that are not encoded in naturally-occurring systems are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publications 2003\/0082575 (Ser. No. 10\/126,927) and 2003\/0108885 (Ser. No. 10\/126,931), which are incorporated by reference herein. These methods involve generating a translational machinery that functions independently of the synthetases and tRNAs endogenous to the translation system (and are therefore sometimes referred to as \u201corthogonal\u201d). Typically, the translation system comprises an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (O-RS). Typically, the O-RS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with at least one non-naturally occurring amino acid in the translation system and the O-tRNA recognizes at least one selector codon that is not recognized by other tRNAs in the system. The translation system thus inserts the non-naturally-encoded amino acid into a protein produced in the system, in response to an encoded selector codon, thereby \u201csubstituting\u201d an amino acid into a position in the encoded polypeptide.","A wide variety of orthogonal tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases have been described in the art for inserting particular synthetic amino acids into polypeptides, and are generally suitable for ise in the present invention. For example, keto-specific O-tRNA\/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are described in Wang, L., et al., 100:56-61 (2003) and Zhang, Z. et al., 42(22):6735-6746 (2003).

W., et al., 301:964-967 (2003).","Use of O-tRNA\/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases involves selection of a specific codon which encodes the non-naturally encoded amino acid. While any codon can be used, it is generally desirable to select a codon that is rarely or never used in the cell in which the O-tRNA\/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is expressed. For example, exemplary codons include nonsense codon such as stop codons (amber, ochre, and opal), four or more base codons and other natural three-base codons that are rarely or unused.","Specific selector codon(s) can be introduced into appropriate positions in the fEPO polynucleotide coding sequence using mutagenesis methods known in the art (including but not limited to, site-specific mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis, restriction selection mutagenesis, etc.).","Methods for generating components of the protein biosynthetic machinery, such as O-RSs, O-tRNAs, and orthogonal O-tRNA\/O-RS pairs that can be used to incorporate a non-naturally encoded amino acid are described in Wang, L., et al., 292: 498-500 (2001); Chin, J.

One or more non-naturally-occurring amino acids may be incorporated at a particular position which does not disrupt activity of the polypeptide. This can be achieved by making \u201cconservative\u201d substitutions, including but not limited to, substituting hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophobic amino acids, bulky amino acids for bulky amino acids, hydrophilic amino acids for hydrophilic amino acids) and\/or inserting the non-naturally-occurring amino acid in a location that is not required for activity.","Regions of fEPO can be illustrated as follows, wherein the amino acid positions in fEPO are indicated in the middle row:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0302"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00014","num":"00014"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00014","he":"12.19mm","wi":"97.28mm","file":"US08278418-20121002-C00014.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A variety of biochemical and structural approaches can be employed to select the desired sites for substitution with a non-naturally encoded amino acid within the fEPO polypeptide. It is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that any position of the polypeptide chain is suitable for selection to incorporate a non-naturally encoded amino acid, and selection may be based on rational design or by random selection for any or no particular desired purpose. Selection of desired sites may be for producing an fEPO molecule having any desired property or activity, including but not limited to agonists, super-agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, receptor binding modulators, receptor activity modulators, dimer or multimer formation, no change to activity or property compared to the native molecule, or manipulating any physical or chemical property of the polypeptide such as solubility, aggregation, or stability. For example, locations in the polypeptide required for biological activity of fEPO can be identified using alanine scanning or homolog scanning methods known in the art. See, e.g., Bittorf, T. et al. 336:133-136 (1993) (identifying critical residues for EPO activity), Wen, D., et al. 269:22839-22846 (1994) (alanine scanning mutagenesis employed to identify functionally important domains of hEPO), and Elliot, S. et al. 89:493-502 (1997) (identifying key electrostatic interactions between hEPO and human EPO receptor). Residues other than those identified as critical to biological activity by alanine or homolog scanning mutagenesis may be good candidates for substitution with a non-naturally encoded amino acid depending on the desired activity sought for the polypeptide. Alternatively, the sites identified as critical to biological activity may also be good candidates for substitution with a non-naturally encoded amino acid, again depending on the desired activity sought for the polypeptide. Another alternative would be to simply make serial substitutions in each position on the polypeptide chain with a non-naturally encoded amino acid and observe the effect on the activities of the polypeptide. It is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that any means, technique, or method for selecting a position for substitution with a non-natural amino acid into any polypeptide is suitable for use in the present invention.","The structure and activity of naturally-occurring mutants of fEPO that contain deletions can also be examined to determine regions of the protein that are likely to be tolerant of substitution with a non-naturally encoded amino acid. See, e.g., Bittorf et al., 336:133 (1993); Wen et al, 269:22839 (1994). Once residues that are likely to be intolerant to substitution with non-naturally encoded amino acids have been eliminated, the impact of proposed substitutions at each of the remaining positions can be examined from the three-dimensional structure of fEPO and its binding proteins. See Syed et al., 395: 511 (1998) and Cheetham et al., 5:861 (1998); x-ray crystallographic and NMR structures of hEPO are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, www.rcsb.org with PDB ID's: 1CN4, LEER, and 1BUY), a centralized database containing three-dimensional structural data of large molecules of proteins and nucleic acids. Thus, by using the known information regarding hEPO, those of skill in the art can readily identify amino acid positions in fEPO (see ) that can be substituted with non-naturally encoded amino acids.","In some embodiments, the EPO polypeptides of the invention comprise one or more non-naturally occurring amino acid positioned in a region of the protein that does not disrupt the helices or beta sheet secondary structure of EPO. In some embodiments, the one or more non-naturally encoded amino acid are incorporated or substituted in one or more of the following regions corresponding to secondary structures in EPO as follows: 1-7 (N-terminus), 8-26 (A helix), 27-38 (region between A helix and B helix), 39-41 (Beta sheet 1), 42-46 (region between Beta sheet 1 and mini helix B\u2032), 47-52 (mini B\u2032 helix), 53-54 (region between mini B\u2032 helix and B helix), 55-83 (B helix), 84-89 (region between B helix and C helix), 90-113 (C helix), 114-121 (mini C\u2032 helix), 122-132 (region between mini C\u2032 helix and Beta sheet 2), 133-135 (Beta sheet 2), 136-137 (region between Beta sheet 2 and D helix), 138-161 (D helix), 162-166 (C-terminus). In some embodiments, the one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids are incorporated in one of the following positions in EPO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 17, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 45, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 68, 72, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 107, 110, 111, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 154, 157, 158, 159, 160, 162, 163, 164, 165 and 166. In some embodiments, the EPO polypeptides of the invention comprise one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids at one or more of the following positions: 21, 24, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 38, 55, 72, 83, 85, 86, 87, 89, 113, 116, 119, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, and 162. In some embodiments, the non-naturally occurring amino acid at these or other positions are linked to a water soluble molecule, including but not limited to positions 21, 24, 38, 83, 85, 86, 89, 116, 119, 121, 124, 125, 126, 127, and 128.","Exemplary sites of incorporation of a non-naturally encoded amino acid include, but are not limited to, those that are excluded from Site I and Site II, may be fully or partially solvent exposed, have minimal or no hydrogen-bonding interactions with nearby residues, may be minimally exposed to nearby reactive residues, and may be in regions that are highly flexible (including but not limited to, C-D loop) or structurally rigid (including but not limited to, B helix) as predicted by the three-dimensional crystal structure of hEPO with its receptor.","A wide variety of non-naturally encoded amino acids can be substituted for, or incorporated into, a given position in fEPO. In general, a particular non-naturally encoded amino acid is selected for incorporation based on an examination of the three dimensional crystal structure of fEPO with its receptor, a preference for conservative substitutions (i.e., aryl-based non-naturally encoded amino acids, such as p-acetylphenylalanine or O-propargyltyrosine substituting for Phe, Tyr or Trp), and the specific conjugation chemistry that one desires to introduce into the fEPO polypeptide (including but not limited to, the introduction of 4-azidophenylalanine if one wants to effect a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition with a water soluble polymer bearing an alkyne moiety or a amide bond formation with a water soluble polymer that bears an aryl ester that, in turn, incorporates a phosphine moiety).","In one embodiment, the method further includes incorporating into the protein the unnatural amino acid, where the unnatural amino acid comprises a first reactive group; and contacting the protein with a molecule (including but not limited to, a dye, a polymer, including but not limited to, a derivative of polyethylene glycol, a photocrosslinker, a cytotoxic compound, an affinity label, a derivative of biotin, a resin, a second protein or polypeptide, a metal chelator, a cofactor, a fatty acid, a carbohydrate, a polynucleotide (including but not limited to, DNA, RNA, etc.), etc.) that comprises a second reactive group. The first reactive group reacts with the second reactive group to attach the molecule to the unnatural amino acid through a [3+2] cycloaddition. In one embodiment, the first reactive group is an alkynyl or azido moiety and the second reactive group is an azido or alkynyl moiety. For example, the first reactive group is the alkynyl moiety (including but not limited to, in unnatural amino acid p-propargyloxyphenylalanine) and the second reactive group is the azido moiety. In another example, the first reactive group is the azido moiety (including but not limited to, in the unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine) and the second reactive group is the alkynyl moiety.","A subset of exemplary sites for incorporation of a non-naturally encoded amino acid include, but are not limited to, 1, 2, 4, 17, 21, 24, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 50, 53, 55, 58, 65, 68, 72, 76, 80, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 89, 113, 115, 116, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134, 136, and 162. An examination of the crystal structure of hEPO and its interactions with the hEPO receptor indicates as well as the molecular modeling provided along with the presently filed application of fEPO indicate that the side chains of these amino acid residues are fully or partially accessible to solvent and the side chain of a non-naturally encoded amino acid may point away from the protein surface and out into the solvent.","Exemplary positions for incorporation of a non-naturally encoded amino acid into fEPO include 21, 24, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 38, 55, 72, 83, 85, 86, 87, 89, 113, 116, 119, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, and 162. An examination of the crystal structure of hEPO and its interactions with the hEPO receptor indicates that the side chains of these amino acid residues are fully exposed to the solvent and the side chain of the native residue points out into the solvent.","In some cases, the non-naturally encoded amino acid substitution(s) or incorporation(s) will be combined with other additions, substitutions, or deletions within the fEPO polypeptide to affect other biological traits of fEPO. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the stability (including but not limited to, resistance to proteolytic degradation) of the fEPO polypeptide or increase affinity of the fEPO polypeptide for an erythropoietin receptor. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the solubility (including but not limited to, when expressed in or other host cells) of the fEPO polypeptide. In some embodiments sites are selected for substitution with a naturally encoded or non-naturally encoded amino acid in addition to another site for incorporation of a non-naturally encoded amino acid for the purpose of increasing fEPO solubility following expression in recombinant host cells. Examples of such sites in fEPO for amino acid substitution to increase solubility are N36, Q86, G113 and\/or Q115, which may be substituted with Lys, Arg, Glu, or any other charged naturally encoded or non-naturally encoded amino acid. In some embodiments, the fEPO polypeptides comprise another addition, substitution, or deletion that modulates affinity for the fEPO receptor, modulates (including but not limited to, increases or decreases) receptor dimerization, stabilizes receptor dimers, modulates circulating half-life, modulates release or bio-availability, facilitates purification, or improves or alters a particular route of administration. Similarly, fEPO polypeptides can comprise protease cleavage sequences, reactive groups, antibody-binding domains (including but not limited to, FLAG or poly-His) or other affinity based sequences (including but not limited to, FLAG, poly-His, GST, etc.) or linked molecules (including but not limited to, biotin) that improve detection (including but not limited to, GFP), purification or other traits of the polypeptide.","For instance, in addition to introducing one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids as set forth herein, one or more of the following substitutions are introduced: S9A, F48S, Y49S, A50S, Q59A, A73G, G101A, T106A, L108A, T132A, R139A, K140A, R143A, S146A, N147A, R150A, and K154A to increase the affinity of the fEPO variant for its receptor (Wen et al., (1994) JBC 269:22839-22846).","In some embodiments, the substitution of a non-naturally encoded amino acid generates a fEPO antagonist. A subset of exemplary sites for incorporation of a non-naturally encoded amino acid include: 10, 11, 14, 15, 96, 97, 100, 103, 104, 107, 110. (Elliot et al. (1997) Blood 89: 493-502; and Cheetham et al. (1998) Nature Structural Biology 5: 861-866). In other embodiments, the exemplary sites of incorporation of a non-naturally encoded amino acid include residues within the amino terminal region of helix A and a portion of helix C. In another embodiment, substitution of L108 with a non-naturally encoded amino acid such as p-azido-L-phenyalanine or O-propargyl-L-tyrosine. In other embodiments, the above-listed substitutions are combined with additional substitutions that cause the fEPO polypeptide to be a fEPO antagonist. For instance, a non-naturally encoded amino acid is substituted at one of the positions identified herein and a simultaneous substitution is introduced at L108 (including but not limited to, L108K, L108R, L108II, L108D, or L108E).","In some cases, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more amino acids are substituted with a non-naturally-encoded amino acid. In some cases, the fEPO polypeptide further includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more substitutions of a non-naturally encoded amino acid for a naturally-occurring amino acid. For example, in some embodiments, at least two residues in the following regions of fEPO are substituted with a non-naturally encoded amino acid: 1-7 (N-terminus), 8-26 (A helix), 27-38 (region between A helix and B helix), 39-41 (Beta sheet 1), 42-46 (region between Beta sheet 1 and mini helix B\u2032), 47-52 (mini B\u2032 helix), 53-54 (region between mini B\u2032 helix and B helix), 55-83 (B helix), 84-89 (region between B helix and C helix), 90-113 (C helix), 114-121 (mini C\u2032 helix), 122-132 (region between mini C\u2032 helix and Beta sheet 2), 133-135 (Beta sheet 2), 136-137 (region between Beta sheet 2 and D helix), 138-161 (D helix), 162-166 (C-terminus). In some cases, the two or more non-naturally encoded residues are linked to one or more lower molecular weight linear or branched PEGs (approximately \u02dc5-20 kDa in mass), thereby enhancing binding affinity and comparable serum half-life relative to the species attached to a single, higher molecular weight PEG.","In some embodiments, up to two of the following residues are substituted with a non-naturally-encoded amino acid at position: 1, 2, 4, 17, 21, 24, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 50, 53, 55, 58, 65, 68, 72, 76, 80, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 89, 113, 115, 116, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134, 136, and 162. Thus, in some cases, any of the following pairs of substitutions are made: N24X* and G113X*; N38X* and Q115X*; N36X* and S85X*; N36X* and A125X*; N36X* and A128X*; Q86X* and S126X* wherein X* represents a non-naturally encoded amino acid. Preferred sites for incorporation of two or more non-naturally encoded amino acids include combinations of the following residues: 21, 24, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 38, 55, 72, 83, 85, 86, 87, 89, 113, 116, 119, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, and 162. Particularly preferred sites for incorporation of two or more non-naturally encoded amino acids include combinations of the following residues: 21, 24, 38, 83, 86, 89, 116, 119, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130 and 162.","To obtain high level expression of a cloned fEPO polynucleotide, one typically subclones polynucleotides encoding a fEPO polypeptide of the invention into an expression vector that contains a strong promoter to direct transcription, a transcription\/translation terminator, and if for a nucleic acid encoding a protein, a ribosome binding site for translational initiation. Suitable bacterial promoters are well known in the art and described, e.g., in Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al.","Bacterial expression systems for expressing fEPO polypeptides of the invention are available in, including but not limited to, sp., and (Palva et al., 22:229-235 (1983); Mosbach et al., 302:543-545 (1983). Kits for such expression systems are commercially available. Eukaryotic expression systems for mammalian cells, yeast, and insect cells are well known in the art and are also commercially available. In cases where orthogonal tRNAs and amino acyl tRNA synthetases (described above) are used to express the fEPO polypeptides of the invention, host cells for expression are selected based on their ability to use the orthogonal components. Exemplary host cells include Gram-positive bacteria (including but not limited to or or ) and Gram-negative bacteria (), as well as yeast and other eukaryotic cells. Cells comprising O-tRNA\/O-RS pairs can be used as described herein.","A eukaryotic host cell or non-eukaryotic host cell of the present invention provides the ability to synthesize proteins that comprise unnatural amino acids in large useful quantities. In one aspect, the composition optionally includes, including but not limited to, at least 10 micrograms, at least 50 micrograms, at least 75 micrograms, at least 100 micrograms, at least 200 micrograms, at least 250 micrograms, at least 500 micrograms, at least 1 milligram, at least 10 milligrams, at least 100 milligrams, at least one gram, or more of the protein that comprises an unnatural amino acid, or an amount that can be achieved with in vivo protein production methods (details on recombinant protein production and purification are provided herein).

The production of large quantities (including but not limited to, greater that that typically possible with other methods, including but not limited to, in vitro translation) of a protein in a eukaryotic cell including at least one unnatural amino acid is a feature of the invention.","A eukaryotic host cell or non-eukaryotic hose cell of the present invention provides the ability to biosynthesize proteins that comprise unnatural amino acids in large useful quantities.

A description of exemplary expression systems is provided below.","Yeast As used herein, the term \u201cyeast\u201d includes any of the various yeasts capable of expressing a gene encoding fEPO. Such yeasts include, but are not limited to, ascosporogenous yeasts (), basidiosporogenous yeasts and yeasts belonging to the Fungi imperfecti () group. The ascosporogenous yeasts are divided into two families, Spermophthoraceae and Saccharomycetaceae. The latter is comprised of four subfamilies, Schizosaccharomycoideae (e.g., genus ), Nadsonioideae, Lipomycoideae and Saccharomycoideae (e.g., genera and ). The basidiosporogenous yeasts include the genera , and . Yeasts belonging to the Fungi Imperfecti () group are divided into two families, Sporobolomycetaceae (e.g., genera and ) and Cryptococcaceae (e.g., genus ).","Of particular interest for use with the present invention are species within the genera , and , including, but not limited to, , and ","The selection of suitable yeast for expression of fEPO is within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. In selecting yeast hosts for expression, suitable hosts may include those shown to have, for example, good secretion capacity, low proteolytic activity, and overall robustness. Yeast are generally available from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Department of Biophysics and Medical Physics, University of California (Berkeley, Calif.), and the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u201d) (Manassas, Va.).","The term \u201cyeast host\u201d or \u201cyeast host cell\u201d includes yeast that can be, or has been, used as a recipient for recombinant vectors or other transfer DNA. The term includes the progeny of the original yeast host cell that has received the recombinant vectors or other transfer DNA. It is understood that the progeny of a single parental cell may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total DNA complement to the original parent, due to accidental or deliberate mutation. Progeny of the parental cell that are sufficiently similar to the parent to be characterized by the relevant property, such as the presence of a nucleotide sequence encoding a fEPO, are included in the progeny intended by this definition.","Expression and transformation vectors, including extrachromosomal replicons or integrating vectors, have been developed for transformation into many yeast hosts. For example, expression vectors have been developed for (Sikorski et al., G(1998) 112:19; Ito et al., J. B. (1983) 153:163; Hinnen et al., P. N. A. S. USA (1978) 75:1929); (Kurtz et al., M. C. B.

The yeast PHO5 gene, encoding acid phosphatase, also may provide useful promoter sequences (Myanohara et al., P. N. A. S. USA (1983) 80:1). Other suitable promoter sequences for use with yeast hosts may include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., J. B. C. (1980) 255:2073); and other glycolytic enzymes, such as pyruvate decarboxylase, triosephosphate isomerase, and phosphoglucose isomerase (Holland et al., B(1978) 17:4900; Hess et al., J. A. ER. (1968) 7:149). Inducible yeast promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions may include the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2; isocytochrome C; acid phosphatase; metallothionein; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism; and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 0 073 657.","Yeast enhancers also may be used with yeast promoters. In addition, synthetic promoters may also function as yeast promoters. For example, the upstream activating sequences (UAS) of a yeast promoter may be joined with the transcription activation region of another yeast promoter, creating a synthetic hybrid promoter. Examples of such hybrid promoters include the ADH regulatory sequence linked to the GAP transcription activation region. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,880,734 and 4,876,197. Other examples of hybrid promoters include promoters that consist of the regulatory sequences of the ADH2, GAL4, GAL10, or PHO5 genes, combined with the transcriptional activation region of a glycolytic enzyme gene such as GAP or PyK. See EP 0 164 556. Furthermore, a yeast promoter may include naturally occurring promoters of non-yeast origin that have the ability to bind yeast RNA polymerase and initiate transcription.","Other control elements that may comprise part of the yeast expression vectors include terminators, for example, from GAPDH or the enolase genes (Holland et al., J. B. C. (1981) 256:1385). In addition, the origin of replication from the 2\u03bc plasmid origin is suitable for yeast. A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid. See Tschemper et al., G(1980) 10:157; Kingsman et al., G(1979) 7:141. The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.","Methods of introducing exogenous DNA into yeast hosts are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and typically include, but are not limited to, either the transformation of spheroplasts or of intact yeast host cells treated with alkali cations. For example, transformation of yeast can be carried out according to the method described in Hsiao et al., P. N. A. S. USA (1979) 76:3829 and Van Solingen et al., J. B. (1977) 130:946. However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear injection, electroporation, or protoplast fusion may also be used as described generally in S., MC: A L. M(2001).

The fermentation methods may be adapted to account for differences in a particular yeast host's carbon utilization pathway or mode of expression control. For example, fermentation of a yeast host may require a single glucose feed, complex nitrogen source (e.g., casein hydrolysates), and multiple vitamin supplementation. In contrast, the methylotrophic yeast may require glycerol, methanol, and trace mineral feeds, but only simple ammonium (nitrogen) salts for optimal growth and expression. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,639; Elliott et al., J. PC. (1990) 9:95; and Fieschko et al., B. B. (1987) 29:1113.","Such fermentation methods, however, may have certain common features independent of the yeast host strain employed. For example, a growth limiting nutrient, typically carbon, may be added to the fermentor during the amplification phase to allow maximal growth. In addition, fermentation methods generally employ a fermentation medium designed to contain adequate amounts of carbon, nitrogen, basal salts, phosphorus, and other minor nutrients (vitamins, trace minerals and salts, etc.). Examples of fermentation media suitable for use with are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,324,639 and 5,231,178.","Baculovirus-Infected Insect Cells The term \u201cinsect host\u201d or \u201cinsect host cell\u201d refers to a insect that can be, or has been, used as a recipient for recombinant vectors or other transfer DNA. The term includes the progeny of the original insect host cell that has been transfected. It is understood that the progeny of a single parental cell may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total DNA complement to the original parent, due to accidental or deliberate mutation.

Viral expression vectors derived from this system usually use the strong viral polyhedrin gene promoter to drive expression of heterologous genes. See generally, Reilly ., BEV: A LM(1992).","Prior to inserting the foreign gene into the baculovirus genome, the above-described components, comprising a promoter, leader (if desired), coding sequence of interest, and transcription termination sequence, are typically assembled into an intermediate transplacement construct (transfer vector). Intermediate transplacement constructs are often maintained in a replicon, such as an extra chromosomal element (e.g., plasmids) capable of stable maintenance in a host, such as bacteria. The replicon will have a replication system, thus allowing it to be maintained in a suitable host for cloning and amplification. More specifically, the plasmid may contain the polyhedrin polyadenylation signal (Miller et al., A. R. M. (1988) 42:177) and a prokaryotic ampicillin-resistance (amp) gene and origin of replication for selection and propagation in ","One commonly used transfer vector for introducing foreign genes into AcNPV is pAc373. Many other vectors, known to those of skill in the art, have also been designed including, for example, pVL985, which alters the polyhedrin start codon from ATG to ATT, and which introduces a BamHI cloning site 32 base pairs downstream from the ATT. See Luckow and Summers, 17 V31 (1989). Other commercially available vectors include, for example, PBlueBac4.5\/V5-His; pBlueBacHis2; pMelBac; pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.).","After insertion of the heterologous gene, the transfer vector and wild type baculoviral genome are co-transfected into an insect cell host.

(1983) 3:2156; Luckow and Summers, V(1989) 17:31. For example, the insertion can be into a gene such as the polyhedrin gene, by homologous double crossover recombination; insertion can also be into a restriction enzyme site engineered into the desired baculovirus gene. See Miller et al., B(1989) 4:91.","Transfection may be accomplished by electroporation. See TW39 MMB(1995); Mann and King, J. G. V. (1989) 70:3501. Alternatively, liposomes may be used to transfect the insect cells with the recombinant expression vector and the baculovirus.

A baculovirus promoter is any DNA sequence capable of binding a baculovirus RNA polymerase and initiating the downstream (3\u2032) transcription of a coding sequence (e.g., structural gene) into mRNA. A promoter will have a transcription initiation region which is usually placed proximal to the 5\u2032 end of the coding sequence. This transcription initiation region typically includes an RNA polymerase binding site and a transcription initiation site. A baculovirus promoter may also have a second domain called an enhancer, which, if present, is usually distal to the structural gene. Moreover, expression may be either regulated or constitutive.","Structural genes, abundantly transcribed at late times in the infection cycle, provide particularly useful promoter sequences. Examples include sequences derived from the gene encoding the viral polyhedron protein (FTMBB(1986); EP 0 127 839 and 0 155 476) and the gene encoding the p10 protein (Vlak et al., J. G. V.

For example, recombinant baculoviruses have been developed for, inter alia, (ATCC No. CCL-125), (ATCC No. CRL-8910), (ATCC No. 1963), , and . See W0 89\/046,699; Wright, N(1986) 321:718; Carbonell et al., J. V. (1985) 56:153; Smith et al., M. C. B. (1983) 3:2156. See generally, Fraser et al., IVC. D. B. (1989) 25:225.

No. 11497-013 (Carlsbad, Calif.)), Tri-368 (), and High-Five\u2122 BTI-TN-5B1-4 ().","Cells and culture media are commercially available for both direct and fusion expression of heterologous polypeptides in a baculovirus\/expression, and cell culture technology is generally known to those skilled in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0349","num":"0348"},"i":"E. Coli "},"A bacterial promoter is any DNA sequence capable of binding bacterial RNA polymerase and initiating the downstream (3\u2033) transcription of a coding sequence (e.g. structural gene) into mRNA. A promoter will have a transcription initiation region which is usually placed proximal to the 5\u2032 end of the coding sequence. This transcription initiation region typically includes an RNA polymerase binding site and a transcription initiation site. A bacterial promoter may also have a second domain called an operator, that may overlap an adjacent RNA polymerase binding site at which RNA synthesis begins. The operator permits negative regulated (inducible) transcription, as a gene repressor protein may bind the operator and thereby inhibit transcription of a specific gene. Constitutive expression may occur in the absence of negative regulatory elements, such as the operator. In addition, positive regulation may be achieved by a gene activator protein binding sequence, which, if present is usually proximal (5\u2032) to the RNA polymerase binding sequence. An example of a gene activator protein is the catabolite activator protein (CAP), which helps initiate transcription of the lac operon in () [Raibaud et al., A. R. G. (1984) 18:173]. Regulated expression may therefore be either positive or negative, thereby either enhancing or reducing transcription.","Sequences encoding metabolic pathway enzymes provide particularly useful promoter sequences. Examples include promoter sequences derived from sugar metabolizing enzymes, such as galactose, lactose (lac) [Chang et al., N(1977) 198:1056], and maltose. Additional examples include promoter sequences derived from biosynthetic enzymes such as tryptophan (trp) [Goeddel et al., N. AR. (1980) 8:4057; Yelverton et al., N. AR. (1981) 9:731; U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,921; EPO Pub. Nos. 036 776 and 121 775]. The \u03b2-galactosidase (bla) promoter system [Weissmann (1981) \u201cThe cloning of interferon and other mistakes.\u201d In Interferon 3 (Ed. I. Gresser)], bacteriophage lambda PL [Shimatake et al., N(1981) 292:128] and T5 [U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,406] promoter systems also provide useful promoter sequences. Preferred methods of the present invention utilize strong promoters, such as the T7 promoter to induce fEPO at high levels. Examples of such vectors are well known in the art and include the pET29 series from Novagen, and the pPOP vectors described in WO99\/05297. Such expression systems produce high levels of fEPO in the host without compromising host cell viability or growth parameters.","In addition, synthetic promoters which do not occur in nature also function as bacterial promoters. For example, transcription activation sequences of one bacterial or bacteriophage promoter may be joined with the operon sequences of another bacterial or bacteriophage promoter, creating a synthetic hybrid promoter [U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,433]. For example, the tac promoter is a hybrid trp-lac promoter comprised of both trp promoter and lac operon sequences that is regulated by the lac repressor [Amann et al., G(1983) 25:167; de Boer et al., P. N. A. S. (1983) 80:21]. Furthermore, a bacterial promoter can include naturally occurring promoters of non-bacterial origin that have the ability to bind bacterial RNA polymerase and initiate transcription. A naturally occurring promoter of non-bacterial origin can also be coupled with a compatible RNA polymerase to produce high levels of expression of some genes in prokaryotes. The bacteriophase T7 RNA polymerase\/promoter system is an example of a coupled promoter system [Studier et al., J. M. B. (1986) 189:113; Tabor et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. (1985) 82:1074]. In addition, a hybrid promoter can also be comprised of a bacteriophage promoter and an operator region (EPO Pub. No. 267 851).","In addition to a functioning promoter sequence, an efficient ribosome binding site is also useful for the expression of foreign genes in prokaryotes. In , the ribosome binding site is called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and includes an initiation codon (ATG) and a sequence 3-9 nucleotides in length located 3-11 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon [Shine et al., N(1975) 254:34]. The SD sequence is thought to promote binding of mRNA to the ribosome by the pairing of bases between the SD sequence and the 3\u2032 and of 16S rRNA [Steitz et al. \u201cGenetic signals and nucleotide sequences in messenger RNA\u201d, In Biological Regulation and Development: Gene Expression (Ed. R. F. Goldberger, 1979)].

The term includes the progeny of the original bacterial host cell that has been transfected. It is understood that the progeny of a single parental cell may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total DNA complement to the original parent, due to accidental or deliberate mutation. Progeny of the parental cell that are sufficiently similar to the parent to be characterized by the relevant property, such as the presence of a nucleotide sequence encoding a fEPO, are included in the progeny intended by this definition.","The selection of suitable host bacteria for expression of fEPO is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In selecting bacterial hosts for expression, suitable hosts may include those shown to have, inter alia, good inclusion body formation capacity, low proteolytic activity, and overall robustness. Bacterial hosts are generally available from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, the Bacterial Genetic Stock Center, Department of Biophysics and Medical Physics, University of California (Berkeley, Calif.); and the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u201d) (Manassas, Va.). Industrial\/pharmaceutical fermentation generally use bacterial derived from K strains (e.g. W3110) or from bacteria derived from B strains (e.g. BL21). These strains are particularly useful because their growth parameters are extremely well known and robust. In addition, these strains are non-pathogenic, which is commercially important for safety and environmental reasons. In one embodiment of the methods of the present invention, the host is a strain of BL21. In another embodiment of the methods of the present invention, the host is a protease minus strain including, but not limited to, OMP- and LON-.","Once a recombinant host cell strain has been established (i.e., the expression construct has been introduced into the host cell and host cells with the proper expression construct are isolated), the recombinant host cell strain is cultured under conditions appropriate for production of fEPO. As will be apparent to one of skill in the art, the method of culture of the recombinant host cell strain will be dependent on the nature of the expression construct utilized and the identity of the host cell. Recombinant host strains are normally cultured using methods that are well known to the art. Recombinant host cells are typically cultured in liquid medium containing assimilatable sources of carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic salts and, optionally, containing vitamins, amino acids, growth factors, and other proteinaceous culture supplements well known to the art. Liquid media for culture of host cells may optionally contain antibiotics or anti-fungals to prevent the growth of undesirable microorganisms and\/or compounds including, but not limited to, antibiotics to select for host cells containing the expression vector.","Recombinant host cells may be cultured in batch or continuous formats, with either cell harvesting (in the case where fEPO accumulates intracellularly) or harvesting of culture supernatant in either batch or continuous formats. For production in prokaryotic host cells, batch culture and cell harvest are preferred.","The fEPO of the invention are normally purified after expression in recombinant systems. fEPO may be purified from host cells by a variety of methods known to the art. Normally, fEPO produced in bacterial host cells is poorly soluble or insoluble (in the form of inclusion bodies). In one embodiment of the present invention, amino acid substitutions may readily be made in the fEPO polypeptide that are selected for the purpose of increasing the solubility of the recombinantly produced protein utilizing the methods disclosed herein as well as those known in the art. In the case of insoluble protein, the protein may be collected from host cell lysates by centrifugation and may further be followed by homogenization of the cells. In the case of poorly soluble protein, compounds including, but not limited to, polyethylene imine (PEI) may be added to induce the precipitation of partially soluble protein. The precipitated protein may then be conveniently collected by centrifugation. Recombinant host cells may be disrupted or homogenized to release the inclusion bodies from within the cells using a variety of methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Host cell disruption or homogenization may be performed using well known techniques including, but not limited to, enzymatic cell disruption, sonication, dounce homogenization, or high pressure release disruption. In one embodiment of the method of the present invention, the high pressure release technique is used to disrupt the host cells to release the inclusion bodies of fEPO. It has been found that yields of insoluble fEPO in the form of inclusion bodies may be increased by utilizing only one passage of the host cells through the homogenizer. When handling inclusion bodies of fEPO, it is advantageous to minimize the homogenization time on repetitions in order to maximize the yield of inclusion bodies without loss due to factors such as solubilization, mechanical shearing or proteolysis.","Insoluble or precipitated fEPO may then be solubilized using any of a number of suitable solubilization agents known to the art. Preferably, fEPO is solubilized with urea or guanidine hydrochloride. The volume of the solubilized fEPO-BP should be minimized so that large batches may be produced using conveniently manageable batch sizes. This factor may be significant in a large-scale commercial setting where the recombinant host may be grown in batches that are thousands of liters in volume. In addition, when manufacturing fEPO in a large-scale commercial setting, in particular for human pharmaceutical uses, the avoidance of harsh chemicals that can damage the machinery and container, or the protein product itself, should be avoided, if possible. It has been shown in the method of the present invention that the milder denaturing agent urea can be used to solubilize the fEPO inclusion bodies in place of the harsher denaturing agent guanidine hydrochloride. The use of urea significantly reduces the risk of damage to stainless steel equipment utilized in the manufacturing and purification process of fEPO while efficiently solubilizing the fEPO inclusion bodies.","When fEPO is produced as a fusion protein, the fusion sequence is preferably removed. Removal of a fusion sequence may be accomplished by enzymatic or chemical cleavage, preferably by enzymatic cleavage. Enzymatic removal of fusion sequences may be accomplished using methods well known to those in the art. The choice of enzyme for removal of the fusion sequence will be determined by the identity of the fusion, and the reaction conditions will be specified by the choice of enzyme as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The cleaved fEPO is preferably purified from the cleaved fusion sequence by well known methods. Such methods will be determined by the identity and properties of the fusion sequence and the fEPO, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Methods for purification may include, but are not limited to, size-exclusion chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography or dialysis or any combination thereof.","fEPO is also preferably purified to remove DNA from the protein solution. DNA may be removed by any suitable method known to the art, such as precipitation or ion exchange chromatography, but is preferably removed by precipitation with a nucleic acid precipitating agent, such as, but not limited to, protamine sulfate. fEPO may be separated from the precipitated DNA using standard well known methods including, but not limited to, centrifugation or filtration. Removal of host nucleic acid molecules is an important factor in a setting where the fEPO is to be used to treat humans and the methods of the present invention reduce host cell DNA to pharmaceutically acceptable levels.","Methods for small-scale or large-scale fermentation can also be used in protein expression, including but not limited to, fermentors, shake flasks, fluidized bed bioreactors, hollow fiber bioreactors, roller bottle culture systems, and stirred tank bioreactor systems. Each of these methods can be performed in a batch, fed-batch, or continuous mode process.","Feline EPO polypeptides of the invention can generally be recovered using methods standard in the art. For example, culture medium or cell lysate can be centrifuged or filtered to remove cellular debris. The supernatant may be concentrated or diluted to a desired volume or diafiltered into a suitable buffer to condition the preparation for further purification. Further purification of the fEPO of the present invention include separating deamidated and clipped forms of the fEPO variant from the intact form.","Any of the following exemplary procedures can be employed for purification of a fEPO polypeptides of the invention: affinity chromatography; anion- or cation-exchange chromatography (using, including but not limited to, DEAE SEPHAROSE); chromatography on silica; reverse phase HPLC; gel filtration (using, including but not limited to, SEPHADEX G-75); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; size-exclusion chromatography, metal-chelate chromatography; ultrafiltration\/diafiltration; ethanol precipitation; ammonium sulfate precipitation; chromatofocusing; displacement chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (including but not limited to preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (including but not limited to ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction.","Proteins of the present invention, including but not limited to, proteins comprising unnatural amino acids, antibodies to proteins comprising unnatural amino acids, binding partners for proteins comprising unnatural amino acids, etc., can be purified, either partially or substantially to homogeneity, according to standard procedures known to and used by those of skill in the art. Accordingly, polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified by any of a number of methods well known in the art, including but not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid or base extraction, column chromatography, affinity column chromatography, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, lectin chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like. Protein refolding steps can be used, as desired, in making correctly folded mature proteins. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), affinity chromatography or other suitable methods can be employed in final purification steps where high purity is desired. In one embodiment, antibodies made against unnatural amino acids (or proteins comprising unnatural amino acids) are used as purification reagents, including but not limited to, for affinity-based purification of proteins comprising one or more unnatural amino acid(s). Once purified, partially or to homogeneity, as desired, the polypeptides are optionally used for a wide variety of utilities, including but not limited to, as assay components, therapeutics, prophylaxis, diagnostics, research reagents, and\/or as immunogens for antibody production.","In addition to other references noted herein, a variety of purification\/protein folding methods are well known in the art, including, but not limited to, those set forth in R. Scopes, , Springer-Verlag, N.Y. (1982); Deutscher, 182: , Academic Press, Inc. N.Y. (1990); Sandana (1997) , Academic Press, Inc.; Bollag et al.

However, in certain embodiments of the invention, those of skill in the art will recognize that, after synthesis, expression and\/or purification, proteins can possess a conformation different from the desired conformations of the relevant polypeptides. In one aspect of the invention, the expressed protein is optionally denatured and then renatured. This is accomplished utilizing methods known in the art, including but not limited to, by adding a chaperonin to the protein or polypeptide of interest, by solubilizing the proteins in a chaotropic agent such as guanidine HCl, utilizing protein disulfide isomerase, etc.","In general, it is occasionally desirable to denature and reduce expressed polypeptides and then to cause the polypeptides to re-fold into the preferred conformation. For example, guanidine, urea, DTT, DTE, and\/or a chaperonin can be added to a translation product of interest. Methods of reducing, denaturing and renaturing proteins are well known to those of skill in the art (see, the references above, and Debinski, et al. (1993) 268: 14065-14070; Kreitman and Pastan (1993) 4: 581-585; and Buchner, et al., (1992) 205: 263-270). Debinski, et al., for example, describe the denaturation and reduction of inclusion body proteins in guanidine-DTE. The proteins can be refolded in a redox buffer containing, including but not limited to, oxidized glutathione and L-arginine. Refolding reagents can be flowed or otherwise moved into contact with the one or more polypeptide or other expression product, or vice-versa.","In the case of prokaryotic production of fEPO, the fEPO thus produced may be misfolded and thus lacks or has reduced biological activity. The bioactivity of the protein may be restored by \u201crefolding\u201d. In general, misfolded fEPO is refolded by solubilizing (where the fEPO is also insoluble), unfolding and reducing the polypeptide chain using, for example, one or more chaotropic agents (e.g. urea and\/or guanidine) and a reducing agent capable of reducing disulfide bonds (e.g. dithiothreitol, DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-ME). At a moderate concentration of chaotrope, an oxidizing agent is then added (e.g., oxygen, cystine or cystamine), which allows the reformation of disulfide bonds. fEPO may be refolded using standard methods known in the art, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,511,502, 4,511,503, and 4,512,922. The fEPO may also be cofolded with other proteins to form heterodimers or heteromultimers. After refolding or cofolding, the fEPO is preferably further purified.","General Purification Methods. Any one of a variety of isolation steps may be performed on the cell lysate comprising fEPO or on any fEPO mixtures resulting from any isolation steps including, but not limited to, affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (\u201cHPLC\u201d), reversed phase-HPLC (\u201cRP-HPLC\u201d), expanded bed adsorption, or any combination and\/or repetition thereof and in any appropriate order.","Equipment and other necessary materials used in performing the techniques described herein are commercially available.

Commercially available pumps include, but are not limited to, HILOAD\u00ae Pump P-50, Peristaltic Pump P-1, Pump P-901, and Pump P-903 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).","Examples of fraction collectors include RediFrac Fraction Collector, FRAC-100 and FRAC-200 Fraction Collectors, and SUPERFRAC\u00ae Fraction Collector (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Mixers are also available to form pH and linear concentration gradients. Commercially available mixers include Gradient Mixer GM-1 and In-Line Mixers (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).","The chromatographic process may be monitored using any commercially available monitor. Such monitors may be used to gather information like UV, pH, and conductivity. Examples of detectors include Monitor UV-1, UVICORD\u00ae S II, Monitor UV-M II, Monitor UV-900, Monitor UPC-900, Monitor pH\/C-900, and Conductivity Monitor (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Indeed, entire systems are commercially available including the various AKTA\u00ae systems from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, N.J.).","In one embodiment of the present invention, for example, the fEPO may be reduced and denatured by first denaturing the resultant purified fEPO in urea, followed by dilution into TRIS buffer containing a reducing agent (such as DTT) at a suitable pH. In another embodiment, the fEPO is denatured in urea in a concentration range of between about 2 M to about 9 M, followed by dilution in TRIS buffer at a pH in the range of about 5.0 to about 8.0. The refolding mixture of this embodiment may then be incubated. In one embodiment, the refolding mixture is incubated at room temperature for four to twenty-four hours. The reduced and denatured fEPO mixture may then be further isolated or purified.","As stated herein, the pH of the first fEPO mixture may be adjusted prior to performing any subsequent isolation steps. In addition, the first fEPO mixture or any subsequent mixture thereof may be concentrated using techniques known in the art. Moreover, the elution buffer comprising the first fEPO mixture or any subsequent mixture thereof may be exchanged for a buffer suitable for the next isolation step using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Ion Exchange Chromatography. In one embodiment, and as an optional, additional step, ion exchange chromatography may be performed on the first fEPO mixture. See generally IEC: PM(Cat. No. 18-1114-21, Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, N.J.)). Commercially available ion exchange columns include HITRAP\u00ae, HIPREP\u00ae, and HILOAD\u00ae Columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Such columns utilize strong anion exchangers such as Q SEPHAROSE\u00ae Fast Flow, Q SEPHAROSE\u00ae High Performance, and Q SEPHAROSE\u00ae XL; strong cation exchangers such as SP SEPHAROSE\u00ae High Performance, SP SEPHAROSE\u00ae Fast Flow, and SP SEPHAROSE\u00ae XL; weak anion exchangers such as DEAE SEPHAROSE\u00ae Fast Flow; and weak cation exchangers such as CM SEPHAROSE\u00ae Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Cation exchange column chromatography may be performed on the fEPO at any stage of the purification process to isolate substantially purified fEPO. The cation exchange chromatography step may be performed using any suitable cation exchange matrix. Useful cation exchange matrices include, but are not limited to, fibrous, porous, non-porous, microgranular, beaded, or cross-linked cation exchange matrix materials. Such cation exchange matrix materials include, but are not limited to, cellulose, agarose, dextran, polyacrylate, polyvinyl, polystyrene, silica, polyether, or composites of any of the foregoing. Following adsorption of the fEPO to the cation exchanger matrix, substantially purified fEPO may be eluted by contacting the matrix with a buffer having a sufficiently high pH or ionic strength to displace the fEPO from the matrix. Suitable buffers for use in high pH elution of substantially purified fEPO include, but are not limited to, citrate, phosphate, formate, acetate, HEPES, and MES buffers ranging in concentration from at least about 5 mM to at least about 100 mM.","Reverse-Phase Chromatography. RP-HPLC may be performed to purify proteins following suitable protocols that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson et al., AB. (1982) 124:217-230 (1982); Rivier et al., J. C. (1983) 268:112-119; Kunitani et al., J. C. (1986) 359:391-402. RP-HPLC may be performed on the fEPO to isolate substantially purified fEPO. In this regard, silica derivatized resins with alkyl functionalities with a wide variety of lengths, including, but not limited to, at least about Cto at least about C, at least about Cto at least about C, or at least about Cto at least about C, resins may be used. Alternatively, a polymeric resin may be used. For example, TosoHaas Amberchrome CG1000sd resin may be used, which is a styrene polymer resin. Cyano or polymeric resins with a wide variety of alkyl chain lengths may also be used. Furthermore, the RP-HPLC column may be washed with a solvent such as ethanol. A suitable elution buffer containing an ion pairing agent and an organic modifier such as methanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or ethanol, may be used to elute the fEPO from the RP-HPLC column. The most commonly used ion pairing agents include, but are not limited to, acetic acid, formic acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, heptafluorobutyric acid, triethylamine, tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, triethylammonium acetate. Elution may be performed using one or more gradients or isocratic conditions, with gradient conditions preferred to reduce the separation time and to decrease peak width. Another method involves the use of two gradients with different solvent concentration ranges. Examples of suitable elution buffers for use herein may include, but are not limited to, ammonium acetate and acetonitrile solutions.","Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography Purification Techniques. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) may be performed on the fEPO. See generally HICH: PM(Cat. No. 18-1020-90, Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, N.J.) which is incorporated by reference herein. Suitable HIC matrices may include, but are not limited to, alkyl- or aryl-substituted matrices, such as butyl-, hexyl-, octyl- or phenyl-substituted matrices including agarose, cross-linked agarose, sepharose, cellulose, silica, dextran, polystyrene, poly(methacrylate) matrices, and mixed mode resins, including but not limited to, a polyethyleneamine resin or a butyl- or phenyl-substituted poly(methacrylate) matrix. Commercially available sources for hydrophobic interaction column chromatography include, but are not limited to, HITRAP\u00ae, HIPREP\u00ae, and HILOAD\u00ae columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Briefly, prior to loading, the HIC column may be equilibrated using standard buffers known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as an acetic acid\/sodium chloride solution or HEPES containing ammonium sulfate. After loading the fEPO, the column may then washed using standard buffers and conditions to remove unwanted materials but retaining the fEPO on the HIC column. fEPO may be eluted with about 3 to about 10 column volumes of a standard buffer, such as a HEPES buffer containing EDTA and lower ammonium sulfate concentration than the equilibrating buffer, or an acetic acid\/sodium chloride buffer, among others. A decreasing linear salt gradient using, for example, a gradient of potassium phosphate, may also be used to elute the fEPO molecules. The eluant may then be concentrated, for example, by filtration such as diafiltration or ultrafiltration. Diafiltration may be utilized to remove the salt used to elute fEPO.","Other Purification Techniques. Yet another isolation step using, for example, gel filtration (GF: PM(Cat. No. 18-1022-18, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) which is incorporated by reference herein, HPLC, expanded bed adsorption, ultrafiltration, diafiltration, lyophilization, and the like, may be performed on the first fEPO mixture or any subsequent mixture thereof, to remove any excess salts and to replace the buffer with a suitable buffer for the next isolation step or even formulation of the final drug product. The yield of fEPO, including substantially purified fEPO, may be monitored at each step described herein using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such techniques may also used to assess the yield of substantially purified fEPO following the last isolation step. For example, the yield of fEPO may be monitored using any of several reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography columns, having a variety of alkyl chain lengths such as cyano RP-HPLC, CRP-HPLC; as well as cation exchange HPLC and gel filtration HPLC.","Purity may be determined using standard techniques, such as SDS-PAGE, or by measuring fEPO using Western blot and ELISA assays. For example, polyclonal antibodies may be generated against proteins isolated from a negative control yeast fermentation and the cation exchange recovery. The antibodies may also be used to probe for the presence of contaminating host cell proteins.","Additional purification procedures include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,367 and includes, but is not limited to, (1) applying a mixture comprising a fEPO polypeptide to a reverse phase macroporous acrylate ester copolymer resin support at a pH of from about 7 to about 9; and (2) eluting the fEPO polypeptide from said support with an aqueous eluant having a pH of from about 7 to about 9 and containing from about 20% to about 80% by volume of an organic diluent selected from the group consisting of acetone, acetonitrile, and a combination of acetone and acetonitrile.","A typical process for the purification of EPO protein is disclosed in WO 96\/35718, to Burg published Nov. 14, 1996, and is described below. Blue Sepharose (Pharmacia) consists of Sepharose beads to the surface of which the Cibacron blue dye is covalently bound. Since EPO binds more strongly to Blue Sepharose than most non-proteinaceous contaminants, some proteinaceous impurities and PVA, EPO can be enriched in this step. The elution of the Blue Sepharose column is performed by increasing the salt concentration as well as the pH. The column is filled with 80-100 l of Blue Sepharose, regenerated with NaOH and equilibrated with equilibration buffer (sodium\/calcium chloride and sodium acetate). The acidified and filtered fermenter supernatant is loaded. After completion of the loading, the column is washed first with a buffer similar to the equilibration buffer containing a higher sodium chloride concentration and consecutively with a TRIS-base buffer. The product is eluted with a TRIS-base buffer and collected in a single fraction in accordance with the master elution profile.","Butyl Toyopearl 650 C (Toso Haas) is a polystyrene based matrix to which aliphatic butyl-residues are covalently coupled. Since EPO binds more strongly to this gel than most of the impurities and PVA, it has to be eluted with a buffer containing isopropanol. The column is packed with 30-401 of Butyl Toyopearl 650 C, regenerated with NaOH, washed with a TRIS-base buffer and equilibrated with a TRIS-base buffer containing isopropanol. The Blue Sepharose eluate is adjusted to the concentration of isopropanol in the column equilibration buffer and loaded onto the column. Then the column is washed with equilibration buffer with increased isopropanol concentration. The product is eluted with elution buffer (TRIS-base buffer with high isopropanol content) and collected in a single fraction in accordance with the master elution profile.","Hydroxyapatite Ultrogel (Biosepra) consists of hydroxyapatite which is incorporated in an agarose matrix to improve the mechanical properties. EPO has a low affinity to hydroxyapatite and can therefore be eluted at lower phosphate concentrations than protein impurities. The column is filled with 30-401 of Hydroxyapatite Ultrogel and regenerated with a potassium phosphate\/calcium chloride buffer and NaOH followed by a TRIS-base buffer. Then it is equilibrated with a TRIS-base buffer containing a low amount of isopropanol and sodium chloride. The EPO containing eluate of the Butyl Toyopearl chromatography is loaded onto the column. Subsequently the column is washed with equilibration buffer and a TRIS-base buffer without isopropanol and sodium chloride. The product is eluted with a TRIS-base buffer containing a low concentration of potassium phosphate and collected in a single fraction in accordance with the master elution profile.","RP-HPLC material Vydac C4 (Vydac) consists of silica gel particles, the surfaces of which carry C4-alkyl chains. The separation of EPO from the proteinaceous impurities is based on differences in the strength of hydrophobic interactions. Elution is performed with an acetonitrile gradient in diluted trifluoroacetic acid. Preparative HPLC is performed using a stainless steel column (filled with 2.8 to 3.2 liter of Vydac C4 silicagel). The Hydroxyapatite Ultrogel eluate is acidified by adding trifluoro-acetic acid and loaded onto the Vydac C4 column. For washing and elution an acetonitrile gradient in diluted trifluoroacetic acid is used. Fractions are collected and immediately neutralized with phosphate buffer. The EPO fractions which are within the IPC limits are pooled.","DEAE Sepharose (Pharmacia) material consists of diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-groups which are covalently bound to the surface of Sepharose beads. The binding of EPO to the DEAE groups is mediated by ionic interactions. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid pass through the column without being retained. After these substances have been washed off, trace impurities are removed by washing the column with acetate buffer at a low pH. Then the column is washed with neutral phosphate buffer and EPO is eluted with a buffer with increased ionic strength. The column is packed with DEAE Sepharose fast flow. The column volume is adjusted to assure an EPO load in the range of 3-10 mg EPO\/ml gel. The column is washed with water and equilibration buffer (sodium\/potassium phosphate). The pooled fractions of the HPLC eluate are loaded and the column is washed with equilibration buffer. Then the column is washed with washing buffer (sodium acetate buffer) followed by washing with equilibration buffer. Subsequently, EPO is eluted from the column with elution buffer (sodium chloride, sodium\/potassium phosphate) and collected in a single fraction in accordance with the master elution profile. The eluate of the DEAE Sepharose column is adjusted to the specified conductivity. The resulting drug substance is sterile filtered into Teflon bottles and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C.","A wide variety of methods and procedures can be used to assess the yield and purity of a fEPO protein one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids, including but not limited to, the Bradford assay, SDS-PAGE, silver stained SDS-PAGE, coomassie stained SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry (including but not limited to, MALDI-TOF) and other methods for characterizing proteins known to one skilled in the art.","Several strategies have been employed to introduce unnatural amino acids into proteins in non-recombinant host cells, mutagenized host cells, or in cell-free systems. These systems are also suitable for use in making the fEPO polypeptides of the present invention. Derivatization of amino acids with reactive side-chains such as Lys, Cys and Tyr resulted in the conversion of lysine to N-acetyl-lysine. Chemical synthesis also provides a straightforward method to incorporate unnatural amino acids. With the recent development of enzymatic ligation and native chemical ligation of peptide fragments, it is possible to make larger proteins. See, e.g., P. E. Dawson and S. B. H. Kent, 69:923 (2000). A general in vitro biosynthetic method in which a suppressor tRNA chemically acylated with the desired unnatural amino acid is added to an in vitro extract capable of supporting protein biosynthesis, has been used to site-specifically incorporate over 100 unnatural amino acids into a variety of proteins of virtually any size. See, e.g., V. W. Cornish, D. Mendel and P. G. Schultz, 1995, 34:621 (1995); C. J. Noren, S. J. Anthony-Cahill, M. C. Griffith, P. G. Schultz, A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, 244 182-188 (1989); and, J. D. Bain, C. G. Glabe, T. A. Dix, A. R. Chamberlin, E. S. Diala, --111 8013-8014 (1989). A broad range of functional groups has been introduced into proteins for studies of protein stability, protein folding, enzyme mechanism, and signal transduction.","An in vivo method, termed selective pressure incorporation, was developed to exploit the promiscuity of wild-type synthetases. See, e.g., N. Budisa, C. Minks, S. Alefelder, W. Wenger, F, M. Dong, L. Moroder and R. Huber, 13:41 (1999). An auxotrophic strain, in which the relevant metabolic pathway supplying the cell with a particular natural amino acid is switched off, is grown in minimal media containing limited concentrations of the natural amino acid, while transcription of the target gene is repressed. At the onset of a stationary growth phase, the natural amino acid is depleted and replaced with the unnatural amino acid analog. Induction of expression of the recombinant protein results in the accumulation of a protein containing the unnatural analog. For example, using this strategy, o, m and p-fluorophenylalanines have been incorporated into proteins, and exhibit two characteristic shoulders in the UV spectrum which can be easily identified, see, e.g., C. Minks, R. Huber, L. Moroder and N. Budisa, 284:29 (2000); trifluoromethionine has been used to replace methionine in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme to study its interaction with chitooligosaccharide ligands by F NMR, see, e.g., H. Duewel, E. Daub, V. Robinson and J. F. Honek, 36:3404 (1997); and trifluoroleucine has been incorporated in place of leucine, resulting in increased thermal and chemical stability of a leucine-zipper protein. See, e.g., Y. Tang, G. Ghirlanda, W. A. Petka, T. Nakajima, W. F. DeGrado and D. A. Tirrell, Angew. 40:1494 (2001). Moreover, selenomethionine and telluromethionine are incorporated into various recombinant proteins to facilitate the solution of phases in X-ray crystallography. See, e.g., W. A. Hendrickson, J. R. Horton and D. M. Lemaster, 9:1665 (1990); J. O. Boles, K. Lewinski, M. Kunkle, J. D. Odom, B. Dunlap, L. Lebioda and M. Hatada, 1:283 (1994); N. Budisa, B. Steipe, P. Demange, C. Eckerskorn, J. Kellermann and R. Huber, 230:788 (1995); and, N. Budisa, W. Karnbrock, S. Steinbacher, A. Humm, L. Prade, T. Neuefeind, L. Moroder and R. Huber, 270:616 (1997). Methionine analogs with alkene or alkyne functionalities have also been incorporated efficiently, allowing for additional modification of proteins by chemical means. See, e.g., J. C. M. vanHest and D. A. Tirrell, 428:68 (1998); J. C. M. van Hest, K. L. Kiick and D. A. Tirrell, 122:1282 (2000); and, K. L. Kiick and D. A. Tirrell, Tetrahedron, 56:9487 (2000); U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,207; U.S. Patent Publication 2002\/0042097, which are incorporated by reference herein.","The success of this method depends on the recognition of the unnatural amino acid analogs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which, in general, require high selectivity to insure the fidelity of protein translation. One way to expand the scope of this method is to relax the substrate specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which has been achieved in a limited number of cases. For example, replacement of Alaby Gly in phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) increases the size of substrate binding pocket, and results in the acylation of tRNAPhe by p-Cl-phenylalanine (p-Cl-Phe). See, M. Ibba, P. Kast and H. Hennecke, 33:7107 (1994). An strain harboring this mutant PheRS allows the incorporation of p-Cl-phenylalanine or p-Br-phenylalanine in place of phenylalanine. See, e.g., M. Ibba and H. Hennecke, 364:272 (1995); and, N. Sharma, R. Furter, P. Kast and D. A. Tirrell, 467:37 (2000). Similarly, a point mutation Phe130Ser near the amino acid binding site of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was shown to allow azatyrosine to be incorporated more efficiently than tyrosine. See, F. Haman-Takaku, T. Iwama, S. Saito-Yano, K. Takaku, Y. Monden, M. Kitabatake, D. Soil and S. Nishimura, 275:40324 (2000).","Another strategy to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins in vivo is to modify synthetases that have proofreading mechanisms. These synthetases cannot discriminate and therefore activate amino acids that are structurally similar to the cognate natural amino acids. This error is corrected at a separate site, which deacylates the mischarged amino acid from the tRNA to maintain the fidelity of protein translation. If the proofreading activity of the synthetase is disabled, structural analogs that are misactivated may escape the editing function and be incorporated. This approach has been demonstrated recently with the valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS). See, V. Doring, H. D. Mootz, L. A. Nangle, T. L. Hendrickson, V. de Crecy-Lagard, P. Schimmel and P. Marliere, 292:501 (2001). ValRS can misaminoacylate tRNAVal with Cys, Thr, or aminobutyrate (Abu); these noncognate amino acids are subsequently hydrolyzed by the editing domain. After random mutagenesis of the chromosome, a mutant strain was selected that has a mutation in the editing site of ValRS. This edit-defective ValRS incorrectly charges tRNAVal with Cys. Because Abu sterically resembles Cys (\u2014SH group of Cys is replaced with \u2014CH3 in Abu), the mutant ValRS also incorporates Abu into proteins when this mutant strain is grown in the presence of Abu. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that about 24% of valines are replaced by Abu at each valine position in the native protein.","Solid-phase synthesis and semisynthetic methods have also allowed for the synthesis of a number of proteins containing novel amino acids. For example, see the following publications and references cited within, which are as follows: Crick, F. J. C., Barrett, L. Brenner, S. Watts-Tobin, R. 1227-1232 (1961); Hofmann, K., Bohn, H. ---5914-5919 (1966); Kaiser, E. T. 47-54 (1989); Nakatsuka, T., Sasaki, T., Kaiser, E. T. 3808-3810 (1987); Schnolzer, M., Kent, S B H. -221-225 (1992); Chaiken, I. M. 255-301 (1981); Offord, R. E. 151-157 (1987); and, Jackson, D. Y., Burnier, J., Quan, C., Stanley, M., Tom, J., Wells, J. A. 243 (1994).","Chemical modification has been used to introduce a variety of unnatural side chains, including cofactors, spin labels and oligonucleotides into proteins in vitro. See, e.g., Corey, D. R., Schultz, P. G. --1401-1403 (1987); Kaiser, E. T., Lawrence D. S., Rokita, S. E. 565-595 (1985); Kaiser, E. T., Lawrence, D. S. 505-511 (1984); Neet, K. E., Nanci A, Koshland, D. E. -6392-6401 (1968); Polgar, L. B., M. L. -3153-3154 (1966); and, Pollack, S. J., Nakayama, G. Schultz, P. G. 1038-1040 (1988).","Alternatively, biosynthetic methods that employ chemically modified aminoacyl-tRNAs have been used to incorporate several biophysical probes into proteins synthesized in vitro. See the following publications and references cited within: Brunner, J. 483-514 (1993); and, Krieg, U. C., Walter, P., Hohnson, A. E. 54-8604-8608 (1986).","Previously, it has been shown that unnatural amino acids can be site-specifically incorporated into proteins in vitro by the addition of chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs to protein synthesis reactions programmed with a gene containing a desired amber nonsense mutation. Using these approaches, one can substitute a number of the common twenty amino acids with close structural homologues, e.g., fluorophenylalanine for phenylalanine, using strains auxotropic for a particular amino acid. See, e.g., Noren, C. J., Anthony-Cahill, Griffith, M. C., Schultz, P. G. -244: 182-188 (1989); M. W. Nowak, et al., 268:439-42 (1995); Bain, J. D., Glabe, C. G., Dix, T. A., Chamberlin, A. R., Diala, E. S. --111:8013-8014 (1989); N. Budisa et al., 13:41-51 (1999); Ellman, J. A., Mendel, D., Anthony-Cahill, S., Noren, C. J., Schultz, P. G. -301-336 (1992); and, Mendel, D., Cornish, V. W. & Schultz, P. G. -24, 435-62 (1995).","For example, a suppressor tRNA was prepared that recognized the stop codon UAG and was chemically aminoacylated with an unnatural amino acid. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the stop codon TAG, at the site of interest in the protein gene. See, e.g., Sayers, J. R., Schmidt, W. Eckstein, F. 5\u2032, 3\u2032 --791-802 (1988). When the acylated suppressor tRNA and the mutant gene were combined in an in vitro transcription\/translation system, the unnatural amino acid was incorporated in response to the UAG codon which gave a protein containing that amino acid at the specified position. Experiments using [H]-Phe and experiments with \u03b1-hydroxy acids demonstrated that only the desired amino acid is incorporated at the position specified by the UAG codon and that this amino acid is not incorporated at any other site in the protein. See, e.g., Noren, et al, supra; Kobayashi et al., (2003) Nature Structural Biology 10(6):425-432; and, Ellman, J. A., Mendel, D., Schultz, P. G. -197-200 (1992).","Microinjection techniques have also been use incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins. See, e.g., M. W. Nowak, P. C. Kearney, J. R. Sampson, M. E. Saks, C. G. Labarca, S. K. Silverman, W. G. Zhong, J. Thorson, J. N. Abelson, N. Davidson, P. G. Schultz, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, 268:439 (1995); and, D. A. Dougherty, 4:645 (2000). A oocyte was coinjected with two RNA species made in vitro: an mRNA encoding the target protein with a UAG stop codon at the amino acid position of interest and an amber suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the desired unnatural amino acid. The translational machinery of the oocyte then inserts the unnatural amino acid at the position specified by UAG. This method has allowed in vivo structure-function studies of integral membrane proteins, which are generally not amenable to in vitro expression systems. Examples include the incorporation of a fluorescent amino acid into tachykinin neurokinin-2 receptor to measure distances by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, see, e.g., G. Turcatti, K. Nemeth, M. D. Edgerton, U. Meseth, F. Talabot, M. Peitsch, J. Knowles, H. Vogel and A. Chollet, 271:19991 (1996); the incorporation of biotinylated amino acids to identify surface-exposed residues in ion channels, see, e.g., J. P. Gallivan, H. A. Lester and D. A. Dougherty, 4:739 (1997); the use of caged tyrosine analogs to monitor conformational changes in an ion channel in real time, see, e.g., J. C. Miller, S. K. Silverman, P. M. England, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, Neuron, 20:619 (1998); and, the use of alpha hydroxy amino acids to change ion channel backbones for probing their gating mechanisms. See, e.g., P. M. England, Y. Zhang, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, 96:89 (1999); and, T. Lu, A. Y. Ting, J. Mainland, L. Y. Jan, P. G. Schultz and J. Yang, 4:239 (2001).","The ability to incorporate unnatural amino acids directly into proteins in vivo offers the advantages of high yields of mutant proteins, technical ease, the potential to study the mutant proteins in cells or possibly in living organisms and the use of these mutant proteins in therapeutic treatments. The ability to include unnatural amino acids with various sizes, acidities, nucleophilicities, hydrophobicities, and other properties into proteins can greatly expand our ability to rationally and systematically manipulate the structures of proteins, both to probe protein function and create new proteins or organisms with novel properties. However, the process is difficult, because the complex nature of tRNA-synthetase interactions that are required to achieve a high degree of fidelity in protein translation.","In one attempt to site-specifically incorporate para-F-Phe, a yeast amber suppressor tRNAPheCUA\/phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase pair was used in a p-F-Phe resistant, Phe auxotrophic strain. See, e.g., R. Futter, 7:419 (1998).","It may also be possible to obtain expression of a fEPO polynucleotide of the present invention using a cell-free (in-vitro) translational system. In these systems, which can include either mRNA as a template (in-vitro translation) or DNA as a template (combined in-vitro transcription and translation), the in vitro synthesis is directed by the ribosomes. Considerable effort has been applied to the development of cell-free protein expression systems. See, e.g., Kim, D.-M. and J. R. Swartz, 74 :309-316 (2001); Kim, D.-M. and J. R.

Another approach that may be applied to the expression of fEPO polypeptides comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid include the mRNA-peptide fusion technique. See, e.g., R. Roberts and J. Szostak, . () 94 12297-12302 (1997); A. Frankel, et al., & 10, 1043-1050 (2003). In this approach, an mRNA template linked to puromycin is translated into peptide on the ribosome. If one or more tRNA molecules has been modified, non-natural amino acids can be incorporated into the peptide as well. After the last mRNA codon has been read, puromycin captures the C-terminus of the peptide. If the resulting mRNA-peptide conjugate is found to have interesting properties in an in vitro assay, its identity can be easily revealed from the mRNA sequence. In this way, one may screen libraries of fEPO polypeptides comprising one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids to identify polypeptides having desired properties. More recently, in vitro ribosome translations with purified components have been reported that permit the synthesis of peptides substituted with non-naturally encoded amino acids. See, e.g., A. Forster et al., . () 100 6353 (2003).","A wide variety of macromolecular polymers and other molecules can be linked to fEPO polypeptides of the present invention to modulate biological properties of fEPO, and\/or provide new biological properties to the fEPO molecule. These macromolecular polymers can be linked to fEPO via a naturally encoded amino acid, via a non-naturally encoded amino acid, or any functional substituent of a natural or non-natural amino acid, or any substituent or functional group added to a natural or non-natural amino acid.","The present invention provides substantially homogenous preparations of polymer:protein conjugates. \u201cSubstantially homogenous\u201d as used herein means that polymer:protein conjugate molecules are observed to be greater than half of the total protein. The polymer:protein conjugate has biological activity and the present \u201csubstantially homogenous\u201d PEGylated fEPO preparations provided herein are those which are homogenous enough to display the advantages of a homogenous preparation, e.g., ease in clinical application in predictability of lot to lot pharmacokinetics.","One may also choose to prepare a mixture of polymer:protein conjugate molecules, and the advantage provided herein is that one may select the proportion of mono-polymer:protein conjugate to include in the mixture. Thus, if desired, one may prepare a mixture of various proteins with various numbers of polymer moieties attached (i.e., di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.) and combine said conjugates with the mono-polymer:protein conjugate prepared using the methods of the present invention, and have a mixture with a predetermined proportion of mono-polymer:protein conjugates.","The polymer selected may be water soluble so that the protein to which it is attached does not precipitate in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological environment. The polymer may be branched or unbranched. Preferably, for therapeutic use of the end-product preparation, the polymer will be pharmaceutically acceptable.","The proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein molecules will vary, as will their concentrations in the reaction mixture. In general, the optimum ratio (in terms of efficiency of reaction in that there is minimal excess unreacted protein or polymer) may be determined by the molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol selected and on the number of available reactive groups available. As relates to molecular weight, typically the higher the molecular weight of the polymer, the fewer number of polymer molecules which may be attached to the protein. Similarly, branching of the polymer should be taken into account when optimizing these parameters. Generally, the higher the molecular weight (or the more branches) the higher the polymer:protein ratio.","As used herein, and when contemplating PEG:fEPO conjugates, the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount which gives an increase in hematocrit that provides benefit to a patient. The amount will vary from one individual to another and will depend upon a number of factors, including the overall physical condition of the patient and the underlying cause of anemia. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of fEPO for a patient suffering from chronic renal failure is 50 to 150 units\/kg three times per week. The amount of fEPO used for therapy gives an acceptable rate of hematocrit increase and maintains the hematocrit at a beneficial level (usually at least about 30% and typically in a range of 30% to 36%). A therapeutically effective amount of the present compositions may be readily ascertained by one skilled in the art using publicly available materials and procedures.","The water soluble polymer may be any structural form including but not limited to linear, forked or branched. Typically, the water soluble polymer is a poly(alkylene glycol), such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), but other water soluble polymers can also be employed. By way of example, PEG is used to describe certain embodiments of this invention.","PEG is a well-known, water soluble polymer that is commercially available or can be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of ethylene glycol according to methods well known in the art (Sandler and Karo, Polymer Synthesis, Academic Press, New York, Vol. 3, pages 138-161). The term \u201cPEG\u201d is used broadly to encompass any polyethylene glycol molecule, without regard to size or to modification at an end of the PEG, and can be represented as linked to fEPO by the formula:\n\nXO\u2014(CHCHO)\u2014CHCH\u2014Y\n\nwhere n is 2 to 10,000 and X is H or a terminal modification, including but not limited to, a Calkyl.\n","In some cases, a PEG used in the invention terminates on one end with hydroxy or methoxy, i.e., X is H or CH(\u201cmethoxy PEG\u201d). Alternatively, the PEG can terminate with a reactive group, thereby forming a bifunctional polymer. Typical reactive groups can include those reactive groups that are commonly used to react with the functional groups found in the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, maleimide groups, activated carbonates (including but not limited to, p-nitrophenyl ester), activated esters (including but not limited to, N-hydroxysuccinimide, p-nitrophenyl ester) and aldehydes) as well as functional groups that are inert to the 20 common amino acids but that react specifically with complementary functional groups present in non-naturally encoded amino acids (including but not limited to, azide groups, alkyne groups). It is noted that the other end of the PEG, which is shown in the above formula by Y, will attach either directly or indirectly to a fEPO polypeptide via a naturally-occurring or non-naturally encoded amino acid. For instance, Y may be an amide, carbamate or urea linkage to an amine group (including but not limited to, the epsilon amine of lysine or the N-terminus) of the polypeptide. Alternatively, Y may be a maleimide linkage to a thiol group (including but not limited to, the thiol group of cysteine). Alternatively, Y may be a linkage to a residue not commonly accessible via the 20 common amino acids. For example, an azide group on the PEG can be reacted with an alkyne group on the fEPO polypeptide to form a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition product. Alternatively, an alkyne group on the PEG can be reacted with an azide group present in a non-naturally encoded amino acid to form a similar product. In some embodiments, a strong nucleophile (including but not limited to, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, semicarbazide) can be reacted with an aldehyde or ketone group present in a non-naturally encoded amino acid to form a hydrazone, oxime or semicarbazone, as applicable, which in some cases can be further reduced by treatment with an appropriate reducing agent. Alternatively, the strong nucleophile can be incorporated into the fEPO polypeptide via a non-naturally encoded amino acid and used to react preferentially with a ketone or aldehyde group present in the water soluble polymer.","Any molecular mass for a PEG can be used as practically desired, including but not limited to, from about 1,000 Daltons (Da) to 100,000 Da or more as desired (including but not limited to, sometimes 1-50 kDa or 10-40 kDa). Branched chain PEGs, including but not limited to, PEG's with each chain having a MW ranging from 10-40 kDa (including but not limited to, 5-20 kDa) can also be used. A wide range of PEG molecules are described in, including but not limited to, the Shearwater Polymers, Inc. catalog, Nektar Theraoeutics catalog, incorporated herein by reference.","Generally, at least one terminus of the PEG molecule is available for reaction with the non-naturally-encoded amino acid. For example, PEG derivatives bearing alkyne and azide moieties for reaction with amino acid side chains can be used to attach PEG to non-naturally encoded amino acids as described herein. If the non-naturally encoded amino acid comprises an azide, then the PEG will typically contain either an alkyne moiety to effect formation of the [3+2] cycloaddition product or an activated PEG species (i.e., ester, carbonate) containing a phosphine group to effect formation of the amide linkage. Alternatively, if the non-naturally encoded amino acid comprises an alkyne, then the PEG will typically contain an azide moiety to effect formation of the [3+2] Huisgen cycloaddition product. If the non-naturally encoded amino acid comprises a carbonyl group, the PEG will typically comprise a potent nucleophile (including but not limited to, a hydrazide, hydroxylamine or semicarbazide functionality) in order to effect formation of corresponding hydrazone, oxime, and semicarbazone linkages, respectively. In other alternatives, a reverse of the orientation of the reactive groups described above can be used, i.e., an azide moiety in the non-naturally encoded amino acid can be reacted with a PEG derivative containing an alkyne.","In some embodiments, the fEPO variant with a PEG derivative contains a chemical functionality that is reactive with the chemical functionality present on the side chain of the non-naturally encoded amino acid.","The invention provides in some embodiments azide- and acetylene-containing polymer derivatives comprising a water soluble polymer backbone having an average molecular weight from about 800 Da to about 100,000 Da. The polymer backbone of the water-soluble polymer can be poly(ethylene glycol). However, it should be understood that a wide variety of water soluble polymers including but not limited to poly(ethylene)glycol and other related polymers, including poly(dextran) and polypropylene glycol), are also suitable for use in the practice of this invention and that the use of the term PEG or poly(ethylene glycol) is intended to encompass and include all such molecules. The term PEG includes, but is not limited to, poly(ethylene glycol) in any of its forms, including bifunctional PEG, multiarmed PEG, derivatized PEG, forked PEG, branched PEG, pendent PEG (i.e. PEG or related polymers having one or more functional groups pendent to the polymer backbone), or PEG with degradable linkages therein.","PEG is typically clear, colorless, odorless, soluble in water, stable to heat, inert to many chemical agents, does not hydrolyze or deteriorate, and is generally non-toxic. Poly(ethylene glycol) is considered to be biocompatible, which is to say that PEG is capable of coexistence with living tissues or organisms without causing harm. More specifically, PEG is substantially non-immunogenic, which is to say that PEG does not tend to produce an immune response in the body. When attached to a molecule having some desirable function in the body, such as a biologically active agent, the PEG tends to mask the agent and can reduce or eliminate any immune response so that an organism can tolerate the presence of the agent. PEG conjugates tend not to produce a substantial immune response or cause clotting or other undesirable effects. PEG having the formula \u2014CHCHO\u2014(CHCHO)\u2014CHCH\u2014, where n is from about 3 to about 4000, typically from about 20 to about 2000, is suitable for use in the present invention. PEG having a molecular weight of from about 800 Da to about 100,000 Da are in some embodiments of the present invention particularly useful as the polymer backbone.","The polymer backbone can be linear or branched. Branched polymer backbones are generally known in the art. Typically, a branched polymer has a central branch core moiety and a plurality of linear polymer chains linked to the central branch core. PEG is commonly used in branched forms that can be prepared by addition of ethylene oxide to various polyols, such as glycerol, glycerol oligomers, pentaerythritol and sorbitol. The central branch moiety can also be derived from several amino acids, such as lysine. The branched poly(ethylene glycol) can be represented in general form as R(-PEG-OH)in which R is derived from a core moiety, such as glycerol, glycerol oligomers, or pentaerythritol, and in represents the number of arms. Multi-armed PEG molecules, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,932,462 5,643,575; 5,229,490; 4,289,872; U.S. Pat. Appl. 2003\/0143596; WO 96\/21469; and WO 93\/21259, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, can also be used as the polymer backbone.","Branched PEG can also be in the form of a forked PEG represented by PEG(-YCHZ), where Y is a linking group and Z is an activated terminal group linked to CH by a chain of atoms of defined length.","Yet another branched form, the pendant PEG, has reactive groups, such as carboxyl, along the PEG backbone rather than at the end of PEG chains.","In addition to these forms of PEG, the polymer can also be prepared with weak or degradable linkages in the backbone. For example, PEG can be prepared with ester linkages in the polymer backbone that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of the polymer into fragments of lower molecular weight:\n\n-PEG-CO-PEG-+HO\u2192PEG-COH+HO-PEG-\n\nIt is understood by those skilled in the art that the term poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG represents or includes all the forms known in the art including but not limited to those disclosed herein.\n","Many other polymers are also suitable for use in the present invention. In some embodiments, polymer backbones that are water-soluble, with from 2 to about 300 termini, are particularly useful in the invention. Examples of suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, other poly(alkylene glycols), such as poly(propylene glycol) (\u201cPPG\u201d), copolymers thereof (including but not limited to copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol), terpolymers thereof, mixtures thereof, and the like. Although the molecular weight of each chain of the polymer backbone can vary, it is typically in the range of from about 800 Da to about 100,000 Da, often from about 6,000 Da to about 80,000 Da.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list for substantially water soluble backbones is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above are contemplated as being suitable for use in the present invention.","In some embodiments of the present invention the polymer derivatives are \u201cmulti-functional\u201d, meaning that the polymer backbone has at least two termini, and possibly as many as about 300 termini, functionalized or activated with a functional group. Multifunctional polymer derivatives include, but are not limited to, linear polymers having two termini, each terminus being bonded to a functional group which may be the same or different.","In one embodiment, the polymer derivative has the structure:\n\nX-A-POLY-B\u2014N\u2550N\u2550N\n\nwherein:\n\nN\u2550N\u2550N is an azide moiety;\n\nB is a linking moiety, which may be present or absent;\n\nPOLY is a water-soluble non-antigenic polymer;\n\nA is a linking moiety, which may be present or absent and which may be the same as B or different; and\n\nX is a second functional group.\n","Examples of a linking moiety for A and B include, but are not limited to, a multiply-functionalized alkyl group containing up to 18, and more preferably between 1-10 carbon atoms. A heteroatom such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur may be included with the alkyl chain. The alkyl chain may also be branched at a heteroatom. Other examples of a linking moiety for A and B include, but are not limited to, a multiply functionalized aryl group, containing up to 10 and more preferably 5-6 carbon atoms. The aryl group may be substituted with one more carbon atoms, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms. Other examples of suitable linking groups include those linking groups described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,932,462 and 5,643,575; and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publication 2003\/0143596, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list for linking moieties is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all linking moieties having the qualities described above are contemplated to be suitable for use in the present invention.","Examples of suitable functional groups for use as X include, but are not limited to, hydroxyl, protected hydroxyl, alkoxyl, active ester, such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters and 1-benzotriazolyl esters, active carbonate, such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbonates and 1-benzotriazolyl carbonates, acetal, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrates, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, amine, aminooxy, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazide, protected thiol, carboxylic acid, protected carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxals, diones, mesylates, tosylates, tresylate, alkene, ketone, and azide. As is understood by those skilled in the art, the selected X moiety should be compatible with the azide group so that reaction with the azide group does not occur. The azide-containing polymer derivatives may be homobifunctional, meaning that the second functional group (i.e., X) is also an azide moiety, or heterobifunctional, meaning that the second functional group is a different functional group.","The term \u201cprotected\u201d refers to the presence of a protecting group or moiety that prevents reaction of the chemically reactive functional group under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending on the type of chemically reactive group being protected. For example, if the chemically reactive group is an amine or a hydrazide, the protecting group can be selected from the group of tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). If the chemically reactive group is a thiol, the protecting group can be orthopyridyldisulfide. If the chemically reactive group is a carboxylic acid, such as butanoic or propionic acid, or a hydroxyl group, the protecting group can be benzyl or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or tert-butyl. Other protecting groups known in the art may also be used in the present invention.","Specific examples of terminal functional groups in the literature include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl carbonate (see e.g., U.S. Pat.

After successful formation of the amide bond, the resulting N-tert-butyl-Boc-protected azide-containing derivative can be used directly to modify bioactive molecules or it can be further elaborated to install other useful functional groups. For instance, the N-t-Boc group can be hydrolyzed by treatment with strong acid to generate an omega-amino-PEG-azide. The resulting amine can be used as a synthetic handle to install other useful functionality such as maleimide groups, activated disulfides, activated esters and so forth for the creation of valuable heterobifunctional reagents.","Heterobifunctional derivatives are particularly useful when it is desired to attach different molecules to each terminus of the polymer.

For example, fEPO polypeptide is PEGylated with an alkyne-terminated mPEG derivative. Briefly, an excess of solid mPEG(5000)-O\u2014CH\u2014C\u2261CH is added, with stirring, to an aqueous solution of p-azido-L-Phe-containing fEPO at room temperature. Typically, the aqueous solution is buffered with a buffer having a pKnear the pH at which the reaction is to be carried out (generally about pH 4-10). Examples of suitable buffers for PEGylation at pH 7.5, for instance, include, but are not limited to, HEPES, phosphate, borate, TRIS-HCl, EPPS, and TES. The pH is continuously monitored and adjusted if necessary. The reaction is typically allowed to continue for between about 1-48 hours.","The reaction products are subsequently subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography to separate the PEGylated fEPO variants from free mPEG(5000)-O\u2014CH\u2014C\u2261CH and any high-molecular weight complexes of the pegylated fEPO polypeptide which may form when unblocked PEG is activated at both ends of the molecule, thereby crosslinking fEPO variant molecules. The conditions during hydrophobic interaction chromatography are such that free mPEG(5000)-O\u2014CH\u2014C\u2261CH flows through the column, while any crosslinked PEGylated fEPO variant complexes elute after the desired forms, which contain one fEPO variant molecule conjugated to one or more PEG groups. Suitable conditions vary depending on the relative sizes of the cross-linked complexes versus the desired conjugates and are readily determined by those skilled in the art. The eluent containing the desired conjugates is concentrated by ultrafiltration and desalted by diafiltration.","If necessary, the PEGylated fEPO obtained from the hydrophobic chromatography can be purified further by one or more procedures known to those skilled in the art including, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography; anion- or cation-exchange chromatography (using, including but not limited to, DEAE SEPHAROSE); chromatography on silica; reverse phase HPLC; gel filtration (using, including but not limited to, SEPHADEX G-75); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; size-exclusion chromatography, metal-chelate chromatography; ultrafiltration\/diafiltration; ethanol precipitation; ammonium sulfate precipitation; chromatofocusing; displacement chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (including but not limited to preparative isoelec-tric focusing), differential solubility (including but not limited to ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction. Apparent molecular weight may be estimated by GPC by comparison to globular protein standards (PPM, A PA(Harris & Angal, Eds.) IRL Press 1989, 293-306). The purity of the fEPO-PEG conjugate can be assessed by proteolytic degradation (including but not limited to, trypsin cleavage) followed by mass spectrometry analysis.

This method allows for proteins to be modified with extremely high selectivity.","The present invention also provides for GH supergene family member combinations (including but not limited to fEPO) homodimers, heterodimers, homomultimers, or heteromultimers (i.e., trimers, tetramers, etc.) where a GH supergene family member polypeptide such as fEPO containing one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids is bound to another GH supergene family member or variant thereof or any other polypeptide that is a non-GH supergene family member or valiant thereof, either directly to the polypeptide backbone or via a linker. Due to its increased molecular weight compared to monomers, the GH supergene family member, such as fEPO, dimer or multimer conjugates may exhibit new or desirable properties, including but not limited to different pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, modulated therapeutic half-life, or modulated plasma half-life relative to the monomeric GH supergene family member. In some embodiments, the GH supergene family member, such as fEPO, dimers of the invention will modulate the dimerization of the GH supergene family member receptor. In other embodiments, the GH supergene family member dimers or multimers of the present invention will act as a GH supergene family member receptor antagonist, agonist, or modulator.","In some embodiments, one or more of the fEPO molecules present in a fEPO containing dimer or multimer comprises a non-naturally encoded amino acid linked to a water soluble polymer that is present within the Site II binding region. As such, each of the fEPO molecules of the dimer or multimer are accessible for binding to the fEPO receptor via the Site interface but are unavailable for binding to a second fEPO receptor via the Site II interface. Thus, the fEPO dimer or multimer can engage the Site I binding sites of each of two distinct fEPO receptors but, as the fEPO molecules have a water soluble polymer attached to a non-genetically encoded amino acid present in the Site II region, the fEPO receptors cannot engage the Site II region of the fEPO ligand and the dimer or multimer acts as a fEPO antagonist. In some embodiments, one or more of the fEPO molecules present in a fEPO containing dimer or multimer comprises a non-naturally encoded amino acid linked to a water soluble polymer that is present within the Site I binding region, allowing binding to the Site II region. Alternatively, in some embodiments one or more of the fEPO molecules present in a fEPO containing dimer or multimer comprises a non-naturally encoded amino acid linked to a water soluble polymer that is present at a site that is not within the Site I or Site II binding region, such that both are available for binding. In some embodiments a combination of fEPO molecules is used having Site I, Site II, or both available for binding. A combination of fEPO molecules wherein at least one has Site I available for binding, and at least one has Site II available for binding may provide molecules having a desired activity or property. In addition, a combination of fEPO molecules having both Site I and Site II available for binding may produce a super-agonist fEPO molecule.","In some embodiments, the GH supergene family member polypeptides are linked directly, including but not limited to, via an Asn-Lys amide linkage or Cys-Cys disulfide linkage. In some embodiments, the linked GH supergene family member polypeptides, and\/or the linked non-GH supergene family member, will comprise different non-naturally encoded amino acids to facilitate dimerization, including but not limited to, an alkyne in one non-naturally encoded amino acid of a first fEPO polypeptide and an azide in a second non-naturally encoded amino acid of a second GH supergene family member polypeptide will be conjugated via a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition. Alternatively, a first GH supergene family member, and\/or the linked non-GH supergene family member, polypeptide comprising a ketone-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid can be conjugated to a second GH supergene family member polypeptide comprising a hydroxylamine-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid and the polypeptides are reacted via formation of the corresponding oxime.","Alternatively, the two GH supergene family member polypeptides, and\/or the linked non-GH supergene family member, are linked via a linker. Any hetero- or homo-bifunctional linker can be used to link the two GH supergene family member, and\/or the linked non-GH supergene family member, polypeptides, which can have the same or different primary sequence. In some cases, the linker used to tether the GH supergene family member, and\/or the linked non-GH supergene family member, polypeptides together can be a bifunctional PEG reagent.","In some embodiments, the invention provides water-soluble bifunctional linkers that have a dumbbell structure that includes: a) an azide, an alkyne, a hydrazine, a hydrazide, hydroxylamine, or a carbonyl-containing moiety on at least a first end of a polymer backbone; and b) at least a second functional group on a second end of the polymer backbone. The second functional group can be the same or different as the first functional group. The second functional group, in some embodiments, is not reactive with the first functional group. The invention provides, in some embodiments, water-soluble compounds that comprise at least one arm of a branched molecular structure. For example, the branched molecular structure can be dendritic.","In some embodiments, the invention provides multimers comprising one or more GH supergene family member, such as fEPO, formed by reactions with water soluble activated polymers that have the structure:\n\nR\u2014(CHCHO)\u2014O\u2014(CH)\u2014X\n\nwherein n is from about 5 to 3,000, m is 2-10, X can be an azide, an alkyne, a hydrazine, a hydrazide, an aminooxy group, a hydroxylamine, a acetyl, or carbonyl-containing moiety, and R is a capping group, a functional group, or a leaving group that can be the same or different as X. R can be, for example, a functional group selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, protected hydroxyl, alkoxyl, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, 1-benzotriazolyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbonate, 1-benzotriazolyl carbonate, acetal, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrates, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, amine, aminooxy, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazide, protected thiol, carboxylic acid, protected carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxals, diones, mesylates, tosylates, and tresylate, alkene, and ketone.\n","The fEPO receptor can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat.

Animals will receive either a single dose of 25 ug\/rat iv or 50 ug\/rat so, and approximately 5-7 blood samples will be taken according to a predefined time course, generally covering about 6 hours for a fEPO polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid not conjugated to a water soluble polymer and about 4 days for a fEPO polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and conjugated to a water soluble polymer. Pharmacokinetic data for fEPO is well-studied in several species and can be compared directly to the data obtained for fEPO comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid. See Mordenti S., et al., 8(11):1351-59 (1991).","The specific activity of fEPO in accordance with this invention can be determined by various assays known in the art. The biological activity of the purified fEPO proteins of this invention are such that administration of the fEPO protein by injection to human patients results in bone marrow cells increasing production of reticulocytes and red blood cells compared to non-injected or control groups of subjects. The biological activity of the fEPO muteins, or fragments thereof, obtained and purified in accordance with this invention can be tested by methods according to Pharm. Europa Spec.

The unnatural amino acid containing polypeptides of the invention are administered in any suitable manner, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable methods of administering such polypeptides in the context of the present invention to a patient are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective action or reaction than another route.","Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.","Polypeptide compositions can be administered by a number of routes including, but not limited to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, transdermal, subcutaneous, topical, sublingual, or rectal means. Unnatural amino acid polypeptide compositions can also be administered via liposomes.

The formulations of packaged nucleic acid can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials.","Parenteral administration and intravenous administration are preferred methods of administration. In particular, the routes of administration already in use for natural amino acid homologue therapeutics (including but not limited to, those typically used for EPO, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNs, interleukins, antibodies, and\/or any other pharmaceutically delivered protein), along with formulations in current use, provide preferred routes of administration and formulation for the unnatural amino acids of the invention.","The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention, is sufficient to have a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time, or, including but not limited to, to inhibit infection by a pathogen, or other appropriate activity, depending on the application. The dose is determined by the efficacy of the particular vector, or formulation, and the activity, stability or serum half-life of the unnatural amino acid polypeptide employed and the condition of the patient, as well as the body weight or surface area of the patient to be treated.

Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.","If a patient undergoing infusion of a formulation develops fevers, chills, or muscle aches, he\/she receives the appropriate dose of aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen or other pain\/fever controlling drug. Patients who experience reactions to the infusion such as fever, muscle aches, and chills are premedicated 30 minutes prior to the future infusions with either aspirin, acetaminophen, or, including but not limited to, diphenhydramine. Meperidine is used for more severe chills and muscle aches that do not quickly respond to antipyretics and antihistamines.

The pharmaceutical compositions containing the fEPO glycoprotein products may be formulated at a strength effective for administration by various means to a human patient experiencing blood disorders, characterized by low or defective red blood cell production, either alone or as part condition or disease. Average quantities of the fEPO glycoprotein product may vary and in particular should be based upon the recommendations and prescription of a qualified physician. The exact amount of fEPO is a matter of preference subject to such factors as the exact type of condition being treated, the condition of the patient being treated, as well as the other ingredients in the composition. The fEPO of the present invention may thus be used to stimulate red blood cell production and correct depressed red cell levels. Most commonly, red cell levels are decreased due to anemia. Among the conditions treatable by the present invention include anemia associated with a decline or loss of kidney function (chronic renal failure), anemia associated with myelosuppressive therapy, such as chemotherapeutic or anti-viral drugs (such as AZT), anemia associated with the progression of non-myeloid cancers, and anemia associated with viral infections (such as HIV). Also treatable are conditions which may lead to anemia in an otherwise healthy individual, such as an anticipated loss of blood during surgery. In general, any condition treatable with fEPO may also be treated with the PEG:fEPO conjugates of the present invention. The invention also provides for administration of a therapeutically effective amount of iron in order to maintain increased erythropoiesis during therapy. The amount to be given may be readily determined by one skilled in the art based upon therapy with fEPO.","The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention.","This example describes one of the many potential sets of criteria for the selection of preferred sites of incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids into fEPO.","This example demonstrates how preferred sites within the fEPO polypeptide were selected for introduction of a non-naturally encoded amino acid. Molecular modeling and known information regarding the secondary structure of fEPO was used to determine preferred positions into which one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids could be introduced. Other fEPO structures and known crystal structure information regarding fEPO was utilized to examine potential variation of primary, secondary, or tertiary structural elements between crystal structure datasets. The coordinates for these structures are available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al. J. Mol. Biol. 1997, 112, pp 535) or via The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB.

Two disulfide bridges are present, formed by C7 and C161 and C29 and C33.","Sequence numbering used in this example is according to the amino acid sequence of mature fEPO (18 kDa variant) shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4.","This example describes one of the many potential sets of criteria for the selection of preferred sites of incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids into fEPO. Using the criteria described below, the amino acid positions utilized for site-specific incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids (for example, p-acetyl-phenylalanine (pAF)) are positions: 53, 55, 116, 89, 72, 86, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 31, 163, 120, 76, 24, 38, 37, 49, 83, 21, 36.

X-ray crystal structure information was used to perform solvent accessibility calculations on the fEPO molecule, utilizing the Cx program (Pintar et al. 2002, Vol. 18, p 980). The solvent accessibility of all atoms was calculated and an average Cx value for each amino acid residue was determined, and is shown in  and . The following criteria were used to evaluate each position of fEPO for the introduction of a non-naturally encoded amino acid: the residue (a) should not interfere with binding of either fEPObp based on structural analysis of fEPO and structural analysis of fEPO and 1CN4, 1EER, and 1BUY (crystallographic structures of hEPO conjugated with hEPOpb), b) should not be affected by alanine scanning mutagenesis (Bittorf, T. et al. 336:133-136 (1993), Wen, D., et al. 269:22839-22846 (1994), and Elliot, S. et al. 89:493-502 (1997), (c) should be surface exposed and exhibit a maximum Cx, demonstrating minimal van der Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions with surrounding residues, (d) should be either deleted or variable in fEPO variants (Bittorf, T. et al. 336:133-136 (1993), Wen, D., et al. 269:22839-22846 (1994), (e) would result in conservative changes upon substitution with a non-naturally encoded amino acid and (f) could be found in either highly flexible regions (including but not limited to CD loop) or structurally rigid regions (including but not limited to Helix B). In addition, further calculations were performed on the fEPO molecule, utilizing the Cx program (Pintar et al. 18, pp 980) to evaluate the extent of protrusion for each protein atom. As a result, in some embodiments, the non-naturally encoded amino acid is substituted at, but not limited to, one or more of the following positions of fEPO: before position 1 (i.e., at the N-terminus), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 43, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 65, 68, 69, 72, 75, 76, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 110, 111, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 139, 159, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167 (i.e., at the carboxyl terminus of the protein), or combinations thereof.","Some sites for generation of a fEPO antagonist include: 10, 11, 14, 15, 96, 97, 100, 103, 104, 107, 110.

The reaction conditions for the cloning can be 94\u00b0 C. for two minutes, with 30 cycles of 94\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0 C. for one minute, 72\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes, and 72\u00b0 C. for 7 minutes, followed by 4\u00b0 C. reaction termination. Molecules are identified that encode fEPO, including the full length fEPO, the mature form of fEPO lacking the N-terminal signal sequence, and SNPs. The full length and mature fEPO encoding cDNA can be inserted into expression vectors, such as the pBAD HISc, and pET20b expression vectors following optimization of the sequence for cloning and expression without altering amino acid sequence.","An introduced translation system that comprises an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (O-RS) is used to express fEPO containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid, The O-RS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with a non-naturally encoded amino acid. In turn the translation system inserts the non-naturally encoded amino acid into fEPO, in response to an encoded selector codon. The following Table (Table 2) includes sequences of fEPO, both full length and mature, and O-RS and O-tRNA sequences, some of which used in these examples, others which were used with hEPO and may be used or optimized for use with fEPO.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0538","num":"0537"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","orient":"land","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"350pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

transformation of with plasmids containing the modified fEPO gene and the orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase\/tRNA pair (specific for the desired non-naturally encoded amino acid) allows the site-specific incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acid into the fEPO polypeptide. The transformed , grown at 37\u00b0 C. in media containing between 0.01-100 mM of the particular non-naturally encoded amino acid, expresses modified fEPO with high fidelity and efficiency. The His-tagged fEPO containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid is produced by the host cells as inclusion bodies or aggregates. The aggregates are solubilized and affinity purified under denaturing conditions in 6M guanidine HCl. Refolding is performed by dialysis at 4\u00b0 C. overnight in 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH8.0, 40 \u03bcM CuSO, and 2% (w\/v) Sarkosyl. The material is then dialyzed against 20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl, followed by removal of the His-tag. See Boissel et al., (1993) 268:15983-93. Methods for purification of fEPO are well known in the art (Nahri et al., (1991) JBC, Vol 266, pp 23022-23026; Narhi et al., (2001) Protein Engineering, Vol 14, pp 135-140; Darling et al., (2002) Biochemistry Vol 41, pp 14524-14531; Boissel et al., (1993) 268:15983-93; and WO0032772A2) and are confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western Blot analyses, or electrospray-ionization ion trap mass spectrometry.","A suppression expression DNA expression vector was constructed according to the invention, expressing feline erythropoietin protein (fEPO).","A. Expression Vector Construction","The expression construct, depicted in , comprises eight copies of a hybrid tRNA gene encoding an tRNA transcript capable of being charge with p-acetylphenylalanine by it's cognate tRNA synthetase. Each copy of the tRNA gene includes a H1 promoter region, the tRNA sequence and a polymerase III transcription termination signal.","Following the tRNA genes is located a Simian virus SV40 origin of replication (SVO), which facilitates replication of the expression construct (vector) in COS cells following transient transfection.","Thereafter is located an expression cassette for the gene sequences of interest, which in this case is the feline EPO coding region. First in the cassette is the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV), which drives expression of the message. The message in this construct encodes the feline erythropoietin (fEPO), which is sequentially preceded by the natural signal peptide (Nat L). The message is followed by the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (BGH).","Thereafter is situated an expression cassette beginning with the mouse beta-globulin major promoter (beta), situated within the cassette so as to drive the expression of sequences encoding the optimized acetylphenylalanine tRNA synthetase (OptEcAFRS), the murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and the salmonella neomycin phosphotransferase gene (Neo) each separated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) derived from the Encephalomyocarditis virus geneome. The Neo sequence is followed by the SV40 early polyadenylation signal (SV).","The vector also contains sequences required for replication in bacteria, including the colE1 origin (pUC Ori) of replication and the beta-lactamase gene to confer ampicillin resistance (Amp).","The EMCV is commercially available, cDNA was commercially synthesized to the IRES region within the viral genome. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of that cDNA was performed in order to amplify the DNA, as well as to add 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends suitable for insertion between the coding domains. The ATG trinucleotide at position 834-836 (Genbank accession number NC-001479) was used as the start codon for the DHFR and Neo sequences.","Because the literature indicates that translation of the open reading frame downstream of the IRES would be less efficient than the upstream open reading frame (translation initiated by 5\u2032 CAP), the strategy was taken to place the DHFR and Neo genes following independent IRES elements to selectively impair said dominant selectable markers in an effort to ease clone selection.","Two versions of the suppression expression vector were generated and designated Lucy F () and Irwin (). Lucy F contains 8 copies of the tRNA genes, a second IRES, and the Neo gene. The Neo gene is included to allow for selection of stable integrated plasmids into the cell genome via treatment with G418. Irwin by contrast contains only 4 copies of the tRNA genes and lacks the second IRES and Neo. Irwin is thereby smaller in size and better suited for transient expression of suppressed proteins for generation of experimental levels of protein production.","B. CHO Cell Expression","The vector \u201cNat L BB-Opti FEPO in Irwin\u201d, a map of which is depicted in , and the sequence of which is set forth in Table 3 containing the suppression elements and encoding the feline EPO protein was transfected into CHO-S cells using a transient transfection protocol. These transfections were performed in parallel with wild type and 22 variants of fEPO such that amber codons were placed within the coding region subject to suppression in a manner so as to retain fEPO bioactivity and glycan structure. The 22 variants of fEPO include those shown in : K52, Q86, E89, E31, E21, E37, R131, K116, F133, L130, R53, Y49, T132, A1, S120, R76, P129, S36, D55, A128, E72, R163. Experimental results indicate the wild type sequence expresses well and that suppression expression of the 22 different variants varied widely, but at least 19 of the 22 demonstrated expression as detectable by ELISA. Accordingly, an embodiment of the inventive suppression expression construct is expected to express gene sequences of interest with amber suppression codons located at a variety of positions.","Transient expression of fEPO may be used to accommodate some technical challenges in producing this protein e.g. having an isoelectric point around pH 4 and the high glycosylation of fEPO (over 40% of the mass) which can affect conjugation efficiency and some site accessibility, therefore alternate chemistries may be used as well as alternate expression systems.","The suppression expression construct in this example encodes the modified feline EPO protein with the amber codon positioned at residue 1 replacing the normal alanine residue. This expression construct is referred to as \u201cNat L BB-Opti FEPO in Lucy F\u201d, a map of which is depicted in , and the sequence of which is set forth in .","Nat L BB-Opti FEPO A1 in Lucy F (containing the amber codon at position A1) was transfected into the CHO-DG44 parent cell line. Transfections were performed using 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 ug linearized DNA per 4.times.10.sup.6 CHO cells per 96 well plate. Dominant selection of stably transfected cells was accomplished via the expression construct encoded neomycin resistance marker and media (CHO-S-SFM II+HT) containing G418.","Viable wells were identified, expanded to small scale (50 ml) shaker culture and cellular productivity assessed by ELISA assay. A variety of G418 resistant cell isolates were obtained producing easily detectable secreted fEPO. Two in particular, 5B5 and 15B3 were determined to be producing 0.07 and 0.1 mg\/L in 3-4 days respectively, or 0.03 picogram\/cell\/day (pcd). Secreted fEPO was detected by ELISA as using the StemCell EPO ELISA KIT-Immunoassay for Human Erythropoietin, cat #01630.","The Lucy F suppression expression system contains an expression cassette encoding the murine DHFR gene. As the parent CHO-DG44 cell line used for expression is completely deficient in DHFR enzymatic activity (double deletion), amplification of the integrated target gene (murine DHFR) is possible by growth selection in media containing methotrexate (MTX). During this amplification, the directly linked protein gene (in this example fEPO) is concomitantly amplified. Thus it is possible to isolate cell lines producing elevated amounts of fEPO. Our first round selection of G418 resistant cell lines is performed in 5 nM MTX. Highest level producers (as determined by ELISA) are then identified and characterized.","The fEPO G418 resistant cell lineages 5B5 and 15B3 were subjected to 5 nM MTX amplification.

All subjects are evaluable for safety and all blood collections for pharmacokinetic analysis are collected as scheduled. All studies are performed with institutional ethics committee approval and patient consent.","Study Design This is a Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study in healthy male volunteers. Eighteen subjects are randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequence groups (nine subjects\/group). EPO is administered over two separate dosing periods as a bolus s.c. injection in the upper thigh using equivalent doses of the PEGylated fEPO comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and the commercially available product chosen. The dose and frequency of administration of the commercially available product is as instructed in the package label. Additional dosing, dosing frequency, or other parameter as desired, using the commercially available products may be added to the study by including additional groups of subjects. Each dosing period is separated by a time period to be based off of the human trial version (e.g. a 14-day washout period). Subjects are confined to the study center at least 12 hours prior to and 72 hours following dosing for each of the two dosing periods, but not between dosing periods. Additional groups of subjects may be added if there are to be additional dosing, frequency, or other parameter, to be tested for the PEGylated fEPO as well. Multiple formulations of EPO that are approved for use may be used in this study. Epoetin alfa marketed as PROCRIT\u00ae and\/or darbepoitein marketed as ARANESP\u00ae are commercially available EPO products that have also been used therapeutically in animals. The experimental formulation of fEPO is the PEGylated fEPO comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.","Blood Sampling Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and after administration of EPO. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum erythropoietin concentrations are obtained at about 30, 20, and 10 minutes prior to dosing (3 baseline samples) and at approximately the following times after dosing: 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice. Fasting clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) are performed immediately prior to the initial dose on day 1, the morning of day 4, immediately prior to dosing on day 16, and the morning of day 19.","Bioanalytical Methods A radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit procedure (Diagnostic Systems Laboratory [DSL], Webster Tex.), is used for the determination of serum erythropoietin concentrations. The commercially available RIA is a double-antibody, competitive method that uses a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to urinary erythropoietin as the primary antibody and an I-labeled urinary erythropoietin as the tracer. Epoetin alfa or darbepoietin is substituted for urinary erythropoietin provided in the DSL kit, in standards and quality control samples. Standard concentrations used in the assay are 7.8, 15.6, 31.3, 50, 62.5, 100, and 125 mIU\/mL. Sensitivity, defined as the mean back-fit value for the lowest standard giving acceptable precision, is 8.6 mIU\/mL, and the assay range is extended to 2,000 mIU\/mL through quality control dilutions.","Safety Determinations Vital signs are recorded immediately prior to each dosing (Days 1 and 16), and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after each dosing. Safety determinations are based on the incidence and type of adverse events and the changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline. In addition, changes from pre-study in vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, and physical examination results are evaluated.","Data Analysis Post-dose serum concentration values are corrected for pre-dose baseline erythropoietin concentrations by subtracting from each of the post-dose values the mean baseline erythropoietin concentration determined from averaging the erythropoietin levels from the three samples collected at 30, 20, and 10 minutes before dosing. Pre-dose serum erythropoietin concentrations are not included in the calculation of the mean value if they are below the quantification level of the assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum concentration data corrected for baseline erythropoietin concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated by model independent methods on a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 8600 computer system using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetics parameters are determined: peak serum concentration (C); time to peak serum concentration (t); area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUC) calculated with the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; and terminal elimination half-life (t), computed from the elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is estimated by linear regression of consecutive data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each treatment. The ratio of the parameter means (preserved formulation\/non-preserved formulation) is calculated.","Safety Results The incidence of adverse events is equally distributed across the treatment groups. There are no clinically significant changes from baseline or pre-study clinical laboratory tests or blood pressures, and no notable changes from pre-study in physical examination results and vital sign measurements. The safety profiles for the two treatment groups should appeared similar.","Pharmacokinetic Results Mean serum erythropoietin concentration-time profiles (uncorrected for baseline erythropoietin levels) in all 18 subjects after receiving a single dose of commercially available hEPO (PROCRIT\u00ae or ARANESP\u00ae) are compared to the PEGylated fEPO and\/or research or commercial fEPOs which are available. The PEGylated fEPO for comparison is one of the present invention, comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid at each time point measured. All subjects should have pre-dose baseline erythropoietin concentrations within the normal physiologic range. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum data corrected for pre-dose mean baseline erythropoietin concentrations and the Cand tare determined. The mean tfor hEPO (PROCRIT\u00ae) is significantly shorter than the tmax for the PEGylated hEPO comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid. Terminal half-life values are significantly shorter for hEPO (PROCRIT\u00ae) compared with the terminal half-life for the PEGylated fEPO comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.","Although the present study is conducted in healthy subjects, similar absorption characteristics and safety profiles would be anticipated in other patient populations; such as patients with cancer or chronic renal failure, post injury with injury-induced anemia, pediatric renal failure patients, patients in autologous predeposit programs, or patients scheduled for elective surgery.","In conclusion, subcutaneously administered single doses of PEGylated fEPO comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid are safe and well tolerated by healthy subjects. Based on a comparative incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination results, the safety profiles of research\/commercial EPOs, hEPO (PROCRIT\u00ae) and PEGylated fEPO comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid are equivalent. The PEGylated fEPO comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid potentially provides large clinical utility to patients and health care providers.","The impact of PEG on the duration of activity of a protein is at least partially dependent on the size and structure (linear vs. branched) of the PEG. The comparative ability of different PEG size variants of fEPO to increase hematocrits (Hct) was evaluated in healthy cats.","Recombinant fEPO variants containing a p-aminophenylalanine (pAF) substitution at position A1 were expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cell expression system. The protein was PEGylated with either 20 kD, 30 kD or 40 kD oxyamino PEG at the site of the non-native amino acid substitution.

Baseline blood samples were collected on Days-14 and Day-7 prior to enrollment in the study. Cats were sedated with acepromazine and isoflurane to reduce the stress of collecting blood samples.

Animals were treated once with their assigned treatments by subcutaneous injection.","Additional blood samples were collected on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38 and 42 post-treatment. Hematocrits were determined for each sample. Daily feed consumption was also measured and animals were observed daily for any health issues.","The effects of the various treatments upon hematocrits and RBC are presented in .","Significant increases in Hct values relative to the buffer controls were observed with either the 20 kD or 30 kD PEGylated fEPO variants within 3 days of dosing. Animals treated with the 40 kD PEG variant exhibited significant increases relative to the buffer controls by approximately 10 days post-treatment. Maximum Hct values were observed on Day 10 for animals treated with the 20 kD PEG variant, Day 14 for the 30 kD PEG variant and Day 17 for the 40 kD PEG variant. Hematocrits for animals treated with either the 20 or 30 kD PEG variants were significantly greater than the buffer controls through at least 28 days post-dosing. These results suggest administration of PEG fEPO once per month should be adequate to support the maintenance of increased Hct levels. There were no adverse events observed during the course of the study.","The ability of PEGylated fEPO variants to restore normal red blood cell (RBC) numbers in cats with anemia can be evaluated in cats with stage III or stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cats with this condition exhibit moderate to severe non-regenerative anemia due to the loss of parenchymal renal cells which are the primary source of endogenous fEPO.","To evaluate the ability of PEGylated fEPO to increase red blood cell numbers in cats with CKD and anemia, 12 cats (6 males and 6 females) weighing approximately 3-6 kg with a clinical history of CKD and hematocrits<30% are acclimated to the study facility, their diet and husbandry procedures. Hematocrits and RBC counts from blood samples collected on Days-14 and Day-7 prior to enrollment in the study are used as baseline controls for each animal.","Cats are assigned to one of three treatment groups using a randomized block design which equalized baseline hematocrits and RBCs between treatments. Each treatment group contains four animals (2 males\/2 females). PEGylated fEPO is administered via subcutaneous injection at doses ranging from 2-8 \u03bcg\/kg.","Additional blood samples are collected on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 and 31 post-treatment. Hematocrits and RBC counts are determined for each sample. Daily feed consumption is also measured and animals are observed and scored daily for clinical signs of depression and\/or lethargy to assess quality of life.","Efficacy is determined by comparing the post-treatment hematocrits and RBC counts with the baseline values obtained prior to administration of the protein. The protein is considered efficacious if the mean daily hematocrit and RBC count values exhibit a statistically significant increase relative to the baseline values or if the mean daily values increase to within the normal reference range values for these parameters at any point during the post-treatment period.","It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.
