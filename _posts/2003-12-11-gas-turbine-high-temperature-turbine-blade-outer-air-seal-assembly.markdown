title: Gas turbine high temperature turbine blade outer air seal assembly
abstract: A turbine shroud assembly includes forward and aft hangers, an axisymmetric plenum assembly, ceramic shroud segments, ceramic spacers, and forward and aft rope seals. The plenum assembly supplies impingement cooling to the shroud and the hangers. The impingement cooling to the forward and aft hangers is controlled independently to improve blade tip clearance. The rope seals are radially inward from the hangers and reduce cooling flow leakage. The turbine shroud assembly can operate in a higher temperature environment using less cooling flow than the prior art.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention was made with Government support under contracts with the US Army (DAAJ02-94-C-0030), the US Air Force (F33615-94-C-2507) and the US Navy (N00019-94-C-0036). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention generally relates to gas turbine engine systems and, more particularly, to high pressure turbine (HPT) blade outer air seal (BOAS) assemblies, also known as turbine shroud assemblies.","Turbine shroud assemblies have been used extensively in gas turbine engines. The turbine shroud assembly may be positioned immediately downstream of an HPT nozzle. The turbine shroud assembly may surround a HPT rotor and may define an outer boundary of a high temperature gas flow path through the HPT. During engine operation, exposure to the high temperature gas flow may result in failure of the turbine shroud components. Due to the differing expansion of rotor and turbine shroud assembly components, it may also result in contact between the turbine shroud assembly and the blade tips of the rotor. A small amount of cooling air from a compressor may be used to decrease some of the adverse effects of the high temperature gas flow.","Minimizing the amount of air necessary to cool the turbine shroud assembly is desirable because engine efficiency decreases as the amount of cooling air increases. Methods for minimizing the cooling air necessary may include decreasing cooling air leakage from the assembly or reducing the cooling needs of the system by increasing the effectiveness of the cooling scheme.","Turbine shroud assemblies have experienced significant distress due to a lack of robust sealing of the assembly. This leakage may result in a significant reduction in the cooling cavity pressure (and back flow margin), which can result in hot gas ingestion and distress in the hardware. Back flow margin is the ratio of the difference between the shroud cooling cavity pressure and the flow path pressure to the flow path pressure. If the back flow margin of the assembly becomes negative (or for some designs even a low positive number), hot flow path gas may ingest into portions of the shroud and may cause significant distress. The challenge in maintaining good back flow margin is due to the difficulty in sealing the various leak paths that allow the cooling air to escape from the shroud cooling cavity.","Several methods of reducing cooling air leakage have been disclosed. These methods include the use of labyrinth type seals and metallic platform seals. Unfortunately, labyrinth seals are not suitable for some applications, and the metallic platform seals, which are secured in machined grooves in the sides of the segments, may fail in the operating environment of some engines. In addition, assembly technicians may cut themselves on the small, sharp metallic platform seals.","Methods of reducing system cooling needs have also been disclosed. Manufacturing the assembly components from more robust materials and utilizing thermal barrier coatings (TBC) have been described. Designs that utilize TBC to keep the shrouds insulated from the hot flow path gas can experience delamination of the TBC, which may result in shroud distress, which may result in large turbine blade tip clearances. The subsequent increase in turbine blade tip clearance significantly hurts fuel consumption and also results in an increase in turbine inlet temperature, which further distresses the hardware.","Methods of increasing the effectiveness of cooling configurations have been disclosed. In one method complex arrays of film cooling holes have been drilled into shroud segments. Although this results in increased cooling of the turbine shroud assembly, all edges of the shroud segments may not be sufficiently cooled and system integrity may suffer.","Turbine shroud assemblies having increased cooling of the shroud segment edges have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,311. This invention utilizes an interlocking hook\/shelf on the ends of the segments in conjunction with conventional feather seals and slots to produce an end gap seal between the adjacent circumferential segments. In addition, this invention uses film cooling holes to reinforce cooling at the sides of the segment. Although cooling of the shroud segment edges is increased, the metallic feather seals may suffer distress at higher operating temperatures, which may result in a loss of back flow margin to the assembly.","Another turbine shroud assembly has been disclosed in U.S. patent application No. 2003\/0133790. This invention requires that the turbine shroud segment and the shroud segment hanger both are segmented arcs. This invention relies on tight tolerances to minimize leakage of the assembly. Sliding the turbine shroud segment into the shroud segment hanger requires tight tolerances to keep the air seal along the forward and aft hooks. Unfortunately, the tolerances needed may result in increased production costs of the turbine shroud assembly. In addition, fine-tuning of the thermal expansion of the forward and aft hangers may not be possible. Further, to change cooling flows, this invention requires that every shroud segment hanger be reworked.","Turbine shroud assemblies having increased cooling efficiency have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,506. This design incorporates a rope seal radially outside of the segment forward hook to reduce the leakage of cooling air through the forward hook region of the shroud support. Unfortunately, the forward hook of this assembly may be exposed to hot ingested flow path air. Also, fine tuning of the thermal growth of the forward hanger may not be possible. Further, the disclosed assembly may not allow for sufficient axial motion of the shroud segment as the pressure loads move the segment aft. Because turbine inlet temperatures will continue to rise to achieve greater thrust to weight capability and improved fuel consumption, still further improvements are needed.","As can be seen, there is a need for improved turbine shroud assemblies. Additionally, assemblies are needed wherein cooling air flow is minimized while allowing for increased gas flow temperatures. Further, turbine shroud assemblies are needed wherein blade tip clearance is decreased. Moreover, turbine shroud assemblies having improved cooling schemes to the forward and aft hangers are needed. Also, assemblies are needed that have reduced cooling air leakage and improved shroud segment sealing.","In one aspect of the present invention, a turbine shroud assembly comprises a plurality of shroud segments assembled circumferentially about a longitudinal engine centerline axis, each shroud segment having a forward hook and an aft hook; a plurality of spacer channels positioned on the radially outward side of the shroud segments, such that one spacer channel is in contact with each interface of two shroud segments; a plurality of ceramic spacer seals positioned in contact with the spacer channels, such that one ceramic spacer seal is within each spacer channel; a forward hanger, comprised of a plurality of forward hanger rails positioned radially outward from the shroud segments, the forward hanger rails capable of engaging the shroud segment forward hooks, the forward hanger rails having an o-ring groove positioned circumferentially on a radially inward side; an aft hanger positioned radially outward from the shroud segments, the aft hanger comprised of a rail capable of engaging the shroud segment aft hooks, the aft hanger rail having an angled surface positioned on the forward edge of the radially inward side; and a plenum assembly positioned between and in contact with the forward hanger and the aft hanger.","In yet another aspect of the present invention, a turbine shroud assembly comprises a plurality of ceramic shroud segments assembled circumferentially about a longitudinal engine centerline axis, each ceramic shroud segment having a forward hook and an aft hook; and a plurality of ceramic spacer seals positioned in contact with the ceramic shroud segments, such that each ceramic spacer seal is in contact with the radially outward side of two ceramic shroud segments.","In another aspect of the present invention, a turbine shroud assembly comprises a plurality of shroud segments assembled circumferentially about a longitudinal engine centerline axis, each shroud segment comprising a monolithic silicon nitride ceramic and having a forward hook and an aft hook; a plurality of spacer channels positioned on the radially outward side of the shroud segments, such that one spacer channel is in contact with each interface of two shroud segments; a plurality of ceramic spacer seals comprising a monolithic silicon nitride ceramic, the ceramic spacer seals positioned in contact with the spacer channels, such that one ceramic spacer seal is within each spacer channel; a forward hanger comprising a nickel based alloy, positioned radially outward from the shroud segments, the forward hanger rails capable of engaging the shroud segment forward hooks, the forward hanger rails having an o-ring groove positioned circumferentially on a radially inward side; a forward rope seal positioned between and in contact with the o-ring groove and the shroud segments; an aft hanger comprising a nickel based alloy, positioned radially outward from the shroud segments, the aft hanger rail capable of engaging the shroud segment aft hooks, the aft hanger rail having an angled surface positioned on the forward edge of the radially inward side; an aft rope seal positioned between and in contact with the angled surface and the shroud segments; a plenum assembly positioned between and in contact with the forward hanger and the aft hanger, the plenum assembly comprising an axisymmetric plenum balloon having an impingement cooling array there through, a plurality of flow metering openings in fluid communication with the axisymmetric plenum balloon, and a plurality of inlet openings in flow communication with the flow metering openings.","In another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for a turbine engine comprises an axisymmetric plenum balloon having an impingement cooling array there through; a plurality of flow metering openings in fluid communication with the axisymmetric plenum balloon; and a plurality of inlet openings in flow communication with the flow metering openings.","In still another aspect of the present invention, a rope seal apparatus for use between a turbine shroud and a turbine hanger comprises a compressed hybrid ceramic rope positioned between and in contact with the turbine shroud and the turbine hanger, such that the turbine hanger is radially outward from the compressed hybrid ceramic rope.","In a further aspect of the present invention, a method of shielding a turbine engine structure from a hot gas flow path there through comprises the steps of providing a plurality of ceramic shroud segments assembled circumferentially about a longitudinal engine centerline, a forward hanger radially outward from and forward of the ceramic shroud segments, an aft hanger radially outward from and aft of the ceramic shroud segments, and a plenum assembly between and in contact with the forward hanger and the aft hanger; and supplying a cooling flow to the plenum assembly such that the cooling flow impinges the ceramic shroud segments, the forward hanger, and the aft hanger.","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.","The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.","The present invention generally provides high pressure turbine (HPT) blade outer air seal (BOAS) assemblies, also known as turbine shroud assemblies and methods for producing the same. The turbine shroud assemblies produced according to the present invention may find beneficial use in many industries including aerospace and industrial. The turbine shroud assemblies of the present invention may be beneficial in applications including electricity generation, naval propulsion, pumping sets for gas and oil transmission, aircraft propulsion, automobile engines, and stationary power plants. This invention may be useful in any gas turbine application.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a turbine shroud assembly for an HPT stage. The turbine shroud assembly may be positioned immediately downstream of an HPT nozzle. The turbine shroud assembly may surround an HPT rotor and may define an outer boundary of a high temperature gas flow path through the HPT. Cooling flow from a compressor may be utilized to cool the turbine shroud assembly. The turbine shroud assembly of the present invention may comprise a plenum assembly positioned between forward and aft hangers. Unlike the prior art, the plenum assembly may comprise an axisymmetric plenum balloon having an impingement cooling array there through. The impingement cooling array may provide cooling flow to the shroud segments and, unlike the prior art, it may also provide cooling flow to the forward and aft hangers. One of the significant advantages of this design over the prior art may be the ability to customize the heat transfer to the forward and aft hangers, which govern the radial position of the shroud segments, which in turn govern the turbine rotor tip clearance. This unique advantage over the prior art helps maintain tight turbine tip clearance for improved performance. Another advantage over the prior art is that any leakage from the combustor plenum that occurs between the forward hanger and the plenum assembly, or from between the aft hanger and the plenum assembly, may not be wasted air. It may act to supercharge the impingement cooling air cavity of the turbine shroud assembly to help maintain positive back flow margin to the assembly.","The plenum assembly of the present invention, unlike the prior art, may comprise inlet openings and flow metering openings. These openings may provide a method of pressure recovery for axial flow combustor plenums, may serve to minimize the cooling flow circuit sensitivity to varying or uncertain orifice discharge coefficients that are common with combustor plenums that suffer from significant circumferential swirl, may straighten the cooling flow as it flows radially inward, and may control the overall amount of cooling flow to the plenum assembly. Further, unlike the prior art, a cooling flow change can be made to the present turbine shroud assembly by simply modifying the flow metering opening diameter or number of flow metering openings. With the prior art designs, each of the shroud segments may be required to undergo modifications. In addition, many engine designs require that the turbine case undergo modifications as well. This may not be required with the present invention.","The turbine shroud assembly of the present invention may comprise hybrid ceramic rope seals at the forward and aft portions of the shroud assembly. Unlike the prior art, the hybrid ceramic rope seals of the present invention may be positioned radially inward from the hangers to reduce hanger exposure to the hot gas flow. Cooling flow leakage may be reduced and cooling cavity pressure may be maintained. By controlling the relative compression in the hybrid ceramic rope seals, an optimized flow distribution may be maintained through the turbine shroud assembly that is not possible in the prior art. Additionally, unlike the prior art that allows the air to escape far from the flow path, the cooling flow from the hybrid rope seals may be channeled directly along the shroud segment to help cool the shroud segment and provide purging of the hot flow path gas away from the turbine shroud assembly.","As seen in , a turbine shroud assembly  may comprise a shroud segment , a ceramic spacer seal , a forward hanger , an aft hanger , a vertical flange , and a plenum assembly . As better seen in , a turbine shroud assembly  may further comprise a forward rope seal  and an aft rope seal . A turbine shroud assembly  may further comprise a thermal barrier coating (TBC) , a forward spacer radial retainer , and an aft spacer radial retainer , as seen in .","The turbine shroud assembly  may comprise a plurality of shroud segments . Each shroud segment  may comprise a forward hook  and an aft hook  capable of engaging the forward hanger rails  and aft hanger rail , respectively. The shroud segments  may be assembled circumferentially about a longitudinal engine centerline axis , as shown in . The shroud segments  are positioned such that they surround a HPT rotor (not shown) and define an outer boundary of a high temperature gas flow path through the HPT. The shroud segments  may comprise a very high temperature capable ceramic, such as monolithic silicon nitride ceramic. Useful ceramics may include AS800\u00ae silicon nitride monolithic ceramic available from Honeywell International, Inc. The shroud segments  may be machined out of a full ring and cut into segments. The shroud segments  may have a thickness between about 0.25 and about 0.50 inches.","Each shroud segment  may be provided with two edge channels and , one on each circumferential end of the shroud segment. As shown in , each edge channel and is comprised of a flat radial surface , a flat circumferential surface , and a fillet  positioned at the interface of flat radial surface  and flat circumferential surface . The flat circumferential surface  includes the edge of a shroud segment  that is adjacent to the edge of a second shroud segment  when the shroud segments  are positioned circumferentially in the shroud assembly. Two edge channels and may be positioned at a platform gap  between two circumferentially assembled shroud segments  to form a spacer channel . The spacer channel  may be capable of receiving a ceramic spacer seal  to create seal  at the interface between flat circumferential surface  and the radial inward surface of the ceramic spacer seal , thus minimizing cooling flow leakage out the platform gap . The edge channels and may have a depth between about 0.05 and about 0.40 inches. The edge channels and may be provided by known manufacturing methods. The shroud segments  may be thermally controlled by utilizing a thermal barrier coating (TBC)  on the hot gas flow path side  (radially inward side) of the shroud segment  and by impingement cooling of the shroud segments  on the back side .","Thermal barrier coatings (TBC)  are known in the art and may be applied to the hot gas flow path side  of the shroud segments . A useful TBC  may be Zircoat\u2122 (by PRAXAIR) and may be applied by plasma spray technique. The TBC  may provide thermal insulation against the hot gas flow and may reduce the cooling requirement of the shroud segments . The turbine shroud assembly  may experience outward radial movement due to thermal expansion. The forward end  of the shroud segment  and the aft end  of the shroud segment  may experience different rates of outward radial movement. The forward end  may be the end of the shroud segment  that is closest to the forward hanger . The aft end  may be the end of the shroud segment  that is closest to the aft hanger . The radial movement of the forward end  during engine operation may be a function of the thermal growth of the forward hanger . The radial movement of the aft end  during engine operation may be a function of the thermal growth of the aft hanger . To compensate for the differential radial thermal growth between the forward hanger  and aft hanger , the thermal barrier coating  may be ground to a conical profile during manufacturing. The thickness of the TBC  across the shroud segment  may vary from the forward end  to the aft end  such that the end of the shroud segment  that experiences the greater outward radial movement may have thicker TBC . This may achieve an optimized cylindrical profile during engine operation, which may maintain robust turbine tip clearance control. Because the present invention may be designed for applications that run at turbine inlet temperatures that can melt or fail even nickel based superalloys, the shroud segments  may be sealed at their flat circumferential surfaces  with ceramic spacer seals .","Ceramic spacer seals  may fit into the spacer channels , as shown in . One ceramic spacer seal  may fit simultaneously into two edge channels and , one edge channel on each of two adjacent circumferentially assembled shroud segments , as shown in . One ceramic spacer seal  may be positioned in each spacer channel . Due to manufacturing limitations and thermal growth considerations, the turbine shroud assembly  may comprise platform gaps  and fillet\/chamfer gaps . The platform gap  may be the gap between adjacent shroud segments . The fillet\/chamfer gap  may be the gap between a shroud segment  and a ceramic spacer seal . The ceramic spacer seals  may conform to the same circumferential cross section as the shroud segments  but without the forward hooks  and aft hooks , as shown in . The ceramic spacer seals  may comprise a ceramic, such as monolithic silicon nitride ceramic. The ceramic spacer seals  may have a thickness between about 0.05 and about 0.4 inches. The thickness of the ceramic spacer seals  may be about equal to the depth of the edge channels and ","The ceramic spacer seals  may be radially retained with forward spacer radial retainers  and aft spacer radial retainers , as shown in . Any known retaining means may be useful for radially retaining the ceramic spacer seals . The forward spacer radial retainers  and aft spacer radial retainers  may comprise known sheet metal retaining rings. During engine operation, the pressure loading of the turbine shroud assembly  may secure the ceramic spacer seals  to the shroud segments , resulting in an exceptional high temperature seal that would not be possible utilizing the prior art. The shroud segments  and ceramic spacer seals  may shelter the forward hanger rails  and aft hanger rail  from the hot flow path gases. The ceramic spacer seals  and the shroud segments  may be retained axially by the forward hanger  and the aft hanger .","The turbine shroud assembly  may comprise forward hanger  and aft hanger . The forward hanger  and aft hanger  may comprise high strength nickel base superalloys, such as Mar-M-247. For some applications, the forward hanger  and aft hanger  may comprise metal-alloys including nickel based alloys and cobalt based alloys. Useful metal alloys may include Single Crystal SC180 available from Honeywell, Mar-M-247 Eqx material available from Martin Marietta, HA230 available from Haynes International, and MA754 available from Special Metals. The forward hanger  and aft hanger  may be formed by known manufacturing methods. The forward hanger  and aft hanger  may govern the overall thermal growth of the turbine shroud assembly . The thermal expansion of the forward hanger  and aft hanger  may be a function of hanger cooling and material selection. The forward hanger  and aft hanger , which may be cooled independently, may allow for optimal thermal growth and precise turbine tip clearance control. For example, the impingement cooling flow to the forward hanger  and aft hanger  may be altered by altering the impingement cooling array , which in turn may alter the thermal expansion of the hangers and may alter turbine tip clearance. The result may be improved turbine tip clearance and thus improved fuel consumption for the engine.","The turbine shroud assembly  may comprise an aft rope seal  between the aft hanger rail  and the shroud segments . The aft rope seal  may comprise a hybrid ceramic rope , as shown in . The hybrid ceramic rope  may comprise a rope core of braided ceramic fibers encapsulated in a metallic braided outer sheath. Useful hybrid ceramic ropes  may include those similar to U.S. Pat. No. 5,301,595, which is incorporated herein by reference. The hybrid ceramic rope  may be compression tested to verify the load on the shroud segments  and may be flow tested to quantify cooling flow as a function of compression. The diameter of a useful hybrid ceramic rope  may be between about 0.04 and about 0.20 inches. The diameter of a preferred hybrid ceramic rope  may be between about 0.045 and about 0.080 inches. The diameter of a more preferred hybrid ceramic rope  may be between about 0.05 and about 0.06 inches.","For proper positioning of the hybrid ceramic rope  and formation of the aft rope seal , the aft hanger rail  may be provided with an angled surface at the forward end of the radially inner surface, as shown in . The angled surface may be provided by known manufacturing techniques. Force balance analysis may be utilized for determining a useful angle of the angled surface . The forces affecting the aft rope seal  may be at static equilibrium (force balance) during engine operation such that the hybrid ceramic rope  may maintain contact with the shroud segment  and the angled surface . A property of force is that the superposition of forces satisfies the laws of vector addition. When the forces acting on the hybrid ceramic rope  equal zero, the hybrid ceramic rope  will not be in motion, thus not extruded. The sum of the forces affecting the aft rope seal  may be zero. Factors affecting these forces may include the compression of the hybrid ceramic rope , the pressure load from the cooling flow , the angle of the angled surface , and the frictional coefficients of the materials. The magnitude of the forces affecting the aft rope seal  may vary by application. Friction testing systems may be useful in determining the forces due to friction. Useful friction testing systems may include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,377,525, which is incorporated herein by reference.","During manufacture of the turbine shroud assembly , an uncompressed form  of the hybrid ceramic rope  may be positioned circumferentially about the shroud segments  and positioned radially inward of the aft hook  of the shroud segment . The aft hanger rail  may be engaged axially to produce the compressed form , as seen in . During manufacture of the turbine shroud assembly , the hybrid ceramic rope  may be compressed between the aft hanger rail , the ceramic spacer seals , and the shroud segments . In this compressed state, the hybrid ceramic rope  may form an aft rope seal . As is known in the art, a flow analysis test may be performed to determine the desired compression. Useful flow analysis systems may include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,980, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The aft rope seal  may provide axial sealing and radial sealing. The hybrid ceramic rope  may be compressed in such a way as to simultaneously form a seal at a plurality of sealing areas , as shown in . The sealing areas  may include a portion of the aft side of the ceramic spacer seal , a portion of the aft side of the shroud segment , the angled surface , the platform gap , and the fillet\/chamfer gap . As can be seen, the hybrid ceramic rope  may contact the aft face of the ceramic spacer seals  at a location between adjacent shroud segments  to minimize radial leakage from the ceramic spacer seals . The hybrid ceramic rope  may also seal the fillet\/chamfer gap  created by the ceramic spacer seal  chamfer. The reaction load for static equilibrium and final sealing on the angled surface of the aft hanger rail  may occur to secure the aft rope seal  and preclude extrusion of the hybrid ceramic rope  out of the gap between the angled surface and the shroud segments . The aft rope seal  may provide a robust flow circuit that minimizes hot gas ingestion if a loss of back flow margin were to occur. For prior art seals, such as platform seals, when there is a loss of back flow margin, hot gas ingestion may occur unimpeded. The aft rope seal  of the present invention may be a physical impedance to hot gas ingestion.","The turbine shroud assembly  may comprise a forward rope seal  between the forward hanger rails  and the shroud segments . The forward rope seal  may comprise a hybrid ceramic rope . The forward hanger rails  may be provided with o-ring grooves . An o-ring groove may be positioned circumferentially on the radially inner surface of a forward hanger rail , as shown in . The o-ring grooves may be formed by known methods and may be capable of forming a forward rope seal . The cross-sectional area of the o-ring groove may be less than the cross-sectional area of the hybrid ceramic rope . The hybrid ceramic rope  may be positioned in the o-ring groove . The forward hanger rails  then may axially engage the forward hook  of the shroud segment  to form the forward rope seal .","During manufacturing of the turbine shroud assembly , the hybrid ceramic rope  may be positioned in the o-ring groove . The hybrid ceramic rope  may be compressed between the forward hanger rails  and the shroud segments . In this compressed state, the hybrid ceramic rope  may produce a forward rope seal . The forward rope seal  may be a typical \u201co-ring\u201d type seal. The forward rope seal  may allow axial movement between the shroud segments  and the forward hanger  while maintaining a controlled amount of flow to purge the cavity forward of the forward hanger .","The turbine shroud assembly  may utilize the axial movement in the forward rope seal  to compensate for the differential axial thermal growth between the forward hanger  and aft hanger , while the aft rope seal  may maintain cooling back flow margin by controlling leakage across multiple sealing areas . Altering the compression of the hybrid ceramic rope , which forms the forward rope seal  and the aft rope seal , may alter the amount of cooling flow  exiting below the forward hanger  and aft hanger . A useful amount of cooling flow  exiting below the forward hanger  and aft hanger  may vary by application. The rate of flow through the hybrid ceramic rope  may be a function of the compression of the hybrid ceramic rope . The hybrid ceramic rope  of the aft rope seal  may be more compressed than the hybrid ceramic rope  of the forward rope seal . This may allow a greater amount of cooling flow  to exit below the forward hanger  than below the aft hanger .","Slots  may be positioned at the inner diameter of the forward hanger  and extend radially outward, as seen in . Slots  are known in the art and may control thermal growth and stresses. Useful slots  for reducing thermal expansion and stresses of the hanger may include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,276, which is incorporated herein by reference. The useful dimensions and number of slots  may be determined by known methods and may vary depending on application and hanger composition. For further control of thermal growth and for stress relief, stress relief openings  may be positioned at the radially outer end of the slots  and extend axially through the forward hanger , as shown in . During engine operation, cooling flow  may pass through the slots  and stress relief openings  and may be channeled to help cool the forward hanger  and provide purging of the hot flow path gas away from the turbine shroud assembly . Methods for producing the slots  and stress relief openings  are known in the art.","Useful methods for forming the slots  and stress relief openings  may include electrical discharge machining (EDM). EDM applications require the use of a spark erosion machine. EDM applications are known in the art and include drilling by spark erosion, which may be useful for forming the stress relief openings . Other known EDM applications include cutting by spark erosion using a flat electrode and cutting by spark erosion using a wire, both of which may be useful in forming the slots .","The turbine shroud assembly  may comprise a plenum assembly , as shown in . The plenum assembly  may be positioned between and in contact with the forward hanger  and aft hanger . The plenum assembly  may be retained between the forward hanger  and aft hanger  by known retaining methods. In one embodiment, as shown in , a bolting system  may retain the plenum assembly  between the forward hanger  and the aft hanger . As shown in , the plenum assembly  may comprise an axisymmetric plenum balloon , inlet openings , and flow metering openings . The axisymmetric plenum balloon  may have an impingement cooling array  there through, as shown in . Known manufacturing methods may be used to produce the plenum assembly . The plenum assembly  may comprise a sheet metal form and may be capable of receiving cooling flow .","During engine operation, a compressor (not shown) may be used to supply the cooling flow . The cooling flow  may enter the plenum assembly  at the inlet openings . The cooling flow  may pass through the inlet openings  and then enter the flow metering openings . The cooling flow  may pass through the flow metering openings  and then enter the axisymmetric plenum balloon . The-cooling flow  may then exit the plenum assembly  through the impingement cooling array .","A vertical flange , shown in , may be positioned radially out from and aft of the inlet openings  and may provide a robust method of pressure recovery for axial flow combustor plenums. The cooling flow  may be straightened as it flows radially inward through the inlet openings  and towards the flow metering openings . The inlet openings  may also serve to minimize the cooling flow circuit sensitivity to varying or uncertain orifice discharge coefficients that are common with combustor plenums that suffer from significant circumferential swirl. The straightening of the cooling flow  may be due to the dimensions of the inlet openings . The length of the inlet openings  may be at least about two inlet hole diameters in length, as an example. The cross-sectional area of the inlet openings  may be at least about  times the cross-sectional area of the flow metering openings . This may allow the flow metering openings  to predominantly control the overall flow to the axisymmetric plenum balloon . The plenum assembly may comprise at least one inlet opening  and at least one flow metering opening . For every inlet opening  there may be a corresponding flow metering opening  to provide a uniform flow distribution to the impingement cooling array . In one embodiment of the present invention the number of inlet openings  and corresponding flow metering openings  may be about . The diameter of the inlet openings  may be between about 0.05 and about 0.20 inches. The diameter of the flow metering openings  may be between about 0.025 and about 0.075 inches.","The axisymmetric plenum balloon  may comprise a sheet metal form and may follow the contour of the back side  of the shroud segments . Impingement cooling effectiveness may be a function of impingement distance. Impingement distance is the distance between the impingement opening and the surface to be cooled. The axisymmetric plenum balloon , by following the contours of the shroud segments , may reduce impingement distance and increase impingement cooling effectiveness. Known manufacturing methods may be used to form the axisymmetric plenum balloon . The impingement cooling array  may be machined into the axisymmetric plenum balloon  and may comprise forward hanger cooling impingement openings , aft hanger cooling impingement openings , and shroud cooling impingement openings .","During engine operation, a first portion  of cooling flow , as shown in , may pass through the forward hanger cooling impingement openings  and may impinge the aft side of the forward hanger , thereby cooling the forward hanger . A second portion  of cooling flow  may pass through the aft hanger cooling impingement openings  and may impinge the forward side of the aft hanger , thereby cooling the aft hanger . A third portion  of cooling flow  may pass through the shroud cooling impingement openings  and may impinge the back side  of the shroud segment , thereby cooling the shroud segment  and the spacer seal . The heat transfer to the forward hanger  and aft hanger , which govern the radial position of the shroud segments , which in turn govern the turbine tip clearance, may be customized by altering the number or diameter of forward hanger cooling impingement openings  and aft hanger cooling impingement openings . This unique advantage over the prior art may help maintain tight turbine tip clearance. The impingement cooling array  may be positioned and sized for optimal heat transfer with minimal cross flow degradation. Any known method of heat transfer analysis may be useful. Factors affecting impingement cooling effectiveness may include the rate of flow of the cooling flow , cross flow degradation, impingement distance, the diameters of the shroud cooling impingement openings , forward hanger cooling impingement openings , and aft hanger cooling impingement openings . Cross flow degradation may be due to the spent air interfering with the intended impingement surfaces while the spent air exits the turbine shroud assembly .","The turbine shroud assembly  of the present invention may reduce the amount of cooling flow to the turbine shroud assembly  while enabling increased turbine inlet temperatures above current production technology capabilities.","As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention provides improved turbine shroud assemblies and methods for their production. A robust high temperature turbine shroud assembly is provided that can operate in a higher temperature environment using less cooling flow than the prior art. Also provided are turbine shroud assemblies having improved cooling efficiency. A turbine shroud assembly having controlled cooling of the forward and aft hangers is also provided.
