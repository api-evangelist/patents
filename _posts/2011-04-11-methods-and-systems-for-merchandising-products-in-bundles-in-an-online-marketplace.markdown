title: Methods and systems for merchandising products in bundles in an online marketplace
abstract: A method and a system for providing product bundles are described. In some instances, the method begins by receiving a request for a view product interface. The view product interface includes a description of a primary product offered for sale by a seller and indicates that a first item is for sale by the seller where the first item is an instance of the primary product. Next, a product bundle definition for the primary product by the seller is identified. The bundle includes a plurality of secondary products selectable by a buyer. An inventory of the seller is accessed to identify a second item for sale that is an instance of a secondary product. The view product interface is provided and includes the description of the primary product and a description of the bundle that includes a description of the second item.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates generally to the technical field of data management and processing, and in one specific example, to merchandising products in bundles in an online marketplace.","An online marketplace is a virtual meeting place made possible by networked computers, where buyers and sellers can interact to exchange goods and services. In online marketplaces, sellers list items for sale. Potential buyers may search for, or browse, the items for sale and purchase an item from a seller. A seller may list more than one item for sale in the online marketplace. A buyer may purchase more than one item from a seller. With conventional online marketplaces, sellers typically have limited options when it comes to promoting their items, and particularly, providing potential buyers with incentives to purchase multiple items.","Example methods and systems to provide product bundles are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","As used herein, the term \u201cproduct\u201d refers to a good for which there exists a predefined description, such as might be found in a product catalog. Accordingly, a product may be identified by a product name, trade name, part name or number, a stock-keeping unit (SKU) number, universal product code (UPC), bar code, international standard book number (ISBN), or other product identifier. The terms \u201citem\u201d and \u201citem for sale\u201d refer to a specific instance of a product. As such, when a seller is listing an item for sale via an online marketplace, if the item corresponds with a particular product in a product catalog made available by the online marketplace, by selecting the corresponding product the seller can auto-populate all or some of the various attributes and description that make up an item listing.","With conventional online marketplaces, sellers may list two or more related, but different, products for sale to potential buyers. The related products may be listed separately in the online marketplace, such that each product has its own item listing. In some instances, a seller may embed one or more links in a particular listing to one or more listings of related products. Alternatively, a seller may manually bundle one or more products into a single advertisement or listing within the online marketplace, for example, by generating a single listing that describes two or more related products being offered together.","Consistent with some embodiments of the invention, systems and methods enable sellers to define product bundles and thereby provide sellers the opportunity to allow a buyer to select and purchase multiple related products being offered via independent listings by the seller. In defining a product bundle, the seller may provide a discount or some other incentive to the buyer who buys multiple products from the seller. The seller may benefit by having higher sales volume and reduced transaction costs. A \u201cbundle,\u201d as used herein, is the purchase of two or more items from a selection of products sold by a seller. A bundle may or may not be predicated on an incentive provided by the seller.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112"]},"An Application Programming Interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more marketplace applications  and payment applications . A bundling component  may be incorporated into marketplace applications . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases .","The marketplace applications  may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the networked system . The payment applications  may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment applications  may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications . While the marketplace and payment applications  and  are shown in  to both form part of the networked system , in alternative embodiments, the payment applications  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, the present invention is of course not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace and payment applications  and  could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","The web client  accesses the various marketplace and payment applications  and  via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly, the programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications  and  via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the networked system  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client  and the networked system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["128","130","102","114","128","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","120","132","200","200","200","116","114"]},"A product identification module  is configured to identify one or more products for sale by the seller in the online marketplace. The product identification module may identify an item as a particular product using a product identifier such as a name, trade name, part name or number, a stock-keeping unit (SKU) number, universal product code (UPC) bar code, international standard book number (ISBN), or other product identifier provided by a seller via a seller device. The product identification module  may access an identifier database  to compare a received product identification to a stored product identification. The identifier database  may store a description of a product, along with text, images, video, or other media. It may be desirable to use product identifiers to define a bundle instead of using identifiers of particular listings or a particular item so that the bundles may be offered in connection with subsequent listings or items corresponding to the product without the seller having to redefine the bundle.","The product identification module  may provide a search function to identify SKUs for products by keyword. The product identification module  may further access an inventory database  (discussed in greater detail below) to determine for which products the seller has items for sale.","A definition module  is configured to manage bundles defined by a seller. The definition module  receives a first product identifier assigned to a first product, referred to as a \u201cprimary identifier.\u201d The primary identifier may be assigned to a primary product in a product bundle. A primary product may be a product that a buyer may purchase before purchasing other, secondary products. Some bundles may include more than one primary product. For example, a primary product may be a camera that is associated with accessories such as tripods, lenses, cases, additional memory, photograph printing supplies, digital imaging software, flashes, etc. The accessories may be referred to as \u201csecondary products\u201d that are assigned respective \u201csecondary identifiers.\u201d The accessories may be listed for sale in the online marketplace separately from the bundles. The use of the terms \u201cprimary product,\u201d \u201cprimary identifier,\u201d \u201csecondary product,\u201d and \u201csecondary identifier\u201d are used for illustration and are not used in a limiting sense.","The definition module  may provide one or more interfaces that allow a seller to define a product bundle. To define a product bundle, the seller selects the primary identifier of the primary product via an interface. The seller subsequently provides or selects one or more secondary identifiers of secondary products that may be bundled with the primary product.","The secondary products may be grouped according to type by the seller or by the definition module . To continue the example of a camera bundle, various lenses offered as secondary products in the bundle may be grouped as \u201clenses.\u201d The group \u201clenses\u201d may include, for example, zoom lenses, portrait lenses, micro lenses, etc.","In some embodiments, the seller may define one or more groups or secondary products that are associated with each bundle by default. The default bundles may be added to a primary product to each listing posted by the seller or to a portion of the listings posted by the seller. The portion may be defined based on category, brand, or other aspect of the primary product. These groups or secondary products may include gift certificates or warrantees being offered by the seller. Some groups may be further defined to limit the number of products in a particular group that can be purchased by the buyer. For example, a buyer may be limited to purchasing one warrantee with any particular bundle.","Via one or more interfaces, the seller optionally defines or selects one or more incentives associated with the bundle. An incentive is a discount or other benefit afforded to a buyer of a bundle that is not afforded to a buyer who does not purchase a bundle. The incentives may include discounts on individual primary or secondary products, a discount based on the number of products added to a bundle, a discount based on a total price of a bundle, a discount on shipping (e.g., secondary items ship free with the primary item), a warrantee or extended warrantee, a more generous return policy, a \u201cbuy one, get one free\u201d offer, a discount applied to additional items, or the like. The seller may further dictate other aspects of the bundle such as start date of a bundle, end date of a bundle, a number of items that a buyer can select to be in a bundle, a ranking of inventory to be included in the bundle (discussed in more detail below), cross-bundling agreements with other sellers (discussed in more detail below), or the like.","In some instances, the seller may provide a spreadsheet that defines one or more bundles. The spreadsheet may include a bundle name, start date, end date, ability to modify, bundle status, primary product identifier, group titles, secondary product identifiers (according to group), discount type, discount value, and the like. The spreadsheet may be accessed by the definition module  and analyzed to store the defined bundles in the bundle database .","Once defined, the product bundle definition is stored in a bundle database . The product bundle definition may define a one-to-many mapping of primary products to secondary products, where one primary product is mapped to each of several secondary products. If the bundle definition defines more than one product as a primary product, the product bundle definition may define several one-to-many mappings, where each of the primary products is mapped to one or more secondary products. Alternatively, the product bundle may be defined a many-to-many mapping where one or more of the primary products and the secondary products are mapped to one another. In some instances, bidirectional mappings may be used such that if one product is mapped to another, that other product is, in turn, mapped back to the one product. The bidirectional mapping is where when the relation between the primary product and secondary products are defined so that when secondary product is viewed by buyer, the primary product is shown to the buyer through reverse mapping. For example, if a seller defines a relation between a game console (primary product) and list of popular games (secondary products), the reverse mapping causes the console to be shown when any of the games are viewed.","The definition module  may further allow a seller to manage the product bundle definitions. For example, a seller may view, modify, enable, disable, or delete one or more of the defined bundles.","An inventory module  monitors the inventory information concerning items available for sale by the seller. The seller may store his inventory information in an inventory database  that can be accessed by the API server . The inventory module  further accesses the bundle database  to determine which products are included in the product bundle definitions, and for each included product, whether the seller actually has a corresponding item available. For example, using the definition module , the seller may have previously defined a camera bundle as including portrait lenses and zoom lenses. However, the seller may have sold out of zoom lenses and therefore may no longer have those items to sell. In this case, the inventory module  accesses the inventory database , determines that the seller has no zoom lenses to sell, and excludes zoom lenses when presenting a camera bundle to a potential buyer.","In some instances, a seller may rank certain items assigned to the same product identifier to indicate which should be given preferable treatment for inclusion in a bundle. The items may be ranked according to price, condition, shipping costs, acquisition date, or the like. For example, new items may be given a rank of \u201c1\u201d and used items may be given a rank of \u201c2.\u201d The seller may indicate that the items in rank 1 are to be presented first, and when those are sold out, items in rank 2 are to be presented. The ranking may be used to ensure proper item rotation. As the seller acquires more items having the same product identifier to sell, the remaining items may be re-ranked.","In some embodiments, the seller may establish cross-bundling agreements with other sellers. For example, the seller may include a product in a product bundle definition that he does not have in inventory or that is frequently sold out. The other seller may sell the same product but have those items in inventory. In these instances, the seller may include the other seller's items in a bundle sold to a buyer. The cross-bundled items may be ranked in the seller's inventory database  so as to sell the seller's items before selling the other seller's items.","A pricing module  is configured to determine a price of a bundle based on a product bundle definition of the bundle accessed from the bundle database . The pricing is defined by the seller and may be based on the particular items selected by the buyer, the sum of the prices of the products added to the bundle, the number of products in the bundle, or other criteria. The pricing module  may apply one or more discounts or credits to the selected bundle. In some instances, the discounts or a value of the incentives may be proportionally applied according to the price of each item in the bundle.","A display module  provides interfaces to the seller and the buyer. The interfaces provided to the seller include bundle definition interfaces and inventory interfaces. The interfaces provided to the buyer include a view item page including an option to buy a bundle and pop-up windows to display information about bundled items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","200"]},"In an operation , a bundling interface is provided to the seller by, for example, the display module . Via the bundling interface, information used to define the bundle is received from the user. For example, in an operation , one or more identifiers assigned to one or more primary products are received.","In operation , identifiers of secondary products are received. In an optional operation , groups of the secondary products are defined. In some instances, operation  may be performed before operation . Operations  and  (or operations  and ) may be performed repeatedly to add multiple groups of secondary products.","In an operation , bundle pricing information is received. Operation  may further include receiving other incentives associated with the bundle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","200"]},"In an operation , a request is received for a view product interface of a primary product. The request may be received via a keyword search, a browsing session, a featured link, or the like. The view product interface includes, for example, a description of the product, one or more pictures of the product, information about the seller, price and shipping information, and bundle information.","In an operation , the bundles offered by the seller for the primary product are identified. The bundles actually being offered may depend on the start date or end date of previously defined bundles.","In an operation , the inventory database  is checked for the secondary items in the bundle. In an operation , the pricing for the bundles is determined.","In an operation , a view product interface is provided for display to a buyer. An example of a view product interface is provided in . The view product interface includes an option to buy a bundle and the secondary items that may be included in the bundle. The view product interface may include a link to a more detailed description of each secondary item, which may be shown in a pop-up window. The user may select one or more items to add to a bundle or specify a quantity of a secondary item to add to a bundle. The user may also specify a number of bundles to purchase via the interface. Items not in the seller's inventory but included in the definition of the bundle may be automatically excluded from the view product interface.","In an operation , the selection of the secondary items is received (including quantities) and, in an operation , the purchase of the bundled items is processed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","504","504","504"]},"A buying interface  displays a list of the primary product and of the selected secondary products. The buying interface may be updated each time a buyer changes a selection in the bundle interface . The buying interface  includes the discounted prices of the items in the bundle and applies any further discounts to the bundle as the secondary items are selected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU) a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a video display unit  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)). The computer system  also includes an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device  (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker), a network interface device , and may include a touchscreen (not shown).","The disk drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions (e.g., software ) embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein.
