{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/082,498 titled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Troubleshooting Subscribers on a Telecommunications Network\u201d filed Jul. 21, 2008. This application also claims benefit to PCT application PCT\/US09\/51300 filed Jul. 21, 2009.","The invention generally relates to telecommunications systems analysis. More particularly, the invention relates to a system, an apparatus and a method for collecting, analyzing, displaying and troubleshooting issues on service provider networks from the standpoint of troubleshooting issues that are subscriber-based.","Service provider networks consist of segments which are geographically distributed, and functions which are best viewed technically as a series of layers, typically based on the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. When service provider networks provided access to web and e-mail programs, troubleshooting was limited and fairly simple, as there was little or no interaction between the programs driving the user's experience on the internet and the signals being sent between computers to make that experience possible. With the advent of such technology that allows video, voice and other time and frequency-sensitive technologies to be sent over service provider networks, the need for a stable network with few or no dropped packets is critical.","The advent of broadband has led to a large number of dependencies on the network for the application's end-user's experience. This makes troubleshooting more complex because there are interdependencies between different operating groups within a service provider network.","An approach to troubleshooting such service provider networks for subscriber issues is to diagnose issues by leveraging the knowledge of each technician within each layer. The technician then troubleshoots each layer using each Element Management Server (EMS) or Command Line Interface (CLI) independently. Then the information between technicians is manually correlated through communication between technicians who are busy troubleshooting each network element.","This approach does not work well for distinguishing between problem-specific and subscriber-specific issues is difficult. First, if there is a problem with any layer of the service provider network, then there is no use troubleshooting any layer above that or any subscriber-based issues. But it would take multiple technicians to determine that there is a problem in a given layer. A problem in lower layers would propagate to higher layers, and so helping a subscriber would be fruitless. For instance, a subscriber connecting to an Internet Protocol (IP) Network will get an authentication failure or a connection timeout. This failure could be due to a transport network failure, failure of the Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) network element, or from the AAA server being down, and so on. Also all elements in layers below IP such as the Radio Frequency (RF) layer would show no failures.","Second, if it is determined that the service provider network is not working properly, it may or may not affect a given subscriber if that subscriber is not being routed through any of the failed network elements. Determination of the path a particular subscriber is using requires manual correlation of messages through various nodes.","Third, subscriber-specific issues require correlation of call flow or control messages from different network elements across the service provider network. One way to accomplish this correlation would be to have multiple technicians, each monitoring the layer associated with their expertise (RF, IP, Applications, etc), and then through manual communication troubleshoot the subscriber's issues. This is not an efficient use of resources as each technician has to perform some level of diagnostics before communicating with the others. Isolating a problem in a network around a specific subscriber then becomes both a time-consuming and resource-consuming process.","Fourth, as problems are found, vendors who have little time or motivation to write detailed explanations and troubleshooting guides instead return cryptic diagnostic codes to the operator via the EMS or the CLI. The technician must in the best case look it up in a book if to provide a human-readable explanation, in the worst case contact the vendor who then may need to find an engineer to look at the source code to determine what the diagnostic code means and possibly recommend a course of action.","Another issue is the scalability of the manual troubleshooting techniques. As the complexity of the network has grown, there is a need for more and more people to become involved in troubleshooting each subscriber's issues. As the number of subscribers increases, the use of more and more technicians to troubleshoot network problems will eventually use up the resources for a given problem. Further, a given network may have different implementations of a given element from different vendors, making the troubleshooting even more complex.","Broadly speaking, the present invention fills these needs by providing: methods, systems and computer readable media defining computer instructions for retrieving status information from active network elements of a service provider network, associating that status information with a subscriber session, call setup, or service, then displaying that information along with KPI or SLAs associated with the active elements.","It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, a device or a method.","The figures are provided in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The figures should not be construed as limiting the breath of the invention in any manner.","A method and apparatus for troubleshooting and diagnosing subscriber-based problems on a service provider network is disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be understood, however, by one of ordinary skill in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in details in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.","A service provider network includes a collection of interconnected service-affecting or subscriber-affecting nodes and logical links between those nodes. As used herein, the term \u2018subscriber-affecting node\u2019 is a component of a service provider network with which a subscriber has a direct interaction with, such as a node for applications or authentication. As used herein, the term \u2018service-affecting node\u2019 is a component of a service-provider network which is required to support a specific-service. Each subscriber-affecting or service-affecting node includes an interconnected set of homogeneous network elements which occupy IP addresses in a pre-defined range. As used herein, the term \u2018network element\u2019 means a facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service. A service provider network can be broken down geographically into a multiplicity of areas, such as a part of a city, a city, or part of a state. The area where the technicians who are assigned to troubleshoot an issue are starting from is referred to as the home area, the others are referred to as foreign areas. As used herein, the term \u2018node\u2019 without any qualifiers refers to either subscriber-affecting or service-affecting nodes.","Network elements may support one or more layers of the service provider network. Examples of layers typically supported by such a network are the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Internet Layer, and Session\/Application Layer. The service provider networks may be wireless, such as cellular networks, or wired, as in cable or Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) networks.","As used herein, the term \u2018logical link\u2019 is an interconnection between two nodes. The logical link may include one or more physical elements, such as switches or repeaters.","Each network element can be controlled or managed by an Element Management System (EMS). The EMS associated with a given network element is proprietary to the vendor that manufactures the network element, although the EMS for a given type of network element will provide the same or similar functionality to that of other vendor's EMS for the same type of network element.","Each EMS provides the same type of information as any other EMS, but the specific details will vary from one EMS to another. For instance, every EMS will provide information associated with that type of network element such as its unique identifier, its network identifier, its type, the manufacturer, and its' Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).","A network element can also be accessed through a proprietary command line interface (CLI). These communications links enable a trained specialist to troubleshoot issues on the network from the standpoint of the functionality offered by that network element. As each network element tends to process signals in one layer of the network signal model, a technician would tend to look at that layer of the service provider network across one or more network elements and network element types. Therefore, a technician diagnosing a problem in the Physical Layer would look at the network elements which process Radio Frequency (RF) signals, a technician whose job it is to diagnose problems in the Internet Protocol (IP) layer would look at network elements associated with the IP Layer and so on.","Further, most service provider networks are built on more than one vendor's products. This improves reliability but increases complexity as each technician must be trained on each EMS and CLI for each vendor's network element.","Service provider networks are accessed via Access Terminals (AT) such as computers or cell phones. A subscriber is a unique AT which is accessing the network over one or more subscriber sessions. A subscriber session is a time-bounded interaction with the network which begins with a sequence of messages called a call setup that is specific to the type of network (wireless, DSL, Cable) and that may end with a sequence of messages, a timeout, or some other network event which indicates the end of a call.","During call setup, a specific route through a series of network elements is defined for the call. The network elements that control this routing can be commanded to report the set of network elements within subscriber-affecting nodes used for the call, the time when the switching is performed, and the time when the call is ended. That way, the time of a specific subscriber session can be determined and the network elements associated with sessions can be associated with the specific session. Independent of the call setup reporting, network elements can be commanded to report status such as CPU utilization, status of process, bit error rate, and so on. This status information can be collected at regular intervals or on request if the call is being analyzed while it is active. This status information can be stored along with the call start and stop times and the set of network elements associated with the call. Once the session is correlated to the network elements and logical links it is routed through, the status of the network elements can be determined during the time frame of the call.","The system can also be setup such that when a specific subscriber connects during a specified timeframe, more detailed or frequent status collection from those associated network elements is executed.","In one or more embodiments, the data associated with the subscriber sessions, including start time, end time and routing information is stored in a database. In one or more embodiments, the data associated with the status of each network element is associated with that element and time-stamped. The data associated with the subscriber session can then be correlated with the status of the network elements within the subscriber-affecting nodes.","In one or more embodiments, the apparatus will provide multiple types of views of the network. In one or more embodiments, a user can change his view of the network from one view type to another to view different parts of the network in different contexts and gain specific information necessary to troubleshoot that part of the network. The Unified Service View shows a topology of al network elements and server used in supporting services such as VoIP, Video, Gaming, and enabling subscriber sessions. The Subscriber View narrows this topology to only those specific network elements and servers that enable a subscriber session. A Transport View shows the specific network elements which logically connect two service nodes. In one or more embodiments, the transport view may be limited to showing the path for a specific protocol such as BGP, Layer3 (router view), Layer2 (switching view) or VLAN view.","The Unified Service View enables the operator to discover and display subscriber service-affecting network elements. The Unified Service View shows an interconnected collection of subscriber-affecting or service-affecting nodes and logical links. Note that a subscriber-affecting node which consists of a single network element is shown on all views as just that network element to avoid confusion. As shown in , the view of the network focuses on the different network layers , , . Each layer processes a specific type of signal with specific characteristics. For instance, RF layer  processes radio signals, IP layer  processes TCP\/IP or similar digital signals and the application layer  processes requests to custom applications such as VoIP . An engineer called in to troubleshoot a problem would most likely focus on a layer at a time as shown in . For instance, a technician working on the Radio Network Controller (RNC) EMS  in the RF layer  communicates with other technicians working on other layers ,  as he gathers new information.","Through the Unified Service View, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and service-affecting parameters such as routing hops can be displayed and monitored. The Unified Service View can be used by an operator to identify and isolate issues that can impact subscriber services.","Failure of a network element can then be defined through KPIs, the status of critical software processes, or the status of critical hardware components. The failure of a logical link can be defined in terms of ranges of values that measurements should fall into. These measurements include but are not limited to routing hops, round trip delay, link utilization, and last activity monitoring. Last activity monitoring is, for a well-balanced network, the expected time between the receipt of certain service-related messages that should be flowing across a link; too long a delay could indicate a failure of a component.","A narrow view of the service provider network by layers would independently show whether or not it is functional for that layer ,,,, as shown as . For instance, if the Session layer  were down, then anything in the Application layer  would fail, although diagnostics would show that all of the software within each network element was functional. In a Unified Service View of the service provider network, having any lower level network layer fail would mean that the upper levels would fail, regardless of whether or not there were issues with that layer.","An embodiment of the Unified Service View of the service provider network is shown in . The Unified Service View shows each subscriber-affecting or service-affecting node and associated transport links. For example, a particular subscriber-affecting node may be functional on all layers or just up to some layer. Knowing quickly that specific subscriber-affecting nodes are down would reduce diagnostics significantly, since no subscriber analysis would help if a subscriber-affecting node that a subscriber goes through is down.","In one embodiment an operator would login successfully and select the Unified Service View. The current operator would be shown , with access to different features dependent on whom that operator is. Initially, there would be a list of operator views limited to views of the known service provider network areas , as no call flows or subscribers had been declared. The known service provider network is captured based on some stored \u201cseed\u201d configuration information provided by an operator. This configuration information would include the IP address or range of IP addresses, access layer type such as Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and security code associated with the primary network element type of that service provider network type, such as a PDSN for a wireless network. The system would then attempt to make contact and identify the set of PDSNs in order to obtain information about that network element as well as the network elements that they connect to. In one embodiment, the information about what type of network elements each network element connects to is contained in a model called the Network Model. The Network Model defines the interconnection between generic element types, the types specifically identified for each type of network (wireless 3G, cable, DSL, etc). Based on the model, the process can query other network elements for information about themselves and the elements they connect to, and so forth. In one or more embodiments, the path which a particular session or call trace travels through can be emphasized for display to the user , , , . In other embodiments, only those paths and the elements which are interconnected by them associated with a particular session or call trace are displayed.","In another embodiment, the information that is being displayed can be formatted into a message for transfer to an external system for processing or display.","Sequence for discovering and building a network topology is as follows. The operator enters the security information required to access the network. For each subscriber-affecting or service-affecting node, the operator enters the network element type, the IP addresses or range of addresses, and whether the element is home (part of the home area) or foreign (part of another area) into a stored configuration. Once the information is entered, only if a range of IP addresses was given, the software performs a ping, ssh, and secure FTP (sftp) on all elements entered to validate the connections. If a unique IP address was given the IP address is assumed to be correct. Another embodiment would use software like SNMPGet to validate the connection. The software will then query each network element through its CLI or EMS to determine the topology of the network around it. The software would then query and display the input, output, and management port IP addresses associated with each element, as well as vendor type (if available). The software could capture and display latency and packet delays between each pair of elements in the network. Typical delays calculated would be the delay between the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the RNC, the delay between the RNC and the PDSN, the delay between the PDSN and Home Agent (HA), and the delay between the HA and AT. In one embodiment, the operator can select two network elements and enter the maximum allowed delay between them, which can then be compared to the current delays to indicate a network problem.","The apparatus communicates with the EMS for each element through a standardized Application Programming Interface (API), or standardized CLI. This way, it is possible for third party diagnostic tools to be added to the part of the apparatus that drives the various views to extend the functionality provided by this invention.","Further, the access layer is separated from the API such that access to the EMS is protocol-independent, again making it cost effective to support third-party software and extend the system as needed.","A subscriber is declared  and searched for . The subscriber can be declared in any way that the service provider network would understand it. Typically this declaration is either an IP address or a Network Access Identifier (NAI). The search for a subscriber is executed using an algorithm that starts with the Home network elements, only going to the foreign elements if the subscriber cannot be found. In one embodiment the operator can limit the search to one or more areas of the network. In one embodiment, if the subscriber cannot be found in either the home or foreign areas of the service-provider network, then a message could be displayed to the operator indicating that the subscriber cannot be found or that the subscriber is not connected to the network. In another embodiment, the operator is prompted to search foreign network elements before doing so to make the search more efficient (ie. If the operator knows where the subscriber is and that he should be picked up by the home network, then no use continuing the search).","If the subscriber can be found, he would be placed in a list associated with the network area which is associated with the subscriber-affecting nodes his signal is passing through . At that point the subscriber sessions would be available to be analyzed. The time window during which subscriber sessions are available are dependent on the configuration of the system as to the amount of data held for processing. For a given subscriber, one could then analyze the call setup  associated with each subscriber session . At any time, an operator can enter a journal entry , which can later be correlated to specific events that are happening within the service provider network or for a specific subscriber. The Unified Service View shows one or more subscriber-affecting nodes  and logical links . A subscriber-affecting node is a container  for one or more network elements  which may be shown within each subscriber-affecting node. In one embodiment, a subscriber-affecting node containing a single network element may be shown as if the network element were directly connected to the network. In one embodiment, the level of detail shown on the Unified Service View may be modified, so that routing hops between logical links may or may not be displayed  and the latency across each logical link is also either displayed or not displayed .","In one embodiment, when a subscriber session  is selected on the Unified Service View, the logical links and network elements associated with that subscriber session are emphasized on the display to show the network elements and links associated with that particular subscriber session.  shows an embodiment of that display. It also shows how one can select a specific element and get more details on it. In this instance, a PDSN labeled p_pdsn is selected  and the details appear in the bottom of the screen, including the name of the element selected . The information displayed will vary with the element selected and is configured in the stored software configuration. In this example the AT information is specific to the PDSN . For all elements there will be IP interfaces , software status , hardware status , KPI , and Notes , which gets updated when notes are added using the journal  while the element  is selected.","In one embodiment, one can configure the Unified Service View to provide a snapshot of the current network delays, or continuous monitoring over a period of hours or days.","The subscriber view allows one to view a portion of the entire service provider network limited to that portion which the subscriber signals travel through for a specific subscriber session. In one embodiment, the operator selects a subscriber session from a list of specific subscribers who he searched for and found on the network, then on selecting the subscriber, only the nodes and links from the display that the particular subscriber is using are shown in the subscriber view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","602","619","603","620","621"]},"Also shown in  is an embodiment of the details associated with a subscriber on a wireless service provider network. This includes information about the AT , subscriber Session information , information about any timers associated with this subscriber , traffic shaping , and any notes which are made during this diagnostic session , time stamped through the journal . The information about the AT  would include assigned IP, manufacturer type, and software version. The subscriber session information  would include the start  and end time  of the subscriber session, the duration of the subscriber session , the IP address of the PCF , the IP address of the PDSN , the IP address of the Foreign Agent (FA) , the IP address of the HA , the session type as a standard representation such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Mobile Internet Protocol (MIP) and the IP address of the AAA . The timer information  would include an inactivity timer, lifetime timer, MIP re-registration timer.","The Call Setup Time View enables one to view the sequence of messages associated with a call setup for a particular subscriber session. It does this by auto-correlating subscriber call messages from different network elements including VoIP and SIP messages to determine the messages associated with a particular call and its sequence. In one embodiment, the Call Setup Time View displays the actual and delay budget times for each message. The results are displayed to the operator in correlated views, as shown in .","The first part of the view  shows the sequence of messages, including the identification of the message  and the time it took to be processed . In another embodiment, time since start of call setup could be shown as well. In another embodiment, the time budgeted (or time over which an error may have occurred) can be displayed as well.","The second part of the view shows the details of the message currently selected in the first view. If the message was successful, this may just be the summary . If it failed, it could be the status , or the status  and the troubleshooting information, and the details of the failed response. The troubleshooting information can include help , which details what went wrong, and suggested resolution , which gives the operator details of how to resolve this problem. The operator may select to display the summary , message detail , help , and suggested resolution  at any time by selecting one or more of these at these selectors.","In one or more embodiments, the call setup information can come from messages from the PDSN and HA in a wireless environment, the BRoadband Access Server element (BRAS) in a non-wireless environment, and every other network element which enables subscriber sessions such as RNC, AAA, and the Policy Server. The messages are captured via components which monitor the element traffic and placed into stored logs. The data can either be searched for via stored logs or displayed via a trigger.","In one or more embodiments,the Call Setup View would capture the following messages during call setup: The Data Link Layer messages between the RNC and PDSN; Data Link Layer messages between the AT and PDSN for wireless networks such as Point-To-Point (PPP) and Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) messages, or messages between the Home Customer-Provided Equipment (CPE) and BRAS; application related messages between AT and PDSN or AT and SIP Server; SIP\/MIP messages between PDSN and HA; MIP messages between AT and HA; AAA messages between PDSN and AAA server; AAA messages between HA and AAA server; SIP messages between the AT and SIP Server; and policy messages between the policy enforcer (PDSN) and Policy server.","Every protocol has its own set of error codes associated with it, which may or may not be documented. Some error codes are defined by a standards body such as 3GPP, 3GPP2, IETF, and RFC's. The standards' codes will have some documentation associated with them. In addition, there will also be vendor-specific codes that may or may not be documented. During the call setup process, a network element may generate a protocol-specific error code and may not provide any details or plausible explanation. The knowledgebase is used to translate the cryptic protocol messages into English, along with providing suggestions that can be used to rectify the error. One embodiment would include separate fields for a description of the problem, cause of the problem, and how to troubleshoot the problem. Another embodiment would allow operators to update the knowledge base with information they discover as they troubleshoot as well as being able to use content provided by other sources.","The knowledge base is stored on computer-readable media. When an error code is contained in a message intercepted from an EMS or a response to a CLI command, the apparatus makes a request to the knowledge base to get a human-readable message to display to the operator. Depending on operator settings, this message could include a multiplicity of fields of different types of information associated with the error code. In one embodiment, the display of different types of information is selectable by the operator.","One embodiment would be a read-only media that can be updated on a subscription basis. Another embodiment could be storage on writeable media where an operator may update it. Another embodiment could be storage on a writeable media where it can be updated via the Internet and\/or an operator.","As shown in , the product can be implemented as a set of functional modules. These modules are described as functional units; there is no implication that these modules must be physically separate components. For convenience, the functions are described in four logical areas; Core , Frontend , Backend , and Access . The Core functions  control the interactions between the operator and the apparatus, acting as a coordinator between the operator and the various other functions in the process. Frontend modules  are primarily modules which translate information received and processed from the EMS into operator display information. Backend modules  translate requests from the user into protocol-independent calls to the EMS and protocol-independent responses from the EMS into information for the Frontend modules to use to create displays. Access modules  are used to translate the protocol-independent requests into protocol-dependent ones, and visa versa.","The Core Framework  implements the UI controller functionality, to enable to user interface to communicate with the logic and which in turn communicates with the network elements of the service provider network via the EMS associated with each network element type.","The Security Module  provides control over access to the functions and configuration of the apparatus.","The Topology View Module  provides the translation of the service provider network information provided by the Topology Discovery Module  into information needed to display the Unified Service View of the service provider network.","The Call Setup Flow View Module  processes information to create a call setup display as shown in .","The Subscriber Info Module  tries to find the subscriber within a specific network using the Subscriber Discovery module . If the Subscriber Discovery  module locates a subscriber, it is either reported back to the display controller via the Core Framework  as a set of elements that the subscriber session is related to. If the subscriber could not be found in the area or areas of the service provider network, a notification is sent back to the display controller via the Core Framework .","The Admin Module  is used to handle application specific requests, like adding or modifying operators and creating or updating the configuration of network definitions.","The Topology Discovery Module  requests information from several network elements based on the Topology Model  to determine what subscriber-affecting and service-affecting nodes are active and how they are connected.","The Call Trace Collection Module  consists of a set of components which collects messages associated with a subscriber session and logs them. Messages associated with the Call Setup are routed to this module from the Access Modules . The Call Trace Collection Module  filters received messages associated with the desired subscriber(s) and then the remaining messages are correlated with each subscriber and the other messages associated with the call setup.","The Data Flow Collection Module  captures QoS data flows from the service-provider network. Appropriate messages from the Access Modules are routed to the Data Flow Collection Module and then to the QOS Data Flow View Module .","The Subscriber Discovery Module  uses the Subscriber Model  to find the subscriber in a given area or set of areas within the service provider network. The network elements associated with the subscriber as defined by the Subscriber Model  are queried to determine if the subscriber is actively using these elements.","The Subscriber Model  describes the environment around a subscriber as a set of elements. For example, a subscriber in a wireless network might be defined at any given time through a PDSN element, which in turn is linked to a specific HA and other elements. One embodiment is to define the model as a Common Information Model (CIM) model based on the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) Standard.","The Topology Model  consists of a set of data models which describe the generic model of a subscriber network to enable the views to be put together based on the presumed connectivity of the elements as defined by the model.","The Operator Model  is the model associated with the model-view-controller (MVC) definition of the various views displayed to the operator.","The Measurement Collection Module  collects data such as delay times to compare to threshold values preset by operators in stored configuration data. This data can then be used to determine if values are above threshold values and so create some error condition.","Access modules  translate protocol-independent requests into PDSN , SSH  and SNMP  requests and accept responses from those protocols and return protocol-independent responses. One or more embodiments of the PDSN Access module  is a special case of the SSH Access Module  but because it is critical it is given separate consideration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["901","902","906","902","904","907","904","905","908","909","910","903","901","902","911","902","903","913","903","914","915"]},"The processing which occurs around the call setup flow is shown in . Data is collected from the network elements  through various network sources  via modules which capture messages to and from the PDSN , HA , RNC , AAA , and VOIP . Messages may also originate from external sources, such as databases containing historical data or a file generated from a third party package to simulate message traffic. These messages are then routed to event logs . Triggers may have been defined by one or more active operators to capture event log messages as they are being stored and sent to the Callflow Controller . Other times, these messages may be requested from the Callflow Controller  as a query against the existing Event Logs . In either case, the logs go through a correlator  which aligns messages based on their time relative to the occurrence of a any message known to be part of the call flow. If there are failures in the messages, the messages are processed with the stored information in the knowledge database to match up the event code of the message, the element type and vendor of the EMS from where the message originated with the description, help, and suggest fields in the knowledge database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1101","1102","1103","1104","1102","418","406"]},"In one or more embodiments, programming instructions for executing above described methods and systems are provided.
