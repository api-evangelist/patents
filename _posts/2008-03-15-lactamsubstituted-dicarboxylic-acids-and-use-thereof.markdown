{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel lactam-substituted dicarboxylic acid derivatives, processes for their preparation, their use for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, and their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for the treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of heme. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","Some substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been described in recent years, such as, for example, 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1, Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223, WO 98\/16507 and WO 98\/23619).","The above-described stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase stimulate the enzyme either directly via the heme group (carbon monoxide, nitric oxide or diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate) by interacting with the iron center of the heme group and a change in conformation which results therefrom and leads to an increase in the enzymic activity [Gerzer et al., 132 (1981), 71] or via a heme-dependent mechanism which is independent of NO but leads to a potentiation of the stimulating effect of NO or CO [e.g. YC-1, Hoenicka et al., 77 (1999) 14; or the pyrazole derivatives described in WO 98\/16223, WO 98\/16507 and WO 98\/23619].","It has not been possible to confirm the stimulating effect, asserted in the literature, of isoliquiritigenin and of fatty acids such as, for example, of arachidonic acid, prostaglandin endoperoxides and fatty acid hydroperoxides on soluble guanylate cyclase [cf., for example, Hoenicka et al., 77 (1999), 14].","If the heme group is removed from soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme still shows a detectable basal catalytic activity, i.e. cGMP is still produced. The remaining basal catalytic activity of the heme-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the aforementioned known stimulators.","Stimulation of heme-free soluble guanylate cyclase by protoporphyrin IX has been described [Ignarro et al., 26 (1994), 35]. However, protoporphyrin IX can be regarded as a mimic of the NO-heme adduct, which is why addition of protoporphyrin IX to soluble guanylate cyclase ought to lead to production of a structure of the enzyme corresponding to the heme-containing soluble guanylate cyclase which is stimulated by NO. This is also verified by the fact that the stimulating effect of protoporphyrin IX is increased by the NO-independent but heme-dependent stimulator YC-1 described above [M\u00fclsch et al., 355, R47].","In contrast to the above-described stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, the compounds of the present invention are able to activate both the heme-containing and the heme-free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. Thus, with these novel activators, the enzyme is stimulated via a heme-independent pathway, which is also verified by the facts that the novel activators firstly show no synergistic effect with NO on the heme-containing enzyme, and secondly the effect of these novel activators cannot be blocked by the heme-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazole-(4,3-a)-quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) [Schmidt et al., 116 (2006), 2552; Stasch et al., 5 (2006), 755].","EP 0 341 551-A1 discloses alkenoic acid derivatives as leucotriene antagonists for the treatment of disorders of the circulatory and respiratory systems. WO 01\/19355, WO 01\/19776, WO 01\/19778, WO 01\/19780, WO 02\/070462 and WO 02\/070510 describe dicarboxylic acid and amino dicarboxylic acid derivatives as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. However, it has emerged that these compounds have disadvantages in relation to their pharmacokinetic properties, such as, in particular, a low bioavailability and\/or an only short duration of action after oral administration.","It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase but do not have the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art compounds.","This object is achieved by the compounds described in the present invention. These compounds differ structurally in comparison with the compounds of the prior art by a 3-(carboxybenzyl)- or 3-(carboxyphenethyl)-5-phenylpent-4-en-1-ylbenzoic acid core structure combined with a lactam or lactam-like side chain.","The present invention relates specifically to compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"40.47mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08217063-20120710-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"A represents a group of the formula"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"17.19mm","wi":"20.74mm","file":"US08217063-20120710-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["* represents the point of attachment to group E,","Rrepresents (C-C)-alkyl or phenyl,","x represents the number 0, 1 or 2,\n        \n        ","y represents the number 2, 3 or 4,\n        \n        "]}},"E represents (C-C)-alkanediyl, (C-C)-alkenediyl or (C-C)-alkynediyl, each of which may be mono- or polysubstituted by fluorine,","m represents the number 1 or 2,","R, Rand Rindependently of one another represent a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen, (C-C)-alkyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethoxy, cyano and nitro,","and","n, o and p independently of one another each represent the number 0, 1 or 2,\n    \n    "]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, the compounds which are encompassed by formula (I) and are of the formulae mentioned hereinafter, and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, and the compounds which are encompassed by formula (I) and are mentioned hereinafter as exemplary embodiments, and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, insofar as the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and mentioned hereinafter are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","The compounds according to the invention may, depending on their structure, exist in stereoisomeric forms (enantiomers, diastereomers).

The telemetry system makes it possible to record continuously the blood pressure and heart rate on conscious animals in their usual habitat.","The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SH rats) with a body weight of >200 g. After transmitter implantation, the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water. The day\/night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6.00 in the morning and at 19.00 in the evening.","The telemetry transmitters (TAM PA-C40, DSI) as employed are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be employed repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.","For the implantation, the fasted animals are anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Sanofi, 50 mg\/kg i.p.) and shaved and disinfected over a large area on the side of the abdomen. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fastened with tissue glue (VetBonD\u2122, 3M). The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle, and layered closure of the wound is performed. An antibiotic (Tardomyocel COMP, Bayer, 1 ml\/kg s.c.) is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.","Outline of Experiment:","The substances to be investigated are administered orally by gavage in each case to a group of animals (n=6). The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures, or suspended in 0.5% strength Tylose, appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml\/kg of body weight. A solvent-treated group of animals is employed as control.","The telemetry measuring unit is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number.","Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna (1010 Receiver, DSI). The implanted transmitters can be activated from outside by means of an incorporated magnetic switch and are switched to transmission in the run-up to the experiment. The emitted signals can be detected online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for Windows, DSI) and be appropriately processed. The data are stored in each case in a file bearing the experiment number which is open for this purpose.","In the standard procedure, the following are measured for 10-second periods in each case: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP), (2) diastolic blood pressure (DBP), (3) mean arterial pressure (MAP) and (4) heart rate (HR).","Measurement acquisition is repeated under computer control at 5-minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure and stored in individual data. Further technical details are given in the documentation of the manufacturing company (DSI).","The test substances are administered at 9.00 h on the day of the experiment. Following the administration, the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours. After the end of the experiment, the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. Analysis). The void value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration of the substance, so that the selected data set includes the period from 7.00 h on the day of the experiment to 9.00 h on the following day.","The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average (15-minute average, 30-minute average) and transferred as text file to a storage medium. The measurements presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated.","The compounds according to the invention can be converted into pharmaceutical preparations in the following ways:","Tablet:","Composition:","100 mg of the compound according to the invention, 50 mg of lactose (monohydrate), 50 mg of maize starch (native), 10 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 25) (from BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and 2 mg of magnesium stearate.","Tablet weight 212 mg, diameter 8 mm, radius of curvature 12 mm","Production:","A mixture of compound according to the invention, lactose and starch is granulated with a 5% strength solution (m\/m) of the PVP in water. The granules are dried and mixed with the magnesium stearate for 5 minutes. This mixture is compressed in a conventional tablet press (see above for format of the tablet). A guideline compressive force for the compression is 15 kN.","Suspension which can be Administered Orally:","Composition:","1000 mg of the compound according to the invention, 1000 mg of ethanol (96%), 400 mg of Rhodigel\u00ae (xanthan gum from FMC, Pennsylvania, USA) and 99 g of water.","10 ml of oral suspension correspond to a single dose of 100 mg of the compound according to the invention.","Production:","The Rhodigel is suspended in ethanol, and the compound according to the invention is added to the suspension. The water is added while stirring. The mixture is stirred for about 6 h until the swelling of the Rhodigel is complete.","Solution which can be Administered Orally:","Composition:","500 mg of the compound according to the invention, 2.5 g of polysorbate and 97 g of polyethylene glycol 400.20 g of oral solution correspond to a single dose of 100 mg of the compound according to the invention.","Production:","The compound according to the invention is suspended in the mixture of polyethylene glycol and polysorbate with stirring. The stirring process is continued until the compound according to the invention has completely dissolved.","I.V.-Solution:","The compound according to the invention is dissolved in a concentration below the saturation solubility in a physiologically tolerated solvent (e.g. isotonic saline, 5% glucose solution and\/or 30% PEG 400 solution). The solution is sterilized by filtration and used to fill sterile and pyrogen-free injection containers."],"DETDESC":[{},{}],"heading":["A.
