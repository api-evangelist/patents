No. 60\/810,078, filed Jun. 1, 2006. Each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the detection and characterization of nucleic acid molecules (e.g., RNA (e.g., small RNAs such as micro RNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)) and other short nucleic acid molecules). More particularly, the present invention relates to methods for the detection and quantification of RNA expression. The present invention further provides for the detection of miRNA and siRNA mutants (e.g., deletion mutants) and variants.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of noncoding RNAs, which are encoded as short inverted repeats in the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates (Ambros, (2001) Cell 107, 823-826; Moss (2002) Curr. Biol. 12, R138-R140). miRNAs are modulators of target mRNA translation and stability, although most target mRNAs remain to be identified. miRNAs sequence-specifically control translation of target mRNAs by binding to sites of antisense complementarity in 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (Ambros, supra; Moss, supra; Lagos-Quintana et al., (2001) Science 294, 853-858; Lau et al., (2001) Science 294, 858-862; Lee et al., (2001) Science 294, 862-864). mRNAs may also inhibit gene expression by other mechanisms (See, e.g., Pillai et al., Science 309, 1573-1576 (2005); Humphreys et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102, 16961-16966 (2005)).","Several miRNAs, such as let-7 RNA, miR-1, miR-34, miR-60, and miR-87, are highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, implicating that they may recognize multiple sites and\/or multiple targets of presumably conserved function (Lagos-Quintana et al., supra; Lau et al., supra; Lee et al., supra; Pasquinelli et al., (2000) Nature 408:86). The small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) lin-4 and let-7 represent a subclass of miRNAs identified by genetic analysis in , which are developmentally regulated and themselves control developmental programs, such as timing of neuronal rewiring, Dauer larva formation, vulva formation, and the terminal differentiation of hypodermal cells.","miRNAs are typically excised from 60- to 70-nucleotide foldback RNA precursor structures, which are sometimes detected at the onset of miRNA precursor expression (Grishok et al., (2001) Cell 106, 23-34; Hutvagner et al. (2001) Science 93, 834-838; Ketting et al., (2001) Genes Dev. 15, 2654-2659) or during expression of very abundant miRNAs (Lagos-Quintana et al., supra; Lau et al., supra; Lee et al., supra). Generally, only one of the strands of the hairpin precursor molecule is excised and accumulates, presumably because it is protected by associated proteins from RNA degradation. These putative proteins may mediate the translational suppression. The miRNA precursor processing reaction requires Dicer RNase III and Argonaute family members (Grishok et al., supra; Hutvagner et al., supra; Ketting et al., supra).","In addition to their impact on gene expression, small RNAs, (e.g., siRNAs or miRNAs in the range of 18-25 nucleotides), may find utility in areas of therapeutics and drug discovery (e.g. as drug targets or as pharmaceutical agents). Thus, in some circumstances, it is important to know approximately how much of each miRNA exists in cells (e.g., before, during or after therapy).","Furthermore, deletions and downregulation of miRNA genes have been associated with cancer (e.g., B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)), providing a need in the art to be able to detect and characterize miRNA expression (See, e.g., Calin et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, 15524-15529 (2002). In some cases, it may also be important to compare levels of miRNA in different tissue types or before and after application of a stimulus, e.g. a chemical or physical intervention.","Because related siRNAs and miRNAs may be present in low amounts in cells, it is desirable that methods of detection be both sensitive and specific. Moreover, for certain applications, it may be beneficial to identify methods suitable for high throughput screening, e.g. homogeneous methods, multiplexed methods, or those suitable to highly parallel automated manipulation and limited temperature changes.","Although miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of gene expression, effective techniques for the detection and quantitation of miRNA expression are lacking. Methods used for quantitation of miRNAs have been based on gel electrophoresis. The miRNAs are detected either by Northern blotting or by the presence of radioactive RNase-resistant duplexes. Northern blotting and chip hybridization methods have relatively low analytical sensitivity (Krichevsky et al. 2003), so microgram quantities of RNA are needed for analyses; moreover, transfer of small RNAs to filters can introduce problems with reproducibility of quantitation and is not typically amendable to high-throughput. Moreover, detection methods based on RNase resistance require highly radioactive probes. Further, assays based solely on probe hybridization may not provide adequate discrimination between isotypes closely related in sequence. Alternative approaches involve cloning the miRNAs and then sequencing the inserts. While this approach may be suitable for discriminating single-base differences between closely related miRNA species, it is time consuming and laborious.","Like miRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small RNA molecules involved in cell defense, e.g. against viral RNA, via a response termed RNA interference (RNAi) (Cullen, B. R., Nature Immunology, 3: 597-599 (2002)). One class of siRNAs is produced through the action of the Dicer enzyme and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) protein complex as part of the RNAi response to the presence of double stranded RNA in cells (Khvorova, A. et al., Cell 115: 209-216 (2003)). Another class of siRNAs is synthetic and encompasses short duplexes, usually 21-23 nt with characteristic dinucleotide overhangs (Elbashir, S. M. et al., EMBO J. 20: 6877-6888 (2001)) introduced directly into cells via transfection or expression from an introduced vector (Paul, C. P. et al., Nature Biotechnology 20: 505-508 (2002), US Patent Application Publication No. 2003\/0148519A1, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). In some cases, siRNAs appear to persist as defined sequences, making them analogous in function and composition to miRNAs (Elbashir, S. M. et al., supra). Efficient and accurate methods of detecting and characterizing (e.g., quantitating) miRNA and siRNA levels are needed.","The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the detection and characterization of nucleic acid molecules (e.g., RNA (e.g., small RNAs such as micro RNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)) and other short nucleic acid molecules. More particularly, the present invention relates to improved methods for the detection and characterization (e.g., quantification) of RNA expression.","For example, the present invention provides a method, comprising: hybridizing at least one nucleic acid (e.g., that contains sequence that is not complementary to the interfering RNA) to a interfering RNA target to generate a detection structure and detecting the detection structure. In some embodiments, the interfering RNA target is an miRNA. In other embodiments, the interfering RNA target is an siRNA. In some embodiments, the siRNA is double stranded.","In some embodiments, the detection structure comprises an invasive cleavage structure. For example, in some embodiments, the nucleic acid comprises first and second oligonucleotides configured to form an invasive cleavage structure in combination with the miRNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid comprises a first oligonucleotide configured to form an invasive cleavage structure in combination with said miRNA. In some embodiments, the first oligonucleotide comprises a 5\u2032 portion and a 3\u2032 portion, wherein said 3\u2032 portion is configured to hybridize to said target sequence, and wherein said 5\u2032 portion is configured to not hybridize to said target sequence. In some embodiments employing a second oligonucleotide, the second oligonucleotide comprises a 5\u2032 portion and a 3\u2032 portion, wherein said 5\u2032 portion is configured to hybridize to said target sequence, and wherein said 3\u2032 portion is configured to not hybridize to said target sequence. In some embodiments, the detecting step comprises use of an INVADER assay.","In some embodiments, the detection structure comprises a circular oligonucleotide hybridized to said small RNA to generate a circular detection structure. In some embodiments, the detecting step comprises use of a rolling circle replication assay.","In some embodiments, the detection structure comprises a nucleic acid molecule with a free 3\u2032-OH group that is extended by a polymerase (e.g., template dependent extension) and the extended sequence is directly or indirectly detected.","In some embodiments, the detecting step(s) comprises use of a detection assay including, but not limited to, sequencing assays, polymerase chain reaction assays, hybridization assays, hybridization assays employing a probe complementary to a mutation, microarray assays, bead array assays, primer extension assays, enzyme mismatch cleavage assays, branched hybridization assays, NASBA assays, molecular beacon assays, cycling probe assays, ligase chain reaction assays, invasive cleavage structure assays, ARMS assays, and sandwich hybridization assays. In some preferred embodiments, the detecting step is carried out in cell lysate.","In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention comprise detecting a second nucleic acid target. In some preferred embodiments, the second nucleic acid target is RNA. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the second nucleic acid target is U6 RNA or GAPDH mRNA.","In some embodiments, the nucleic acid used to form the detection structure comprises a template with one or more sites sufficiently complementary to the small RNA so as to allow the RNA to hybridize to the template and be extended in an extension reaction. In some embodiments, the extension reaction is a polymerase chain reaction wherein one or more RNAs are used as primers in the polymerase chain reaction. In some such embodiments, a single type of RNA binds to two locations on the template to provide the polymerase chain reaction primers. In other embodiments, two or more RNAs are used as primers. In such embodiments, the detection of an amplification product signifies the presence of the two or more RNAs in the sample (i.e., an miRNA multiplex assay). Similar methods may be employed in a ligase chain reaction where the miRNAs are used as the ligated oligonucleotide(s). In some embodiments, the RNA is used as a template for modification of a detection complex by extension of a primer across at least part of the RNA template.","In some embodiments, the method comprises detection of a plurality of miRNAs. In some such embodiments, the plurality of miRNAs comprises polymorphisms of the same miRNA. In other embodiments, the plurality of miRNAs comprises different miRNAs (e.g., Let-7, miR-1, miR-1d, miR-135, miR-15, miR-16, miR-124a, or miR125b).","The present invention also provides kits for conducting any of the above methods. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides kits comprising a nucleic acid configured for forming a detection structure when hybridized to an RNA target sequence. In some embodiments, the kits are configured to detect an miRNA. In some preferred embodiments, kits are configured to detect a Let-7, miR-1, miR-135, miR-15, miR-16, miR-1b, miR-124a, or miR125b miRNA. In some preferred embodiments, kits are configured to co-detect a second RNA target with an miRNA target.","The present invention also provides a method for detecting a miRNA target, comprising providing (i) a miRNA target; (ii) a first unlabled oligonucleotide; (iii) a second unlabeled oligonucleotide; (iv) a reverse transcriptase; (v) a polymerase; and (vi) a probe oligonucleotide; incubating (i) through (vi) under conditions such that a detection structure forms; and detecting the detection structure. In some embodiments, the first unlabeled oligonucleotide comprises a first region that is complementary to the miRNA target and a second region that is not complementary to the miRNA target. In some embodiments, the second unlabeled oligonucleotide comprises a first region that is complementary to a second region of the miRNA target and a second region that is not complementary to the second region of the miRNA target. In some embodiments, detecting comprises forming an invasive cleavage structure, cleaving the invasive cleavage structure, and detecting the cleavage of the invasive cleavage structure. In some embodiments, said incubating further comprises incubating with an enzyme capable of cleaving a detection structure and lacking polymerase activity. In some embodiments, the enzyme is a 5\u2032 nuclease, while in some embodiments, the enzyme comprises a FEN-1 nuclease. In some embodiments, cleaving the invasive cleavage structure occurs at a temperature of between 45\u00b0 C. and 60\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, cleaving the invasive cleavage structure occurs at a temperature of approximately 50\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the first unlabled oligonucleotide is used as a primer for reverse transcription. In some embodiments, the first unlabled oligonucleotide is used as an INVADER oligonucleotide in an invasive cleavage reaction. In some embodiments, (i) through (vi) are present within the same reaction vessel. In some embodiments, the method further comprises providing (vii) a second probe oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the first unlabeled oligonucleotide and the reverse transcriptase reverse transcribe the miRNA target. In some embodiments, the reverse transcribed miRNA target (i.e., an miRNA cDNA target) is amplified by the first unlabeled oligonucleotide and the second unlabeled oligonucleotide and the DNA polymerase in a polymerase chain reaction. In some embodiments, the amplified reverse transcribed miRNA target forms a detection structure in the presence of the probe oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the first unlabeled oligonucleotide comprises nucleic acid sequence such that a duplex of about 6-7 base pairs is formed between the oligonucleotide and the miRNA target. The present invention is capable of detecting miRNA present in very small copy numbers. For example, in some embodiments, less than 200 copies of miRNA in a sample are detected. In some embodiments, less than 100 copies of miRNA in a sample are detected. In some embodiments, the second unlabeled oligonucleotide comprises nucleic acid sequence such that a duplex of about 9 base-pairs is formed between the oligonucleotide and the miRNA target.

In some embodiment, the method further comprises providing (vii) an oligonucleotide complementary to a region of the second unlabeled oligonucleotide probe. In some embodiments, cleaving the invasive cleavage structure at a temperature of approximately 50\u00b0 C. permits high fidelity discrimination of target sequences, although other temperatures may be selected based on sequence, buffer components, etc. for optimum performance. In some embodiments, the target sequences comprise variant miRNAs of a single species. In some embodiments, increasing the concentration of the probe oligonucleotide increases the sensitivity of detecting the miRNA target. In some embodiments, two or more miRNAs are detected. In some embodiments, detecting comprises use of a labeled probe. In some embodiments, the labeled probe is fluorescently labeled. In some embodiments, the labeled probe is configured for FRET detection. In some embodiments, the labeled probe has a first conformation when not hybridized in a duplex and a second conformation when hybridized in a duplex. In some embodiments, the labeled probe exhibits increased fluorescence when hybridized in a duplex. The present invention is not limited by the miRNA detected. Indeed, a variety of miRNAs can be detected using the compositions and methods of the present invention including, but not limited to, Let-7, miR-1, miR-135, miR-15, miR-16, miR125b, miR-1d, and miR124a.","The present invention also provides a kit comprising one or more of a first unlabled oligonucleotide that comprises a first region that is complementary to a miRNA target and a second region that is not complementary to the miRNA target; a second unlabeled oligonucleotide that comprises a first region that is complementary to a second region of the miRNA target and a second region that is not complementary to the second region of the miRNA target; a reverse transcriptase; a DNA polymerase; a probe oligonucleotide; and an enzyme capable of cleaving a detection structure. In some embodiments, the detection structure comprises an invasive cleavage structure. In some embodiments, the kit is configured to detect a miRNA target and at least one other RNA target. In some embodiments, the kit is configured to detect the miRNA target sequence in a cell lysate.","To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are defined below:","As used herein, the term \u201cmiRNA\u201d refers to micro RNA. As used herein, the term \u201cmiRNA target sequence\u201d refers to a miRNA that is to be detected (e.g., in the presence of other nucleic acids). In some embodiments, a miRNA target sequence is a variant of a miRNA.","As used herein, the terms \u201cRNA detection structure\u201d and \u201cdetection structure\u201d refer to a structure formed by hybridizing a nucleic acid (e.g., an oligonucleotide) to an RNA target, e.g., an miRNA or siRNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is a single nucleic acid (e.g., a larger nucleic acid with a small region (or regions) of homology to the miRNA). In other embodiments, the nucleic acid comprises two nucleic acids (e.g., that hybridize to the miRNA to form a hairpin (e.g., single or double hairpin) structure). In preferred embodiments, miRNA detection structures are capable of detection using known nucleic acid detection methods, including, but not limited to, those disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, RNA detection structures are further modified following the hybridization step. For example, in some embodiments, one or more components of the detection structure provides a template for extension by a nucleic acid polymerase. In other embodiments, one or more components of the detection structure is contacted with a ligase and ligated to an additional nucleic acid.","The term \u201csiRNAs\u201d refers to short interfering RNAs. In some embodiments, siRNAs comprise a duplex, or double-stranded region, where each strand of the double-stranded region is about 18 to 25 nucleotides long; the double-stranded region can be as short as 16, and as long as 29, base pairs long, where the length is determined by the antisense strand. Often siRNAs contain from about two to four unpaired nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of each strand. siRNAs appear to function as key intermediates in triggering RNA interference in invertebrates and in vertebrates, and in triggering sequence-specific RNA degradation during posttranscriptional gene silencing in plants. At least one strand of the duplex or double-stranded region of a siRNA is substantially homologous to or substantially complementary to a target RNA molecule. The strand complementary to a target RNA molecule is the \u201cantisense\u201d strand; the strand homologous to the target RNA molecule is the \u201csense\u201d strand and is also complementary to the siRNA antisense strand. One strand of the double stranded region need not be the exact length of the opposite strand, thus, one strand may have at least one fewer nucleotides than the opposite complementary strand, resulting in a \u201cbubble\u201d or at least one unmatched base in the opposite strand. One strand of the double-stranded region need not be exactly complementary to the opposite strand; thus, the strand, preferably the sense strand, may have at least one mismatched base pair.","siRNAs may also contain additional sequences; non-limiting examples of such sequences include linking sequences, or loops, which connect the two strands of the duplex region. This form of siRNAs may be referred to \u201csi-like RNA\u201d, \u201cshort hairpin siRNA\u201d where the short refers to the duplex region of the siRNA, or \u201chairpin siRNA\u201d. Additional non-limiting examples of additional sequences present in siRNAs include stem and other folded structures. The additional sequences may or may not have known functions; non-limiting examples of such functions include increasing stability of an siRNA molecule, or providing a cellular destination signal.","As used herein, the terms \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpatient\u201d refer to any organisms including plants, microorganisms and animals (e.g., mammals such as dogs, cats, livestock, and humans).","As used herein, the term \u201cINVADER assay reagents\u201d or \u201cinvasive cleavage assay reagents\u201d refers to one or more reagents for detecting target sequences, said reagents comprising oligonucleotides capable of forming an invasive cleavage structure in the presence of the target sequence. In some embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise an agent for detecting the presence of an invasive cleavage structure (e.g., a cleavage agent). In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides comprise first and second oligonucleotides, said first oligonucleotide comprising a 5\u2032 portion complementary to a first region of the target nucleic acid and said second oligonucleotide comprising a 3\u2032 portion and a 5\u2032 portion, said 5\u2032 portion complementary to a second region of the target nucleic acid downstream of and contiguous to the first portion. In some embodiments, the 3\u2032 portion of the second oligonucleotide comprises a 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide not complementary to the target nucleic acid. In preferred embodiments, the 3\u2032 portion of the second oligonucleotide consists of a single nucleotide not complementary to the target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the first and second oligonucleotides are covalently coupled to one another (e.g., through a linker).","In some embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise a solid support. For example, in some embodiments, the one or more oligonucleotides of the assay reagents (e.g., first and\/or second oligonucleotide, whether bridging or non-bridging) is attached to the solid support. In some embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise a buffer solution. In some preferred embodiments, the buffer solution comprises a source of divalent cations (e.g., Mn and\/or Mg ions). Individual ingredients (e.g., oligonucleotides, enzymes, buffers, target nucleic acids) that collectively make up INVADER assay reagents are termed \u201cINVADER assay reagent components.\u201d","In some embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise a third oligonucleotide complementary to a third portion of the target nucleic acid upstream of the first portion of the first target nucleic acid. In yet other embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise a target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise a second target nucleic acid. In yet other embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise a third oligonucleotide comprising a 5\u2032 portion complementary to a first region of the second target nucleic acid. In some specific embodiments, the 3\u2032 portion of the third oligonucleotide is covalently linked to the second target nucleic acid. In other specific embodiments, the second target nucleic acid further comprises a 5\u2032 portion, wherein the 5\u2032 portion of the second target nucleic acid is the third oligonucleotide. In still other embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise an ARRESTOR molecule (e.g., ARRESTOR oligonucleotide).","The inclusion of 2\u2032 O-methylated ARRESTOR oligonucleotides, which are base-paired fully to each probe's target-specific region and partially to its 5\u2032-flap region, sequesters uncleaved probes and prevents X-structure formation in the secondary reaction, as described in Eis et al., Nature Biotechnology, 19:673-676 (2001), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","In some preferred embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents further comprise reagents for detecting a nucleic acid cleavage product. In some embodiments, one or more oligonucleotides in the INVADER assay reagents comprise a label. In some preferred embodiments, said first oligonucleotide comprises a label. In other preferred embodiments, said third oligonucleotide comprises a label. In particularly preferred embodiments, the reagents comprise a first and\/or a third oligonucleotide labeled with moieties that produce a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect.","In some embodiments one or more the INVADER assay reagents may be provided in a predispensed format (i.e., premeasured for use in a step of the procedure without re-measurement or re-dispensing). In some embodiments, selected INVADER assay reagent components are mixed and predispensed together. In preferred embodiments, predispensed assay reagent components are predispensed and are provided in a reaction vessel (including but not limited to a reaction tube or a well, as in, e.g., a microtiter plate). In particularly preferred embodiments, predispensed INVADER assay reagent components are dried down (e.g., desiccated or lyophilized) in a reaction vessel.","In some embodiments, the INVADER assay reagents are provided as a kit. As used herein, the term \u201ckit\u201d refers to any delivery system for delivering materials. In the context of reaction assays, such delivery systems include systems that allow for the storage, transport, or delivery of reaction reagents (e.g., oligonucleotides, enzymes, etc. in the appropriate containers) and\/or supporting materials (e.g., buffers, written instructions for performing the assay etc.) from one location to another. For example, kits include one or more enclosures (e.g., boxes) containing the relevant reaction reagents and\/or supporting materials. As used herein, the term \u201cfragmented kit\u201d refers to delivery systems comprising two or more separate containers that each contains a subportion of the total kit components. The containers may be delivered to the intended recipient together or separately. For example, a first container may contain an enzyme for use in an assay, while a second container contains oligonucleotides. The term \u201cfragmented kit\u201d is intended to encompass kits containing Analyte specific reagents (ASR's) regulated under section 520(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but are not limited thereto. Indeed, any delivery system comprising two or more separate containers that each contains a subportion of the total kit components are included in the term \u201cfragmented kit.\u201d In contrast, a \u201ccombined kit\u201d refers to a delivery system containing all of the components of a reaction assay in a single container (e.g., in a single box housing each of the desired components). The term \u201ckit\u201d includes both fragmented and combined kits.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides INVADER assay reagent kits comprising one or more of the components necessary for practicing the present invention. For example, the present invention provides kits for storing or delivering the enzymes and\/or the reaction components necessary to practice an INVADER assay. The kit may include any and all components necessary or desired for assays including, but not limited to, the reagents themselves, buffers, control reagents (e.g., tissue samples, positive and negative control target oligonucleotides, etc.), solid supports, labels, written and\/or pictorial instructions and product information, inhibitors, labeling and\/or detection reagents, package environmental controls (e.g., ice, desiccants, etc.), and the like. In some embodiments, the kits provide a sub-set of the required components, wherein it is expected that the user will supply the remaining components. In some embodiments, the kits comprise two or more separate containers wherein each container houses a subset of the components to be delivered. For example, a first container (e.g., box) may contain an enzyme (e.g., structure specific cleavage enzyme in a suitable storage buffer and container), while a second box may contain oligonucleotides (e.g., INVADER oligonucleotides, probe oligonucleotides, control target oligonucleotides, etc.).","The term \u201clabel\u201d as used herein refers to any atom or molecule that can be used to provide a detectable (preferably quantifiable) effect, and that can be attached to a nucleic acid or protein. Labels include, but are not limited to, dyes; radiolabels such as P; binding moieties such as biotin; haptens such as digoxygenin; luminogenic, phosphorescent or fluorogenic moieties; mass tags; and fluorescent dyes alone or in combination with moieties that can suppress or shift emission spectra by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Labels may provide signals detectable by fluorescence, radioactivity, colorimetry, gravimetry, X-ray diffraction or absorption, magnetism, enzymatic activity, characteristics of mass or behavior affected by mass (e.g., MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry; fluorescence polarization), and the like. A label may be a charged moiety (positive or negative charge) or alternatively, may be charge neutral. Labels can include or consist of nucleic acid or protein sequence, so long as the sequence comprising the label is detectable.","As used herein, the term \u201cdistinct\u201d in reference to signals refers to signals that can be differentiated one from another, e.g., by spectral properties such as fluorescence emission wavelength, color, absorbance, mass, size, fluorescence polarization properties, charge, etc., or by capability of interaction with another moiety, such as with a chemical reagent, an enzyme, an antibody, etc.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccomplementary\u201d or \u201ccomplementarity\u201d are used in reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides such as an oligonucleotide or a target nucleic acid) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, the sequence \u201c5\u2032-A-G-T-3\u2032\u201d is complementary to the sequence \u201c3\u2032-T-C-A-5\u2032.\u201d Complementarity may be \u201cpartial,\u201d in which only some of the nucleic acids' bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201ctotal\u201d complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids. Either term may also be used in reference to individual nucleotides, especially within the context of polynucleotides. For example, a particular nucleotide within an oligonucleotide may be noted for its complementarity, or lack thereof, to a nucleotide within another nucleic acid strand, in contrast or comparison to the complementarity between the rest of the oligonucleotide and the nucleic acid strand.","The term \u201chomology\u201d and \u201chomologous\u201d refers to a degree of identity. There may be partial homology or complete homology. A partially homologous sequence is one that is less than 100% identical to another sequence.","As used herein, the term \u201chybridization\u201d is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is influenced by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, and the Tof the formed hybrid. \u201cHybridization\u201d methods involve the annealing of one nucleic acid to another, complementary nucleic acid, i.e., a nucleic acid having a complementary nucleotide sequence. The ability of two polymers of nucleic acid containing complementary sequences to find each other and anneal through base pairing interaction is a well-recognized phenomenon. The initial observations of the \u201chybridization\u201d process by Marmur and Lane, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 46:453 (1960) and Doty et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 46:461 (1960) have been followed by the refinement of this process into an essential tool of modern biology.","The complement of a nucleic acid sequence as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide which, when aligned with the nucleic acid sequence such that the 5\u2032 end of one sequence is paired with the 3\u2032 end of the other, is in \u201cantiparallel association.\u201d Certain bases not commonly found in natural nucleic acids may be included in the nucleic acids of the present invention and include, for example, inosine and 7-deazaguanine. Complementarity need not be perfect; stable duplexes may contain mismatched base pairs or unmatched bases. Those skilled in the art of nucleic acid technology can determine duplex stability empirically considering a number of variables including, for example, the length of the oligonucleotide, base composition and sequence of the oligonucleotide, ionic strength and incidence of mismatched base pairs.","As used herein, the term \u201cT\u201d is used in reference to the \u201cmelting temperature.\u201d The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. Several equations for calculating the Tof nucleic acids are well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the Tvalue may be calculated by the equation: T=81.5+0.41(% G+C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (see e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization (1985). Other references (e.g., Allawi and SantaLucia, Biochemistry 36: 10581-94 (1997) include more sophisticated computations which take structural and environmental, as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of T.","The term \u201cgene\u201d refers to a DNA sequence that comprises control and coding sequences necessary for the production of an RNA having a non-coding function (e.g., a ribosomal or transfer RNA), a polypeptide or a precursor. The RNA or polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or function is retained.","The term \u201cwild-type\u201d refers to a gene or a gene product that has the characteristics of that gene or gene product when isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild-type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily designated the \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cwild-type\u201d form of the gene. In contrast, the term \u201cmodified,\u201d \u201cmutant,\u201d or \u201cpolymorphic\u201d refers to a gene or gene product that displays modifications in sequence and or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally-occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product.","The term \u201crecombinant DNA vector\u201d as used herein refers to DNA sequences containing a desired heterologous sequence. For example, although the term is not limited to the use of expressed sequences or sequences that encode an expression product, in some embodiments, the heterologous sequence is a coding sequence and appropriate DNA sequences necessary for either the replication of the coding sequence in a host organism, or the expression of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. DNA sequences necessary for expression in prokaryotes include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, a ribosome binding site and possibly other sequences. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenlyation signals and enhancers.","The term \u201coligonucleotide\u201d as used herein is defined as a molecule comprising two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, preferably at least 5 nucleotides, more preferably at least about 10-15 nucleotides and more preferably at least about 15 to 30 nucleotides. The exact size will depend on many factors, which in turn depend on the ultimate function or use of the oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide may be generated in any manner, including chemical synthesis, DNA replication, reverse transcription, PCR, or a combination thereof.","Because mononucleotides are reacted to make oligonucleotides in a manner such that the 5\u2032 phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3\u2032 oxygen of its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage, an end of an oligonucleotide is referred to as the \u201c5\u2032 end\u201d if its 5\u2032 phosphate is not linked to the 3\u2032 oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring and as the \u201c3\u2032 end\u201d if its 3\u2032 oxygen is not linked to a 5\u2032 phosphate of a subsequent mononucleotide pentose ring. As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger oligonucleotide, also may be said to have 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. A first region along a nucleic acid strand is said to be upstream of another region if the 3\u2032 end of the first region is before the 5\u2032 end of the second region when moving along a strand of nucleic acid in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.","When two different, non-overlapping oligonucleotides anneal to different regions of the same linear complementary nucleic acid sequence, and the 3\u2032 end of one oligonucleotide points towards the 5\u2032 end of the other, the former may be called the \u201cupstream\u201d oligonucleotide and the latter the \u201cdownstream\u201d oligonucleotide. Similarly, when two overlapping oligonucleotides are hybridized to the same linear complementary nucleic acid sequence, with the first oligonucleotide positioned such that its 5\u2032 end is upstream of the 5\u2032 end of the second oligonucleotide, and the 3\u2032 end of the first oligonucleotide is upstream of the 3\u2032 end of the second oligonucleotide, the first oligonucleotide may be called the \u201cupstream\u201d oligonucleotide and the second oligonucleotide may be called the \u201cdownstream\u201d oligonucleotide.","The term \u201cprimer\u201d refers to an oligonucleotide that is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which primer extension is initiated. An oligonucleotide \u201cprimer\u201d may occur naturally, as in a purified restriction digest or may be produced synthetically.","A primer is selected to be \u201csubstantially\u201d complementary to a strand of specific sequence of the template. A primer must be sufficiently complementary to hybridize with a template strand for primer elongation to occur. A primer sequence need not reflect the exact sequence of the template. For example, a non-complementary nucleotide fragment may be attached to the 5\u2032 end of the primer, with the remainder of the primer sequence being substantially complementary to the strand. Non-complementary bases or longer sequences can be interspersed into the primer, provided that the primer sequence has sufficient complementarity with the sequence of the template to hybridize and thereby form a template primer complex for synthesis of the extension product of the primer.","The term \u201ccleavage structure\u201d as used herein, refers to a structure that is formed by the interaction of at least one probe oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid, forming a structure comprising a duplex, the resulting structure being cleavable by a cleavage means, including but not limited to an enzyme. The cleavage structure is a substrate for specific cleavage by the cleavage means in contrast to a nucleic acid molecule that is a substrate for non-specific cleavage by agents such as phosphodiesterases, which cleave nucleic acid molecules without regard to secondary structure (i.e., no formation of a duplexed structure is required).","The term \u201ccleavage means\u201d or \u201ccleavage agent\u201d as used herein refers to any means that is capable of cleaving a cleavage structure, including but not limited to enzymes. \u201cStructure-specific nucleases\u201d or \u201cstructure-specific enzymes\u201d are enzymes that recognize specific secondary structures in a nucleic molecule and cleave these structures. The cleavage means of the invention cleave a nucleic acid molecule in response to the formation of cleavage structures; it is not necessary that the cleavage means cleave the cleavage structure at any particular location within the cleavage structure.","The cleavage means may include nuclease activity provided from a variety of sources including the CLEAVASE enzymes (Third Wave Technologies, Madison, Wis.), the FEN-1 endonucleases (including RAD2 and XPG proteins, and FEN-1 endonucleases derived from archaeabacteria), Taq DNA polymerase and DNA polymerase I. The cleavage means may include enzymes having 5\u2032 nuclease activity (e.g., Taq DNA polymerase (DNAP), DNA polymerase I). The cleavage means may also include modified DNA polymerases having 5\u2032 nuclease activity but lacking synthetic activity. Examples of cleavage means suitable for use in the methods and kits of the present invention are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,614,402; 5,795,763; 5,843,669; PCT Appln. Nos WO 98\/23774; WO 02\/070755A2; and WO0190337A2, each of which is herein incorporated by reference it their entireties.","The term \u201cthermostable\u201d when used in reference to an enzyme, such as a 5\u2032 nuclease, indicates that the enzyme is functional or active (i.e., can perform catalysis) at an elevated temperature, i.e., at about 55\u00b0 C. or higher (e.g., including, but not limited to, 60\u00b0 C., 65\u00b0 C., 70\u00b0 C., 75\u00b0 C., 80\u00b0 C., 85\u00b0 C. or 90\u00b0 C.).","The term \u201ccleavage products\u201d as used herein, refers to products generated by the reaction of a cleavage means with a cleavage structure (i.e., the treatment of a cleavage structure with a cleavage means).","The term \u201cnon-target cleavage product\u201d refers to a product of a cleavage reaction that is not derived from the target nucleic acid. As discussed above, in some of the methods of the present invention, cleavage of the cleavage structure generally occurs within the probe oligonucleotide. The fragments of the probe oligonucleotide generated by this target nucleic acid-dependent cleavage are \u201cnon-target cleavage products.\u201d","The term \u201cprobe oligonucleotide\u201d, in the context of an INVADER assay reaction, refers to an oligonucleotide that interacts with a target nucleic acid to form a cleavage structure in the presence or absence of an INVADER oligonucleotide. When annealed to the target nucleic acid, the probe oligonucleotide and target form a cleavage structure and cleavage occurs within the probe oligonucleotide.","The term \u201cINVADER oligonucleotide\u201d refers to an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to a target nucleic acid at a location near the region of hybridization between a probe and the target nucleic acid, wherein the INVADER oligonucleotide comprises a portion (e.g., a chemical moiety, or nucleotide-whether complementary to that target or not) that overlaps with the region of hybridization between the probe and target. In some embodiments, the INVADER oligonucleotide contains sequences at its 3\u2032 end that are substantially the same as sequences located at the 5\u2032 end of a probe oligonucleotide.","The term \u201cARRESTOR molecule\u201d refers to an agent added to or included in an invasive cleavage reaction in order to stop one or more reaction components from participating in a subsequent action or reaction. This may be done by sequestering or inactivating some reaction component (e.g., by binding or base-pairing a nucleic acid component, or by binding to a protein component). The term \u201cARRESTOR oligonucleotide\u201d refers to an oligonucleotide included in an invasive cleavage reaction in order to stop or arrest one or more aspects of any reaction (e.g., the first reaction and\/or any subsequent reactions or actions; it is not intended that the ARRESTOR oligonucleotide be limited to any particular reaction or reaction step). This may be done by sequestering some reaction component (e.g., base-pairing to another nucleic acid, or binding to a protein component). However, it is not intended that the term be so limited as to just situations in which a reaction component is sequestered.","The term \u201ccassette\u201d as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide or combination of oligonucleotides configured to generate a detectable signal in response to cleavage of a probe oligonucleotide in an INVADER assay. In preferred embodiments, the cassette hybridizes to a non-target cleavage product from cleavage of the probe oligonucleotide to form a second invasive cleavage structure, such that the cassette can then be cleaved.","Secondary cleavage reactions in some preferred embodiments of the present invention include the use of FRET cassettes. Such molecules provide both a secondary target (Secondary Reaction Target or SRT) and a FRET labeled cleavable sequence, allowing homogeneous detection (i.e., without product separation or other manipulation after the reaction) of the sequential invasive cleavage reaction. Other preferred embodiments use a secondary reaction system in which the FRET probe and synthetic target are provided as separate oligonucleotides. The cleaved 5\u2032-flaps from a primary reaction act as invasive oligonucleotides in a secondary reaction, in which they bind to the appropriate secondary-reaction target (SRT).","In some embodiments, the cassette is a single oligonucleotide comprising a hairpin portion (i.e., a region wherein one portion of the cassette oligonucleotide hybridizes to a second portion of the same oligonucleotide under reaction conditions, to form a duplex). In other embodiments, a cassette comprises at least two oligonucleotides comprising complementary portions that can form a duplex under reaction conditions. In preferred embodiments, the cassette comprises a label. In particularly preferred embodiments, cassette comprises labeled moieties that produce a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect.","The term \u201csubstantially single-stranded\u201d when used in reference to a nucleic acid substrate means that the substrate molecule exists primarily as a single strand of nucleic acid in contrast to a double-stranded substrate which exists as two strands of nucleic acid which are held together by inter-strand base pairing interactions.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cnon-amplified oligonucleotide detection assay\u201d refers to a detection assay configured to detect the presence or absence of a particular target sequence (e.g., miRNA, SNP, repeat sequence, etc.) that has not been amplified (e.g., by PCR), without creating copies of the target sequence. A \u201cnon-amplified oligonucleotide detection assay\u201d may, for example, amplify a signal used to indicate the presence or absence of a particular target sequence or polymorphism within a target sequence, so long as the target sequence is not copied.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cnon-amplifying oligonucleotide detection assay\u201d refers to a detection assay configured to detect the presence or absence of a target sequence (e.g., miRNA, SNP, repeat sequence, etc.), without creating copies of the target sequence. A \u201cnon-amplifying oligonucleotide detection assay\u201d may, for example, amplify a signal used to indicate the presence or absence of a particular target sequence or polymorphism in a target sequence, so long as the target sequence is not copied.","The term \u201csequence variation\u201d as used herein refers to differences in nucleic acid sequence between two nucleic acids. For example, a wild-type structural gene and a mutant form of this wild-type structural gene may vary in sequence by the presence of single base substitutions and\/or deletions or insertions of one or more nucleotides. These two forms of the structural gene are said to vary in sequence from one another. A second mutant form of the structural gene may exist. This second mutant form is said to vary in sequence from both the wild-type gene and the first mutant form of the gene.","The term \u201cliberating\u201d as used herein refers to the release of a nucleic acid fragment from a larger nucleic acid fragment, such as an oligonucleotide, by the action of, for example, a 5\u2032 nuclease such that the released fragment is no longer covalently attached to the remainder of the oligonucleotide.","The term \u201cK\u201d as used herein refers to the Michaelis-Menten constant for an enzyme and is defined as the concentration of the specific substrate at which a given enzyme yields one-half its maximum velocity in an enzyme catalyzed reaction.","The term \u201cnucleotide analog\u201d as used herein refers to modified or non-naturally occurring nucleotides including but not limited to analogs that have altered stacking interactions such as 7-deaza purines (i.e., 7-deaza-dATP and 7-deaza-dGTP); base analogs with alternative hydrogen bonding configurations (e.g., such as Iso-C and Iso-G and other non-standard base pairs described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,983 to S. Benner and herein incorporated by reference); non-hydrogen bonding analogs (e.g., non-polar, aromatic nucleoside analogs such as 2,4-difluorotoluene, described by B. A. Schweitzer and E. T. Kool, J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 7238-7242, B. A. Schweitzer and E. T. Kool, J. Am. Chem.

Nucleotide analogs include modified forms of deoxyribonucleotides as well as ribonucleotides.","The term \u201cpolymorphic locus\u201d is a locus present in a population that shows variation between members of the population (e.g., the most common allele has a frequency of less than 0.95). In contrast, a \u201cmonomorphic locus\u201d is a genetic locus at little or no variations seen between members of the population (generally taken to be a locus at which the most common allele exceeds a frequency of 0.95 in the gene pool of the population).","The term \u201cmicroorganism\u201d as used herein means an organism too small to be observed with the unaided eye and includes, but is not limited to bacteria, virus, protozoans, fungi, and ciliates.","The term \u201cmicrobial gene sequences\u201d refers to gene sequences derived from a microorganism.","The term \u201cbacteria\u201d refers to any bacterial species including eubacterial and archaebacterial species.","The term \u201cvirus\u201d refers to obligate, ultramicroscopic, intracellular parasites incapable of autonomous replication (i.e., replication requires the use of the host cell's machinery).","The term \u201csample\u201d in the present specification and claims is used in its broadest sense. On the one hand it is meant to include a specimen or culture (e.g., microbiological cultures). On the other hand, it is meant to include both biological and environmental samples. A sample may include a specimen of synthetic origin.","Biological samples may be animal, including human, fluid, solid (e.g., stool) or tissue, as well as liquid and solid food and feed products and ingredients such as dairy items, vegetables, meat and meat by-products, and waste.

These examples are not to be construed as limiting the sample types applicable to the present invention.","The term \u201csource of target nucleic acid\u201d refers to any sample that contains nucleic acids (RNA (e.g., miRNA) or DNA). Particularly preferred sources of target nucleic acids are biological samples including, but not limited to blood, saliva, cerebral spinal fluid, pleural fluid, milk, lymph, sputum and semen.","An oligonucleotide is said to be present in \u201cexcess\u201d relative to another oligonucleotide (or target nucleic acid sequence) if that oligonucleotide is present at a higher molar concentration that the other oligonucleotide (or target nucleic acid sequence). When an oligonucleotide such as a probe oligonucleotide is present in a cleavage reaction in excess relative to the concentration of the complementary target nucleic acid sequence, the reaction may be used to indicate the amount of the target nucleic acid present. Typically, when present in excess, the probe oligonucleotide will be present in at least a 100-fold molar excess; typically at least 1 pmole of each probe oligonucleotide would be used when the target nucleic acid sequence was present at about 10 fmoles or less.","A sample \u201csuspected of containing\u201d a first and a second target nucleic acid may contain either, both or neither target nucleic acid molecule.","The term \u201creactant\u201d is used herein in its broadest sense. The reactant can comprise, for example, an enzymatic reactant, a chemical reactant or light (e.g., ultraviolet light, particularly short wavelength ultraviolet light is known to break oligonucleotide chains). Any agent capable of reacting with an oligonucleotide to either shorten (e.g., cleave) or elongate the oligonucleotide is encompassed within the term \u201creactant.\u201d","As used herein, the term \u201cpurified\u201d or \u201cto purify\u201d refers to the removal of contaminants from a sample. For example, in some embodiments, recombinant CLEAVASE nucleases are expressed in bacterial host cells and the nucleases are purified by the removal of host cell proteins; the percent of these recombinant nucleases is thereby increased in the sample.","As used herein the term \u201cportion\u201d when in reference to a protein (as in \u201ca portion of a given protein\u201d) refers to fragments of that protein. The fragments may range in size from four amino acid residues to the entire amino acid sequence minus one amino acid (e.g., 4, 5, 6, . . . , n\u22121).","The term \u201cnucleic acid sequence\u201d as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide, nucleotide or polynucleotide, and fragments or portions thereof, and to DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic origin, which may be single or double stranded, and represent the sense or antisense strand.

An \u201cisolated polynucleotide\u201d or \u201cisolated oligonucleotide\u201d is therefore a substantially purified polynucleotide.","The term \u201ccontinuous strand of nucleic acid\u201d as used herein is means a strand of nucleic acid that has a continuous, covalently linked, backbone structure, without nicks or other disruptions. The disposition of the base portion of each nucleotide, whether base-paired, single-stranded or mismatched, is not an element in the definition of a continuous strand. The backbone of the continuous strand is not limited to the ribose-phosphate or deoxyribose-phosphate compositions that are found in naturally occurring, unmodified nucleic acids. A nucleic acid of the present invention may comprise modifications in the structure of the backbone, including but not limited to phosphorothioate residues, phosphonate residues, 2\u2032 substituted ribose residues (e.g., 2\u2032-O-methyl ribose) and alternative sugar (e.g., arabinose) containing residues.","The term \u201ccontinuous duplex\u201d as used herein refers to a region of double stranded nucleic acid in which there is no disruption in the progression of basepairs within the duplex (i.e., the base pairs along the duplex are not distorted to accommodate a gap, bulge or mismatch with the confines of the region of continuous duplex). As used herein the term refers only to the arrangement of the basepairs within the duplex, without implication of continuity in the backbone portion of the nucleic acid strand. Duplex nucleic acids with uninterrupted basepairing, but with nicks in one or both strands are within the definition of a continuous duplex.","The term \u201cduplex\u201d refers to the state of nucleic acids in which the base portions of the nucleotides on one strand are bound through hydrogen bonding the their complementary bases arrayed on a second strand. The condition of being in a duplex form reflects on the state of the bases of a nucleic acid. By virtue of base pairing, the strands of nucleic acid also generally assume the tertiary structure of a double helix, having a major and a minor groove. The assumption of the helical form is implicit in the act of becoming duplexed.","The term \u201ctemplate\u201d refers to a strand of nucleic acid on which a complementary copy is built from nucleoside triphosphates through the activity of a template-dependent nucleic acid polymerase. Within a duplex the template strand is, by convention, depicted and described as the \u201cbottom\u201d strand.

The present invention provides methods of detecting, characterizing and quantitating miRNA expression. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of detecting miRNA expression comprising adding a nucleic acid to a miRNA to aid in detection. The resulting \u201cmiRNA detection structure\u201d is then detected using any suitable method including, but not limited to, those disclosed herein. While the following description focuses on the detection and quantitation of miRNAs, it should be understood that the invention also finds use with other short nucleic acid molecules (e.g., DNA and RNA of less than, for example, 50, 40, 30, or 20 nucleotides in length).","Various embodiments are illustrated below using miRNA as an example. However, it should be understood that the methods may be applied to other small nucleic acid molecules.","I. Formation of a miRNA Detection Structure","In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of generating miRNA detection structures to aid in the detection of miRNAs. miRNAs are small in size (approximately 21 nucleotides (e.g., around 18-25 nucleotides)) and are thus difficult to detect using standardized hybridization methods. In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention comprise adding a nucleic acid molecule to an miRNA (e.g., via hybridization, extension, or ligation) to generate a detection structure. Such detection structures can then be detected using any suitable method.","In one particular embodiment, the detection structure described in  is generated for detection of miRNAs. In this embodiment, two oligonucleotides are annealed to the miRNA to form a double loop or \u201cdumbbell\u201d like structure. The dumbbell structure creates a larger region of double-stranded nucleic acid by extending the ends of the miRNA with a double-stranded region of oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, each end of the miRNA is extended between 2 and 5 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the ends of the oligonucleotides comprise additional nucleic acid sequences that do not hybridize to the miRNA. In some embodiments, these additional sequences form invasive cleavage structures (e.g., INVADER assay invasive cleavage structures). In some embodiments, invasive cleavage structures are detected by the INVADER assay (See e.g., below description). For example, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides described in Example 18 (See, e.g., ) are utilized to detect miRNAs associated with cancer (e.g., that form an invasive cleavage structure that can be detected by INVADER assay).","In other embodiments, the detection structure described in  is generated for the detection of miRNAs. In this embodiment, one oligonucleotide is annealed to the miRNA to generate an arched structure. The miRNA brings the ends of the oligonucleotide together with greater efficiency than in the absence of the miRNA. In some embodiments, the ends of the oligonucleotide comprise additional sequences that extend beyond the miRNA and do not hybridize to the miRNA. In some embodiments, these additional sequences form invasive cleavage structures (e.g., INVADER assay invasive cleavage structures). In some embodiments, invasive cleavage structures are detected by the INVADER assay (See e.g., below description). In other embodiments, following cleavage of an INVADER assay invasive cleavage structure, the resulting ends are ligated to form a circular structure. In other embodiments, one oligonucleotide is hybridized to a miRNA such that the ends of the oligonucleotide are brought in close proximity (e.g., hybridized to adjacent nucleotides of the miRNA) and are then ligated.","In still further embodiments, the detection structures described in  are generated. In this embodiment, either probe or INVADER oligonucleotides are extended to create a single hairpin loop or \u201chalf dumbbell\u201d structure. For example, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides described in Example 18 (See, e.g., ) are utilized to detect miRNAs associated with cancer (e.g., that form an invasive cleavage structure that can be detected by INVADER assay).","In some embodiments, the ends of the oligonucleotides comprise additional nucleic acid sequences that do not hybridize to the miRNA (See, e.g., Examples 19G and 19H). In some embodiments, these additional sequences form invasive cleavage structures (e.g., INVADER assay invasive cleavage structures). In some embodiments, invasive cleavage structures are detected by the INVADER assay (See e.g., below description).","In other embodiments, these additional sequences are complementary to additional oligonucleotides added to reaction mixtures to stabilize a cleavage structure, e.g. an INVADER assay invasive cleavage structure ().","In some embodiments, circular structures generated as described above are detected using a rolling circle replication assay (See e.g., below description of rolling circle replication).","In still further embodiments, detection structures are generated from long oligonucleotides (e.g., greater than 50, 100, 1000 or more nucleotides) with short region(s) of homology to miRNAs. One or more miRNAs are hybridized to the oligonucleotides to generate detection structures. In some embodiments, these detection structures are detected by extension of miRNAs (e.g., via ligation or polymerization reactions such as RT-PCR). In some embodiments, these detection structures are further detected by hybridization to oligonucleotides conjugated to solid supports, such as microspheres, or other surfaces or structures. In some embodiments, the non-miRNA component is extended or ligated to another nucleic acid and directly or indirectly detected.","In some embodiments, oligonucleotides used to form detection structures comprise one or more nucleotide analogs. For example, in some embodiments, 2\u2032-O-methyl nucleotides are utilized. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that the presence of 2\u2032-O-methyl bases increases the stability of the hybridized detection structure and aids in further detection methods.","II. Detection of Nucleic Acids (e.g., Interfering RNAs)","In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of detecting miRNAs. The present invention is not limited to a particular detection assay. Any suitable method may be utilized including, but not limited to, those disclosed herein.","In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, miRNA detection methods are quantitative. The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, it is contemplated that levels of a particular miRNA in the body are associated with a level of gene expression from their cognate genes. The present invention thus provides methods of correlated miRNAs with gene expression of particular genes (e.g., genes involved in disease states (e.g., cancer) or metabolism). For example, in some embodiments, the methods of the present invention are utilized to determine the presence of abnormal (e.g., high or low) levels of a particular miRNA (e.g., miRNA expression associated with cancer (See, e.g., Calin et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 99, 15524-15529 (2002), e.g., using oligonucleotides described in Example 18 and ) or to determine the effect of an intervention (e.g., drug) on miRNA expression. In other embodiments, heterologous miRNAs (e.g., from expression vectors, transgenic constructs, transfection, etc.) are detected to characterize the efficiency of miRNA expression systems.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of detecting a particular miRNA (e.g., a miRNA such as mir-1 or mir-135). In other embodiments, the methods of the present invention are used to distinguish between variants (e.g., polymorphisms or mutations) in a particular miRNA. In still further embodiments, the present invention provides methods of lysing cells to be tested for the presence of miRNAs.","A. INVADER Assay","In some embodiments, the INVADER assay is used for the detection of miRNAs. In some embodiments, the INVADER assay comprises forming a nucleic acid cleavage structure that is dependent upon the presence of a target nucleic acid and cleaving the nucleic acid cleavage structure so as to release distinctive cleavage products. 5\u2032 nuclease activity, for example, is used to cleave the target-dependent cleavage structure and the resulting cleavage products or the cleavage of the cleavage structure is indicative of the presence of specific target nucleic acid sequences in the sample. When one or two (or more) strands of nucleic acid, or oligonucleotides, both hybridize to a target nucleic acid strand such that they form an overlapping invasive cleavage structure, as described below, invasive cleavage can occur. Through the interaction of a cleavage agent (e.g., a 5\u2032 nuclease) and the upstream oligonucleotide, the cleavage agent can be made to cleave the downstream oligonucleotide at an internal site in such a way that a distinctive fragment is produced. Such embodiments have been termed the INVADER assay (Third Wave Technologies) and are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,846,717, 5,985,557, 5,994,069, 6,001,567, 6,090,543, 6,348,314, and 6,458,535, WO 97\/27214 WO 98\/42873, Lyamichev et al., Nat. Biotech., 17:292 (1999), Hall et al., PNAS, USA, 97:8272 (2000), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).","The INVADER assay detects hybridization of probes to a target by enzymatic cleavage of specific structures by structure specific enzymes (See, INVADER assays, Third Wave Technologies; See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,846,717; 6,090,543; 6,001,567; 5,985,557; 5,994,069; 6,090,543; 6,348,314; 6,458,535; U.S. Patent App. Nos. 20030186238 (Ser. No. 10\/084,839); 20030104378A1 (Ser. No. 09\/864,636); Lyamichev et al., Nat. Biotech., 17:292 (1999), Hall et al., PNAS, USA, 97:8272 (2000), WO97\/27214 and WO98\/42873, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).","The INVADER assay detects specific DNA and RNA sequences by using structure-specific enzymes (e.g. FEN endonucleases) to cleave a complex formed by the hybridization of overlapping oligonucleotide probes (See, e.g. ). Elevated temperature and an excess of one of the probes enable multiple probes to be cleaved for each target sequence present without temperature cycling. In some embodiments, these cleaved probes then direct cleavage of a second labeled probe. The secondary probe oligonucleotide can be 5\u2032-end labeled with fluorescein that is quenched by an internal dye. Upon cleavage, the de-quenched fluorescein labeled product may be detected using a standard fluorescence plate reader.","The INVADER assay detects specific sequences, mutations, and SNPs in unamplified, as well as amplified (See, e.g., Example 19, ), RNA and DNA, including genomic DNA. In the embodiments shown schematically in , the INVADER assay uses two cascading steps (a primary and a secondary reaction) both to generate and then to amplify the target-specific signal. For convenience, the alleles in the following discussion are described as wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT), even though this terminology does not apply to all genetic variations. In the primary reaction (, panel A), the WT primary probe and the INVADER oligonucleotide hybridize in tandem to the target nucleic acid to form an overlapping structure. An unpaired \u201cflap\u201d is included on the 5\u2032 end of the WT primary probe. A structure-specific enzyme (e.g. the CLEAVASE enzyme, Third Wave Technologies) recognizes the overlap and cleaves off the unpaired flap, releasing it as a target-specific product. In the secondary reaction, this cleaved product serves as an INVADER oligonucleotide on the WT fluorescence resonance energy transfer (WT-FRET) probe to again create the structure recognized by the structure specific enzyme (panel A). When the two dyes on a single FRET probe are separated by cleavage (indicated by the arrow in ), a detectable fluorescent signal above background fluorescence is produced. Consequently, cleavage of this second structure results in an increase in fluorescence, indicating the presence of the WT allele (or mutant allele if the assay is configured for the mutant allele to generate the detectable signal). In some embodiments, FRET probes having different labels (e.g. resolvable by difference in emission or excitation wavelengths, or resolvable by time-resolved fluorescence detection) are provided for each allele or locus to be detected, such that the different alleles or loci can be detected in a single reaction. In such embodiments, the primary probe sets and the different FRET probes may be combined in a single assay, allowing comparison of the signals from each allele or locus in the same sample.","If the primary probe oligonucleotide and the target nucleotide sequence do not match perfectly at the cleavage site (e.g., as with the MT primary probe and the WT target, , panel B), the overlapped structure does not form and cleavage is suppressed. The structure specific enzyme (e.g., CLEAVASE VIII enzyme, Third Wave Technologies) used cleaves the overlapped structure more efficiently (e.g. at least 340-fold) than the non-overlapping structure, allowing excellent discrimination of the alleles.","The probes turn over without temperature cycling to produce many signals per target (i.e., linear signal amplification). Similarly, each target-specific product can enable the cleavage of many FRET probes.","The primary INVADER assay reaction is directed against the target DNA (or RNA) being detected. The target DNA is the limiting component in the first invasive cleavage, since the INVADER and primary probe are supplied in molar excess. In the second invasive cleavage, it is the released flap that is limiting. When these two cleavage reactions are performed sequentially, the fluorescence signal from the composite reaction accumulates linearly with respect to the target DNA amount.","In certain embodiments, the INVADER assay, or other nucleotide detection assays, are performed with accessible site-designed oligonucleotides and\/or bridging oligonucleotides. Such methods, procedures and compositions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,149, 6,358,691, 6,355,437, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/882,945, and PCT Applications WO9850403, and WO0198537, all of which are specifically incorporated by reference in their entireties.","In some preferred embodiments, the exposing of the sample (e.g., nucleic acid sequence (e.g., interfering RNA (e.g., miRNA or siRNA))) to the oligonucleotides and the agent comprises exposing the sample to the oligonucleotides and the agent under conditions wherein an invasive cleavage structure is formed between said target sequence and said oligonucleotides if said target sequence is present in said sample, wherein said invasive cleavage structure is cleaved by said cleavage agent to form a cleavage product.","In some embodiments, the target sequence (e.g. miRNA) comprises a first region and a second region, the second region downstream of and contiguous to the first region, and the oligonucleotides comprise first and second oligonucleotides, wherein at least a portion of the first oligonucleotide is completely complementary to the first portion of the target sequence and wherein the second oligonucleotide comprises a 3\u2032 portion and a 5\u2032 portion, wherein the 5\u2032 portion is completely complementary to the second portion of the target nucleic acid.","In some preferred embodiments, the exposing of the sample to the oligonucleotides and the agent comprises exposing the sample to the oligonucleotides and the agent under conditions wherein an invasive cleavage structure is formed between the target sequence and the oligonucleotides if the target sequence is present in the sample, wherein the invasive cleavage structure is cleaved by the cleavage agent to form a cleavage product.","In some particularly preferred embodiments, the target sequence comprises a first region and a second region, said second region downstream of and contiguous to said first region, and said oligonucleotides comprise first and second oligonucleotides, wherein at least a portion of said first oligonucleotide is completely complementary to said first portion of said target sequence and wherein said second oligonucleotide comprises a 3\u2032 portion and a 5\u2032 portion, wherein said 5\u2032 portion is completely complementary to said second portion of said target nucleic acid.","In certain embodiments, the present invention provides kits for assaying a pooled sample (e.g., a pooled blood sample or pooled cell lysates) using INVADER detection reagents (e.g. primary probe, INVADER probe, and FRET cassette). In preferred embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions on how to perform the INVADER assay, and in some embodiments, how to apply the INVADER detection assay to pooled samples from many individuals, or to \u201cpooled\u201d samples from many cells (e.g., from a biopsy sample) from a single subject.","The present invention further provides assays in which the target nucleic acid is reused or recycled during multiple rounds of hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and cleavage of the probes without the need to use temperature cycling (i.e., for periodic denaturation of target nucleic acid strands) or nucleic acid synthesis (i.e., for the polymerization-based displacement of target or probe nucleic acid strands). When a cleavage reaction is run under conditions in which the probes are continuously replaced on the target strand (e.g. through probe-probe displacement or through an equilibrium between probe\/target association and disassociation, or through a combination comprising these mechanisms, (Reynaldo et al., J. Mol. Biol. 97: 511-520 (2000)), multiple probes can hybridize to the same target, allowing multiple cleavages, and the generation of multiple cleavage products.","The INVADER Assay Reaction:","In preferred embodiments of the INVADER DNA assay, two oligonucleotides (a discriminatory primary probe and an INVADER Oligo) hybridize in tandem to the target DNA to form an overlapping structure. The 5\u2032-end of the primary probe includes a 5\u2032-flap that does not hybridize to the target DNA (). The 3\u2032-nucleotide of the bound INVADER oligonucleotide overlaps the primary probe, but need not hybridize to the target DNA (See, e.g., Examples 15 and 16). The CLEAVASE enzyme recognizes this overlapping structure and cleaves off the unpaired 5\u2032-flap of the primary probe, releasing it as a target-specific product. The primary probe is designed to have a melting temperature close to the reaction temperature. Thus, under the isothermal assay conditions, primary probes, which are provided in excess, cycle on the target DNA. This allows for multiple rounds of primary probe cleavage for each target DNA, and amplification of the number of released 5\u2032-flaps.","In the secondary reaction, each released 5\u2032-flap can serve as an INVADER oligonucleotide on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) Cassette to create another overlapping structure that is recognized and cleaved by the CLEAVASE enzyme (). When the FRET Cassette is cleaved, the fluorophore (F) and quencher (Q) are separated, generating detectable fluorescence signal. Similar to the initial reaction, the released 5\u2032-flap and the FRET Cassette cycle, resulting in amplified fluorescence signal. The initial and secondary reactions run concurrently in the same well.","The biplex format of the INVADER DNA Assay enables simultaneous detection of two DNA sequences in a single well (See, e.g., Examples 17 and 19(L)). Most often, this involves detection of two variants of a particular polymorphism (e.g., in a miRNA). The biplex format uses two different discriminatory Primary Probes, each with a unique 5\u2032-flap, and two different FRET Cassettes, each with a spectrally distinct fluorophore. By design, the released 5\u2032-flaps will bind only to their respective FRET Cassettes to generate a target-specific signal.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides kits comprising one or more of the components necessary for practicing the present invention. For example, the present invention provides kits for storing or delivering the enzymes of the present invention and\/or the reaction components necessary to practice a cleavage assay (e.g., the INVADER assay). By way of example, and not intending to limit the kits of the present invention to any particular configuration or combination of components, the following section describes one embodiment of a kit for practicing the present invention:","In some embodiments, the kits of the present invention provide the following reagents:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0170"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"CLEAVASE enzyme","Primary Probe Oligos"]},{"entry":[{},"DNA Reaction Buffer 1","INVADER Oligo"]},{"entry":[{},{},"FRET Cassette 1 (e.g., F)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"FRET Cassette 2 (e.g., R)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mutant DNA controls"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Wild type DNA controls"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cNo Target\u201d Blank control"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0171"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"CLEAVASE enzyme","Primary Probe"]},{"entry":[{},{},"oligonucleotides"]},{"entry":[{},"DNA Reaction Buffer 1","INVADER Oligo"]},{"entry":[{},{},"FRET Probe 1 (e.g., F)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"FRET Probe 2 (e.g., R)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Secondary Reaction Target 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Secondary Reaction Target 2"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ARRESTOR oligonucleotide 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ARRESTOR oligonucleotide 2"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mutant DNA controls"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Wild type DNA controls"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u201cNo Target\u201d Blank control"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"An additional consideration has to do with undesired effects resulting from particular combinations of oligonucleotides in a single reaction. One such effect is target-independent generation of background signal. Certain oligonucleotides in combination with others may generate signal in the INVADER assay in the absence of the particular target being detected. Separation of these oligonucleotide combinations into different pools can be used to alleviate this effect. Similarly, certain oligonucleotide combinations can artificially repress signal generation from a desired target. Again, separation of these combinations into different pools can alleviate this effect.","The designs of the probes sets (e.g., the oligonucleotides and\/or their sequences) are adapted for use in miRNA detection assays using the guidelines for reaction design and optimization provided herein (See e.g., the Experimental Section).

The concentration of a 100-ng sample should be 15 ng\/\u03bcl.","B. Rolling Circle Replication","In other embodiments, rolling circle replication methods (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) are utilized for detection of miRNA detection structures (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,344,329; 6,143,495; 6,316,229; 6,210,884, 6,183,960 and 6,235,502; each of which is herein incorporated by reference). In some embodiments, rolling circle replication is used to detect circular miRNA detection structures generated from the annealing of the ends of a single oligonucleotide annealed to a miRNA. In some embodiments, the ends of the oligonucleotide hybridize to the miRNA with no overlap. This oligonucleotide can be ligated in the presence or absence of miRNA. However, the ligation reaction is more efficient in the presence of the miRNA. In such embodiments, the level of circular molecules detected over time is compared to a control reaction lacking miRNA.","In other embodiments, the ends of the oligonucleotide hybridize to the miRNA with overlapping ends to generate an invasive cleavage structure. Such structures are cleaved prior to ligation, thus improving the specificity of the generation of the circular detection structure.","Rolling circle amplification (RCA) involves replication of circular single-stranded DNA molecules. In RCA, a rolling circle replication primer hybridizes to circular nucleic acid molecules followed by rolling circle replication of the nucleic acid molecules using a strand-displacing DNA polymerase. Amplification takes place during rolling circle replication in a single reaction cycle. Rolling circle replication results in large DNA molecules containing tandem repeats of the nucleic acid sequence. This DNA molecule is referred to as a tandem sequence DNA (TS-DNA).","In some embodiments, ligation-mediated rolling circle amplification (LM-RCA), which involves a ligation operation prior to replication, is utilized. In the ligation operation, an probe hybridizes to its cognate target nucleic acid sequence, if present, followed by ligation of the ends of the hybridized probe to form a covalently closed, single-stranded nucleic acid. After ligation, a rolling circle replication primer hybridizes to probe molecules followed by rolling circle replication of the circular molecules using a strand-displacing DNA polymerase. Generally, LM-RCA comprises mixing an open circle probe with a target sample, resulting in an probe-target sample mixture, and incubating the probe-target sample mixture under conditions promoting hybridization between the open circle probe and a target sequence, mixing ligase with the probe-target sample mixture, resulting in a ligation mixture, and incubating the ligation mixture under conditions promoting ligation of the open circle probe to form an amplification target circle (ATC), mixing a rolling circle replication primer (RCRP) with the ligation mixture, resulting in a primer-ATC mixture, and incubating the primer-ATC mixture under conditions that promote hybridization between the amplification target circle and the rolling circle replication primer, mixing DNA polymerase with the primer-ATC mixture, resulting in a polymerase-ATC mixture, and incubating the polymerase-ATC mixture under conditions promoting replication of the amplification target circle, where replication of the amplification target circle results in formation of tandem sequence DNA (TS-DNA).","C. Additional Detection Methods","The present invention is not limited to INVADER assay or rolling circle assay detection. Any method that allows for the detection of miRNA detection structures may be utilized. Exemplary, non-limiting detection assay that find use in the methods of the present invention are described below.","1. Hybridization Assays","In some embodiments of the present invention, detection structures are detected using a hybridization assay. In a hybridization assay, the presence of absence of a given nucleic acid sequence is determined based on the ability of the DNA from the sample to hybridize to a complementary DNA molecule (e.g., a oligonucleotide probe). A variety of hybridization assays using a variety of technologies for hybridization and detection are available. A description of a selection of assays is provided below.","a. Detection of Hybridization Using \u201cDNA Chip\u201d Assays","In some embodiments of the present invention, sequences are detected using a DNA chip hybridization assay. In this assay, a series of oligonucleotide probes are affixed to a solid support. The oligonucleotide probes are designed to be unique to a given target sequence (e.g., component of a detection complex). The sample of interest is contacted with the DNA \u201cchip\u201d and hybridization is detected.","In some embodiments, the DNA chip assay is a GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.; See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,045,996; 5,925,525; and 5,858,659; each of which is herein incorporated by reference) assay. The GeneChip technology uses miniaturized, high-density arrays of oligonucleotide probes affixed to a \u201cchip.\u201d Probe arrays are manufactured by Affymetrix's light-directed chemical synthesis process, which combines solid-phase chemical synthesis with photolithographic fabrication techniques employed in the semiconductor industry. Using a series of photolithographic masks to define chip exposure sites, followed by specific chemical synthesis steps, the process constructs high-density arrays of oligonucleotides, with each probe in a predefined position in the array. Multiple probe arrays are synthesized simultaneously on a large glass wafer. The wafers are then diced, and individual probe arrays are packaged in injection-molded plastic cartridges, which protect them from the environment and serve as chambers for hybridization.","The nucleic acid to be analyzed is isolated, amplified by PCR, and labeled with a fluorescent reporter group. The labeled DNA is then incubated with the array using a fluidics station. The array is then inserted into the scanner, where patterns of hybridization are detected. The hybridization data are collected as light emitted from the fluorescent reporter groups already incorporated into the target, which is bound to the probe array. Probes that perfectly match the target generally produce stronger signals than those that have mismatches. Since the sequence and position of each probe on the array are known, by complementarity, the identity of the target nucleic acid applied to the probe array can be determined.","In other embodiments, a DNA microchip containing electronically captured probes (Nanogen, San Diego, Calif.) is utilized (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,017,696; 6,068,818; and 6,051,380; each of which are herein incorporated by reference). Through the use of microelectronics, Nanogen's technology enables the active movement and concentration of charged molecules to and from designated test sites on its semiconductor microchip. DNA capture probes unique to a given target sequence are electronically placed at, or \u201caddressed\u201d to, specific sites on the microchip. Since DNA has a strong negative charge, it can be electronically moved to an area of positive charge.","First, a test site or a row of test sites on the microchip is electronically activated with a positive charge. Next, a solution containing the DNA probes is introduced onto the microchip. The negatively charged probes rapidly move to the positively charged sites, where they concentrate and are chemically bound to a site on the microchip. The microchip is then washed and another solution of distinct DNA probes is added until the array of specifically bound DNA probes is complete.","A test sample is then analyzed for the presence of target sequences by determining which of the DNA capture probes hybridize, with target sequences. An electronic charge is also used to move and concentrate target molecules to one or more test sites on the microchip. The electronic concentration of sample DNA at each test site promotes rapid hybridization of sample DNA with complementary capture probes (hybridization may occur in minutes). To remove any unbound or nonspecifically bound DNA from each site, the polarity or charge of the site is reversed to negative, thereby forcing any unbound or nonspecifically bound DNA back into solution away from the capture probes. A laser-based fluorescence scanner is used to detect binding.","In still further embodiments, an array technology based upon the segregation of fluids on a flat surface (chip) by differences in surface tension (ProtoGene, Palo Alto, Calif.) is utilized (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,001,311; 5,985,551; and 5,474,796; each of which is herein incorporated by reference). Protogene's technology is based on the fact that fluids can be segregated on a flat surface by differences in surface tension that have been imparted by chemical coatings. Once so segregated, oligonucleotide probes are synthesized directly on the chip by ink-jet printing of reagents. The array with its reaction sites defined by surface tension is mounted on a X\/Y translation stage under a set of four piezoelectric nozzles, one for each of the four standard DNA bases. The translation stage moves along each of the rows of the array and the appropriate reagent is delivered to each of the reaction sites. For example, the A amidite is delivered only to the sites where amidite A is to be coupled during that synthesis step and so on. Common reagents and washes are delivered by flooding the entire surface and then removing them by spinning.","DNA probes unique for the target sequence (e.g., component of a detection complex) of interest are affixed to the chip using Protogene's technology. The chip is then contacted with the PCR-amplified genes of interest. Following hybridization, unbound DNA is removed and hybridization is detected using any suitable method (e.g., by fluorescence de-quenching of an incorporated fluorescent group).","In yet other embodiments, a \u201cbead array\u201d is used for the detection of polymorphisms (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.; See e.g., PCT Publications WO 99\/67641 and WO 00\/39587, each of which is herein incorporated by reference). Illumina uses a BEAD ARRAY technology that combines fiber optic bundles and beads that self-assemble into an array. Each fiber optic bundle contains thousands to millions of individual fibers depending on the diameter of the bundle. The beads are coated with an oligonucleotide specific for the detection of a given SNP or mutation. Batches of beads are combined to form a pool specific to the array. To perform an assay, the BEAD ARRAY is contacted with a prepared subject sample (e.g., nucleic acid sample). Hybridization is detected using any suitable method.","b. Enzymatic Detection of Hybridization","In some embodiments of the present invention, hybridization is detected by enzymatic cleavage of specific structures.","In some embodiments, hybridization of a bound probe is detected using a TaqMan assay (PE Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.; See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,962,233 and 5,538,848, each of which is herein incorporated by reference). The assay is performed during a PCR reaction. The TaqMan assay exploits the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity of the AMPLITAQ GOLD DNA polymerase. A probe, specific for a given allele or mutation, is included in the PCR reaction. The probe consists of an oligonucleotide with a 5\u2032-reporter dye (e.g., a fluorescent dye) and a 3\u2032-quencher dye. During PCR, if the probe is bound to its target, the 5\u2032-3\u2032 nucleolytic activity of the AMPLITAQ GOLD polymerase cleaves the probe between the reporter and the quencher dye. The separation of the reporter dye from the quencher dye results in an increase of fluorescence. The signal accumulates with each cycle of PCR and can be monitored with a fluorimeter.","In still further embodiments, polymorphisms are detected using the SNP-IT primer extension assay (Orchid Biosciences, Princeton, N.J.; See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,952,174 and 5,919,626, each of which is herein incorporated by reference). In this assay, SNPs are identified by using a specially synthesized DNA primer and a DNA polymerase to selectively extend the DNA chain by one base at the suspected SNP location. DNA in the region of interest is amplified and denatured. Polymerase reactions are then performed using miniaturized systems called microfluidics. Detection is accomplished by adding a label to the nucleotide suspected of being at the target sequence location. Incorporation of the label into the DNA can be detected by any suitable method (e.g., if the nucleotide contains a biotin label, detection is via a fluorescently labeled antibody specific for biotin).","2.

Design of Oligonucleotides to Detect GAPDH and U6 RNA","In some circumstances, it may be desirable to co-detect, e.g. in a biplex assay, an RNA generally present in all cells at constant levels along with one or more miRNA species, which may be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. INVADER assays were therefore designed to two distinct RNAs generally found in all cell types: human glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (hGAPDH) and U6 RNA.","In the case of hGAPDH, the following oligonucleotides have been used in biplex miRNA detection assays: INVADER oligonucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 41); probe (SEQ ID NO: 42); ARRESTOR oligonucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 43); SRT oligonucleotide (SEQ ID NO:49), FRET oligonucleotide (red dye) (SEQ ID NO: 48).","In the case of U6, sequence alignments of the U6 RNAs of 8 diverse species from to mouse to to humans to identify a region suitable for the design of a \u201cuniversal\u201d INVADER assay. The alignment is shown in ; the oligonucleotide sequences created to detect this sequence are SEQ ID NOs: 93-95.","Initial experiments carried out with these oligonucleotides on cell lysates using SEQ ID NOs: 45-47 demonstrated that signal from U6 reactions reached saturation well before miRNA signal, possibly owing to large quantities of U6 RNA in cells. Therefore, titration reactions were carried out to determine whether diluting the probe and INVADER oligonucleotide concentrations would render this probe set suitable for use in biplex miRNA detection assays with INVADER and probe final concentrations ranging from 1 \u03bcM to 12.5 nM. Final concentrations of the INVADER and probe oligonucleotides between 12.5-50 nM were suitable for biplex miRNA detection for miR-1d and let-7a. ARRESTOR, SRT, and FRET probe concentrations were as described in the previous examples. Further experiments demonstrate that detection of U6 RNA with the \u201cuniversal\u201d U6 RNA oligonucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 93-95) is comparable to detection with SEQ ID NOs: 45-47.","A.

Otherwise, none of the alternative design oligonucleotide sets offered any improvement over the original designs. It is noteworthy that the combination of an all-DNA INVADER oligonucleotide with the original chimeric probe oligonucleotide gave FOZ values approximately equivalent to those obtained with both chimeric probe and INVADER oligonucleotides. In some applications, substitution of an all DNA INVADER oligonucleotide may be desirable to reduce oligonucleotide synthesis costs and may be made without sacrificing limit of detection.","Further experiments demonstrated that it is possible to compensate for sub-optimal signal generation with particular oligonucleotide sets by adding more RNA (e.g. lysate, purified total RNA, synthetic miRNA) to the reaction. Similarly, additional experiments in which various oligonucleotides (i.e. probe, INVADER, ARRESTOR, or various combinations thereof) were gel purified as described in Example 1 indicated that standard gel purification of all three types of oligonucleotides gives maximal signal. It is possible to achieve signal levels approximately equal to the maximal levels with gel purified probes if the other oligonucleotides, i.e. the INVADER and ARRESTOR oligonucleotides, are desalted following synthesis.","This example describes experiments carried out to test the suitability of the INVADER assay to detect different miRNA species in total RNA extracted from diverse tissue types.

Total RNA was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, Calif., catalog number K4008-1, Human Total RNA Master Panel II). For let-7a, 50 ng of total RNA was tested in each reaction; for the other miRNA species, 100 ng of total RNA was tested. All reactions were set up as described in Example 8; primary reactions were run at the temperature optima for 1.5 hours; secondary reactions were as described above. The gene expression profiles for each miRNA species are presented in . These results indicate that the INVADER assay can be used to examine miRNA expression in different tissue types. These data further suggest that let-7a and miR-125b are expressed in a wide variety of tissues; the other miRNA species appear to be more specific to a limited number of tissue types.","This example describes the impact of alterations in probe and INVADER oligonucleotide length on detection of the let-7a 22-nt miRNA. In particular, these experiments compare detection of an miRNA that forms perfect stacking interactions between the ends of the probe and INVADER oligonucleotides to detection of an miRNA that forms both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overlaps as well as to one that results in a single nucleotide gap at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0295","num":"0328"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},"INVADER assays were set up to test the performance of these oligonucleotide sets for detection of synthetic let-7a miRNAs.

Primary reactions were run for 15 minutes at 53\u00b0 C.; secondary reactions, for 5 minutes at 60\u00b0 C., as described in Example 2. The results are presented in .","These data indicate that in this experiment, a single nucleotide overlap at both ends of the miRNA target resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in signal generation as well as a reduction of 2\u00b0 C. in optimal temperature. A one nucleotide gap at both ends of the target, however, did not reduce signal generation, though it did reduce the optimal reaction temperature by 5\u00b0 C.","Experiments were carried out to determine whether the INVADER miRNA assay discriminated the miRNA target itself from both its precursor RNA and from the DNA encoding the miRNA.","A. Precursor Cross-reactivity Test","Precursor let-7 RNA (SEQ ID NO: 87) was transcribed in vitro and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to determine whether it contained any fragments that might mimic the let-7a miRNA. The shortest contaminating fragment was estimated to be approximately 45 nt. LOD reactions were run essentially as described in Example 3 at precursor or synthetic 5\u2032 P let-7a mi-RNA concentrations as indicated in the table below. PI mixes contained 10 \u03bcM probe SEQ ID NO: 6 and 100 \u03bcM INVADER oligonucleotide SEQ ID NO: 5. Primary reactions were run at 53\u00b0 C. for 1 hour; secondary reactions were run at 58\u00b0 C. for 1 hour with secondary reaction mixes essentially as described in Example 3 (FRET probe SEQ ID NO: 21, SRT SEQ ID NO: 22, and ARRESTOR SEQ ID NO: 7). The results of this experiment indicated that this miRNA assay is approximately 4% cross reactive vs. the precursor RNA.","B. Discrimination of RNA vs. DNA Signal","Reactions were run to detect let-7a miRNA in cell lysates as described in Example 7. Prior to detection with the INVADER assay, aliquots 1 \u03bcl of 8 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl RNAse A (Qiagen, Inc.) were added to 80 \u03bcl of cell lysate and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2.25 hours. The RNAse A treated samples failed to generate any signal above background, indicating that signal generated in assays lacking RNAse A arises from detection of the miRNA target and not the encoding DNA (). Further experiments were carried out in which RNAse A was added either prior to the primary reaction or prior to the secondary reaction. When RNAse A was added prior to the primary reaction, no signal was generated, consistent with the previous results. When RNAse A was added subsequent to the primary reaction, no loss of signal was observed, further indicating that the signal being detected is due to RNA and that there is no adverse effect of RNAse on other reaction components, e.g. the CLEAVASE enzyme.","Oligonucleotide designs were created for miR-124a. These oligonucleotides can be used to detect two naturally occurring miRNAs\u2014one 21 nt in length and the other, 22 nt.","Temperature optimization reactions were set up, essentially as described in Example 3, using 1 nM of synthetic miRNA target, 25 primary reaction and a 15 minute secondary reaction. The oligonucleotides used in these reactions are listed in  (SEQ ID NOs: 90-92). Temperature profiles for the two different length miRNA targets are shown in  and indicate that the same oligonucleotide designs can be used to detect both targets.","Approaches similar to those described in the preceding examples may similarly be used to detect siRNAs.  illustrates two alternative INVADER assay designs for detection of a \u03b2-actin siRNA.

Thus, various oligonucleotides were designed herein for the detection and characterization of miRNAs associated with cancer. These oligonucleotides are depicted in  (where m=2\u2032-O-Methyl; r=ribose (to indicate RNA instead of DNA)).","Experiments were conducted in order to detect and characterize miRNAs using reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and invasive cleavage reaction assay (e.g., in a two-step or single-step reaction (e.g., in a single tube)). Chemistries utilized for these assays (e.g., single-step RT, PCR and invasive cleavage reactions) are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,913,881; 6,875,572, 6,872,816, and 7,011,944, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/266,723, filed Nov. 3, 2005, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The general design for detection of miRNA using this methodology is shown in . Briefly, a reverse transcription (RT) primer oligonucleotide (that, in preferred embodiments, also serves as the INVADER oligonucleotide in an invasive cleavage reaction assay) and a reverse transcriptase are used to reverse transcribe (into cDNA) a target RNA (e.g., miRNA), and, subsequently (e.g., in a two-step assay) or concurrently (e.g., in a one-step assay (e.g., in a single tube)), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer oligonucleotide and DNA polymerase are used for amplification of the cDNA product in the presence of primary probe thereby enabling formation of a detection structure (e.g., that can be detected by an invasive cleavage reaction assay).","During development of the present invention, multiple factors were examined and characterized in order to optimize miRNA detection capability and sensitivity using an assay that comprises a reverse transcription reaction, a polymerase chain reaction and an invasive cleavage assay reaction. These include the length (e.g., through oligonucleotide design) of the RT primer\/miRNA duplex formed (e.g., between 4 and 10 (e.g., between 6 and 7) base-pairs); the copy number of miRNA available in a sample for detection; the length (e.g., through oligonucleotide design) of the PCR forward primer\/miRNA duplex formed (e.g., between 4 and 10 (e.g., between 7 and 9) base-pairs); concentration of oligonucleotides used; reaction temperature at which assays could be conducted; the influence of stacker oligonucleotides (e.g., oligonucleotides that bind to the RT primer\/INVADER oligo or PCR primer); use of oligonucleotides that form hairpin structures; the use of a single-step or two-step assay configuration; the effect of INVADER primary probe length (e.g., between 8 and 10) base pairs; the ability of the assay to discriminate between variants (e.g., mutants) of a single miRNA species; and the ability of the assay to detect more than one miRNA in a single reaction (e.g., biplex assay).","A) Length of RT-primer\/miRNA Duplexes","Various lengths of RT-primer\/miRNA duplexes were tested and characterized. To test the effect of RT primer-miRNA duplex length with the ability to detect miRNA, oligonucleotides were designed for use as RT primers such that duplexes of 6 or 7 base pairs formed between the RT primer and miRNA. These primers were tested for performance in triplicate using varying levels of let-7a miRNA molecules per reaction (e.g., 300,000, 50,000, 8,333, 1,389, 231, 39, and 0). Reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 0.5 \u03bcM of forward PCR primer 2343-16-01, 0.034 units\/\u03bcL native Taq polymerase, 2 units\/\u03bcl of MMLV reverse transcriptase, and 6.67 ng\/ul of CLEAVASE VIII enzyme in a buffer containing 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM MgCl, and 25 uM dNTPs. For the 6 base pair duplex length, 0.5 \u03bcM of RT primer 2343-14-01, 0.5 \u03bcM probe 2343-14-05, 0.25 \u03bcM FRET probe 23-211 were added to the reaction mix. For the 7 base pair duplex length, 0.5 \u03bcM of RT primer 2343-03-01, 0.5 \u03bcM probe 2343-14-08, 0.25 \u03bcM FRET probe 23-755 were added to the reaction mix. Reactions were assembled in a 96-well skirted plate, covered with 10 uL of mineral oil. The plate was then subjected to single steps of 42\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes followed by 95\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes, and 30 cycles of 95\u00b0 C. for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0 C. for 15 seconds, 72\u00b0 C. for 45 seconds. After completion of the cycles, the reaction plate was heated to 99\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes then cooled down to 50\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes then read on a Cytofluor plate reader using excitation and

the present invention provides that, when comparing the same copy number of let-7a per reaction, the net signal is higher for 7 base-pair RT primer-miRNA duplex than for the 6 base-pair RT primer-miRNA duplex, although a shorter duplex provides levels of signal sufficient for detection. Accordingly, in some embodiments, assays of the present invention (e.g., comprising a reverse transcription reaction, a polymerase chain reaction, and an invasive cleavage assay reaction and a detection structure) are able to detect miRNA targets when oligonucleotides with short (e.g., less than 10 nucleotides; less than 8 nucleotides; or less than 7 nucleotides) regions of homology between RT primer\/INVADER oligonucleotides and miRNA target are used. In some embodiments, the RT primer\/INVADER oligonucleotide comprises other sequence that does not form a duplex (e.g., that is not complementary) with the target miRNA. In some embodiments, the other sequence that does not form a duplex forms a hairpin structure (e.g., sequence within the sequence that does not form a duplex with the target RNA is able to fold back and bind with itself).","Accordingly, in some embodiments, RT primer\/INVADER oligonucleotides are designed such that a 6 base-pair duplex is formed between the oligonucleotide and the miRNA target. In some embodiments, RT primer oligonucleotides are designed such that a 7 base-pair duplex is formed between the oligonucleotide and the miRNA target. Although an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention and the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism of action, an increased length of duplex formation between the RT primer and miRNA target provides a more readily formable detection structure (e.g., when the RT primer oligonucleotide is also used as the primary INVADER oligonucleotide as described in ) that in turn provides a higher net signal compared to shorter duplexes.","B) Detection of Low Levels of miRNA","Experiments to determine the scope of the level of detection utilized various levels of miR-16 miRNA ranging from 3\u00d710to 2 copies per reaction tested using 25 \u03bcL reaction volumes.

the present invention demonstrates that the performance of detection assays for miRNA (e.g., comprising a reverse transcription reaction, a polymerase chain reaction and a invasive cleavage assay reaction and a detection structure) decreases as the PCR primer-miRNA duplex length decreases from 9 to 7 base pairs.

In some embodiments, the primer oligonucleotide comprises other sequence that does not form a duplex (e.g., that is not complementary) with the target miRNA or cDNA generated therefrom. In some embodiments, the other sequence that does not form a duplex forms a hairpin structure (e.g., sequence within the sequence that does not form a duplex with the target sequence or cDNA generated therefrom is able to fold back and bind with itself).","D) Detection of Let-7a miRNA Using Single or Multiple Probes","Levels of Let-7a miRNA ranging from 3\u00d710to 3 molecules per reaction were tested employing the following two probes 2343-14-02 at 0.5 \u03bcM and 2343-14-03 at 40 nM in reactions where one of the probes was present or both.
