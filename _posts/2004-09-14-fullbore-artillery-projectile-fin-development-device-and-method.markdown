Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to guided projectiles, and more particularly to a fin-stabilized guided projectile.","2. Description of the Related Art","Generally, artillery projectiles launched from cannons require mechanical and aerodynamic stabilization to assure a predictable trajectory. Until recently, most artillery projectiles were generally stabilized by means of angular momentum (spinning inertia). This technique commonly referred to as spin stabilization, is achieved by spinning the projectile about its longitudinal axis as it translates along the bore of the cannon.  shows an example of the general configuration of a conventional spin stabilized projectile consisting of an ogive  adjacent to a forward bore rider , which is next to a shell body  that is adjacent to an obturating (gas-sealing) rotating band , which is adjacent to a tailboom  all formed and spinning about the longitudinal axis of the spin stabilized projectile during flight. This rotation (spin) motion is achieved by mechanical contact between the helical rifling grooves and lands engraved on the surface of the cannon bore mating with a deformable metallic or polymeric ring of material, referred to as the rotating band  mounted on the rear of the projectile.","In practice, this motion causes the projectile to spin about the longitudinal axis of the projectile thereby acquiring some magnitude of angular momentum that is conserved (retained) as the projectile exits the muzzle. One disadvantage associated with the spin stabilization method is the potential for excessive angular acceleration imparted to the entire projectile. The associated axial and centrifugal loads may result in prohibitively high inertial forces acting on projectile components.","Additionally, the potential to over-stabilize the projectile, which may prevent tip-over at the point of apogee, exists with spin-stabilized projectiles. In these cases, the projectile may approach or impact the target at an orientation other than nose (ogive ) first thereby resulting in a malfunction and a failed or delayed detonation. Another characteristic of over-stabilized projectiles is their tendency to drift off their intended trajectories resulting in excessive dispersion and\/or unintended collateral damage.","Artillery projectile designers have applied the fin stabilization technique in an effort to diminish or eliminate some of the disadvantages associated with spin-stabilized projectiles. Fin-stabilized projectiles have the advantage of operating in a uniaxial acceleration loading environment (as opposed to the dual acceleration environment, axial and angular, of the spin-stabilized projectiles).  shows a conventional fin-stabilized projectile with the fins  configured as they would be during flight.","Fin stabilization has proven successful in the past and is considered an enhancement to both direct fire and indirect fire munitions. One of the major advantages to this technique is that a single smoothbore cannon can be used conventionally for high velocity direct fire fin stabilized kinetic energy penetrators (mounted in sabots) in addition to launching the relatively lower velocity full bore indirect fire artillery projectiles.","A disadvantage of the fin stabilization method is that the fins must be capable of assuming a stowed configuration for translation through the bore of the cannon during launch, and a deployed configuration for aerodynamic stability during flight. Conventional full-bore fin stabilized artillery projectiles usually employ some form of a complex mechanism requiring on-board energy sources or powered mechanisms such as electric batteries, motors, solenoids, squibs (explosives) or spring-loaded (pre-compressed) mechanical devices. Some potential complications associated with these devices include a possible requirement that they integrate precise timing mechanisms or electrical circuits to activate and deploy the fins within a short distance after the projectile exits the muzzle of the cannon. Therefore, there remains a need for a novel full-bore artillery projectile fin deployment mechanism which is not dependent on the use of any electromechanical or complicated stored potential energy actuation devices.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment of the invention provides a full-bore artillery projectile fin deployment device comprising at least one projectile stabilization fin comprising an aperture and a movable pawl; a rod comprising a head portion and a shaft portion terminating with a beveled tip configured for engaging the pawl; a tailboom configured for housing the fin, wherein the tailboom comprises a hollow bore configured for receiving the rod; a pin slotted through the aperture of the fin and attaching the fin to the tailboom; and a bias member adjacent to the head portion of the rod. In one embodiment, the rod is slotted to simultaneously engage a plurality of fins. The tailboom comprises a forward end and a rearward end and a slot configured for permitting the fin to articulate out of the tailboom, and wherein the tailboom connects to a projectile.","Additionally, the tailboom further comprises a receptacle configured for housing the bias member and a boss configured for limiting the rods translation in the direction towards the rearward end of the tailboom. Moreover, propulsion of the projectile exerts acceleration loads on the rod, wherein the (pressure) causes the rod to translate in a direction towards the rearward end of the tailboom thereby causing the rod to engage the pawl, and wherein the (pressure) causes the head portion of the rod to apply a compressive force on the bias member configured for storing energy. The bias member is configured for releasing stored energy thereby causing the rod to translate in a direction towards the forward end of the tailboom, wherein forward translation of the rod causes a contact surface of the beveled tip to engage the pawl causing the fin to deploy from the slot.","Another aspect of the invention provides a projectile comprising at least one deployable fin comprising an aperture and a deflectable pawl; a rod comprising a beveled tip configured for engaging the pawl; a housing unit comprising a forward end, a rearward end, and a hollow bore longitudinally configured between the forward end and the rearward end, wherein the hollow bore is configured for receiving the rod; a pin slotted through the aperture and attaching the fin to the housing unit, wherein the pin rotationally mounts the fin to the housing unit; and a bias member engaging the rod, wherein the forward end corresponds with a forward direction of movement of the projectile and a rearward end corresponds with a rearward direction opposite the forward direction, and wherein the housing unit comprises a slot configured for permitting the fin to articulate out of the housing unit.","Furthermore, propulsion of the projectile exerts pressure (acceleration loads) on the rod, wherein the pressure causes the rod to translate in a rearward direction causing the rod to engage the pawl, wherein the pressure causes the rod to apply a compressive force on the bias member configured for storing energy, wherein the bias member is configured for releasing stored energy thereby causing the rod to translate in a forward direction, and wherein forward translation of the rod causes a contact surface of the beveled tip to engage the pawl causing the fin to deploy from the slot. Moreover, the housing unit further comprises a receptacle configured for housing the bias member and a boss configured for limiting the rod to translate in the rearward direction. Additionally, the rod is configured to simultaneously engage a plurality of fins. Also, the projectile further comprises a nose portion, a forward bore rider adjacent to the nose portion, a shell body adjacent to the forward bore rider, and an obturator disposed between the shell body and the housing unit, wherein the housing unit forms a tailboom of the projectile.","Another embodiment of the invention provides a method of deploying a fin from a full-bore artillery projectile, wherein the method comprises positioning a rotatable fin in a tailboom of the projectile, wherein the fin comprises a deflectable pawl; positioning a rod in the tailboom, wherein the rod comprises a beveled tip; exerting pressure on the rod causing the beveled tip to engage the pawl; removing the pressure from the rod; and translating the beveled tip to re-engage the pawl causing the fin to rotate out of the tailboom, wherein the projectile travels in a forward direction. Moreover, the pressure is exerted by propulsion of the projectile in the forward direction, wherein the pressure causes the rod to translate in a direction opposite the forward direction, wherein the pressure causes the rod to apply a compressive force on a bias member configured for storing energy, and wherein the bias member releases stored energy thereby causing the rod to translate in a forward direction.","The embodiments of the invention provide a device that deploys projectile stabilization fins at the appropriate time without the use of any active mechanical or electronic timing or actuation devices. The embodiments of the invention contrast conventional designs because no internally-stored energy or power source such as fuels or complex actuation devices are required. Additionally, no electromechanical mechanisms such as motors, timers or electronic circuits are required for the timing of the deployment of the stabilization fins. Rather, according to the embodiments of the invention, the impetus for fin deployment activation is the acceleration of the projectile and the associated inertial set-back forces occurring during launch. The mechanics of the embodiments of the invention results in inertial forces acting on the invention's components which results in appropriately timed fin deployment.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.","As mentioned, there remains a need for a novel full-bore artillery projectile fin deployment mechanism which is not dependent on the use of any complex electro-mechanical actuation devices. The embodiments of the invention solve this need by providing a mechanism for the deployment of the fins of a fin stabilized full-bore artillery projectile launched from a smoothbore cannon. The invention's novel mechanism includes an arrangement of mechanical devices that are activated by set-back accelerations occurring within the projectile during launch from a smoothbore cannon. As such, the power source for the embodiments of the invention is the naturally occurring projectile launch accelerations.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention. According to an embodiment of the invention, a full-bore fin stabilized artillery projectile , as illustrated in , comprises an ogive  adjacent to a forward bore rider . The forward bore rider  is next to a shell body , which is adjacent to an obturating (gas-sealing) rotating band (obturator) . The obturator  is adjacent to a tailboom .  further illustrates a fin  in the deployed configuration attached to the tailboom  of the fin-stabilized projectile . The tailboom  further comprises slots , which the fins  rotate out of during the fin deployment action. For ease of understanding, four fins  are illustrated in the figures and in the accompanying descriptions herein. However, those skilled in the art would readily understand that any number of fins  could be used in conjunction with the embodiments of the invention.","As illustrated in , each of the four fins  includes a through-hole  to allow a rotational degree of freedom for deployment after the projectile  exits the muzzle of the cannon (not shown). Preferably, at muzzle exit the fins  rotate out of the tailboom  and perform their function as aerodynamic control surfaces for stabilized projectile flight.","This fin deployment action preferably occurs within a short time (as soon as the physics of motion allow; (i.e., preferably deployment occurs as soon as the projectile  clears the cannon bore (not shown) and muzzle break (if so equipped)) after muzzle exit to minimize projectile yaw so the projectile  maintains its intended trajectory. Further, the fins  preferably do not deploy too soon as contact would likely occur between the fin material and the bore surface of the cannon or one of many internal surfaces of a muzzle brake (not shown). Specifically, the fins  preferably do not deploy any time prior to complete exit of the projectile  from the cannon.","Additionally, as further illustrated in , each of the fins  also preferably feature a prismatic piece of spring steel (or suitable substitute) which functions as a pawl . The tip  of the pawl  is capable of bending rearward from its initial non-deformed position but is not capable of bending forward past its initial non-deformed position relative to the directions shown in . This limited bending capability is achieved by notching the fin  in such a manner as to support a bearing load on the forward side (the side the pawl  cannot bend towards) and removing most of the material (notch ) on the rearward side (to allow deflection of the pawl  in the rearward direction).  shows the pawl  in the unloaded position while  shows the same fin  with the pawl  in the loaded or deflected position.","The sequence of events leading to the various configurations assumed by the components during the successful application of the embodiments of the invention includes the following three steps. In the first step, which can be described as the pre-launch condition, the fins  are positioned in the slotted tailboom .  shows a cross-section of the slotted tailboom  and the position of two of the four fins  in the pre-launch configuration. The fins  are mounted on dowel pins  which pass through the through-hole  of each fin  as well as the body of the slotted tailboom . The dowel pins  permit rotation of the fin  in the plane in which the fins  lie. A central hollow bore  is included in the tailboom  to accommodate a plunger rod . Moreover, the tailboom  includes a receptacle  configured for housing a bias member  (shown in ).","The slotted plunger rod , which is shown separately in , comprises a generally flat weighted head portion . Moreover, a shaft  extends from the head portion . In one embodiment, the shaft  is configured with four identical slotted sides, which are generally configured in rectangular block portions. The number of slotted sides is dependent on the number of fins . Again, for ease of understanding, four fins , and thus, four slotted sides of the shaft  are illustrated in the drawings and described herein. As shown in , the central hollow bore  of the tailboom  includes four slotted guides  to accept each one of the rectangular block portions of the shaft  of the plunger rod . Similarly, the number of slotted guides  is dependent on the number of fins . Alternatively, the shaft  may be cylindrically configured. As best seen in , the shaft  terminates with a generally cylindrical portion  with a notched end or beveled tip  having a catch surface  on the end opposite the head portion . The beveled tip  comprises four identical beveled sides (one bevel side surface per fin ).","The pre-launch position of the plunger rod  relative to the invention assembly is shown in .  also shows the bias member , preferably configured as a plunger rod return spring, which is positioned in the receptacle  (best seen in ), wherein the bias member  is positioned between the weighted head portion  of the plunger rod  and the forward surface  (best seen in ) of the slotted tailboom . In the pre-launch configuration, the beveled tip  of the plunger rod  is forward of the pawls  mounted to the individual fins .","The second step in the sequence of events occurs during the combustion of propellant when pressure acts on all exposed projectile components rear of the obturator . The pressure generated in the chamber of the cannon (not shown) acts normal to exposed surfaces of the tailboom  and the exposed edges of the fins . This pressure acts to keep the fins  in the tailboom  as the entire projectile  begins to accelerate along the bore of the cannon. In addition to the pressure acting to keep the fins  in the tailboom , the center of gravity of the fins  is, by design, inboard of the dowel pins  for each of the fins . This eccentricity between the dowel pins  and the center of gravity of the fins  act to create a moment force acting on the fin  causing rotation of the fin  inwards, toward the center of the projectile . Simple mechanical interference between the fin  and the presence of any material in the slotted tailboom  prevents excessive rotation of the fins  inward towards the centerline of the projectile .","While the projectile  accelerates forward, the inertial forces acting on all non-constrained internal components of the slotted tailboom  cause the non-constrained components to accelerate rearward relative to the projectile . In particular, the plunger rod  translates towards the rear of the projectile  and both impacts and causes the deflection of the tip  of each pawl .  depicts the exact instant the beveled tip  of the plunger rod  impacts and deflects the pawl  of each fin . A magnified view of the contact between the beveled tip  of the plunger rod  and the tips  of the pawls  is shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12"],"b":["114","111","109","109","116","112","111","111","111","112","111","161","105","114","111","109","109"]},"The third step in the sequence of events occurs after the projectile  has exited the muzzle of the cannon (not shown) and the projectile , as a whole, is no longer accelerating in the forward direction. Subject to this condition, the weighted head portion  of the plunger rod  no longer applies a compression force on the bias member . Thus, the bias member  begins to release its stored energy acquired by compression when the weighted head portion  of the plunger rod  translates rearward and compresses the bias member , and elongates thereby pushing on and causing the translation of the plunger rod  in the forward direction. As the plunger rod  translates forward, it generates forward momentum equal to the mass of the plunger rod  multiplied by the instantaneous velocity of the plunger rod . As such, as the plunger rod  translates forward, contact occurs between the pawls  mounted on each of the fins  and the catch surface  of the beveled tip  of the plunger rod .","Unlike the deflection of the pawls  occurring when the plunger rod  translated in the rearward direction, the pawls  are not capable of deflecting a sufficient amount to allow passage of the beveled tip  of the plunger rod  in the forward direction. Consequently, the contact force (or impact impulse) is applied from the forward translating beveled tip  of the plunger rod  to the rear surface  (best seen in ) of the pawls  resulting in a moment force (torque due to the eccentricity of the line of force of the impact relative to the constraint) being applied to the fins  thereby causing a rotation of the fins  about the dowel pins  fixed to the tailboom .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 4","FIG. 13"],"b":["111","157","109","109","129","114","111"]},"Because the bias member  has not fully recovered to its unloaded length at the time of impact between the pawls  of the stowed fins  and the beveled tip  of the plunger rod , the translation of the plunger rod  continues translating forward by rotating the fins  which contain the pawls  outboard from the tailboom  as part of the deployment action of the fin . The angular velocity of each of the four fins  can be estimated by equating the linear momentum of the plunger rod  to the angular momentum of the four fins  plus the post impact linear velocity of the plunger rod .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15"],"b":["106","111","116","111","106","171","106","100","100","106","106","106","106","105","106","107","105","111","103","106"]},"The embodiments of the invention include various configurations during and after projectile launch from a smoothbore gun tube (not shown). The translations of invention components occurring during launch are intentional and restricted in their translational and rotational degrees of freedom as described above to result in the deployment of the projectile stabilization fins . As previously described, the deployment of the fins  occurs after the projectile  has exited the launch cannon (not shown) and the acceleration of the projectile  has ceased. The velocity of the projectile  after exiting the muzzle of the cannon is sufficient for the projectile  to continue on its trajectory with fins  fully deployed. The accelerations and forces occurring during projectile launch provide the impetus for the invention's components to function as described above. Both the bias member  and the pawl  bear no loads or deformations in the pre-launch configuration and therefore are not sources of stored energy.","The lack of a stored energy source is a desirable feature from the perspective of desiring to acquire and store a reserve of fin stabilized artillery projectiles . More particularly, without stored energy sources, there is no need to maintain a stored energy device while in long term storage, which would require additional maintenance such as checking and replacing batteries, etc. Thus, without having stored energy sources, the embodiments of the invention facilitate the saving of money, time, and manpower resources, etc., and eliminate the risk of fin deployment system malfunctions as the embodiments of the invention deploy the fins  by naturally occurring acceleration loads; i.e., the projectile  accelerates in the cannon bore (not shown) while the fins  are stowed, and after muzzle exit, the projectile  no longer accelerates so the bias member , which retains its original strength because it was not stored in a compressed configuration, then powers the deployment of the projectile .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIGS. 3 through 15"],"b":["106","100","201","106","105","100","106","109","203","111","105","111","114","205","111","114","109","207","111","209","114","109","106","105","100","100","111","111","116","116","111"]},"Generally, the embodiments of the invention provide a device that deploys projectile stabilization fins  at the appropriate time without the use of any active mechanical or electronic timing or actuation devices. Specifically, the embodiments of the invention provide a device that deploys projectile stabilization fins , which is powered entirely by inertial accelerations occurring within the projectile during the launch event. Accordingly, the embodiments of the invention provide a projectile  or vehicle that changes geometric configurations after a launch operation during which time naturally occurring acceleration loads power an assembly or device which reconfigures the geometry of the projectile  after the acceleration loads are removed. The embodiments of the invention may be implemented in several applications such as: fins of an archer's arrow, air launched missiles, gun launched projectiles, and ground vehicles, etc.","The embodiments of the invention contrast conventional designs because no internally-stored energy or power source such as fuels or complex pre-compressed springs are required prior to launch.

The mechanics of the embodiments of the invention results in inertial forces acting on the invention's components which results in appropriately timed fin deployment. An appropriately timed fin deployment can be described as occurring after the projectile  has exited the cannon and is clear of interference with the cannon bore surface and muzzle brake features.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
