{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/719,497, filed Mar. 8, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,637,386, which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/177,372, filed May 12, 2009, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DAAL01-97-C-0108 awarded by Army Research Laboratories. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates microelectronic devices, and more particularly to edge termination for silicon carbide devices.","High voltage silicon carbide (SiC) devices can be capable of handling high voltages, and may handle as much as about 100 amps or more of current, depending on the size of their active area. High voltage SiC devices have a number of important applications, particularly in the field of power conditioning, distribution and control.","A conventional power device structure has an n-type SiC substrate on which an n\u2212 epitaxial layer, which functions as a drift region, is formed. The device typically includes a P-N and\/or Schottky junction on the n\u2212 layer, which acts as a main junction for blocking voltage in the reverse bias direction and providing current flow in the forward bias direction. A p-type junction termination extension (JTE) region, which is typically formed by ion implantation, may surround the main junction. The implants used to form the JTE region may be aluminum, boron, or any other suitable p-type dopant. The purpose of the JTE region is to reduce or prevent the electric field crowding at the edges, and to reduce or prevent the depletion region from interacting with the surface of the device. Surface effects may cause the depletion region to spread unevenly, which may adversely affect the breakdown voltage of the device. Other termination techniques include guard rings and floating field rings that may be more strongly influenced by surface effects. A channel stop region may also be formed by implantation of n-type dopants, such as nitrogen or phosphorus, in order to prevent\/reduce extension of the depletion region to the edge of the device.","Additional conventional terminations of SiC Schottky diodes are described in \u201cPlanar Terminations in 4H-SiC Schottky Diodes With Low Leakage And High Yields\u201d by Singh et al., ISPSD '97, pp. 157-160. A p-type epitaxy guard ring termination for a SiC Schottky Barrier Diode is described in \u201cThe Guard-Ring Termination for High-Voltage SiC Schottky Barrier Diodes\u201d by Ueno et al., IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 16, No. 7, July, 1995, pp. 331-332. Additionally, other termination techniques are described in published PCT Application No. WO 97\/08754 entitled \u201cSiC Semiconductor Device Comprising A PN Junction With A Voltage Absorbing Edge.\u201d","In addition to junction termination extension (JTE), multiple floating guard rings (MFGR) and field plates (FP) are commonly used termination schemes in high voltage silicon carbide devices. Another conventional edge termination technique is a mesa edge termination.","Field plate termination is also a conventional technique for edge termination of a device and may be cost-effective. In conventional field plate devices, high fields are supported by the oxide layer under the metal field plate. This technique performs well for silicon devices where the highest field in the semiconductor is relatively low. However, in SiC devices the electric fields in the blocking state may be very high (\u02dc2 MV\/cm) which multiplies by a factor of 2.5 at the oxide-semiconductor interface. This leads to very high oxide fields and may result in long-term reliability problems. Thus, field plate terminations may be unsuitable for use in SiC devices.","The use of multiple floating guard rings in addition to JTE has been proposed as a technique for reducing the sensitivity of the JTE to implant dose variation. See Kinoshita et al., \u201cGuard Ring Assisted RESURF: A New Termination Structure Providing Stable and High Breakdown Voltage for SiC Power Devices,\u201d Tech. Digest of ISPSD '02, pp. 253-256. Kinoshita et al. reported that such techniques reduced the sensitivity to implant dose variation. However, the area utilized for termination was increased to almost three times the area of JTE alone as the guard rings are added to both the inner edge of the JTE and the outside of the JTE.","A conventional JTE-terminated PIN diode is illustrated in . As shown therein, a PIN diode  includes an n\u2212 drift layer  between a p+ layer  and an n+ substrate .  illustrates one half of a PIN-structure; the structure may include mirror image portions (not shown). An anode contact  is on the p+ layer , and a cathode contact  is on the n+ substrate . A junction termination extension (JTE) region  including a plurality of JTE zones A, B, C is provided in the n\u2212 drift layer  adjacent the p+ layer . The JTE zones A, B, C are p-type regions that may have levels of charge that decrease outwardly in a stepwise fashion with distance from the PN junction between the p+ layer  and the n\u2212 drift layer . Although three JTE zones A, B, C are illustrated, more or fewer JTE zones may be provided.","The JTE zones A, B, C may be formed by successive implantation of ions into the n\u2212 drift layer . However, such implantation may require multiple mask and implantation steps, increasing the complexity and expense of production. This may be exacerbated as the number of JTE zones is increased. Furthermore, the stepwise doping gradient provided by such an approach may not provide an ideal termination.","Some embodiments provide methods of forming a junction termination extension for an electronic device including a main junction region. The methods include forming a mask on a semiconductor layer adjacent the main junction region, the semiconductor layer having a first conductivity type and the mask including a plurality of openings. A source of second conductivity type dopants is provided at the surface of the semiconductor layer, and the second conductivity type dopants are diffused into the semiconductor layer to form doped regions in the semiconductor layer corresponding to respective ones of the mask openings that coalesce while leaving dopant peaks in the semiconductor layer corresponding to respective ones of the mask openings near the surface of the silicon carbide layer. A near-surface region of the semiconductor layer that includes the dopant peaks is removed. The semiconductor layer may include a silicon carbide layer.","The mask openings may have respective areas that expose areas of a surface of the semiconductor layer that become smaller with lateral distance from the main junction region. The doped regions may provide a diffused junction termination region in the semiconductor layer having a lateral doping gradient that decreases with distance from the main junction region.","Removing the near-surface region of the silicon carbide layer may include removing material from the silicon carbide layer including the dopant peaks.","Providing the source of second conductivity type dopants may include implanting second conductivity type dopants into the silicon carbide layer.","Providing the source of second conductivity type dopants may include providing a vapor phase diffusion source of second conductivity dopants adjacent the silicon carbide layer under conditions selected to cause second conductivity dopants in the vapor phase diffusion source to diffuse into the silicon carbide layer.","Diffusing the second conductivity type dopants may include annealing the silicon carbide layer including the second conductivity type dopants at a temperature in excess of 1800\u00b0 C.","The methods may further include forming a graphite cap layer on the silicon carbide layer, annealing the silicon carbide layer may include annealing the silicon carbide layer and the graphite cap layer.","A peak concentration of second conductivity type dopants in the silicon carbide layer after removal of the non-diffused dopant peaks may be about 10cmor less, and in some embodiments, about 10cmor less.","The junction termination region may have a peak dopant concentration that varies in a lateral dimension from a high dopant concentration closest to the main junction region to a low dopant concentration farthest from the main junction region.","The junction termination region may have a peak dopant concentration that decreases smoothly in a lateral dimension.","The source of second conductivity dopants may provide a peak dopant concentration of about 10cmor more in the silicon carbide layer at locations corresponding to the plurality of openings.","The plurality of openings may have a lateral width Ld and a spacing between adjacent openings of Lnd, and Ld may decrease with distance from the main junction region and\/or Lnd may increase with width from the main junction region. In some embodiments, Ld may vary from about 2.5 \u03bcm to about 1 \u03bcm. Furthermore, Lnd may be about 2 \u03bcm.","The mask may include a plurality of zones, including a first zone closest to the main junction region and a second zone that is farther from the main junction region from the first zone. In the first zone, the spacing Lnd between adjacent openings may remain constant with distance from the main junction region and the lateral width Ld of the openings may decrease with distance from the main junction region. In the second zone, the spacing Lnd between adjacent openings may increase with distance from the main junction region and the lateral width Ld may remain constant with distance from the main junction region.","The mask may include a third zone that is farther from the main junction than the second zone, and in the third zone, the lateral width Ld of the openings may remain constant with distance from the main junction, and the spacing Lnd between adjacent openings increases by an increasing amount with distance from the main junction region.","An electronic device according to some embodiments includes a silicon carbide layer having a first conductivity type and including a main junction adjacent a surface of the silicon carbide layer, and a junction termination region at the surface of the silicon carbide layer adjacent the main junction. The charge in the junction termination region decreases with lateral distance from the main junction, and a charge in the junction termination region may be less than about 2\u00d710cm.","The junction termination region may have a lateral width L. In some embodiments, a maximum charge in the junction termination region may be less than about 1\u00d710cm. A maximum doping concentration in the junction termination region may be about 5\u00d710cm.","The electronic device may further include a semiconductor mesa at a surface of the silicon carbide layer, and the junction termination region may be adjacent the semiconductor mesa.","A charge in the junction termination region near a surface of the silicon carbide layer may decrease laterally in a smooth fashion from the maximum charge near the main junction down to about 5\u00d710cm.","An electronic device according to further embodiments includes a silicon carbide layer having a first conductivity type and including a main junction adjacent a surface of the silicon carbide layer. A junction termination region is at a surface of the silicon carbide layer adjacent the main junction. The junction termination region includes a region of second conductivity type dopants that has a total charge of about 5\u00d710cmor less in a region adjacent the primary junction and may have a doping profile that decreases with distance from the main junction in an approximately linear fashion.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding\u201d when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms used herein should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","Relative terms such as \u201cbelow,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cupper,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201chorizontal,\u201d \u201clateral,\u201d \u201cvertical,\u201d \u201cbeneath,\u201d \u201cover,\u201d etc., may be used herein to describe a relationship of one element, layer or region to another element, layer or region as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.","Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. The thickness of layers and regions in the drawings may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and\/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described with reference to semiconductor layers and\/or regions which are characterized as having a conductivity type such as n-type or p-type, which refers to the majority carrier concentration in the layer and\/or region. Thus, n-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons, while p-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes. Some material may be designated with a \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2212\u201d (as in n+, n\u2212, p+, p\u2212, n++, n\u2212\u2212, p++, p\u2212\u2212, or the like), to indicate a relatively larger (\u201c+\u201d) or smaller (\u201c\u2212\u201d) concentration of majority carriers compared to another layer or region. However, such notation does not imply the existence of a particular concentration of majority or minority carriers in a layer or region.","As is described in more detail below, embodiments of the present invention may provide improved edge termination of semiconductor devices, such as P-N, Schottky, PiN or other such semiconductor devices. Particular embodiments of the present invention provide edge termination for silicon carbide (SiC) devices. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be utilized as edge termination for SiC Schottky diodes, junction barrier Schottky (JBS) diodes, PiN diodes, thyristors, transistors, or other such SiC devices.","According to some embodiments, a junction termination extension that has a smoothly graded doping profile in both lateral and vertical directions can be provided in a silicon carbide device by controlled diffusion of dopants. As used herein, a smoothly graded doping profile refers to a doping profile that is graded in a non-stepwise fashion so that it is not characterized by having sharp changes in doping concentration. A smoothly graded doping profile may, for example, be graded in a linear, quasi-linear and\/or log-linear fashion.","The dopants may be provided adjacent a main or primary junction in a silicon carbide layer by diffusion or implantation through a plurality of openings in a mask formed on the silicon carbide layer. The openings may be formed to expose portions of the silicon carbide layer that have areas that decrease with distance from the junction. The silicon carbide layer may be annealed to cause the dopants introduced through the plurality of openings to diffuse out and form a single doped JTE region within the silicon carbide layer. Stated differently, doped regions in the silicon carbide layer corresponding to the mask openings are expanded by controlled diffusion so that they coalesce to form a single junction termination region that has a doping concentration that may be smoothly graded, and in some cases linearly or nearly linearly graded in the vertical and\/or lateral directions. In particular embodiments, the JTE can extend a distance Lof about 200 \u03bcm or more from a main junction area with a linearly graded doping profile that decreases laterally with distance from the main junction from about 5\u00d710cmnear the main junction down to about 5\u00d710cmassuming a JTE depth of 0.5 \u03bcm. Such a device may have superior junction termination characteristics compared to a conventional implanted JTE, which may require multiple masks for implantation and may not be able to obtain a linearly graded doping profile in a lateral dimension.","Exemplary embodiments are illustrated in . Referring to , an n\u2212 silicon carbide drift layer  is formed on an n+ silicon carbide substrate . The substrate  may include on- or off-axis silicon carbide of the 4H, 6H, 3C and\/or 15R polytype. A graphite mask  including mask openings  and A to E is formed on a surface of the drift layer . The mask opening  corresponds to the location of a main junction of the device. For example, in a PIN device, the main junction would correspond to the PN junction through which a majority of conduction occurs in the forward operating state. It will be appreciated that in some devices, such as Schottky diodes, the main junction may include a metal-semiconductor junction instead of or in addition to a P-N junction.","The mask openings A to E are located adjacent to the main junction, and are formed to expose areas of the surface of the drift layer  that decrease with lateral distance from the main junction. That is, the mask openings A to E that are closer to the main junction may be wider and\/or spaced closer together than mask openings A to E that are farther away from the main junction, which may be smaller and\/or spaced farther apart from one another.","Each of the openings A to E has a first width Ld, and is spaced apart from an adjacent opening by a second width Lnd. As illustrated in , the first width Ld may decrease with lateral distance from the main junction, while the second width Lnd may increase with lateral distance from the main junction.","Referring to , in some embodiments, p-type dopants  may be introduced into the drift layer  by ion implantation to form doped regions A to E corresponding to the mask openings A to E, respectively. The doped regions A to E may have a doping profile in the vertical direction (perpendicular to the surface of the drift layer ) that has a box, retrograde or buried profile.","Ions may be implanted into the drift layer  to form doped regions A to E that have a sufficient amount of total charge to be diffused to form a desired JTE doping profile in the drift layer  during a subsequent thermal drive-in anneal. In some embodiments, the doped regions A to E may have a peak doping concentration prior to the drive-in anneal that is in excess of 10cm. Exemplary implantation conditions that can be employed to obtain a desired amount of charge are shown in Table 1.","Table 1 shows an implant schedule for obtaining a box profile of aluminum ions in 4H\u2014SiC having a peak doping concentration of about 1\u00d710cm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Exemplary Ion Implantation Schedule"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Dose (cm)","Energy (keV)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"2.0 \u00d7 10","40"]},{"entry":[{},"2.8 \u00d7 10","80"]},{"entry":[{},"4.3 \u00d7 10","150"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As illustrated in , p-type dopants may in some embodiments be introduced into the drift layer  by diffusion doping. Diffusion doping of silicon carbide is described, for example, in Y. Gao et al., \u201cSelective doping of 4H\u2014SiC by codiffusion of aluminum and boron,\u201d J. of Appl. Phys., col. 90, no. 11, pp. 5647-5651 (2001); S. I. Soloviev et al., \u201cDoping of 6H\u2014SiC by selective diffusion of boron,\u201d Appl. Phys. Letters, vol. 77, no. 4, pp. 4004-4006 (2000); and Y. Gao, et al., \u201cInvestigation of boron diffusion in 6H\u2014SiC,\u201d Appl. Phys. Letters, vol. 83, no. 5, pp. 905-907 (2003).","Diffusion doping of SiC may have some advantages compared to ion implantation. In particular, diffusion doping does not introduce radiation damage to the SiC lattice. Diffusion doping also may be suitable for forming deep, linearly graded p-n junctions in SiC. Furthermore, diffused boron is able to compensate n-type doping, forming a buried intrinsic layer. However, diffusion doping of SiC requires extremely high processing temperatures, e.g., above 1800\u00b0 C., which can cause the SiC substrate being doped to physically degrade. Furthermore, it is desirable to establish equilibrium conditions of SiC source materials in the crucible to avoid or discourage either sublimation or epitaxial growth during the sublimation process.","For example, in some embodiments, a silicon carbide substrate  including a silicon carbide drift layer  thereon may be exposed to a gas phase source of p-type dopants at a pressure of 500 Torr in an argon ambient at temperatures of from about 1800\u00b0 C. to about 2200\u00b0 C. for a time of about 5 to 30 minutes. In order to protect the surface of the drift layer , the mask  may include a graphite film on the surface of the drift layer. The diffusion process may be carried out in some embodiments using an inductively heated vertical quartz chamber with water-cooled walls.","Boron and\/or aluminum vapor can be generated by sublimation from solid sources. For example, boron can be sublimated from elemental boron, while aluminum can be sublimated from AlC. In particular embodiments, boron atoms may be doped into the drift layer , and the gas phase source may include 2.5% elemental boron.","In order to sustain the equilibrium condition of the process, a graphite crucible with a mixture of silicon carbide powder and elemental boron (as a source of the doping atoms) may be used, with zero temperature gradient between the gas phase and the substrate. Once the equilibrium condition is established inside the crucible, the velocity of sublimation and epitaxial growth of SiC on the substrate  may be equal, and the p-type impurities will be diffused into the drift layer . Diffusion of the impurities into the drift layer  is believed to be aided by silicon vacancies in the SiC layer.","Unintentional diffusion of boron on the back side of the substrate  opposite the drift layer  can be removed by lapping the substrate with a diamond paste. Furthermore, after diffusion, the graphite mask  can be removed by burning in an oxygen environment.","Following formation of the doped regions A to E through ion implantation and\/or diffusion of dopants, a drive-in anneal is performed to diffuse the dopants into the drift layer  to form a graded JTE profile  that is relatively smoothly graded from a high doping concentration to a low doping concentration in both the lateral (X) and vertical (Y) directions, as illustrated in . In some embodiments, the doped regions A to B may be annealed at a temperature greater than 1600\u00b0 C., and in some embodiments greater than 1800\u00b0 C. The doped regions may be annealed for 5 minutes or more, and in some embodiments for 30 minutes or more. In particular embodiments, the doped regions A to B may be annealed at a temperature of about 1800\u00b0 C. for about 30 minutes. A blanket graphite cap layer  may be formed on the surface of the drift layer  prior to the anneal to protect the surface of the drift layer .","During the drive-in anneal process, dopants in the doped regions  and A to E diffuse further into the drift layer . For example, dopants in the doped region  diffuse out to form doped region . Similarly, dopants in the doped region A diffuse out to form doped region A, dopants in the doped region B diffuse out to form doped region B, etc. However, even after the drive-in anneal, non-diffused dopant concentration peaks A-E remain in a near-surface region of the drift layer . In particular, when the doped regions A to E are formed in a layer of silicon carbide or another semiconductor material in which dopants do not readily diffuse, dopant concentration peaks may remain even after the drive-in anneal.","The diffused doped regions A to E merge together to form a continuously doped JTE region  that has a doping concentration that may decrease smoothly with lateral distance from the main junction as well as with vertical distance from the surface of the drift layer . For example, curves  and  represent curves of relatively constant p-type doping concentration in the drift layer . The doping concentration along curve  is less than the doping concentration along curve . A PN junction is formed along the contour where the p-type doping concentration of the JTE region  is equal to the n-type doping concentration of the drift layer .","In the case of boron, the diffusion coefficient in SiC is 4 to 5 times higher in the lateral direction than in the vertical (c-axis) direction. Thus, the lateral diffusion of boron may provide a good overlap, or lateral merging, of diffused regions in the lateral direction, resulting in the formation of larger regions with smaller average doping compared to, for example, blanket diffusion of dopants. That is, in blanket diffusion of dopants (i.e., only a single JTE opening is used), the dopants may diffuse laterally by a certain distance, but the average doping may not decrease significantly as a result of this lateral diffusion. In contrast, when multiple JTE openings are used, more of the resulting JTE region is doped due to lateral diffusion of dopants, resulting in smaller average doping in the JTE region.","Several different doping profiles of p-type dopants in 4H\u2014SiC as measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) are illustrated in . In particular, FIG. A illustrates four different doping profiles of boron in 4H\u2014SiC. Details of the profiles are shown in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Exemplary Doping Conditions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Curve","Doping Type","Anneal Temperature (\u00b0 C.)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["82","Implantation","1800"]},{"entry":["92","Diffusion","1800"]},{"entry":["94","Diffusion","1900"]},{"entry":["96","Diffusion","2000"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Referring to , the initial charge of boron in the silicon carbide diffusion was determined by the pressure and temperature in the quartz reactor in the case of curves , , and . In the case of curve , the initial charge was provided and precisely controlled by ion implantation, and the doped silicon carbide layer was annealed at a temperature of 1800\u00b0 C. for five minutes in an atmosphere of argon to redistribute and activate the dopants.","As is apparent from , the dopant profile extends deeper for higher diffusion temperatures. However, the peak concentration of dopants near the surface of the silicon carbide layer remains relatively high in each case. Such a high concentration of dopants may be undesirable in a junction terminal extension, because the JTE region may not become fully depleted at the design blocking voltage. However, beyond the regions of peak concentration near the surface, the dopant concentrations in each case decrease with depth in a generally log-linear fashion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["102","104","106","108","102","104","106","108"],"sup":["13 ","\u22122","14 ","\u22122","14 ","\u22122","15 ","\u22122"]},"In order to reduce or avoid a problem of less than full depletion at the design blocking voltage, a surface portion of the drift layer  may be removed, for example, by selective etching. Referring to , an etch mask , which may be photoresist, is formed on the drift layer  over the main junction of the device, and the highly doped surface portion of the drift layer  is selectively etched away. In some embodiments, about 0.2 \u03bcm of material may be etched from the surface of the drift layer . Selective etching may be performed, for example, using reactive ion etch techniques which are well known in the art.","A semiconductor mesa  is thereby formed to define the main junction of the device that includes the highly doped region , while a graded JTE region  with a much lower peak concentration of p-type dopants is defined, because the surface region of the drift layer  with a high concentration of p-type dopants has been removed. The mesa  may have a height of about 0.2 \u03bcm. The graded JTE region  may extend laterally from the mesa by a distance L. The surface doping concentration in the JTE region  may be greatest near the main junction of the device, and may decrease laterally outward from the junction.","In some embodiments, the JTE region  may have a maximum concentration of p-type dopants that permits the JTE region  to be fully depleted at the design blocking voltage. In particular embodiments, the JTE region  may have a maximum charge of p-type dopants that is about 1\u00d710cmor less, depending on how much of the drift layer is removed. In further embodiments, the JTE region  may have a maximum charge of p-type dopants that is about 2\u00d710cmor less, and in some embodiments about 1\u00d710cmor less. Furthermore, the charge of p-type dopants in the JTE region  may decrease laterally in a smooth fashion from the maximum charge near the main junction down to about 5\u00d710cmat a point distal from the main junction.","In some embodiments, the surface doping charge in the JTE region  may decrease from about 1\u00d710cmnear the main junction down to about 1\u00d710cmat the outer edge of the JTE region .","In some embodiments, the surface doping concentration in the JTE region  may decrease from about 5\u00d710cmnear the main junction down to about 10cmat the outer edge of the JTE region . In still further embodiments, the surface doping concentration in the JTE region  may decrease from about 10cmnear the main junction down to about 10cmat the outer edge of the JTE region .","In some embodiments, the JTE region may have a total charge near the main junction of about 2\u00d710cm, and in some embodiments, a total charge near the main junction of about 5\u00d710cm.","Accordingly, a JTE region  that has a peak doping concentration that permits the JTE region  to be fully depleted at the design blocking voltage and that has a graded dopant profile that decreases in a relatively smooth fashion both laterally and vertically with distance from the main junction can be formed using only a single masking step, a single doping step and a single drive-in diffusion step.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["20","21","16","14","23"]},"As noted above, in order to provide a JTE region  that has a graded doping concentration in both the lateral and vertical directions, the amount of charge in the doped regions A-E can be reduced with distance from the main junction. For both ion implantation and diffusion doping, the amount of charge that is doped into the drift layer  can be controlled by varying the size, shape, spacing and\/or distribution of the doped regions A-E. The size, shape, spacing and distribution of the doped regions A-E is determined by the size, shape, spacing and\/or distribution of the mask openings A-E shown in . Masks having various patterns of mask openings A-E can be used. For example, the mask patterns A-D shown in  include mask openings  (light areas) that expose progressively smaller areas of an underlying drift layer with distance from a main junction.","As illustrated in , the mask openings  can be any geometric shape, such as linear, square, triangular, curvilinear, etc. In each case, the density and\/or size of the mask openings can be reduced with distance from the main junction to expose smaller and smaller amounts of the drift layer . In this manner, the doped regions in the drift layer corresponding to the mask openings  will contain smaller and smaller amounts of total charge assuming that they are doped from the same implantation and\/or gas phase source.","Referring to , in some embodiments, the doping mask  can include generally linear mask openings . Each of the generally linear mask openings  may have a lateral width Ld, and may be spaced apart from an adjacent opening  by a width Lnd. In some embodiments, the doping mask  can be organized into a plurality of zones based on distance from the main junction area, illustrated in  as Zones  to . In a given zone, the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  may decrease with distance from the main junction and\/or the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings  may increase with distance from the main junction area.","For example, in the embodiments illustrated in , in Zone , which in  is closest to the main junction area, the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  decreases with distance from the main junction, while Lnd remains constant. In the next zone, Zone , the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings  increases with distance from the main junction, while the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  remains constant. In Zone , the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings  increases with distance from the main junction by an increasing amount with each step, while the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  remains constant and\/or decreases.","In some particular embodiments, in Zone , the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  may start at 2.5 \u03bcm close to the junction, and may decrease in 0.05 \u03bcm steps down to 1 \u03bcm with increasing distance from the main junction, while the width Lnd between adjacent mask openings  may remain constant at 2 \u03bcm.","In Zone , the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  may remain constant at 1 \u03bcm, while the width Lnd between adjacent mask openings  may increase in 0.2 \u03bcm steps with increasing distance from the main junction.","In Zone , the lateral width Ld of the mask openings  may remain constant at 1 \u03bcm, while the lateral width Lnd between adjacent mask openings  increases with distance from the main junction by an amount \u0394Lnd that increases with each step. For example, in Zone , Lnd may increase in steps from 3.6 \u03bcm to 4.4 \u03bcm (\u0394Lnd=0.8 \u03bem), then from 4.4 \u03bcM to 5.4 \u03bcm (\u0394Lnd=1.0 \u03bcm), then from 5.4 \u03bcm to 6.6 \u03bcm (\u0394Lnd=1.2 \u03bcm), etc. It will be appreciated that although a general pattern as described above may be employed to provide decreasing levels of charge in the JTE region with distance from the main junction, there may be some deviations in the pattern while still achieving a generally linearly graded JTE region.","In particular embodiments, the mask  can be designed to provide a doping profile in the JTE region that decreases with distance from the junction in a linear, non-linear, or nearly linear fashion depending on the doping and\/or annealing conditions. For example, a simulated doping profile that decreases in a quasi-linear fashion and that can be generated using a mask pattern as described above is illustrated in . The simulated doping profile shown in  is based on an anneal of a doped silicon carbide layer at 1800\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes.","It will be appreciated that a junction termination extension as described above can be used in connection with many different kinds of unipolar and\/or bipolar power devices, such as metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs), bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), MOS controlled thyristors (MCTs), PIN diodes, Schottky diodes, junction barrier Schottky (JBS) diodes, and others. Furthermore, a junction termination extension as described above can be used in connection with power devices fabricated using other semiconductor materials. For example, a junction termination extension as described herein could be used in connection with power devices fabricated using other wide bandgap semiconductor materials, such as gallium nitride based materials, or other semiconductor materials, such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, etc.","In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-7D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
