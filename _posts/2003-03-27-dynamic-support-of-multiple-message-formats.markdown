Field of the Invention","This invention relates to messaging systems, and more particularly, to supporting multiple message formats in a single user interface.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a 24\u00d77 international business environment, electronic messaging provides a convenient way for companies to communicate with customers all over the globe. Currently, many companies have dedicated e-mail inboxes defined for specific business areas. Often, employees called agents are assigned to poll and manage the support requests from customers for one or more dedicated e-mail inboxes, as well as from their individual agent inboxes. With customer support centers handling very large numbers of customer support requests daily, increasing the efficiency of each agent in responding to each customer request by only seconds can produce enormous cost savings for the customer support center.","To provide international support, companies must be able to communicate with customers using a variety of electronic messaging systems, languages, and formats. Even within a single messaging system, messages can be sent and received having many different formats. For example, common electronic mail formats include plain text, rich text, and hypertext markup language (HTML). In addition, a message may be communicated in one language, such as Japanese, requiring a different character set for display than the default configuration for the recipient, who may, for example, use English as a default language. Preserving the original format of a message can be valuable in formulating a response to the message.","If a company wishes to implement a customer support center where agents can communicate using multiple messaging systems, typically the company must purchase different software products to handle each messaging system because of the different communication protocols involved. Because different products must be purchased, agents must learn to use a different user interface for each messaging system. Efficiency of an agent typically degrades when he or she must remember different user interfaces for communicating with customers via different messaging systems.","Thus, it is desirable to enable customer service agents to communicate with customers in a variety of electronic message formats from within a single user interface.","The present invention enables a single interface to be used to prepare and present messages in a variety of different formats. For example, the single interface can be used to prepare, receive or display messages in different languages, such as English or Japanese, which require different character sets. Furthermore, the single interface supports preparing, sending, and receiving messages in multiple text formats, such as plain text, rich text, and Multiple Internet Mail Extension (MIME) format.","In one embodiment, a method includes receiving a message in a native format, dynamically selecting a format for providing a response to the message, and providing the response in the dynamically-selected format.

One of skill in the art will understand that messages can include e-mail, web chat messages, short messaging service messages, and other forms of text messaging. The native format of the message can be, for example, determined by the environment in which the message was prepared.","The present invention can provide a response in the native format of the original message or in another format, such as a format used to prepare the response. The format of the response in which the response is to be displayed can be dynamically selected when the response is to be presented.","The response can be generated automatically or prepared by a user. The response can include data in an independent format that can be interpreted and displayed by a single user interface. For example, the response can include a pie-formulated answer to a question posed in the original message, and the pre-formulated answer can be stored in a format independent of any character set or language. The independent format need not correspond to either the native format or the format used to prepare the response. The response is provided in the dynamically-selected format.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","105","110","105","110","100"]},"Shown within system  is application program server .
