priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/993,138, filed May 14, 2014, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to pyrazolopyridines and pyrazolopyrimidines, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and their use as medicaments. More particularly, the present invention provides 6-phenyl-1H-pyrazolopyridines derivatives and 6-phenyl-1H-pyrazolopyrimidines derivatives which are Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors and useful for the treatment of allergic and respiratory conditions, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US and is characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible with bronchodilators. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily cigarette smoke. Symptoms are typically breathing-related (e.g. chronic cough, exertional dyspnea, expectoration and wheeze). Patients experience periods of stable disease interspersed with inflammatory exacerbations resulting in acute decline in lung function and often hospitalization.","Current treatment guidelines recommend bronchodilators as the mainstay of COPD drug treatment. However, anti-inflammatory inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilator\/inhaled corticosteroid combination products, are extensively used. Whilst inhaled corticosteroids do provide some benefits with respect to short term lung function improvements and exacerbation frequency, they do not address the corticosteroid-refractory inflammation which is characteristic of this disease and thought to play a key role in disease progression. There is a clear medical need for anti-inflammatory therapies in COPD that will address the chronic inflammatory component of the disease and ultimately provide symptomatic relief, a reduction in exacerbation frequency and an amelioration of exacerbation severity.","The Janus kinase (JAK) family of receptor associated tyrosine kinases, JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), are involved in signal transduction associated with a variety of inflammatory cytokines. JAK kinases can function as either hetero or homo-dimers, phosphorylating STAT transcription factors which regulate inflammatory gene transcription. Oral JAK 1\/JAK 3 inhibitors such as CP-690550 have shown impressive anti-inflammatory activity in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.","Many JAK dependent cytokines are thought to play key roles in the pathology of COPD which involves the interplay of multiple inflammatory cells such as T lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and lung epithelium. For example the JAK 1\/JAK 3 heterodimer plays a key role in T lymphocyte survival and activation whereas JAK 2 is thought to be critical for regulation of neutrophil activation and apoptosis. JAK 1 and JAK 2 play an important role in IL-13 mediated inflammatory signaling in macrophages, which is thought to link acute inflammatory events to chronic progressive disease. Importantly JAK 1, JAK 2 and TYK 2 also play an important role in signaling mediated by IFN\u03b3, a cytokine associated with the chronic inflammation observed in COPD, which modulates the activity of T cells, epithelium and macrophages whilst not being modulated by corticosteroids.","Macrophage phagocytosis of bacteria is impaired in the lungs of COPD patients, potentially in part due to high local IFN\u03b3 levels. In vitro studies with isolated patient cells have shown that JAK inhibitors increase phagocytotic rate in the presence of IFN\u03b3. Consequently, as well as exerting a direct anti-inflammatory effect, JAK inhibitors may also increase the ability of the lung to maintain a sterile environment.","JAK inhibitors are therefore likely to have utility in the treatment of a range of inflammatory diseases, including lung diseases such as COPD, asthma and pulmonary vascular disease. Compounds which have a broad inhibitory activity across the range of Janus kinases, in particular, are likely to have a potent anti-inflammatory effect. However, such a selectivity profile can also lead to undesirable side-effects in systemically circulating compounds, particularly anemia and neutropenia associated with JAK 2 inhibition. For the treatment of lung diseases, it is therefore particularly favorable to provide JAK inhibitors which can be administered by inhalation and which inhibit Janus kinases locally in the lung without having a significant systemic exposure.","There is thus a need to provide new JAK inhibitors that are potent, selective inhibitors of Janus kinases with appropriate metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties, particularly compounds which can be administered by inhalation and are active in lung tissue whilst having poor systemic penetration or high systemic lability.","The present invention provides pyrazolopyridines and pyrazolopyrimidines which are potent and selective inhibitors of Janus kinases, including a compound having the structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"33.44mm","wi":"62.06mm","file":"US09518052-20161213-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","6 "]},"R and Rare independently selected from the group consisting of H, C-Calkyl, hydroxy(C-Calkyl), phenyl(C-Calkyl), and \u2014(CH)\u2014W, where W is C-Ccycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl or heterocyclic containing 1-3 N, S and\/or O atoms, \u2014SO\u2014R\u2032, \u2014NHSO\u2014R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2033SO\u2014R\u2032 and SR\u2032, where R\u2032 and R\u2033 are independently C-Calkyl or C-Ccycloalkyl, amino, C-Calkylamino, di(C-Calkyl)amino, phenyl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic;

Examples include the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate\/carbonate, bisulfate\/sulfate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride\/chloride, hydrobromide\/bromide, hydroiodide\/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulfate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate\/hydrogen phosphate\/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate, naphatlene-1,5-disulfonic acid and xinofoate salts.","Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.","Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts. For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002).","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may be prepared by one or more of three methods:","(i) by reacting a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) with the desired acid or base;","(ii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or","(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of formula (I)-(Ii) to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.","All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.","The compounds of formula (I)-(Ii), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term \u2018solvate\u2019 is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of formula (I)-(Ii), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term \u2018hydrate\u2019 may be employed when said solvent is water.","A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates\u2014see by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.","When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water\/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.","Also included within the scope of the invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallization, by recrystallization from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together. Cf. Chem. Commun., 17, 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004). For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J. Pharm. Sci., 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (1975).","The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term \u2018amorphous\u2019 refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order (glass transition\u2032). The term \u2018crystalline\u2019 refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order (melting point\u2032).","The compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as \u2018thermotropic\u2019 and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as lyotropic\u2032. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as \u2018amphiphilic\u2019 and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as \u2014COONa, \u2014COOK, or \u2014SONa) or non-ionic (such as \u2014NN(CH)) polar head group. For more information, see by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4Edition (Edward Arnold, 1970).","Hereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) include references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.","The compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may exhibit polymorphism and\/or one or more kinds of isomerism (e.g. optical, geometric or tautomeric isomerism). The compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may also be isotopically labelled. Such variation is implicit to the compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) defined as they are by reference to their structural features and therefore within the scope of the invention.","Compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis\/trans (or Z\/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (\u2018tautomerism\u2019) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.","The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may also contain a counterion which is optically active (e.g. d-lactate or l-lysine) or racemic (e.g. dl-tartrate or dl-arginine).","Cis\/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization.","Conventional techniques for the preparation\/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person. Chiral compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture. Chiral chromatography using sub- and supercritical fluids may be employed. Methods for chiral chromatography useful in some embodiments of the present invention are known in the art (see, for example, Smith, Roger M., Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK; Chromatographic Science Series (1998), 75 (Supercritical Fluid Chromatography with Packed Columns), pp. 223-249 and references cited therein). In some relevant examples herein, columns were obtained from Chiral Technologies, Inc, West Chester, Pa., USA, a subsidiary of Daicel\u00ae Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.","When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer. While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).","The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature. Isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagent in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed. In particular, hydrogen atoms may be replaced by deuterium atoms since such deuterated compounds are sometimes more resistant to metabolism.","Also included within the scope of the invention are active metabolites of compounds of formula (I)-(Ii), that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug, often by oxidation or dealkylation. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include","(i) where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (\u2014CH\u2192\u2014CHOH):","(ii) where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (\u2014OR\u2192\u2014OH);","(iii) where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (\u2014NRR\u2032\u2192\u2014NHR or \u2014NHR\u2032);","(iv) where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (\u2014NHR\u2192\u2014NH);","(v) where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph\u2192-PhOH); and","(vi) where a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (\u2014CONH\u2192COOH).","For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) is typically in the range of 0.01 mg to 500 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration. In another embodiment of the present invention, the total daily dose of a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) is typically in the range of 0.1 mg to 300 mg. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the total daily dose of a compound of formula (I)-(Ii) is typically in the range of 1 mg to 30 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein. These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 65 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.","In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a prefilled capsule, blister or pocket or by a system that utilises a gravimetrically fed dosing chamber. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or \u201cpuff\u201d containing from 1 to 5000 \u03bcg of drug. The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 \u03bcg to 20 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.","A compound of formula (I)-(Ii) can be administered per se, or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, which, as active constituent contains an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the invention, in addition to customary pharmaceutically innocuous excipients and\/or additives.","Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).","Compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth. Formulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, lozenges (including liquid-filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution, liposome, films, ovules, sprays and liquid formulations.","Liquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and\/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.","Compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001).","For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %. In one embodiment of the present invention, the disintegrant will comprise from 5 weight % to 20 weight % of the dosage form. Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. Tablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet. Tablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulfate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %. In one embodiment of the present invention, lubricants comprise from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet. Other possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavoring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.","Exemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant.","Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated. Formulations of tablets are discussed in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980).","Consumable oral films for human or veterinary use are typically pliable water-soluble or water-swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically comprise a compound of formula (I)-(Ii), a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticiser, a stabiliser or emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function. The film-forming polymer may be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and is typically present in the range 0.01 to 99 weight %, more typically in the range 30 to 80 weight %. Other possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavorings and flavor enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents. Films in accordance with the invention are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined coater dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.","Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and\/or modified release. Modified release includes delayed, sustained, pulsed, controlled, targeted and programmed release. Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO-A-00\/35298.","Compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Such parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular, intra-articular and subcutaneous administration. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.","Compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally.","The compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler, as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, or as nasal drops. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin. Delivery by inhalation is the preferred route of administration for the compounds of the present invention.","The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound of formula (I)-(Ii) comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the compound, a propellant as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.","Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.","Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as 1-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.","A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 \u03bcg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 \u03bcl to 100 \u03bcl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I)-(Ii), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.","Suitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for intranasal administration. Formulations for intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and\/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release includes delayed, sustained, pulsed, controlled, targeted and programmed release.","Compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline.","Compounds of formula (I)-(Ii) may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste, bioavailability and\/or stability when using any of the aforementioned modes of administration. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in international patent publications WO91\/11172, WO94\/02518 and WO98\/55148.","Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I)-(Ii), may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus, a kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I)-(Ii), and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like. Such a kit is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.","The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure.
