title: Method and apparatus for removing redundant information from digital documents
abstract: Method and apparatus for reconstructing new documents from a group of old ones by removing the existing redundant information. Redundant information (images, text paragraphs) from retrieved multimedia documents is removed. Each document consists of two main parts stored in different databases. The first part of a document represents text paragraphs, the second part consists of the images and drawings related with the text paragraphs. An information reduction methodology examines first the text paragraphs of each document related with a specific topic, and removes the redundant information, such as same or similar paragraphs, by keeping pointers useful for a future reconstruction of the original documents. The remaining text paragraphs and the set of points are used to compose the first version of a new document. The invention also examines all the images related with the set of original documents and removes the same or similar images while keeping pointers that could assist a future reconstruction of the original documents. The invention merges text-paragraphs and images and creates the first stage new document.

No. 60\/351,636, filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jan. 25, 2002.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","The World Wide Web is a vast information resource and is being used by millions of people daily. A careful examination of web pages reveals that in addition to words that appear in each web page, there are also other related information that could be used to describe users' search needs more precisely. Such information includes (1) well defined (structured) information about each web page such as its URL and title; (2) metadata associated with each web page such as its size and the time it was last modified; (3) images in a web page; and (4) the links that connect different web pages and images.","Document processing also is an important research area, where several techniques have been developed for separating text-paragraphs from images and drawings. However, the reconstruction of a new document using a number of different documents on the same subject is still an open challenging problem that requires a solution.","One object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for removing redundant text from digital documents.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for removing redundant images from digital documents.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for synthesizing a new document that is free of redundant text and images.","The invention disclosed herein provides a method and apparatus for reconstructing new documents from a group of old ones by removing the existing redundant information. In particular, this invention removes redundant information (images, text paragraphs) from retrieved multimedia documents. Each document consists of two main parts stored in different databases. The first part of a document represents text paragraphs, the second part consists of the images and drawings related with the text paragraphs. The information reduction methodology examines first the text paragraphs of each document related with a specific topic, and removes the redundant information, such as same or similar paragraphs, by keeping pointers useful for a future reconstruction of the original documents. The remaining text paragraphs and the set of points are used to compose the first version of a new document. This invention also examines all the images related with the set of original documents and removes the same or similar images while keeping pointers that could assist a future reconstruction of the original documents. At this point, the invention merges text-paragraphs and images and creates the first stage new document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, method for removing redundant information from digital documents, comprises the steps of: organizing text into sentences and paragraphs; analyzing the sentences and the paragraphs; comparing the sentences and paragraphs with other documents; and identifying redundancies between the documents.","According to a feature of the present invention, method for removing redundant information from digital documents, comprises the steps of: extracting statistical features selected from the group consisting of: size of a paragraph in characters; character histograms; number of sentences; number of words in each sentence; word histograms; starting word of each sentence; and ending word of a paragraph; determining whether similar said statistical features exist; if similar statistical features exist, then deciding paragraphs are similar, removing redundant paragraph, and proceeding to the step of comparing said sentences and paragraphs with other documents otherwise, postponing removal of paragraph; analyzing corresponding image and data parts of the paragraph; determining whether the paragraphs are placed in a different order; if the paragraphs are placed in a different order, then analyzing the starting word of each sentence, analyzing the length of each sentence; and proceeding to the step of comparing the sentences and paragraphs with other documents otherwise, proceeding to the step of comparing sentences and paragraphs with other documents.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, method for removing redundant information from digital documents, comprises the steps of: analyzing each image in said document; extracting statistical features from each image, wherein the features are selected from the group consisting of: number of image regions; histogram of colors; relative size of regions; texture of regions; and weighted regions graph, determining whether same features exist; if same features exist, then deciding that images are similar; removing redundant image; and terminating the step of analyzing each image; otherwise, postponing removal of image; analyzing corresponding text and data parts of image; determining whether there is an ambiguity; if there is an ambiguity, then performing image understanding process; making a final decision on removal of image; and returning to the step of removing redundant image; otherwise, proceeding to the step of terminating the step of analyzing each image.","According to a common feature of both embodiments of the present invention, method for removing redundant information from digital documents, comprises the document synthesis steps of: a first step of combining text paragraphs; a second step of combining associated images; reassigning numbers in paragraphs and images; comparing with caption of image; determining whether there is a match; if there is a match, then placing the image after the examined paragraph; assigning a number to said image; reassigning those numbers related to the captions; producing a synthetic document; and terminating the document synthesis steps; otherwise, terminating the document synthesis steps.","This invention reconstructs new documents from a group of old ones by removing the existing redundant information. In particular, this invention removes redundant information (images, text paragraphs) from retrieved multimedia documents.","Referring to , each document consists of two main parts stored in different databases . The first part of a document represents text paragraphs, the second part consists of the images and drawings related with the text paragraphs. The information reduction methodology examines first the text paragraphs of each document related with a specific topic, and removes the redundant information, such as same or similar paragraphs, by keeping pointers useful for a future reconstruction of the original documents. The remaining text paragraphs and the set of points are used to compose the first version of a new document. The methodology also examines all the images related with the set of original documents and removes the same or similar images while keeping pointers that could assist a future reconstruction of the original documents. At this point, the methodology merges text-paragraphs and images and creates the first stage new document.","The original documents are retrieved  by the search engine  and stored  into the user's workstation , where the Information Redundancy Removal (IRR)  software scheme processes  the input pieces of text and image information to create  the new document .","The information retrieved  from different databases will be stored  temporarily in the user's workstation . This information is composed by text, images and data. Each piece (text, image, data) of this information is stored  into a different memory space in order to be efficiently and independently processed. The process used here includes two major parts: removal of the existing redundancies in text and images  and first stage document synthesis .","Referring to , redundancy in text means the duplication of certain large parts of a text paragraph, or the duplication of an entire paragraph To remove redundant text, all text pieces are organized  into paragraphs (P) and sentences (S) without the loss of their referenced pointers to other items such as images, data. Then, each sentence, or paragraph is analyzed  and compared  with the other sentences and paragraphs from different documents in order that a possible redundancy be discovered.","Referring to , each text paragraph is analyzed  by the IRR method and important statistical features (f) are extracted . These statistical features are: (1.) the size of the paragraph (Ps) in text characters; (2.) the character histogram, i.e. the number of A's, B's, C's etc. that appear; (3.) the number of sentences (Sn); (4.) the number of words in a sentence (Sw); (5.) the histogram of words; (6.) the starting word (Ws) of each sentence in a paragraph; and (7.) the ending (or stop) word (We) of the paragraph.","If it is determined that two paragraphs P and P have the same features  described above, then P and P are considered as similar  with a probability p(f) of removal. This means that one of these two paragraphs has to be removed  as redundant under the condition that both have the same reference pointers (or ids) to other items, such as images, data, or tables. If is determined that the reference pointers are different , then a more detailed analysis takes place on the examined paragraphs and the removal operation is postponed  until an analytical examination has taken place  at the corresponding images and data parts. In addition, if it is determined that the paragraphs have been placed in a different order  in a text-paragraph, a more accurate matching of the two paragraphs will be accomplished by analyzing the starting word of a new sentence (W)  and by analyzing the length of each sentence (SL)) .","Referring to , image redundancy can also be removed from documents. Image redundancy is the occurrence of the same image more than twice, with the same or different resolution, size and\/or color. Each image analyzed  and a number of statistical characteristics (c) are extracted  from it. These characteristics are: (1.) the number of image regions (nr); (2.) a histogram of colors; (3.) the relative size of the regions (sr); (4.) the shapes of regions (shr); (5.) the texture of regions (tr); and (6.) the weighted regions graph (G)","If it is determined  that two images I and I have the same statistical characteristics described above, then I and I are determined  to be similar or same with a probability p\u2032(f) of removal. In this case, one of these two images will be removed  under the condition that both have the same pointers (or ids) to other forms, such as text, and\/or data. If it is determined that the pointers are different , then a more detailed analysis of the examined images occurs and the removal operation  is postponed  until an analytical examination occurs  on the corresponding text and data parts. If it is determined that there is an ambiguity , an image understanding process  occurs and is used to make the final decision  of removing or not removing one of the examined images.","Referring to , the generation of the weighted graph of an image is depicted. Here, the comparison of two images is mainly based on the comparison of their features and especially their regions weighted graphs, which carry all the information needed for each region. Ni represents the vector or record of an image region, Rij represents the relative distance between the regions Ni and Nj, and \u03a6 represents the relative direction or angle between two regions.","Referring to , the synthesis of text and image information takes place after the removal of redundancies from both text and image parts. The synthesis process combines text paragraphs  and combines their associated images  to generate a new kind of document  by reassigning numbers  in paragraphs and images. This information is compared  with the \u201ccaption\u201d of a particular image. If it is determined that there is a match , the image is placed after the examined paragraph  and an appropriate number is assigned  to it. In addition, all the numbers related with captions are reassigned . The synthetic document produced  by the information redundancy removal (IRR) contains all the information needed to reconstruct any of the original documents, if necessary.","While the preferred embodiments have been described and illustrated, it should be understood that various substitutions, equivalents, adaptations and modifications of the invention may be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustration and not limitation."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
