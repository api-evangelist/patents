{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of search engines and Directories of Web sites. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and system for mapping and searching the Internet, and displaying the results in a visual form.","A \u201cSearch engine\u201d is a system that searches for information that sustains some Search criteria. Regarding the Internet, a Search engine is a Web application that searches Web sites that sustain some Search criteria.","A search engine on the Internet usually comprises three parts:\n\n","A search-index is a database that contains information about a set of Web sites. Using the search-index, a sub-group of Web-site(s) can be obtained according to search-criteria.","There are various search Web-sites that maintain databases about the contents of other Web sites. Yahoo was the first search Web site to gain worldwide attention, and it differs from most other search sites in that its content is indexed by people who create a hierarchical directory by subjects. As a result, Yahoo and similar search Web sites are technically called \u201cdirectories\u201d rather than \u201csearch engines\u201d. Most directories offer a search engine mechanism to query the database.","Most other search Web applications are highly automated, sending \u201cSpider\u201d programs out on the Web around the clock to collect the text of Web pages. Spiders follow all the links on a page and put all the text into a database. Sometimes a Web site offers both\u2014a search engine and directory capabilities.","Major search engines such as AltaVista and Google index the content of the Web, while directories such as Yahoo and Looksmart try to categorize it manually. However, due to the huge size of the Web and other objective reasons (such as connectivity of sites), Google indexed only 30% of the Web, while Yahoo indexed only 2% (according to the assessments of the Web size)","There are dozens of search engines, each with its own anchor Web site. Some search Web applications, such as Yahoo, search not only using their search engine but also provide the results from simultaneous searches of other search indices.","Usually, the above-mentioned search engines do not provide focused answers, since the same keywords may be found in Web sites of different categories and subjects, while the user is not provided with means for distinguishing between the results. Search results can span for pages, and consequently overwhelm the user.","Yahoo displays not only Web sites that contain the specified keywords, but also a list of categories that contain the searched keyword(s), as may be seen in . In the illustrated case, the word \u201cchess\u201d was searched. Hence, after obtaining the initial results, the user can focus his search by selecting the category best suited to the subject matter he is looking for. In that case, the search results are limited to the selected category as pre-grouped by the people of Yahoo. Such a search may be called a \u201ccontext search\u201d. However, the user is not provided with means for distinguishing the Web sites by importance or any other property. Moreover, since Yahoo does not scan the Internet by automated methods, each category contains a minor amount of Web sites.","Due to the fact that the categories of Yahoo were defined by a human factor and not by a machine, there are some ambiguities. For example, in , the hierarchy of the categories \u201cComputers and Internet>Hardware>Systems>Macintosh>Software>Games\u201d is odd since regarding to computers, the category \u201cSoftware\u201d is not a sub-category of \u201chardware\u201d.","One of the options of the Google search engine, introduces a different approach. The search starts from a selection of one or more predefined categories and the search refinement is carried out by the topical keywords. For example, a user wishes to search for a free computer chess game. The user starts the search from a Web page (within the Google Web site) called \u201cWeb directory\u201d, where he selects the category \u201cGames\u201d. Google displays a list of sub-categories, and the user selects the \u201cComputer games\u201d sub-category. The next category is \u201cWindows\u201d, and in this category Google displays the following answers: 3D Graphics (18 Web sites), Cheats and Hints (46 Web sites), Downloads (21 Web sites), Fan Fiction (11 Web sites), and Shareware (146 Web sites). When selecting the final directory, the user submits the keyword \u201cchess\u201d to limit the results to only chess games.","In matter of fact, Google uses the directory of Open Directory Project (ODP), rather then its own directory. ODP is an organization of more than 30,000 volunteers that index the Internet.","Google results are ranked quite differently from those of other search engines. Ranking in Google is carried out according to the site's importance as determined by the number of links pointing to a Web site. After obtaining a list of Web sites that meet a text-oriented search criterion, Google ranks the obtained list according to the number of links pointing to each Web site, and the results are presented according to this order.","The main drawbacks in the existing search engines are the following:\n\n","All the methods described above have not yet provided satisfactory solutions to the problem of the searching of Internet Web sites.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for carrying out a search of Web sites, which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for carrying out a search of Web sites, which provides presentation of the Web sites, such that the visualization reveals certain attributes of the presented Web sites.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and system for carrying out a search of Web sites, which classifies the Web sites according to their attributes.","Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for carrying out a search of Web sites according to a search criteria, comprising: pre-indexing the sites of the Web, including grouping the Web sites according to predefined group-criteria; pre-classifying each Web site according to a predefined set of properties; pre-visual-formulating each Web site according to its identified properties; and upon searching of Web sites that sustain a search criterion, displaying the formed site results divided into the pre-indexed groups wherein each site within a group is displayed according to its visual-formulation.","Preferably, the grouping is carried out by a clustering process and the group-criteria is of a function among others the number of hyperlink(s) pointing from and to each the Web sites.","Preferably, the set of properties comprises parameters relating to the site's importance, the nature of the site's owner, the existence of an e-store within the site, the existence of a \u201cchat room\u201d within the site, the existence of a forum within the site, the existence of multimedia file(s) and\/or their amount and\/or size within the site, the frequent used keywords in the textural date of the site, whether the site is \u201cofficial\u201d, the essence of the site, and\/or the amount of information in the site.","Preferably, the importance of a Web site is a function of the hyperlinks pointing to and from a Web site.","Preferably, the amount of information in a Web site is determined according to the number of characters, and\/or the number of words, and\/or the number of bytes included within the Web site.","Preferably, the visual-formulation is a distinguishable visual presentation of the properties in a visual presentation.","Preferably, each Web site is presented as a building, the height of the building is proportional to the importance of the Web site represented by it.","Preferably, wherein each Web site is presented as a building wherein the width of the building is proportional to the amount of information within the Web site.","Preferably, a commercial Web site is presented as an office-type building.","Preferably, a personal Web site is presented as a house.","Preferably, each Web site is presented as a building wherein a Web site owned by an academy and\/or college and\/or school is presented as a campus-type building.","Preferably, wherein the presence of an e-store in a Web site is presented as a display-window at the building.","In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method for visually presenting a set of properties of a Web site, comprising: associating to each of the properties distinguishable graphical representation within a Web site; and displaying the graphical representation within a Web site representation.","Preferably, the graphical representation is presented in 2D or 3D.","Preferably, the Web site representation is a building.","Preferably, a group of Web sites is presented as a street and each Web site in the group is presented as a building.","In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method for finding sub-groups having a common basis in a set of Web sites, comprising: clustering the set of Web sites by determining groups having a common basis by their being related by hyperlink(s) pointing to and from each of the Web sites; and labeling the determined groups by analyzing their content.","Preferably, the analyzing is carried out by detecting keywords frequently used in a determined group.","In another aspect, the invention is directed to a system for searching of Web sites in the Internet, comprising: a Spider application, for scanning the Web sites of the Internet; a Database application, for storing the information collected by the Spider application; an Indexing application, for grouping, and\/or for labeling and\/or for classifying the found Web sites; and a Seeker application, for searching of Web sites that sustain a search criteria by querying the Database according to the search criteria.","Preferably, the system comprises a visual formulating application, for visually formulating each of the Web sites according to the classification and displaying the same to a user.","In order to facilitate the reading of the description to follow, a number of terms and initials are defined below:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 2","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":["whatisthematrix.com, the official Web site of the movie (e.g., which is owned by the producer of the movie);","upcomingmovie.com the Web site which contains information regarding the upcoming sequent movie;","amazon.com the site where the book on which the movie is based on can be bought;","jet-li.com the Web site of the director of the movie;","carrieannmoss.com the Web site of the major actress;","some corresponding amateur Web sites, and so forth."]}}}},"As is well known, there are connections, generally called \u201clinks\u201d or \u201chyperlinks\u201d, which refer Internet users from one Web site to other Web site(s). Actually, links point from one Web page to another Web page, or even to the same Web page, however since Web sites comprise Web pages, we can assume that a link points from one Web site to another Web site, or even to the same Web site. For example, link L refers users from the Web site S, where L resides on, to Web sites S and S. L refer users to Web sites S, S and S, etc. Generally, links are made to \u201cconnect\u201d between Web sites. Furthermore, the more links point to a Web site, the higher its popularity. In other words, a Web site to which more links refer, maybe considered as more \u201cimportant\u201d than a Web site to which fewer links refer. In that sense, the Web site whatis.thematrix.com to which 3 links refer, is more \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cpopular\u201d than the Web site jet-li.com. Furthermore, all the Web sites of  form a virtual group \u201cconnected\u201d by a somewhat common subject.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 3","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["The Football group: 5 hyperlinks point between the members of the group, and 3 hyperlinks to\/from the other groups.","The Basketball group: 11 hyperlinks point between the members of the group, and 3 hyperlinks to\/from the other groups.","The Baseball group: 5 hyperlinks point between the members of the group, and 2 hyperlinks to\/from the other groups."]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In this example, only three hyperlinks are pointing from\/to the Sport group to the other groups, while the number of links pointing between the members of the group is much higher. The same is true at the Health and Business groups.","Indexing","Prior to carrying out a search, a great deal of the Internet Web sites should be indexed, by means of an indexing process. According to the present invention the indexing is carried out in two stages:","Clustering","The groups of the Web are determined according to the hyperlinks pointing to and out of the Internet sites. Since the grouping criteria is the hyperlinks (such as the number of hyperlinks, the density of hyperlinks, etc.), this is a totally objective process, in contrary to the prior art, where the groups are determined by a human factor or text-oriented, and hence the results were subjective. For a matter of fact, the clustering process is so indifferent to text, that even after the cluster formation, it is still unknown what is the topical common denominator of the new-formed group.","Determining the groups can be a lengthy process, since any possible combination of Web sites is to be checked. For example, if a set of 10 Web sites is checked, named as \u201cA\u201d to \u201cJ\u201d, then any combination should be considered, such as A,B; A,C; A,D; A,B,C; A,B,D; A,B,E; A,B,C,D,E; A,B,C,D,F; and so forth in order to determine groups. The decision as to when a group is formed is subject to an automatic decision based on statistical and\/or mathematical parameters such as variance and significance in the link's density, variance, direction, proportion, etc.","The problem of grouping objects (not necessarily web entities) is well known in the art, and many algorithms were developed in order to speed up the process. In the prior art, the grouping process is called \u201cClustering\u201d.","Since the Internet comprises more than 100 millions of Web sites (billions of Web pages), automatic clustering of the Internet is long and heavy process, even when fast algorithms and fast computing machines are implemented. Therefore, according to the invention, the clustering is made prior to the carrying out of a search. The clustering is performed by a \u201cclustering engine\u201d, which also works in the background.","Labeling","Another aspect of the clustering problem is naming the determined groups, in order to determine what is their subject, since the link-oriented grouping is indifferent to text, and therefore can not relate a subject title to the new formed groups. The process of entitling a group is called herein \u201cLabeling\u201d. Such a process can be carried out by heuristic methods, with or without the assistance of a human factor.","Regarding the examples described in , frequent appearance of the word \u201cfootball\u201d, \u201cbasketball\u201d and \u201cbaseball\u201d in a cluster may lead to the conclusion that the cluster deals with a group of sport.","A step toward automatization of the Labeling process is carried out by determining the major words that appear in a cluster, and then relating the words to a subject.","Data Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"The data structure created by the clustering process can also be seen as a map of the web, since every site in the web has a specific location in the tree.","Carrying Out a Search","The search process uses the search-index that was constructed in the indexing process. As much Web sites have been indexed, as much reliable the results of the search.","The process of searching starts from the major clusters of the search-index. For example, searching for Web sites regarding \u201cCharlie's Angels\u201d produces seventy Web sites in the Entertainment cluster and forty Web sites in the Sport cluster. If the subject is searched in relevance with entertainment, then the next search will be in the Entertainment cluster. Searching for Web sites regarding \u201cCharlie's Angels\u201d in the Entertainment cluster produces twenty Web sites in the TV Series cluster, forty Web sites in the Movies cluster, and ten Web sites in the rest of the clusters. The search is refined by selecting the movies cluster, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Indexing:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":["Marked as , is the process that is made by the searching facility that includes Clustering and Labeling. As a result, trees of Clusters are constructed. The Web sites of the Internet are scanned and the titles of the Web sites, the links and the addresses of the pages in which predefined keywords are found are stored in a database. Then, a Clustering algorithm is executed on the collected data in order to determine clusters. Then the detected Clusters are labeled by a Labeling process.\n\nSearching:\n","The Searching, which is conducted by a user, starts at .","At , the user defines the search criteria.","At , the database is scanned in order to find the clusters (as defined at ) contain clusters that meet the criterion.","At , the names of the clusters that contain instance(s) of the searched words are presented to the user. According to an embodiment of the invention, the tree of Clusters is such that each node contains, for example, about 8\u201310 branches.","At , after the user assesses the results, if he wishes to refine the search, the process continues with . Otherwise the process proceeds to its end at .","At , the user clicks on the pointing entity (usually a name or an icon presented on his display) associated with the desired cluster.","At , the sub group of the selected cluster that contains instances of the searched words is displayed to the user, and then the process returns to .","At , the process ends. At this stage, a list of Web sites is displayed to the user, and he may select the Web site to browse by clicking its hyperlink. It is preferable that the list will contain no more than tens of links. The presentation of hundred of links would overwhelm and confuse the user."]}}}},"It should be understood that the process of refining the search may also be carried out by using the pre-classifying of the Web sites.","It is to be clear that the Indexing is a preliminary stage, and it is not carried out each time a search is performed.","Visual Presentation of Web Site's Attributes","In the prior art, hyperlinks to Web sites that have been found in a search are presented as a list. Some search engines also provide a rating number. Other search engines provide the paragraph (of the Web page) that includes the searched words. As a matter of fact, this type of presentation is one-dimensional. In order to make the list of the found Web sites more understandable and easier to analyze, the presentation of the list of Web sites is preferably carried out as follows:","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the Web sites of the Internet are categorized by predefined attributes. Then, on the presentation, the attributes will have a visual expression.","The following example presents some attributes by which Web sites can be categorized:\n\n","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the attributes of the Web sites found in a search are presented in a subjected visual presentation, possibly a 3D-dimensional. For example, according to one embodiment of the invention, all the Web sites are visualized in an urban form as follows:\n\n","A user that carries out a search may focus on the relevant Web pages by several steps wherein the street presentation is the last one of them. The steps are equivalent to the levels in a tree of clusters. According to an embodiment of the invention, each level may be presented as a geographical entity: a continent represents the highest level (Entertainment and Sport in ). The next levels can be countries, cities, streets and buildings).","According to this approach, the search begins in a conventional manner by specifying the keywords with or without the logical terms between them (And, Or, Not, etc.). As a result, the user receives an illustration of the \u201ccontinents\u201d where the searched words have been found.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"The size of the continent is preferably proportional to the number of Web sites included in that Cluster. Since the Entertainment cluster contains more Web sites than the Sport cluster, it is of greater size in this example.","After selecting the Entertainment \u201ccontinent\u201d (the selection being carried out by clicking the selected object), the user is presented with the \u201ccountries\u201d\u2014TV series, Movies, Plays, Music, etc. Again, The countries, in which the search subjects have been found, are being marked to the user (see ). The size of the \u201ccountry\u201d is proportional to the number of the Web sites of this entity.","The relevance of an entity to the search criterion can be visually marked also. For example, as greater the relevance, as highlighted the entity.","After selecting the \u201ccountry\u201d, the user is presented with the \u201ccities\u201d in the selected \u201ccountry\u201d, as illustrated in .","The last level of the focusing process is the presentation of a street, as described above.  schematically illustrates an example of a \u201cstreet\u201d presentation of a group of Web sites found in a Web search, according to an embodiment of the invention. The buildings, each represents a Web site, are numbered from  to . Building  represents a Web site, which is owned by an enterprise, hence, its presentation is like an office building. Building  represents an amateur Web site and hence, it is presented like a private house. Building  represents a Web site that is owned by an academic institute, and therefore is presented like a campus. Building  represents a Web site that sells products, for example, it has an e-store, and thus it comprises a display-window. As mentioned above, the height of each building is relative to the number of hyperlinks pointing to and from the Web site represented by it. The width of the Web site represents, for example, the amount of information in the Web site. This parameter can be determined by the amount of words, pages, bytes, and so forth.","It should be noted that the parameters of each Web site, as well as the continents, which are formed according to clusters, are attained and prepared for display by the search engine facility prior to the search by the user, by a process independent of the user search, which is carried out in real time. The application described above is geographically oriented. However, other reference \u201cworlds\u201d may be implemented in order to emphasize the attributes of a Web site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"Web sites  are a part of the Internet .
