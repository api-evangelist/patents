title: Methods and systems for automatic evaluation of electronic discovery review and productions
abstract: Techniques are provided for automatic sampling evaluation. An automatic sampling evaluation system enables users to evaluate convergence of one or more search processes. For example, given a set of searches that were validated by human review, a system can implement a retrieval process that samples one or more non-retrieved collections. Each individual document's similarity in the one or more non-retrieved collections is automatically evaluated to other documents in any retrieved sets. Given a goal of achieving a high recall, documents with high similarity can then be analyzed for additional noun phrases that may be used for a next iteration of a search. Convergence can be expected if the information gain in the new feedback loop is less than previous iterations, and if the additional documents identified are below a certain threshold document count.

More particularly, the disclosure relates to techniques for automatic evaluation of electronic discovery review and productions.","Collaboration using electronic messaging, such as email and instant messaging is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. Many users and organizations have transitioned to \u201cpaperless\u201d offices, where information and documents are communicated almost exclusively using electronic messaging. Also, \u201cpaper\u201d based documents can be scanned and converted to electronic files using OCR (Optical character recognition). As a result, users and organizations are also now expending time and money to sort and archive increasing volumes of digital documents and data.","At the same time, state and federal regulators such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have become increasingly aggressive in enforcing regulations requiring storage, analysis, and reporting of information based on electronic messages. Additionally, criminal cases and civil litigation frequently employ electronic discovery techniques, in addition to traditional discovery methods, to discover information from electronic documents and messages.","One problem with electronically storing information is that complying with disclosure requirements or reporting requirements is difficult because of the large amounts of data that may accumulate. As broadband connections to the Internet are common in most homes and businesses, emails frequently include one or more multi-megabyte attachments. Moreover, these emails and attachments are increasingly of diverse and propriety formats, making later access to data difficult without the required software.","Another problem is that disclosure requirements or reporting requirements do not simply require that the electronic message be preserved and then disclosed. Often, the disclosure requirements or reporting requirements are more focused toward the disclosure or report on information about the electronic message, such as who had access to sensitive data referred to in the contents of a particular electronic message. Some companies have teams of employees spending days and weeks reviewing emails in order to respond to regulatory audits and investigations. For these reasons, the inventors believe that users and organizations need electronic message analysis solutions to help lower costs in disclosing and\/or reporting information related to electronic messaging and other electronically stored information.","In electronic discovery, whether it is for early case assessment or for improving speed and accuracy of review, it is critically important to identify as many responsive documents as is possible. Unlike typical web search engine technologies which focuses on identifying only a handful of most relevant documents, electronic discovery invariably is about minimizing the risks of overlooking relevant documents and minimizing expenses. This shifts the technical challenge from optimizing precision (finding only relevant documents) into one of increasing recall (finding most of the relevant documents).","Accordingly, what is desired is to solve problems relating to automatic review of electronic discovery and productions, some of which may be discussed herein. Additionally, what is desired is to reduce drawbacks relating to automatic review of electronic discovery and productions, some of which may be discussed herein.","The following portion of this disclosure presents a simplified summary of one or more innovations, embodiments, and\/or examples found within this disclosure for at least the purpose of providing a basic understanding of the subject matter. This summary does not attempt to provide an extensive overview of any particular embodiment or example. Additionally, this summary is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of an embodiment or example or to delineate the scope of the subject matter of this disclosure. Accordingly, one purpose of this summary may be to present some innovations, embodiments, and\/or examples found within this disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to a more detailed description presented later.","In various embodiments, a semantic space associated with a corpus of electronically stored information (ESI) may be created. Documents (and any other objects in the ESI, in general) may be represented as vectors in the semantic space. Vectors may correspond to identifiers, such as, for example, indexed terms. The semantic space for a corpus of ESI can be used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing, and relevancy rankings.","The semantic space can be leveraged for automatic sampling evaluation. An automatic sampling evaluation system enables users to evaluate convergence of one or more search processes. For example, given a set of searches that were validated by human review, a system can implement a retrieval process that samples one or more non-retrieved collections. Each individual document's similarity in the one or more non-retrieved collections is automatically evaluated to other documents in any retrieved sets. Given a goal of achieving a high recall, documents with high similarity can then be analyzed for additional noun phrases that may be used for a next iteration of a search. Convergence can be expected if the information gain in the new feedback loop is less than previous iterations, and if the additional documents identified are below a certain threshold document count","In various embodiments, a computer-implemented method for evaluating a search process is provided. Information is received identifying in a collection of documents a first set of documents that satisfy search criteria associated with a first search. A document feature vector is then generated for each document in the first set of documents. Information is received identifying in the documents in the collection of documents that do not satisfy the search criteria associated with the first search a second set of documents that satisfy first sampling criteria. A document feature vector is then generated for each document in the second set of documents. A determination is made whether a second search of the collection results in new document gain based on the document feature vector for each document in the first set of documents and the document feature vector for at least one document in the second set of documents. Information indicative of whether the second search of the collection results in new document gain can then be generated and\/or displayed to a user.","In one aspect, determining whether the second search of the collection results in new document gain can include determining that the document feature vector of the at least one document in the second set of documents satisfies similarity criteria associated with a document feature vector generated to represent all documents in the first set of documents. Determining that the document feature vector of the at least one document in the second set of documents satisfies the similarity criteria associated with the document feature vector generated to represent all documents in the first set of documents can further include determining that the similarity criteria is satisfied by a predetermined threshold likely to increase the number of documents produced in the second search. In another aspect, determining whether the second search of the collection results in new document gain can include determining that the document feature vector of the at least one document in the second set of documents satisfies similarity criteria associated with the document feature vector for at least one document in the first set of documents.","In further embodiments, a set of noun phrases associated with the second search can be determined based on the at least one document in the second set of documents. Search criteria associated with the second search may be generated based on the search criteria associated with the first search and the determined set of noun phrases. A determination may be made whether a third search of the collection results in new document gain based on a document feature vector generated for each document in a third set of documents that satisfy the search criteria associated with the second search and a document feature vector generated for at least one document in a fourth set of documents identified in the documents in the collection of documents that do not satisfy the search criteria associated with the second search that satisfy second sampling criteria. Information can then be generated indicative of whether the third search of the collection results in new document gain.","In some embodiments, determining the document feature vector for each document in the first set of documents can include determining a plurality of term feature vectors for the document and generating the document feature vector for the document based on each term vector in the plurality of term vectors.","In one embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable medium is provided storing computer-executable code for evaluating a search process. The non-transitory computer-readable medium includes code for receiving information identifying in a collection of documents a first set of documents that satisfy search criteria associated with a first search, code for determining a document feature vector for each document in the first set of documents, code for receiving information identifying in the documents in the collection of documents that do not satisfy the search criteria associated with the first search a second set of documents that satisfy first sampling criteria, code for determining a document feature vector for each document in the second set of documents, code for determining whether a second search of the collection results in new document gain based on the document feature vector for each document in the first set of documents and the document feature vector for at least one document in the second set of documents, and code for generating information indicative of whether the second search of the collection results in new document gain.","In a further embodiment, a system for evaluating search process of electronic discovery investigations can include a processor and a memory configured to store a set of instructions which when executed by the processor configure the processor to receive information identifying in a collection of documents a first set of documents that satisfy search criteria associated with a first search, determine a document feature vector for each document in the first set of documents, receive information identifying in the documents in the collection of documents that do not satisfy the search criteria associated with the first search a second set of documents that satisfy first sampling criteria, determine a document feature vector for each document in the second set of documents, determine whether a second search of the collection results in new document gain based on the document feature vector for each document in the first set of documents and the document feature vector for at least one document in the second set of documents, and generate information indicative of whether the second search of the collection results in new document gain.","A further understanding of the nature of and equivalents to the subject matter of this disclosure (as well as any inherent or express advantages and improvements provided) should be realized in addition to the above section by reference to the remaining portions of this disclosure, any accompanying drawings, and the claims.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to information systems used in e-discovery and information governance. More particularly, this disclosure relates to techniques for automatic evaluation of electronic discovery review and productions.","The embodiments discussed herein are illustrative of one or more examples of the present invention. As these embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to illustrations, various modifications or adaptations of the methods and\/or specific structures described may become apparent to those skilled in the art. All such modifications, adaptations, or variations that rely upon the teachings of the present invention, and through which these teachings have advanced the art, are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.","Hence, the present descriptions and drawings should not be considered in a limiting sense, as it is understood that the present invention is in no way limited to only the embodiments illustrated.","Processing of Electronic Messages",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","115","120","125","130","135","140","145","150","155","105","160","165","170","175","180","185","190","195","115","117","155","157"]},"Master index  can include hardware and\/or software elements that provide indexing of information associated with electronic documents, such as word processing files, presentation files, databases, e-mail message and attachments, instant messaging (IM) messages, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, Multimedia Message Service (MMS), or the like. Master index  may be embodied as one or more flat files, databases, data marts, data warehouses, and other repositories of data. Although the disclosure references specific examples using e-mail messages, the disclosure should not be considered as limited to only e-mail message or electronic messages only. The disclosure is applicable to other types of electronic documents as discussed above.","In various embodiments, master index  provides indexes configured for accessing and retrieving a variety of content, metadata, and attributes associated with electronic documents processed by processing system . For example, e-mail tables  can include hardware and\/or software elements that index information associated with e-mail messages processed by processing system . E-mail full text index  can include hardware and\/or software elements that provide a full text index of e-mail messages processed by processing system . The full text index may be an inverted index that enables fast searching of contents (e.g., headers and body), metadata, and attachments of e-mail messages processed by processing system .","Topic tables  can include hardware and\/or software elements that index e-mails and topics, concepts, or categories. Topic tables  may store relationships between predetermined, user-defined, or automatically derived topics, concepts, or categories and e-mail messages processed by processing system . In another aspect, topic table  may store relationships between related, similar, and near-duplicate e-mail messages. Cluster full text index  can include hardware and\/or software elements that provide a full text index of e-mail messages that have a cluster relationship. A cluster relationship may be defined by relationships based on statistical analysis of noun phrases, linguistic analysis, semantic analysis, or the like. Clusters of e-mail messages having close relationships satisfying predetermined criteria may be associated with topics in topic tables .","Distribution list full text index  can include hardware and\/or software elements that provide a full text index of e-mail messages associated with a distribution or conversation, such as mailing list or e-mail chain. Participant tables  can include hardware and\/or software elements that index information related to participants of a distribution or conversation (e.g., To-recipients, CC-recipients, BCC-recipients, etc.). Dimension tables  and fact tables  can include hardware and\/or software elements that index information facilitating further processing of e-mail messages processed by processing system , such as data warehouse processing, post-processing analytics, or the like.","MAPI module  is linked to e-mail servers  and to duplicate eliminator . MAPI module  can include hardware and\/or software elements configured for communicating with data repositories, such as e-mail servers . In this example, MAPI module  may interface directly with e-mail server  using one or more application programming interfaces (APIs). MAPI module  may incorporate or implement other interfaces, protocols, etc. for facilitating communication with a particular data repository. E-mail servers  can include hardware and\/or software elements that provide electronic messaging services, such as e-mail transport, storage, and retrieval. One example of mail server  is a computer system running Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Mail server  may include other mail transport agents, mail user agents, and the like. E-mail messages may be stored on mail server  in a file, such as an Outlook PST file, a database, or the like.","Duplicate eliminator  can include hardware and\/or software elements that detect and eliminate redundant and\/or duplicative information from data repositories. In one example of operation, MAPI module  may retrieve e-mail messages from e-mail servers  in order to \u201ccrawl\u201d e-mail servers  to request e-mail messages. Duplicate eliminator  may filter redundant and\/or duplicate e-mail messages received from e-mail servers .","For example, a user A of mail server  may have sent an e-mail message addressed to user B and to user C. When duplicate eliminator  received e-mail messages obtained from mailboxes on mail server  for users A, B, and C, user A's mailbox contains the e-mail message as sent to user B and user C. Additionally, both user B's and user C's mailbox contains the respective user's copy of the e-mail message as received from user A. Duplicate eliminator potentially receives at least three copies of the e-mail message.","Duplicate eliminator  may determine two MD5 checksums for each e-mail message to \u201cidentify\u201d the e-mail message. Duplicate eliminator  may compute the MD5 checksums in response to message attribute data associated with an e-mail message, such as a sender e-mail address or sender identifier, sorted To-recipient e-mail addresses or To-recipient identifiers, sent time, alpha-numeric contents of subject, and the body text (e.g., body text size, contents of the body text, etc.). Other information not included in the e-mail message but associated with the message attribute data may also be used to compute the MD5 checksums. Other types of integrity, detection, and authenticity algorithms, such as cyclical redundancy checks (CRCs), hashes, and the like, may be used in addition to or in the alternative to the MD5 checksum.","In one example, a first \u201cstrict\u201d MD5 checksum can be computed that is unique and represents an exact match of a processed e-mail message. A second \u201crelaxed\u201d MD5 checksum can be computed that is non-unique or semi-unique. Duplicate eliminator  may compute a relaxed MD5 checksum using a portion or subset of the message attribute data used to compute the strict MD5 checksum. When duplicate eliminator receives a new e-mail, the new e-mail message may be processed (e.g., address normalization and cleansing) and a strict MD5 checksum may be computed and compared with previously computed strict MD5 checksums to determine whether the new e-mail message is unique. If the strict MD5 checksum for the new e-mail message is different, duplicate eliminator  then computes a relaxed MD5 checksum for the new e-mail message and compares the relaxed MD5 checksum to previously computed relaxed MD5 checksums.","If the relaxed MD5 checksum for the new e-mail message is different, then the new-e-mail address is not a duplicate. If the relaxed MD5 checksum for the new e-mail message is the same as one or more previously computed relaxed MD5 checksums, duplicate eliminator  may apply one or more rules or policies to further eliminate possible duplicate e-mail messages. The rules or polices may be based on time differences, header processing, and the like, and also the addition of trailing content, such as disclaimers, names of attachment files, and the like.","Buffer manager  is linked to duplicate eliminator  and indexer . Buffer manager  can include hardware and\/or software elements that manage data communications. Buffer manager  may buffer or otherwise manage production and consumption of e-mail messages retrieved while \u201ccrawling\u201d data repositories. In one embodiment, buffer manager  may create batches of e-mail messages. In one aspect, batching the e-mail messages may allow indexer  to apply batch-processing techniques to message attribute data associated with a batch of e-mail messages. Buffer manager  may create batches of 10, 50, or 100 e-mail messages.","Indexer  is linked to master index . Indexer  can include hardware and\/or software elements that index electronic documents. Indexer  may include functionality for decomposing documents into constituent parts and populating master index . For example, indexer  may process an e-mail message to parse header and body fields to retrieve message content and generate metadata associated with the e-mail message. Indexer  may further perform other types of processing, such as surface processing, statistical processing, linguistic processing, semantic processing, or the like.","Advantageously, electronic document processing system  can provide a user or organization with access to indexed electronically stored information to assist in reporting requirements or gathering information for the purposes of electronic discovery and information governance. After \u201ccrawling\u201d data repositories to retrieve documents and the like, processing system  can automatically process and index the retrieved information. Processing system  can then allow the user or organization to readily and quickly search and query the processed information for a variety of purposes. Processing system  further provides other post-processing features to enhance the discovery and presentation of relevant information to the user or organization.","For example, thread analyzer  is linked to master index . Thread analyzer  can include hardware and\/or software elements that organize documents into one or more discussions or conversations. An e-mail thread can be a series or sequence of one or more e-mail messages that form a logical discussion or communication. E-mail messages within an e-mail thread may be related by sender address, recipient address, topic, and time. E-mail messages may further be related based on forwarding replies, CC-recipients, BCC-recipients, and the like. Thread analyzer  may determined groups of documents that are related to a discussion or conversation as well as determine orderings or position of e-mail messages in e-mail threads.","In another example, topic classifier  is linked to master index . Topic classifier  can include hardware and\/or software elements that determine topics, concepts, or categories for an electronic document. Topic classifier  may determine a topic of an e-mail message based on the subject header or in response to the content of the body of an e-mail message. Topic classifier  may further determine a topic of an e-mail message based on statistical, linguistic, or semantic analysis. Topic classifier  may associate an e-mail message with a given topic, classifier, and\/or category. The topic may be predefined, user-defined, or automatically created based on based on statistical, linguistic, or semantic analysis.","In another example, analytics ETL module  is linked to master index . Analytics ETL module  can include hardware and\/or software elements that provide an interface accessing master index . In one example, analytics ETL module  provides an interface for importing and\/or extracting data between master index  and one or more external data sources. Analytics ETL module  may provide an interface for transforming data in master index  (e.g., cleansing, aggregation, summarization, integration, etc.) and loading the data into some form of data warehouse for further analysis and processing.","In yet another example, directory interface  is linked to master index  and directory servers . Directory interface  can include hardware and\/or software elements that access information stored in a directory. A directory can include any database of information associated with objects, such as users or computer hosts. In various embodiments, directory servers  include one or more directory servers (e.g., directory server ) running Active Directory by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. In other embodiments, other types of directory servers and\/or services may be used such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers, Identity Management servers, and the like. In various embodiments, examples of information stored in directory servers  can include \u201corganizational\u201d or \u201ccorporate\u201d data, such as department identifiers associated with a user or computer host, a group identifier associated with a user, a corporate or departmental title associated with a user, telephone and address information, and security information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","206","208","210","202","204","206","208","210","202","204","206"]},"Portal  includes software elements for accessing and presenting information provided by the indexer . In this example, the portal  includes web applications  communicatively coupled to information gathering and presentation resources, such as a Java Server Page (JSP) module , a query engine , a query optimization module , an analytics module , and a domain templates module .","Indexer  includes software elements for processing and storing e-mail messages. The indexer  includes metadata , full text indices , thread analysis , group effects , and topics .","Crawler  includes software elements for retrieving e-mail messages from an e-mail repository. Some examples of an e-mail repository are an e-mail server (e.g., one of the mail servers  of ), a Post Office Protocol (POP) enabled computer server, an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) enabled computer server, and files, such as PST files, UNIX style maildirs\/mbox formats, and the like. In this example, the crawler  includes Reference Information Storage System (RISS) module , Enterprise Vault Software (EV) module , MAPI module , PST module , Directory Services (ADS) module , and a Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Merge Wizard (ExMerge) module .","Accordingly, software components  can provide a user or organization with access to indexed electronically stored information to assist in reporting requirements or gathering information for the purposes of electronic discovery and information governance. After \u201ccrawling\u201d electronically stored information to retrieve documents and the like, software components  can automatically process and index the retrieved information. Software components  can then allow the user or organization to readily and quickly search and query the processed information for a variety of purposes.","Recall of Processed Documents","Early assessment is a growingly important phase of e-discovery and information governance during which complete scope and extent of relevant information in a collection is often unknown. Traditional keyword and Boolean searches often play a big part in an assessment, but they are not always enough to hone in on the specifics of a case. In one aspect, electronic document processing system  can offer an additional approach to improve the recall of related and relevant documents based on statistical and linguistic analysis of document content.","In various embodiments, processing system  may be used for electronic discovery. Electronic discovery almost always involves searching for relevant and responsive documents. One or more technologies may be applied for the task. Keyword based search has been one traditional method of searching, but its limitations have been well understood and documented [1]. At their most basic level, concept search technologies are designed to overcome some limitations of keyword search.","When applied to document discovery, traditional Boolean keyword search often results in sets of documents that include non-relevant items (false positives) or that exclude relevant terms (false negatives). This is primarily due to the effects of synonymy (different words with similar meanings) or polysemy (same word with multiple meanings). For polysemes, an important characteristic requirement is that they share the same etymology but their usage has evolved it into different meanings. Moreover, there are also situations where words that do not share the same etymology have different meanings (e.g., river bank vs. financial bank), in which case they are classified as homonyms. In addition to the above word forms, unstructured text content, and especially written text in emails and instant messages contain user-created code words, proper name equivalents, contextually defined substitutes, and prepositional references etc., that mask the document from being indentified using Boolean keyword search. Even simple misspellings, typos and OCR scanning errors can make it difficult to locate relevant documents.","Also common is an inherent desire of speakers to use a language that is most suited from the perspective that is convenient for the speaker. This can be illustrated using the event which the victim's side called the event in question an \u201caccident\u201d or a \u201cdisaster\u201d while the plaintiff's side called it an \u201cevent\u201d, \u201csituation\u201d, \u201cincident\u201d, \u201cproblem\u201d, \u201cdifficulty\u201d, etc. The combination of human emotion, language variation, and assumed context makes the challenge of retrieving these documents purely on the basis of Boolean keyword searches a nearly impossible task.","Concept based searching is a very different type of search when compared to Boolean keyword search. The input to concept searching is one or more words that allow the investigator or user to express a concept. The search system is then responsible for identifying other documents that belong to the same concept. All concept searching technologies attempt to retrieve documents that belong to a concept (reduce false negatives and improve recall) while at the same time not retrieve irrelevant documents (reduce false positives and increase precision).","Thus, concept search, as applied to electronic discovery, is a search using meaning or semantics. While it is very intuitive in evoking a human reaction, expressing meaning as input to a system and applying that as a search that retrieves relevant documents is something that requires a formal model. Technologies that attempt to do this formalize both the input request and the model of storing and retrieving potentially relevant documents in a mathematical form. There are several technologies available for such treatment, with two broad initial approaches.","First are unsupervised learning systems. These systems convert input text into a semantic model, typically by employing a mathematical analysis technique over a representation called vector space model. This model captures a statistical signature of a document, its terms and their occurrences. A matrix derived from the corpus is then analyzed using a Matrix decomposition technique. These systems are unsupervised in the sense that they do not require a training set where data is pre-classified into concepts or topics. Also, such systems do not use ontology or any classification hierarchy and rely purely on the statistical patterns of terms in documents.","These systems generally derive their semantics through a representation of co-occurrence of terms. One primary consideration is maintaining this co-occurrence in a form that reduces impact of noise terms while capturing the essential elements of a document. For example, a document about an automobile launch may contain terms about automobiles, their marketing activity, public relations etc., but may have a few terms related to the month, location and attendees, along with frequently occurring terms such as pronouns and prepositions. Such terms do not define the concept automobile, so their impact in the definition must be reduced. To achieve such end result, unsupervised learning systems represent the matrix of document-terms and perform a mathematical transformation called dimensionality reduction.","First are supervised learning systems. In the supervised learning model, an entirely different approach is taken. A main requirement in this model is supplying a previously established collection of documents that constitutes a training set. The training set contains several examples of documents belonging to specific concepts. The learning algorithm analyzes these documents and builds a model, which can then be applied to other documents to see if they belong to one of the several concepts that is present in the original training set. Thus, concept searching task becomes a concept learning task that may use one of the following techniques: Decision Trees, Na\u00efve Bayesian Classifier, and Support Vector Machines.","While supervised learning is an effective approach during document review, its usage in the context of searching has significant limitations. In many situations, a training set that covers all possible outcomes is unavailable and it is difficult to locate exemplar documents. Also, when the number of outcomes is very large and unknown, such methods are known to produce poor results.","As noted earlier, concept searching techniques are most applicable when they can reveal semantic meanings of a corpus without a supervised learning phase. One method includes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) also is known with Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). LSI is one of the most well-known approaches to semantic evaluation of documents. This was first advanced at Bell Labs (1985) and later developed by many information retrieval researchers [3]. The essence of the approach is to build a complete term-document matrix, which captures all the documents and the words present in each document. Typical representation is to build an N\u00d7M matrix where the N rows are the documents, and M columns are the terms in the corpus. Each cell in this matrix represents the frequency of occurrence of the term at the \u201ccolumn\u201d in the document \u201crow\u201d.","Such a matrix is often very large\u2014document collections in the millions and terms reaching tens of millions are not uncommon. Once such a matrix is built, the mathematical technique known as SVD reduces the dimensionality of the matrix into a smaller size. This process reduces the size of the matrix and captures the essence of each document by the most important terms that co-occur in a document. In the process, the dimensionally reduced space represents the \u201cconcepts\u201d that reflect the conceptual contexts in which the terms appear.","Another method includes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which is very similar to latent semantic analysis in that a set of highly correlated artifacts of words and documents in which they appear is translated into a combination of the smallest set of uncorrelated factors. These factors are the principal items of interest in defining the documents, and are determined using a SVD technique. The mathematical treatment, application and results are similar to LSI. A variation on this, called Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a technique that works well with data of limited variability. However, in the context of electronic discovery documents where data varies widely, this results in poor performance.","Yet another method includes Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) which is most useful for classification and text clustering where a large collection of documents are forced into a small set of clusters. NMF constructs a document-term matrix similar to LSI and includes the word frequency of each term. This is factored into a term-feature and feature-document matrix, with the features automatically derived from the document collection. The process also constructs data clusters of related documents as part of the mathematical reduction. An example of this research takes the Enron email corpus and classifies the data using NMF into 50 clusters [2].","Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a technique that combines elements of Bayesian learning and probabilistic latent semantic indexing. In this sense, it relies on a subset of documents pre-classified into a training set, and unclassified documents are classified into concepts based on a combination of models from the training set [10].","Although theoretically attractive and experimentally successful, word space models are plagued with efficiency and scalability problems. This is especially true when the models are faced with real-world applications and large scale data sets. The source of these problems is the high dimensionality of the context vectors, which is a direct function of the size of the data. If document-based co-occurrences is used, the dimensionality equals the number of documents in the collection. If word-based co-occurrences is used, the dimensionality equals the vocabulary, which tends to be even bigger than the number of documents. This means that the co-occurrence matrix will soon become computationally intractable when the vocabulary and the document collections grow.","Nearly all the technologies build a word space by building a word-document matrix with each row representing a document and column representing a word. Each cell in such a matrix represents the frequency of occurrence of the word in that document. All these technologies suffer from a memory space challenge, as these matrices grow to very large sizes. Although many cells are sparse, the initial matrix is so large that it is not possible to accommodate the computational needs of large electronic discovery collections. Any attempt to reduce this size to a manageable size is likely to inadvertently drop potentially responsive documents. Another problem with all of these methods is that they require the entire semantic space to be constructed ahead of time, and are unable to accommodate new data that would be brought in for analysis. In most electronic discovery projects, it is routine that some part of the data is brought in as a first loading batch, and once review is started, additional batches are processed.","In various embodiments, a semantic space is generated using a variation of Reflective Random Indexing (RRI) [4, 5, 6]. In one aspect, a semantic vector space model is provided to achieve the same dimensionality reduction espoused by LSI, without requiring the mathematically complex and intensive SVD and related matrix methods. In some embodiment, a set of term vectors and a set of document vectors are created. These vectors may be built using a scan of the document and term space with several data normalization steps. A semantic space build may occur seamlessly without any user intervention, such as during indexing or analytics processing as discussed above. Case data collection may then ready for culling, early case assessment (ECA), search, review, production, or the like.","Generation of a Semantic Space","In various embodiments, processing system  generates a semantic space with semantic vectors as term vectors and document vectors. Processing system  may generate a term vector for each term in a corpus of information. Processing system  then may generate a document vector for each document in the corpus. As noted earlier, one primary characteristic of the semantic space is a dimensionality reduction of a term-document matrix. Each row in a term-document matrix represents all documents in which a term appears. Each column in the matrix represents all terms that a document contains. Therefore, semantic relatedness may be expressed in the connectedness of each matrix cell. For example, two documents that share the same set of terms may be connected through a direct connection. It is also possible for two documents to be connected using an indirect reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","310","310","310","310","320","310","330","340"]},"Semantic vector analysis module  includes hardware and\/or software elements configured for generating semantic space .

In another example, semantic vector analysis module  may apply one or more rules to remove terms with very low global term frequency (TF). Terms less than a small number of global TF also may not help, since they are limited to just a few documents.

For example, processing system  may then compute new document vectors from the term vectors, replacing the former random assignments with a new vector. For example, processing system  computes a new document vector for each document by examining all the terms of the document and merging all the term vectors into a new document vector (e.g., using a vector sum). The merging of term vectors may take into account the frequency of each term in the document and the frequency of the document in the entire corpus.","In some embodiments, the above process constitutes a single training cycle.

As discussed above, in various embodiments, a set of random document vectors may be generated with each document of a corpus using Random Indexing. The general idea behind word space models is to use distributional statistics to generate high-dimensional vector spaces, in which words are represented by context vectors whose relative directions are assumed to indicate semantic similarity. This assumption is motivated by the distributional hypothesis, which states that words with similar meanings tend to occur in similar contexts. According to this hypothesis, if two words are observed that constantly occur with the same contexts, it may be assuming that the two words mean similar things. The two words not need to occur with each other; only that the words co-occur with the same other words. In standard word space methodology, a high-dimensional vector space is produced by collecting the data in a co-occurrence matrix F, such that each row Fw represents a unique word w and each column Fc represents a context c, typically a multi-word segment such as a document, or another word. In the former case, where the columns represents documents, the matrix may be a words-by-documents matrix. In the latter case where the columns represents words, the matrix may be called a words-by-words matrix. LSA is an example of a word space model that uses document-based co-occurrences.","The cells Fwc of a co-occurrence matrix record the frequency of co-occurrence of word w and document or word c. As an example, for document-based co-occurrences, and if a given word is observed three times in a given document in a corpus, a 3 may be entered in a corresponding cell in the co-occurrence matrix. By the same token, for word-based co-occurrences, and if two given words are observed to occur close to each other five times in a corpus, a 7 may be entered in a corresponding cell of the co-occurrence matrix. Frequency counts are usually normalized and weighted in order to reduce the effects of high frequency words, and, in case document-based co-occurrences are used, to compensate for differences in document size.","The point of the co-occurrence matrix is that the rows Fw effectively constitute vectors in a high-dimensional space, such that the elements of the vectors are (normalized) frequency counts, and the dimensionality of the space is determined by the number of columns in the matrix, which is identical to the number of contexts (i.e. words or documents) in a corpus. We call the vectors context or document vectors, since they represent the contexts or documents in which words have occurred. In effect, the context or document vectors are representations of the distributional profiles of words, which means that a distributional similarity may be defined between words in terms of vector similarity. By virtue of the distributional hypothesis, this makes it very straight-forward to compute semantic similarity between words, such that a comparison is made between context vectors using any of a wide range of possible vector similarity measures, such as the cosine of the angles between the vectors, or the City-Block metric.","Although theoretically attractive and experimentally successful, word space models are plagued with efficiency and scalability problems. This is especially true when the models are faced with real-world applications and largescale data sets. One source of these problems is the high dimensionality of context or document vectors, which is a direct function of the size of the data. For document-based co-occurrences, the dimensionality equals the number of documents in the collection, and for word-based co-occurrences, the dimensionality equals the vocabulary, which tends to be even bigger than the number of documents. This means that the co-occurrence matrix will soon become computationally intractable when the vocabulary and the document collection grow. Another problem with the co-occurrence matrix is that a majority of the cells in the matrix will be zero due to the sparse data problem. That is, only a fraction of the co-occurrence events that are possible in the co-occurrence matrix will actually occur, regardless of the size of the data. A tiny amount of the words in language are distributionally promiscuous; the vast majority of words only occur in a very limited set of contexts. In a typical co-occurrence matrix, more than 99% of the entries are zero.","In order to counter problems with very high dimensionality and data sparseness, most well-known and successful models, like LSA, use statistical dimension reduction techniques. Standard LSA uses truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is a matrix factorization technique that can be used to decompose and approximate a matrix, so that the resulting matrix has much fewer columns\u2014typically only a couple of hundred\u2014and is much denser. It should be noted that SVD is not the only way to achieve this result. There are a number of related dimension reduction techniques that are used in word space research (e.g. principal component analysis and independent component analysis), and they all share the same basic methodology: first sample the data in a standard co-occurrence matrix, and then transform it into a much smaller and denser representation.","There are (at least) three reasons to avoid using dimension reduction techniques of this type:","Dimension reduction techniques such as SVD tend to be computationally very costly, with regards to both memory consumption and execution time. For many applications, and especially for large vocabularies and large document collections, it is not practically feasible to compute an SVD.","Dimension reduction is typically a one-time operation, which means that the entire process of first constructing the co-occurrence matrix and then transforming it has to be done from scratch, every time new data is encountered. The inability to add new data to the model is a serious deficiency, as many applications require the possibility to easily update the model.","Most importantly, these dimension reduction techniques fail to avoid the initial huge co-occurrence matrix. On the contrary, they require initial sampling of the entire data. There are two problems with this. First, it is the initial co-occurrence matrix that is computationally cumbersome. In order to make the models efficient and scalable, this step should be avoided, rather than handled by ad hoc solutions. Second, initial sampling of the entire data means that there can be no intermediary results. It is only after both constructing and transforming the co-occurrence matrix that any processing can begin.","As an alternative to LSA-like models that first construct a huge co-occurrence matrix and then use a separate dimension reduction phase, processing system  may use an incremental word space model called Random Indexing, based on Pentti Kanerva's work on sparse distributed representations. The basic idea is to accumulate context vectors based on the occurrence of words in contexts. This technique can be used with any type of linguistic context, is inherently incremental, and does not require a separate dimension reduction phase.","In some embodiments, a Random Indexing technique can be described as a two-step operation:","First, each context (e.g. each document or each word) in a corpus of information is assigned a unique and randomly generated representation called an index vector. These index vectors are sparse, high-dimensional, and ternary, which means that their dimensionality (d) is on the order of thousands, and that they consist of a small number of randomly distributed +1s and \u22121s, with the rest of the elements of the vectors set to 0.","Then, context vectors are produced by scanning through the text, and each time a word occurs in a context (e.g. in a document, or within a sliding context window), that context's d-dimensional index vector is added to the context vector for the word in question. Words are thus represented by d-dimensional context vectors that are effectively the sum of the words' contexts.","In the Random Indexing approach, a standard co-occurrence matrix F of order w\u00d7c is produced by using unary index vectors of the same dimensionality c as the number of contexts, and then the resulting context vectors are collected in a matrix. Such unary index vectors would consist of a single 1 in a different position for each context, and would thus be orthogonal. By contrast, the d-dimensional random index vectors are only nearly orthogonal.","In step , a first term for which to generate a term vector is selected.

In another aspect, processing system  may start with existing document vectors and term vectors and add new terms\/document into it. In such a case, the additional documents simply add to the semantic space by reinforcing existing term and document vectors.","In some embodiments, processing system  may further capture positional information of terms. System  may use positional information and build a term and its neighbors as a way of limiting how a term's proximity defines its context. Accordingly, during indexing, processing system  may further capturing special positional information. Processing system  then may build a term-to-term projection based on the positional information.","Accordingly, in various embodiments, a semantic space may be build using a linear scan of terms, followed by a scan of documents. In contrast to LSA and other dimensionality reduction techniques, processing system  requires much less memory and CPU resources for semantic space construction. This is primarily because matrix operations such as singular value decomposition (SVD) are computationally intensive, and requires both the initial term-document matrix and intermediate matrices to be manipulated in memory. In contrast, semantic vectors can be built for a portion of the term space with a portion of the index. It is also possible to scale simply by employing persistence to disk at appropriate batching levels, thus scaling to unlimited term and document collections. Additionally, in other aspects, processing system  may more easily parallelize vector space building for distribution across multiple systems. This allows parallel computation of the space, allowing for a distributed algorithm to work on multiple term-document spaces simultaneously. This can dramatically increase the availability of concept search capabilities to very large matters, and within time constraints that are typically associated with large electronic discovery projects.","Moreover, processing system  may build a semantic space incrementally, as new batches of data are received, without having to build the entire space from scratch. This is a very common scenario in electronic discovery, as an initial batch of document review needs to proceed before all batches are collected. It is also fairly common for the scope of electronic discovery to increase after early case assessment. Finally, processing system  may be tune a semantic space using parameter selection such as dimension selection, similarity function selection and selection of term-term vs. term-document projections. These capabilities allow electronic discovery project teams to weigh the costs of computational resources against the scope of documents to be retrieved by the search. If a matter requires a very narrow interpretation of relevance, the concept search algorithm can be tuned and iterated rapidly. Like other statistical methods, semantic spaces retain their ability to work with a corpus including multiple languages, multiple data types, encoding types etc., which is a key requirement for e-discovery. This is because processing system  does not rely on linguistic priming or linguistic rules for its operation.","Resource requirements for building a semantic vector space is an important consideration. Time and space complexity of semantic space algorithms can be evaluated as a function of corpus size, both from the initial construction phase and for follow-on search and retrievals.

While the number of document vectors closely tracks the number of documents, the number of term vectors grows more slowly. This is the case even for OCR-error prone ESI collections, where the term vector growth moderated as new documents were added to the corpus.","In some aspects, space complexity of a semantic space model is linear with respect to the input size. Partitioning of a problem across certain term boundaries and persisting the term and document vectors can provide for increased scalability. For example, a 4 million document collection with 20 million terms, processing system  may break apart the term collection into 20 sub-spaces of a million terms each. Since term vector stores do not rely on other term vectors\u2014they only rely on document vectors, the space can be partitioned effectively. For the above case, processing system  may implement scaling by sharding the terms in a multi-pass algorithm. Since both the semantic space construction and its use during concept search are scalable by use of external disk-resident structures, memory requirements are modest. One implementation of the algorithm requires memory space for tracking one million term and document vectors, which is about 2 GB, for a semantic vector dimension of 200.","Time for semantic space construction is linear on the number of terms and documents. For a very large corpus, the space construction requires periodic persistence of partially constructed term and document vectors and their clusters. A typical configuration persists term vectors for each million terms, and documents at each million documents. As an example, the NIST TextRetrieval Conference (TREC) Legal Track supplied tobacco corpus would require 4 term sub-space constructions, with six document partitions, yielding 24 data persistence invocations. If we consider the number of training cycles, each training cycle repeats the same processes. As an example, the TREC tobacco corpus with two training cycles involves 48 persistence invocations.

Processing system  may perform text clustering based on semantic vectors to generate one or more cluster representing \u201cconcepts\u201d or \u201ctopics.\u201d For example processing system  may identify document clusters based on document vectors and create concepts or topics from these document clusters. Naming of concepts or topics may be based on frequent terms appearing in members of the cluster.","One valuable usage item is the centroid of each cluster, which is a centroid representation of all cluster members. For example, cluster  is associated with centroid  which is a vector representing the \u201ccenter\u201d of all documents that are members of cluster . All documents that are members of cluster  also all within radius . Radius  may be a maximum radius around centroid  that encompasses the document vectors of all documents that are members of cluster .","In some aspects, a clustering algorithm may be used that constructs hierarchical clusters.  is an illustration of one or more cluster hierarchies in one embodiment according to the present invention. In one example, processing system  may incorporate an algorithm for hierarchical kMeans clustering where a cosine distance metric is used for similarity. For each cluster, processing system  may determine a centroid and its max radius (e.g., determined as a cosine distance from the centroid). All vectors that belong to a cluster fall within the max radius. In this example, cluster  includes set  of sub-clusters. Each sub-cluster may have a centroid and maximum radius. Accordingly, obtaining one topic\/cluster may further show all sub-clusters in a hierarchy. Further, naming of topics may be based on frequent terms appearing in the sub-clusters below a cluster as well as the members of the cluster. Thus, processing system  may implement one or more clustering algorithms that divide data into meaningful sub-groups (clusters) so that intra-cluster similarity is maximized while inter-cluster similarity is minimized. Some techniques are further discussed in relation to the clustering research package from University of Minnesota called CLUTO.","Accordingly, in some aspects, processing system  allows visualization and other treatment (such as tagging) of like vectors (as a single concept or topic). Processing system  provides for narrowing\/partitioning search result spaces into smaller more manageable spaces, navigation paths through a large collection of documents, and the discovery of other documents through membership in clusters. Processing system  may further cluster key-vector pairs and store the pairs using an indexing method that facilitates vector comparisons for items only within a specific set of clusters as further discussed below. Cluster-ordered index has the benefit that given an object, its cluster can be identified quickly using an index.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","1000","1000","1010"]},"In step , all objects in a semantic space are initialized to belong to a single cluster. In step , a branching parameter is determined. In some embodiments, a branching parameter or k-value may be indicative of a number of branches. Values such as 10-way branching may be used. In step , objects are clustered into sub-clusters based on the branching parameter. For example, processing system  may use kMeans clustering to generate a number of sub-clusters. In another example, processing system  may use agglomerative hierarchical clustering to build a hierarchy from individual elements by progressively merging clusters.","In some embodiments, a single invocation of kMeans clustering by processing system  may include allocating a number of cluster mappings to be same size as the number of objects. Cluster centroids are allocated to be the number of clusters, each of a predetermined number of dimensions. Cluster mappings are then initialized randomly where each object vector is assigned to a random cluster. Processing system  then may iterate as many times as needed computing new mappings. Processing system  then may initialize each cluster centroid vector to zero. For each object, processing system  retrieves its vector and adds it to the cluster's centroid vector. After all objects are processed, processing system  then normalizes the centroid vector.","Processing system  thereafter computes new mappings for each object vector, based on the nearest centroid vector (i.e., the centroid that is closest to it) and changes the cluster for that object if its centroid is not its current mapping. By tracking the number of cluster mapping changes, and if there are any changes, processing system  continues to iterate for new mappings.","In step , sub-clusters are split that satisfy splitting conditions. For example, for any sub-cluster that qualifies for splitting, processing system  may recursively invoke clustering on that sub-cluster. Continuing the example above, if a member cluster member was re-assigned to a child sub-cluster, remove it from the current cluster. Processing system  stops when there are no new clusters generated.  ends in step .","In various embodiments, processing system  may utilize measurement criteria for determining whether to split a sub-cluster. For example, for a cluster in question, processing system  may determine the centroid and its vector. For all vectors that belong to that cluster, processing system  may determine a cosine distance of the vector from the centroid. If the combined normalized distance for all vectors is below a certain threshold value, processing system  may determine that the cluster should not be split further. If the distance is above a certain value, processing system  may split the cluster further.","In various embodiments, processing system  implements clustering using a variety of forms. For example, processing system  may use Cluster Mapping where a mapping parallels all root-level objects that were clustered. The mapping maps a document or term vector at the root level to the cluster it belongs. In another example, processing system  may use Cluster Partition where all object members that belong to a cluster and sub-cluster members are contained at the child level. In another example, each cluster level contains a centroid, which represents the centroid of all the members and clusters that belong under it.","In further embodiments, processing system  may cluster search results into a set of clusters. For search results that satisfy certain conditions (such as being limited to around 100K objects), processing system  may build document vectors from term vectors and build a new document vector space specific to only the search results. Processing system  may further take only the search results and build a new hierarchical cluster to cluster results. This has the advantage that any incrementally added documents (i.e., those that were not part of the corpus used to build the term or document vectors) can be part of the search results.","Storage and Retrieval of a Semantic Space","In some embodiments, processing system  may store term and document vectors of a semantic space in a persistent store so they can be reused, maintaining connections between the term vectors and document vectors.  is a block diagram illustrating persistent storage of vector space  in one embodiment according to the present invention.","Both term vectors and document vectors, at their very basic level, may have a large collection of key-value pairs to be stored and accessed. In one aspect, an index key may be either a term for a term vector or a document ID for a document vector. A frequent retrieval process may be given a key to find its corresponding vector. To facilitate fast access to object vectors for a given an object, processing system  may provide an object index, with object-ordered storage in the persistent store. During retrievals, processing system  may maintain an object index entirely in one type of storage device (such as working memory\/RAM associated with in-memory portion ), while key-vector pairs may be maintained in another type of storage device (such as on disk in a binary file associated with on-disk portion ). In order to scale the object index for very large vector stores, processing system  may create the index entries only for a small portion of the overall set of vectors. Accordingly, processing system  implements a retrieval with a binary search in the index to locate an entry closest to the query object, and then a linear scan in a small region of the persistent store. In one embodiment, processing system  may create the index entries using a configurable parameter, IndexRatio, such that if it is set to 128, processing system  may create one index entry in memory for every 128 disk entries.","In further embodiments, given a vector (either term or document vector), processing system  may find other vectors and their corresponding objects within a certain cosine distance of the supplied vector. Rather than simply scan an entire vector space linearly, performing a cosine measurement for every enumerated vector, processing system  may build vector-ordered storage and indexes to vector-ordered regions. In one embodiment, processing system  may split a vector into four equal-width segments and store the vector four times, with ordering based on the segment's order. Processing system  then may build four separate in-memory indexes into these segments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","100","100","100"]},"In another aspect, a cosine-match based retrieval may be used for identification of the top N matches of a given vector. During retrieval, processing system  may compare index vector entries for cosine similarity for each of a predetermined number of segments independently. For each segment, processing system  may identify the top N matches based on that segment, resulting in 10*N index entries. Processing system  then may scan the actual entries from each segment-ordered regions, collecting actual cosine similarity matches for each region. This may reduce the search space to 4*N*IndexRatio, so if N is set to the 20 highest entries, an index ratio of 128 gives a search space of 10K entries to be compared. In various aspects, this is a constant order search space and scales to any size of vector space.","Retrieval time for a search and time for building semantic space exploration are also characterized for various corpus sizes and complexity of queries. To facilitate a fast access to term and document vectors, processing system  may employ a purpose-build object store such as discussed above. The object store offers predictable and consistent access to a term or document semantic vector. For example, given a term or document, the object store provides random access and retrieval to its semantic vector within 10 to 30 milliseconds. In another aspect, the object store provides predictable and consistent access to all nearest neighbors (using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance measures) of a term and document vector. The object store has built-in hierarchical k-means based clustering. The search algorithm implements a cluster exploration technique that algorithmically chooses the smallest number of clusters to examine for distance comparisons. A cluster of 1000 entries is typically examined in 100 milliseconds or less.","Accordingly, in some instances, given the above object store and retrieval paths, retrieval times for searches range from 2 seconds to 10 seconds, depending in large part, on the number of nearest neighbors of a term, the number of document vectors to retrieve, and on the size of the corpus. The following Table 4 illustrates observed performance for the Enron corpus, using the cluster-directed search described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0159"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Performance Measurements"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Average","Min","Max","STDEV"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Term vector search",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Clusters Examined","417.84","2","849","274.72"]},{"entry":["Clusters Skipped","1001.25","19","1673","478.98"]},{"entry":["Terms Compared","24830.38","0","50154","16079.72"]},{"entry":["Terms Matched","21510.29","0","47294","15930.2"]},{"entry":["Total Cluster Read Time (ms)","129.39","0","405","88.23"]},{"entry":["Total Cluster Read Count","417.84","2","849","274.72"]},{"entry":["Average Cluster Read Time","0.29","0","3.75","0.18"]},{"entry":"(ms)"},{"entry":["Total Search Time (ms)","274.56","0","609","187.27"]},{"entry":"Document vector search"},{"entry":["Clusters Examined","645.07","2","4911","646.01"]},{"entry":["Clusters Skipped","2348.29","4","5366","2166.25"]},{"entry":["Docs Compared","160463.16","361","305135","126313.64"]},{"entry":["Docs Matched","29560.16","0","81796","29523.07"]},{"entry":["Total Cluster Read Time","906.52","0","5148","748.88"]},{"entry":"(ms)"},{"entry":["Total Cluster Read Count","641.24","2","1746","631.89"]},{"entry":["Average Cluster Read Time","370.51","0","2574","440.39"]},{"entry":"(ms)"},{"entry":["Total Search Time (ms)","1172.86","0","5288","675.87"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As is apparent from the above time measurements as well as number of clusters examined and skipped, concept searching can be offered to users with predictability and consistency, thereby making it possible for usage as an interactive, exploratory tool during the ECA, culling, analysis and review phases of electronic discovery.","Searching a Semantic Space","In various embodiments, once term and document vectors of a semantic space are created, they can be used for various kinds of searches. In one embodiment, a search for a concept may utilize a cosine distance measurement between a query vector and other vectors. Accordingly, identifying the nearest neighbor terms involves using the query vector to identify the other terms in a term vector store that are closest to it based on a determined cosine distance. Additionally, identifying all documents that are represented by a query can be achieved merely by identifying the closest documents to a query vector, again by way of cosine similarity.","For example,  illustrates an exemplary process  where given a single input term (i.e., one that occurs in the original corpus that was indexed), processing system  uses the semantic space to locate related terms and documents in a concept of the input term. The related terms may include all other terms closest to the input term in concept. In some embodiments, processing system  may determine related terms by using the input term to locate a corresponding term vector, and then identifying other term vectors closest to the term vector of the input term, for example, using a cosine similarity function. The words that correspond to its closest vectors are closest to the input term because they either co-occur with the input term in the same document or co-occur through other words in other documents a transitive relationship between them. Given a set of terms, processing system  may obtain each term's term vector, merge them into a single vector, and then search for other term vectors that are closest to the merged vector. Accordingly, processing system  may find several words (e.g., helmet or touchdown) that are conceptually related to an input term (e.g., football). Given a term or set of terms, processing system  may find all documents by using the term vectors and the corresponding words and performing a Lucene search to find all documents containing the term.","In another example,  illustrates an exemplary process  where given an input paragraph, processing system  uses the semantic space to locate related terms that co-occur in the paragraph. In yet another example,  illustrates an exemplary process  where processing system  determines those documents that match an input document according to predetermined conditions thereby yielding a document collection. In one aspect, processing system  pick only those documents that match a certain threshold, yielding a document collection of near or substantially duplicates of the input document. In another aspect, processing system  may use a cosine distance between a corresponding term vector and each document vector to pick only those documents that match a certain threshold, yielding a document collection in a concept defined by the input document. In yet another example, given a set of document vectors, it is possible to apply a clustering algorithm to cluster the document vectors. The set of document vectors can be the entire corpus or a subset from a search\u2014the clustering algorithm simply clusters the set of document vectors. The choice of clustering algorithm and its parameters will define the quality and type of clusters (i.e., flat vs. hierarchical etc.).","As discussed above, in various embodiments, processing system  can leverage a semantic space for concept searches.  are a flowchart of method  for performing a concept search using a semantic space in one embodiment according to the present invention. Implementations of or processing in method  depicted in  may be performed by software (e.g., instructions or code modules) when executed by a central processing unit (CPU or processor) of a logic machine, such as a computer system or information processing device, by hardware components of an electronic device or application-specific integrated circuits, or by combinations of software and hardware elements. Method  depicted in  begins in step .","In step , one or more query terms are received. For example, a user of processing system  may supply one or more search terms via a search interface as the one or more query terms. In another example, a user may select one or more terms or phrases from one or more documents as the one or more query terms. In yet another example, one or more terms may be automatically extracted from one or more documents as the one or more query terms.","In step , term vectors are retrieved for each query term. In various embodiments, processing system  performs an object-key based lookup into a term vector space retrieving term vectors for all the query terms.","In step , each retrieved term vector is combined into a single query term vector. In one example, if every term's vector is normalized, processing system  may perform vector addition to combine each retrieved term vector. In step , a set of term vectors are determined that satisfy conditions related to the query term vector. In one embodiment, processing system  uses the term vector space to find all the neighbors of the query vector. For example, processing system  may find the closest  terms. In another example, processing system  may find all terms whose term vectors are within a predetermined radius of the query term vector.","In some aspects, processing system  identifies terms that satisfy a set of predetermined conditions related to a query term vector as representing the \u201cconcept\u201d that the query terms define. Each concept is loosely defined in that terms that satisfy the predetermined conditions may not all be noun phrases or terms that have similar meanings.","In step , a query is generated based on terms associated with the determined set of terms. For example, processing system  may use the closest determined terms to the one or more query terms and construct a Lucene OR search. The Lucene OR search may be constructed with boosts or other weighting or ranking influences. In further embodiment, the closest terms identified in step  may be presented as a \u201cpreview\u201d for a user to select from. Processing system  then may alter generation of the query. Method  continues via step \u201cA\u201d in .","In step , a set of documents are determined based on the search results of the query. For example, a Lucene OR search as above may generated results of a large collection of documents. Specifically, a Lucene OR search may pick up every document that has one of the closest terms to the query terms, so it is over-inclusive.","In step , document vectors are received for each document in the determine set of documents.

In one exemplary process, a case was created for a collection of documents in native formats. The case was named with a description to indicate what the case was about and the location of any data sources. In the case, at least one project was created for each topic for the duration of each iteration. Within a project, searchers created tags to label different search methods. After a search was done, the documents found were labeled with the tag of the corresponding search used.","To review the effectiveness of each search method, a process was followed to allow reviewers to review a sample set of results: first, an administrator created a list of users for search result reviewing and assessment, and for each user, a project was also created; next, the administrator created a randomly sampled set from search results to be assessed and added it to each reviewer's project; the administrator also created a global multiple-valued tag to allow each reviewer to tag a document under review as \u201cResponsive\u201d, \u201cNot Responsive\u201d or \u201cNot Sure.\u201d","Messages in the collection were processed to recover discussion threads.

By managing search and search results in this way, good searches and positive results can be carried over from a previous iteration to a latter one while allowing updates.","In the last iteration, similarly, a batch of searches was performed, documents found were tagged and a final set was generated by merging results of different searches. Lastly, for production, system  exports a list of the final set which shows the original document ID associated with each result in the collection by including those messages in the same discussion threads as well.","In some embodiments, system  provides automatic sampling evaluation. An automatic sampling evaluation system enables users to evaluate convergence of one or more search processes. For example, given a set of searches that were validated by human review, system  can implement a retrieval process that samples one or more non-retrieved collections. Each individual document's similarity in the one or more non-retrieved collections is automatically evaluated to other documents in any retrieved sets. In one embodiment, a similarity measurement is based on Noun Phrases extracted from the text of emails and attachments. A scored feature vector is computed for each document, based on its frequency of occurrence in various regions of text of emails. A predetermined number of the top noun phrases (e.g., the top 20) may be selected, as the information gain from lower ranked noun phrases typically is small. This feature vector from the sample document is then verified for similarity (e.g., using a cosine distance metric as discussed above), to identify whether the document from the sample is close to any of the documents of any retrieved sets. The number of documents that are part of any non-retrieved set that is greater than a threshold cutoff in similarity represents missed documents that would reduce the recall rate. Given the overall goal of achieving a high recall, the documents with high similarity can then be analyzed for additional noun phrases that may be used for a next iteration of a search. This constitutes at least a single iteration of search relevance feedback.","To evaluate convergence of subsequent iterations, system  measures the number of documents that were in any missed pool. Convergence can be expected if the information gain in the new feedback loop is less than previous iterations, and if the additional documents identified are below a certain threshold document count.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0187"},"figref":["FIGS. 20A and 20B","FIG. 20","FIG. 20A"],"b":["2000","2000","2000","2005"]},"In step , an initial search query is received. The initial search query may include one or more keywords, phrases, tokens, or the like. In another example, a search query may include representations of documents, such as signatures, features, feature vectors, or the like.","In step , search results are received in response to the initial search query. The search results may include a list of documents that satisfy a search query. Documents may be identified by document identifies or the like. Other information related to each document that satisfies the search query may be provided. In step , the search results are augmented. For example, a set of documents that satisfy a search query may be organized into discussions (e.g., threads), organized by topic, organized by one or more document relationships, or the like. Such organizational information and\/or metadata may be processed only on the search results or may be obtained from pre-processed information further returning additional documents not included in the search results but related through other predetermined relationships.","In step , the augmented search results are received. In step , a document feature vector is determined for each document in the augmented search results. A document feature vector may be determined in real-time or pre-computed as discussed above.","Serially or in parallel, in step , an unretreived collection is received. For example, a list of documents that were not returned as part of the search query and\/or search result augmentation may be identified. In step , automated sampling is performed on the unretreived collection. A variety of techniques may be used to sample the unretreived collection. Some examples are discussed in \u201cCommon Sense Sampling for eDiscovery\u201d by Herbert L. Roitblat, Ph.D. and \u201cEvidence-based Search Evaluation\u201d by the same author, which are incorporated by reference for all purposes.

A document feature vector is then determined for each document in the sampled results as in step .","Referring to , in step , any similarities are determined between the documents in the search results and the documents in the sampled results. For example, each document in the search results and the sampled results is not represented by its feature vector (e.g., V=vwhere each vrepresents a noun phrase in a score-ordered list of noun phrases extracted from that document). Each sampled document feature vector (e.g., S) is then measured for similarity against a featured vector that represents the entire retrieved set. In one embodiment, the retrieved set feature vector similarity was measured using a merged feature vector evaluation. In another embodiment, the retrieved set feature vector similarity was measured using a document-by-document feature vector similarity evaluation.","The merged feature vector comparison first combines the top score-ordered documents from the retrieved set and merges their feature vectors.
