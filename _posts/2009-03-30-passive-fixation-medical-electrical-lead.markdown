{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/047,837, filed on Apr. 25, 2008. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates generally to implantable medical leads, and, more particularly, to passive fixation medical electrical leads.","The human anatomy includes many types of tissues that can either voluntarily or involuntarily, perform certain functions. After disease, injury, or natural defects, certain tissues may no longer operate within general anatomical norms. For example, after disease, injury, time, or combinations thereof, the heart muscle may begin to experience certain failures or deficiencies. Certain failures or deficiencies can be corrected or treated with implantable medical devices (IMDs), such as implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices, or combinations thereof.","IMDs detect and deliver therapy for a variety of medical conditions in patients. IMDs include implantable pulse generators (IPGs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. ICDs typically comprise, inter alia, a control module, a capacitor, and a battery that are housed in a hermetically sealed container with a lead extending therefrom. It is generally known that the hermetically sealed container can be implanted in a selected portion of the anatomical structure, such as in a chest or abdominal wall, and the lead can be inserted through various venous portions so that the tip portion can be positioned at the selected position near or in the muscle group. When therapy is required by a patient, the control module signals the battery to charge the capacitor, which in turn discharges electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient via electrodes disposed on the lead, e.g., typically near the distal end of the lead. Typically, a medical electrical lead includes a flexible elongated body with one or more insulated elongated conductors. Each conductor electrically couples a sensing and\/or a stimulation electrode of the lead to the control module through a connector module.","In order to deliver stimulation or to perform sensing functions, it is desirable for the distal end of the lead to substantially remain in its position, as originally implanted by a physician. To stay in position, the distal end of the lead can be configured to be actively or passively fixed to tissue of interest. Active fixation refers to a lead electrode placed inside of tissue whereas passive fixation occurs when the electrode is placed on or near the surface of tissue. Actively fixing a lead to tissue can entail twisting a helical coil, disposed at the distal end of the lead, into the tissue of a patient. Suturing the lead to tissue is another active fixation means. While actively fixing the distal end of the lead to tissue substantially ensures that the lead remains in place, the tissue can experience some inflammation. Additionally, in some cases, such as children, active fixation of a lead may be difficult due to the size of the heart. Passive fixation of a lead, developed as an alternative to actively fixing a lead to tissue, involves use of an adhesive on the lead's distal end that can be stuck to the tissue, thereby reducing or eliminating inflammation of the tissue. Cyanocrylate adhesive, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,886, has been used to passively connect a lead to tissue. Alternatively, hydrogel, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,768,523, has also been used to passively adhere a lead to tissue. Adhesives are placed directly onto a pad located at the distal end of the lead. The pad is then placed onto the epicardium. These adhesives, placed directly onto the pad, may not be tightly coupled or bonded to the pad. It is desirable to develop implantable medical electrical leads with new adherable fixation mechanisms.","The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. The devices described herein include an exemplary number of leads, etc. One will understand that the components, including number and kind, may be varied without altering the scope of the disclosure. Also, devices according to various embodiments may be used in any appropriate diagnostic or treatment procedure, including a cardiac procedure. Leads disclosed herein are typically chronically implanted in a patient.","One or more embodiments relate to an implantable passive fixation lead. The lead comprises an elongate lead body and a support member disposed at the distal end of the lead body. The support member is configured to be passively fixated to tissue of a patient through the use of a bioreactive adhesion layer. A bioreactive adhesion layer, formed over the support member, comprises a linking material and adhesive material. The linking material is placed over, and, covalently bonds to the surface of the support member. A bioadhesive material is then placed over the linking material. The bioadhesive material covalently bonds onto the linking material. A removable cover is then placed over the bioadhesive material. The bioreactive adhesion layer ensures that an adhesive is secured in place.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","105","106","100","106","106","106","100","100","108","107","106","106","108","100","114","107"]},"Lead  is an endocardial lead; however, as previously stated, the disclosure also applies to epicardial leads, as depicted and described relative to , , A-. Exemplary endocardial leads that can employ passive fixation mechanisms, as described herein, include CapSure\u00ae sold by Medtronic, Inc. of Minnesota. Endocardial leads are attached to the endocardium, the innermost layer of tissue that lines the chambers of the heart. The endocardium underlies the much more voluminous myocardium.","Lead  includes an elongated lead body  and a polymeric support member  for passively fixating the distal end  of the lead  to tissue of a patient. Each of these elements are described below. The elongated lead body  extends from a proximal end  to a distal end . Lead body  can include one or more connectors , and one or more jacketed elongated conductive elements -. A jacket (also referred to as a layer, longitudinal element, coating) extends along and longitudinally around the conductive elements -and serves to insulate one or more conductive elements -. Connector module  can include connectors , such as set screws, that electrically and mechanically connect conductive elements -to ports (not shown) of connector module . Conductive element (also referred to as a \u201cconductor coil,\u201d torque coil\u201d, \u201cdistal tip conductor\u201d) can extend to the distal end  and can optionally be coupled to a retractable and\/or extendable tip. One or more conductive elements serve as, or are connected to, defibrillation coils that deliver electrical stimuli, when necessary, to tissue of a patient. Lead  can also include a conductive element that extends from the proximal end  to ring electrode  while another conductive element extends from proximal end  to tip electrode .","Electrically conductive elements -can include coils, wires, coil wound around a filament, cables, conductors or other suitable members. Conductive elements -can comprise platinum, platinum alloys, titanium, titanium alloys, tantalum, tantalum alloys, cobalt alloys (e.g. MP35N, a nickel-cobalt alloy etc.), copper alloys, silver alloys, gold, silver, stainless steel, magnesium-nickel alloys, palladium, palladium alloys or other suitable materials. Electrically conductive element -is covered, or substantially covered, longitudinally with a jacket (also referred to as a layer, a longitudinal element, a longitudinal member, a coating, a tubular element, a tube or a cylindrical element). Typically, the outer surface of electrodes  such as the ring electrode , the tip electrode , and the defibrillation coils are exposed or not covered by a jacket or layer so that electrodes  can sense and\/or deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. Support member  (also referred to as a pad or disk) is used to passively couple the distal end  of lead  to tissue, as described in greater detail relative to , , and A-.","Medical electrical lead ,  depicted in  respectively, represent an epicardial lead. Lead  comprises, inter alia, a lead body  and a support member  coupled at a distal end  of lead body . Lead body  can comprise one or more elongated conductive elements covered by one or more elongated insulative jackets. Electrically conductive element(s) is the same or similar to at least one of conductive elements -. An electrode , coupled to or part of the conductive element, is proximate the support member . In some embodiments, conductive element can be partially inserted in the support member  with an electrode coupled to conductive element . Support member  includes first and second opposing surfaces respectively, in which first surface , in combination with a bioreactive adhesion layer  shown in , can be attached to tissue of the patient.","Bioreactive adhesion layer  ensures that adhesive material remains in place and does not easily move, fall or easily contact an undesirable surface such as the surface of an electrode or non-targeted tissue. Bioreactive adhesion layer  comprises linking material  and bioreactive material  (also referred to as bioreactive adhesive) formed over or placed onto support member . One or more embodiments for forming bioreactive adhesion layer  is shown relative to .","First surface of support member , shown in , can be substantially treated by increasing its original surface area (also referred to as appeared surface area or geometric surface area) through formation of height variations or peaks  as is shown in . Increased surface area allows first surface area to receive, and, covalently bond to, a linking material , as described below. First surface can be roughened to include peaks . Surface roughening techniques can increase the surface area of polymeric support member  formed from polyurethane, silicone, or a combination thereof. The increased surface area can be referred to as a real surface area, which is the total surface area including peaks. Application of plasma over a surface of a support member  is one way to roughen a surface. For example, plasma, formed of argon\/water (Ar\/HO), can significantly increase the surface area of support member , which can be formed from a polymer such as polyurethane. In this embodiment, hydroxyl (OH) groups, disassociated from water, is added onto the polyurethane chain. The OH groups are then available to react and\/or bond to polyurethane. Ethylene\/nitrous oxide (NO) is yet another type of plasma that can be used to roughen the surface of support member . In this embodiment, oxygen can be added to the polyurethane. Alternatively, the surface of support member  can be washed in an ultrasonic water bath and then undergo a plasma treatment process. In addition to plasma treatment, molding, abrading, laser abrasion and other suitable techniques can be used to increase the surface area of support member . Alternatively, a surgical mesh, such as a Dacron mesh, can be attached to the first surface in order to increase the surface area of the first surface ","After first surface has had its surface area increased, support member  can be used as a substrate for receiving linking material , as shown in . The linking material  is introduced over, or, attached to, a first surface through coating, dipping painting and\/or chemical vapor deposition. Linking material  is formed of at least one or more reactive compound(s) presented below in Table 1. Exemplary reactive compound(s) used to form linking material  can include (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTS) epichlorohydrin (EPC), (star PEG-succinimidyl succinate, dextran (DEX), and\/or polyacrylic acid. All of these compounds are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich located in St. Louis, Mo. Table 1, shown in , provides the chemical structure of the bioreactive compounds that can be used to form the linking material .","In particular, the linking material  can chemically react and covalently bond with the first surface of support member . Referring to , linking material  links or securely bonds support member  to a bioadhesive material that is introduced over or placed directly onto linking material . In particular, bioadhesive material comprises at least one or more bioreactive layer . The edged-balls associated with bioreactive layer  merely schematically show the bioreactive layer  as including reactive components and does not represent an actual image of these components.  shows that the linking material  chemically reacts with a bioadhesive material, as shown by darkened bioreactive layer  for bioadhesion to tissue (not shown). Coating, painting, dipping, chemical vapor deposition are a few of the ways in which bioadhesive, that includes reactive compounds, can be placed onto linking material .","Bioreactive layer  forms a connection with biologic material such as the tissue. The interaction between the bioreactive layer  and tissue can cause a chemical reaction and\/or a biological response such as an inflammatory response and\/or immune response. The bioreactive layer  can makeup the bioadhesive material, which can then react with a tissue site in order to form a bond between the tissue site and the support member . The bioreactive layer  can contain a sulfide reactive group (e.g. mercapto-reactive group (\u2014SH), disulfide (\u2014S\u2014S\u2014) etc.), amino-reactive group such as aldehyde (\u2014CHO), catechol, cyanide (\u2014CN), succimide (\u2014NHS) cyanoacrylates (e.g. n-butyl cyanoacrylate or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate) and\/or N-hydroxysuccinimide.

Referring to , lead  is depicted as including a cover  and a delivery mechanism . Bioadhesives can provide strong adhesion to biological matter, often instantly upon contact due to proteins on the tissue site that can react with the bioreactive material . The cover  can be placed over the bioreactive material  to help prevent the bioreactive material  from inadvertently bonding to an undesired site (e.g. undesired tissue site, electrode etc.) and\/or being deactivated by a body fluid. The illustrated cover  preferably comprises an inert material substantially impermeable to body fluids to discourage inadvertent bonding and\/or deactivation of the bioreactive layer  such that it can no longer be adhered to the desired tissue site. Further, the inert composition helps prevent the cover  itself from bonding with tissue during lead delivery. In some embodiments, for example, the cover  can comprise a wax paper or a foil.","The cover  is preferably sealed around and\/or on top of the bioreactive layer . With respect to , the cover  has an annular shape for covering the similarly-shaped bioreactive layer . Referring briefly to , the cover  can take a disk shape, for example, in order to cover the disk-shaped bioreactive layer  of . As is shown, in one or more embodiments, the cover  does not cover the electrode , in order to facilitate navigation of the electrode to an optimal tissue site.","The bioreactive layer  can be substantially sealed between the cover  and the first surface by an effective, releasable seal, thus allowing the removal of the cover  in order to attach the support member  to the tissue site. For example, the cover  can be thermally sealed about the bioreactive layer , such as, for example, in the case of a cover  comprising a wax paper. In other embodiments, the cover  can be mechanically sealed against the bioadhesive material. In one or more embodiments, pressure can be used to mechanically seal cover  to the bioadhesive material.","Referring again to , with the bioreactive layer  sealed off from the external environment by the cover , a physician can move the lead  within a body without the bioreactive layer  bonding to a tissue site. For example, in the case of an epicardial lead, the physician can move the lead electrode to different positions on the epicardium to locate the preferred tissue site depending on the optimal electrical (mapping) and anatomical properties The physician can then remove the cover  and fix or press the support member with the electrode  against the epicardium. In preferred embodiments, the physician can then remove the cover  proximate the tissue site (e.g., using forceps), thus avoiding the need to remove the lead  from the body in order to expose the bioreactive layer .","In some cases physicians have located the preferred tissue site using a lead without an attached bioadesive material, removed the lead from the tissue site to apply the off-the-shelf bioadesive material to the lead and\/or the tissue site, and then attached the lead to the tissue site. Such a procedure can be managed more easily in a general thoracic surgery in which the heart is exposed than in a limited access procedure such as a thoracoscopy. Leads ,  can facilitate a less invasive implantation compared to conventional passive fixation devices. For example, the support member  is small enough in some embodiments to be implanted percutaneously through a small incision or trocar. The cover  allows the physician to insert the lead through the small incision and guide it to a tissue site without the bioreactive layer  bonding to, for example, a trocar wall or tissue along the route to the tissue site. The physician can then remove the cover  proximate the tissue site for attachment.","As  depict, the delivery mechanism  can comprise a vacuum  typically, 200-600 pounds per square inch (psi) which can be used to percutaneously position the lead and support member to the preferred tissue site. Other suitable methods of percutaneous delivery can likewise be employed. In some embodiments, the cover  is coupled with a tether  for removing the cover  and exposing the bioreactive layer . For example, after guiding the support member  to the tissue site, the physician can gently pull the tether to remove the cover  and expose the bioreactive layer . The physician can then attach the support member  to the tissue site with the bioadhesive material. Afterward, the cover  and the tether  can be removed by pulling the tether out through the incision.","The tether  provides an unobtrusive and uncomplicated way to remove the cover  without needing to insert and manipulate additional instruments through a limited incision, thus allowing, for example, a smaller incision and\/or trocar or thoracoscopy introducer, and potentially less scarring and post-operative pain for the patient. To facilitate removal, the tether  can be coupled to the cover  in a manner that allows the cover to be removed by simply pulling the tether out through the incision in a direction away from the support member . For example, in one embodiment, the cover  can comprise a cover proximal portion  and a cover distal portion . The cover  is preferably disposed on the bioreactive layer  with the cover proximal portion  proximate the lead body distal end . In other words, the cover proximal portion  is located between the cover distal portion  and the lead body distal end . The tether  can be coupled to the cover distal portion . When the tether is pulled away from the support member  in a direction along the lead body , the cover distal portion  is peeled back across the cover proximal portion  until the entire cover  is removed. The tether  and the cover  can then be pulled gently through the incision and removed from the body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 7 and 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["270","270","272","274","274","276","278","280","276","280","278","278","280","282","284","272","286","288","276","286","288","276","278","280","286"]},"Referring to , the lead  can include a cover  coupled with a tether . In this embodiment, the cover  is formed as a cylindrical sleeve that can surround the bioreactive material  so that it seals the bioreactive material  from its external environment. The cover  comprises an inert material to prevent it from bonding with tissue during lead delivery. Further, the cover  is substantially impermeable to body fluids (including blood) to help prevent the bioreactive material  from deactivating during lead delivery such that it can no longer be adhered to the desired tissue site. In some embodiments, for example, the cover  can comprise a wax paper or a foil. To facilitate removal of the cover, the tether  is attached at a base  of the cover and along a side surface  of the cover. As the tether  is pulled, the force from the tether rips the cover to free it from around the support member .","Lead  can be delivered to a predetermined tissue site, for example, within the right atrium or ventricle. Once adjacent the desired tissue site, the tether  can be gently pulled to break and to remove the cover  and expose the bioreactive material specifically developed for application in the bloodstream\/heart . The support member  can then be fixed to the tissue site and the cover  and the tether  removed from the body. In an alternate embodiment, the lead is delivered with a steerable catheter which covers and protects the bioreactive material in addition to or in place of the cover .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["300","310","320","330"]},"Numerous alternatives exist to the embodiments described herein. For example, although  shows the first surface roughened, it is contemplated that an unroughened first surface can also be modified by linking material . Additionally, the upper surface of the linking material  need not follow the roughened contour of the first surface . The linking material  strengthens the attachment between the bioadhesive material and the first surface by covalently bonding the bioreactive material to the first surface . For example, the linking material  can comprise polyacrylate that is covalently bonded to a first surface formed of, for example, polyurethane.","Furthermore, the bioreactive material  is not limited to the annular shape depicted, but may be disposed on the first surface in a number of suitable shapes and configurations in order to securely attach the support member  to a desired tissue site. In addition, one or more electrodes and conductors can be attached to the support member  in a variety of locations. As just one example, the support member  may have concentric ring and\/or tip electrodes with the bioreactive material  attached to the first surface in between and\/or outside the electrodes.","Additionally, as can be seen in , the support member  comprises the first surface and a second surface in which the electrode  is proximate the first surface , but the bioreactive material  is attached to the second surface of the support member . The different locations of the electrode  and the bioreactive material  can allow the lead  to be attached to a tissue site with the second surface , while allowing the electrode  to interact with another tissue site. For example, the lead  can be placed between the pericardium and epicardium of a heart, with the bioreactive material adhered to the pericardium and the electrode  and the first surface placed against the epicardium.","Moreover, while one or more embodiments have been described such that the bioreactive adhesion layer  is formed over the first surface of support member , it should be appreciated that the bioreactive adhesion layer  can also be formed solely over second surface . Additionally, in one or more embodiments, bioreactive adhesion layer  can be formed over first and second surfaces -","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain disclosed embodiments, the disclosed embodiments are presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation and other embodiments of the invention are possible.
