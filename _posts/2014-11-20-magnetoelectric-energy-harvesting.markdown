title: Magnetoelectric energy harvesting
abstract: An energy harvesting device for harvesting energy from a moving structure includes a housing allowing transmission of magnetic fields therethrough. A piezoelectric material capable of a phase transition and a magnetostrictive material capable of a structural change when subjected to a magnetic field are mechanically coupled to each other in the housing. An adjustable pre-stress means is positioned between the housing and the combination of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Electrical contacts are positioned on the piezoelectric material. A magnet is mounted on the moving structure. The housing is mounted in sufficient proximity to the magnet for the magnetic field of the magnet to induce the structural change in the magnetostrictive material.

This makes them a candidate as the active material in energy harvesting devices. By utilizing the direct piezoelectric (or pyroelectric) effect when mechanical or thermal energy is available from the environment, the mechanical or thermal energy can be converted to electric charge polarization in relaxor ferroelectric single crystal material and useful amounts of energy can be obtained.","Relaxor single crystals display both a linear piezoelectric effect and a non-linear electromechanically coupled phase transition. The linear piezoelectric effect in relaxor single crystals has been well characterized and is extraordinarly large, approximately a factor of six times that of the ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The non-linear electromechanically coupled phase transition associated with field and stress driven phase transformations has been the subject of extensive study, especially for lead indium niobate-lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PIN-PMN-PT) ternaries. Reversible stress and temperature induced phase transformations are associated with spontaneous charge generation in the relaxor single crystals.  is a graph showing strain versus stress for a representative phase change piezoelectric material.  clearly shows a large strain jump at the stress and field induced phase transformation. These stress and field driven phase transformations offer significant new approaches to energy harvesting. These results demonstrate that phase transformations can provide more than an order of magnitude increase in energy density per cycle for mechanical energy harvesting. Utilizing this phase transformation behavior suggests that a stress-biased energy harvester would take maximum advantage of the phase transformation in the relaxor single crystal material.","Magnetostrictive materials are similar to ferroelectric materials because they convert magnetic energy into mechanical energy. However, magnetostrictive materials utilize a magnetic field rather than an electrical field. An applied magnetic field can alter the direction of the magnetic moments inside the material, and the magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the direction of the applied magnetic field. This directional change of the magnetic moments is coupled to the material's lattice via spin-orbit coupling and results in a physical change in the dimension of the material. It is known to utilize this physical change in mechanical applications and control systems.","It is known to use piezoelectric materials to harvest energy. Piezoelectric materials will generate electric potential when subjected to some kind of mechanical stress. However, piezoelectric materials have constraints on their ability to function properly, such as temperature, force, and pressure. These constraints, along with the difficulty of attaching piezoelectric materials to rotating or moving machinery, make it difficult to locate piezoelectric material devices in contact with the mechanical stress generator which allows the piezoelectric material to act as an energy harvesting device.","It is also known to use magnetostrictive materials to harvest energy. Magnetostrictive materials are able to harvest vibrational energy from vibrating pumps, motors, buildings, ships, etc. since magnetostrictive materials are able to change shape in response to a magnetic field, and it is known to use these changes in magnetic state to induce a voltage in coils, which can then be converted into power.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an energy harvesting device for a changing magnetic field.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an energy harvesting device having maximum efficiency.","Accordingly, there is provided an energy harvesting device for harvesting energy from a moving structure. The device has a rigid, hollow housing capable of allowing the transmission of a magnetic field therethrough. A piezoelectric material is positioned in the hollow housing. A magnetostrictive material capable of a structural change when being subjected to a magnetic field is also positioned in the housing mechanically coupled to the piezoelectric material. An adjustable pre-stress means is positioned between the housing and the piezoelectric material and magnetostrictive material combination to apply a pre-stress to the piezoelectric material and the magnetostrictive material. Electrical contacts are joined in contact with the piezoelectric material. A magnet mounted on the moving structure induces the structural change in the magnetostrictive material when the magnet is nearest the housing. The structural change stresses the piezoelectric material which generates electrical potential at the contacts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","12","13","13","14","14","15","15","16","16","16","16","15","15","14","13","14","12","12"]},"For a given material, the position of this curve and its inflection points depend on pressure, temperature and the electrical field to which the material is subjected.
