Field","Apparatuses and methods consistent with exemplary embodiments relate to a method and apparatus for reproducing media data, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for reproducing media data while restricting a control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data.","2. Description of the Related Art","Due to an increase in media data exchanged via wireless or wired communication networks, various methods have been developed to commercially implement use of media data. For example, a user may be provided free media data, and in return, the user has to view an advertisement related to the free media data. In this manner, media data consumption by the user is commercially implemented.","In this case, if the user does not view the advertisement by using a skip function or a fast forward function, the media data consumption cannot be commercially implemented. Also, if a user records the free media data and indiscriminately shares the recorded media data with other users, the media data consumption may not be commercially implemented.","Thus, a media data provider requires control operations including recording, skipping, and fast-forwarding of media data to be restricted so as to prevent execution of the control operations while a user reproduces the media data.","Aspects of exemplary embodiments provide a method and apparatus for reproducing media data while restricting a control operation by a user. Aspects of exemplary embodiments also provide a computer readable recording medium having recorded thereon a program for executing the method.","According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method of reproducing media data received from a media server, performed by a client device, the method including: driving a browser including an application programming interface (API) for restricting a control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data; restricting the control operation with respect to the reproduction of the media data by using the API; and reproducing the media data based on the restricted control operation.","The restricting the control operation may include: receiving information about the restricting of the control operation; and retrieving the API for restricting the control operation with respect to the reproduction of the media data, according to the received information.","The receiving the information may include receiving information as metadata before a session for the reproduction of the media data is started, or receiving a notification according to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)-2014 standard during a session for the reproduction of the media data, wherein the notification is related to the restricting of the control operation.","The receiving the information may include receiving the information about the restricting of the control operation according to Asynchronous JavaScript and Extensible Markup Language (AJAX) during a session for the reproduction of the media data.","The receiving the information may include receiving the information about the restricting of the control operation from a server that is different from the media server.","The reproducing the media data may include: when an input indicating a control operation is received from a user, determining whether the control operation is a restricted control operation; when the control operation is determined as the restricted control operation, ignoring the control operation and continuing the reproducing the media data.","According to an aspect of another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a media data reproducing apparatus that is a client device for reproducing media data received from a media server, the media data reproducing apparatus including: a browser driving unit which drives a browser including an application programming interface (API) for restricting a control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data; and an application driving unit which restricts the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data by using the API, and which drives an application that reproduces the media data based on the control operation.","According to an aspect of another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a computer readable recording medium having recorded thereon a program for executing the method of reproducing the media data.","According to an aspect of another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method of providing media data, the method including: transmitting, from a first server to a client device, media data; and transmitting, from a second server to the client device, information about restricting a control operation with respect to a reproduction of the media data by the client device, wherein the information is used by the client device to retrieve an application programming interface (API) for restricting the control operation with respect to the reproduction of the media data.","According to an aspect of another exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method of reproducing media data received from a media server, performed by a client device, the method including: restricting a control operation with respect to a reproduction, by the client device, of media data by using an application programming interface (API); and reproducing the media data based on the restricted control operation.","Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. The exemplary embodiments may be embodied in various forms without being limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Descriptions of well-known parts are omitted for clarity, and like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. Expressions such as \u201cat least one of,\u201d when preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify the individual elements of the list.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","110","120","110"]},"The client  drives the browser, and drives an application for reproduction of the received media data based on the driven browser. The browser provides an environment for driving the application for reproduction of the received media data, and includes at least one application programming interface (API) related to reproduction of the received media data. The at least one API related to reproduction of the received media data may include an API for restricting a control operation with respect to reproduction of the received media data. The application may be a webpage related to reproduction of the received media data. In this case, the webpage may include a link or a script that is related to reproduction of the received media data.","In operation , the client  requests the media server  for the application (e.g., the webpage) for reproduction of the media data, and receives the application in response to the request. For example, the client  may receive the webpage including the link or the script related to reproduction of the media data.","In operation , the client  requests the media server  for the media data by driving the application received in operation , and receives the media data in response to the request. The client  receives the media data in a streaming manner or a downloading manner.","In operation , the client  receives, from the media server , information about restriction on a control operation that may be performed by a user.","In the present exemplary embodiment, a session for reproduction of the media data is started according to the request for the media data by the client  in operation . After the session for reproduction of the media data is started, the information about restriction on the control operation may be separately received from the media server  in operation . However, it is understood that other exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, according to another exemplary embodiment, the client  may receive the information when the session is started in operation  (e.g., as metadata).","As non-limiting examples, the information about restriction on the control operation may be received in the form of a notification according to the CEA-2014 standard after the session for reproduction of the media data is started, or may be received according to Asynchronous JavaScript and Extensible Markup Language (AJAX). In the latter case, the client  may drive an application supporting the AJAX and may receive only necessary information, that is, the information about restriction on the control operation, from the media server  without reloading entire pages. Thus, after the session for reproduction of the media data is started, the client  may request the media server  for the information about restriction on the control operation, and may receive the requested information about restriction on the control operation, according to the AJAX.","The information about restriction on the control operation may be information related to restriction on pausing or stopping the media data, or may be information related to restriction on recording the media data. For example, in cases where a user is to view an advertisement before the media data is to be reproduced, the information about restriction on the control operation may be related to restriction on pausing or stopping the advertisement. Also, in order to protect a copyright of the media data when the media data is being reproduced, the information about restriction on the control operation may be related to restriction on recording the media data.","In operation , the client  restricts the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data, according to the information received in operation . The client  retrieves the API for restricting the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data, according to the information received in operation . The retrieved API specifies at least one of control operations allowed during reproduction of the media data and specifies control operations prevented during reproduction of the media data. This operation will be described in detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A"]},"\u201cSetMode\u201d is a control operation restricting method that involves setting possible control operations by receiving variables corresponding to modes illustrated in  from a webpage that is an application driven in the client . For example, when \u201c0x01\u201d is input to the API as a variable, it is only possible to start and stop the media data, and when \u201c0x02\u201d is input to the API as a variable, it is only possible to pause and resume the media data. In order to make a start, stop, pause, and resumption possible, \u201c0x03\u201d is input as a variable, wherein \u201c0x03\u201d is a combination of \u201c0x01\u201d and \u201c0x02\u201d and is \u201c00000011\u201d in binary. \u201c0x08\u201d is a variable for restricting recording of the media data, and when \u201c0x11\u201d (i.e., \u201c00001011\u201d in binary) is input as a variable, it is possible to start, stop, pause, resume, and record the media data.","In order to restrict another control operation, the aforementioned four bits may be used, and in order to restrict the control operation by using a \u201cdefault mode\u201d (i.e., a basic setting in a browser), \u201c0xff\u201d (i.e., a binary number of \u201c11111111\u201d) is input.","The object properties are provided to indicate a current state restricted by the \u201cSetMode\u201d method. For example, \u201cPlaymode\u201d is an object property that indicates a current restriction state of the control operation, and \u201crecordMode\u201d is an object property that indicates whether recording of the media data is currently restricted.","Also, in relation to operations  and  (to be described later), in order to inform a user about an occurrence of an error when the user inputs a control operation that is not allowed, \u201cerror\u201d may be provided as an object property.","Referring to , similar to the API of , the API of  includes an object method and object properties for restricting the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data. Comparing the API of  with the API of , the API of  is different in that variables input to the \u201cSetMode\u201d method do not correspond to modes for specific control operations, but correspond to reproduction modes that are combinations of a plurality of control operations.","In other words, when \u201c0x00\u201d is input to the \u201cSetMode\u201d method as a variable, the client  may be set as \u201cAdvancedPlayer Mode\u201d in which all control operations are possible. when \u201c0x01\u201d is input to the \u201cSetMode\u201d method as a variable, the client  may be set as \u201cPrimitivePlayer Mode\u201d in which it is only possible to start and stop reproduction of the media data. In \u201cPrimitivePlayer Mode,\u201d adjusting a media data reproduction speed, searching for the media data, and seeking to previous\/next media data is restricted. When \u201c0x02\u201d is input to the \u201cSetMode\u201d method as a variable, the client  may be set as \u201cBasicPlayer Mode\u201d in which only adjusting a media data reproduction speed is restricted.","Referring back to , in operation , the client  reproduces the media data according to the control operation restricted in operation . That is, the media data is reproduced according to the restricted control operation.","A user may input a control operation during reproduction of the media data. In this case, in operation , the client  determines whether the control operation input by the user is restricted in operation .","In operation , if the control operation input by the user in operation  is not allowed by the restricted control operation, the client  ignores the user input and continues reproducing the media data. However, if the control operation input by the user in operation  is allowed by the restricted control operation, the client  performs the control operation according to the user input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","334","110","120","310","320","350","350","330","332","336","338","340","342","130","132","136","138","140","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["110","110","410","420","410","412","414"]},"The media data reproducing unit  requests a media server  or  for media data, receives the media data, and reproduces the received media data.","The browser driving unit  drives a browser that provides an environment for driving an application for reproduction of the media data. The browser provides at least one API related to reproduction of the media data. The browser may be a browser compatible with the CEA-2014. As described above, the API related to reproduction of the media data includes an API for restricting a control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data. The application may be a webpage related to reproduction of the media data.","The application driving unit  drives the application related to reproduction of the media data based on the browser driven by the browser driving unit . The application driving unit  requests the media server  or  for the application related to reproduction of the media data (e.g., the webpage), receives the application, and drives the application.","Also, the application driven by the application driving unit  retrieves the API included in the browser, wherein the API is for restricting the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data. The application driving unit  retrieves the API, based on information about restriction on the control operation received by the information receiving unit , and restricts the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data. For example, based on the information, it is possible to restrict pausing or stopping of reproduction of the media data, or to restrict recording of the media data. A detailed description related to restriction on the control operation is provided above with reference to .","When restriction is set with respect to the control operation, the media data is reproduced based on the restricted control operation. According to the CEA-2014 standard, all control operations related to reproduction of the media data are defined by APIs of the browser. Thus, according to the present exemplary embodiment, an API for restriction of a control operation may be added to the browser in the form of an embedded object or a plug-in object, and the control operation may be restricted based on the added API.","In this manner, since the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data may be restricted external to the client  by using the added API, a user may not discretionally skip or fast forward commercial content such as an advertisement, so that consumption of the media data may be commercially implemented.","The information receiving unit  receives the information about restriction on the control operation with respect to reproduction of the media data from the media server  or the third server . As described above, the information about restriction on the control operation may be received in the form of a notification from the media server  or the third server  after a session for reproduction of the media data is started, or may be received from the media server  or the third server  according to AJAX. Also, as described above, the information about restriction on the control operation may be transmitted in the form of metadata to the client  before a session for reproduction of the media data is started.","The information receiving unit  may be pushed to receive the information about restriction on the control operation from the media server  or the third server .
