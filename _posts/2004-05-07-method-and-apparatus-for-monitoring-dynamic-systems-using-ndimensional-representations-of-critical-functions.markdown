{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/457,068 filed Dec. 7, 1999.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the visualization, perception, representation and computation of data relating to the attributes or conditions constituting the health state of a dynamic system. More specifically, this invention relates to the display and computation of data, in which variables constituting attributes and conditions of a dynamic system can be interrelated and visually correlated in time as three-dimensional objects.","2. Description of the Related Art","A variety of methods and systems for the visualization of data have been proposed. Traditionally, these methods and systems fail to present in a real-time multi-dimensional format that is directed to facilitating a user's analysis of multiple variables and the relationships between such multiple variables. Prior methods typically do not process and display data in real-time, rather they use databases or spatial organizations of historical data. Generally, they also simply plot existing information in two or three dimensions, but without using three-dimensional geometric objects to show the interrelations between data. Often previous systems and methods are limited to pie charts, lines or bars to represent the data. Also, many previous systems are limited to particular applications or types of data. The flexibility and adaptability of the user interface and control is typically very limited, and may not provide flexible coordinate systems and historical-trend monitors. Other systems, which have a flexible user interface, generally require substantial user expertise in order to collect and evaluate the data, including the pre-identification of data ranges and resolution. Another common limitation of previous systems and methods is that they provide only a single or predetermined viewpoint from which to observe the data. Typically, prior systems and methods do not provide data normalcy frameworks to aid in the interpretation of the data. Furthermore, most prior methods use \u201cicons,\u201d shapes, lines, bars, or graphs. For general background material, the reader is directed to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,752,893, 4,772,882, 4,813,013, 4,814,755, 4,823,283, 4,915,757, 5,021,976, 5,121,469, 5,262,944, 5,317,321, 5,491,779, 5,588,104, 5,592,195, 5,596,694, 5,751,931, 5,768,552, 5,774,878, 5,796,398, 5,812,134, 5,830,150, 5,923,330, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for the material disclosed therein.","As this disclosure employs a number of terms, which may be new to the reader, the reader is directed to the applicants' definitions section, which is provided at the beginning of the detailed description section.","It is desirable to provide a method, system, and apparatus, which facilitates the rapid and accurate analysis of complex and quickly changing data. Moreover, it is desirable that such a system and method not be arbitrarily limited to a particular field or application. It is important that such a system and method be capable of analyzing time based, real-time, and historical data and that it be able to graphically show the relationships between various data.","Recent research studies have indicated that the human mind is better able to analyze and use complex data when it is presented in a graphic, real-world type representation, rather than when it is presented in textual or numeric formats. Research in thinking, imagination and learning has shown that visualization plays an intuitive and essential role in assisting a user associate, correlate, manipulate and use information. The more complex the relationship between information, the more critically important is the communication, including audio and visualization of the data. Modern human factors theory suggests that effective data representation requires the presentation of information in a manner that is consistent with the perceptual, cognitive, and response-based mental representations of the user. For example, the application of perceptual grouping (using color, similarity, connectedness, motion, sound etc.) can facilitate the presentation of information that should be grouped together. Conversely, a failure to use perceptual principles in the appropriate ways can lead to erroneous analysis of information.","The manner in which information is presented also affects the speed and accuracy of higher-level cognitive operations. For example, research on the \u201csymbolic distance effect\u201d suggests that there is a relationship between the nature of the cognitive decisions (for example, is the data increasing or decreasing in magnitude?) and the way the information is presented (for example, do the critical indices become larger or smaller, or does the sound volume or pitch rise or fall?). Additionally, \u201cpopulation stereotypes\u201d suggest that there are ways to present information that are compatible with well learned interactions with other systems (for example, an upwards movement indicates an increasing value, while a downwards movement indicates a decreasing value).","Where there is compatibility between the information presented to the user and the cognitive representations presented to the user, performance is often more rapid, accurate, and consistent. Therefore, it is desirable that information be presented to the user in a manner that improves the user's ability to process the information and minimizes any mental transformations that must be applied to the data.","Therefore, it is the general object of this invention to provide a method and systems for presenting a three-dimensional visual and\/or possibly an audio display technique that assists in the monitoring, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of the \u201chealth\u201d of a dynamic system, whether a natural or artificial system.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system that assists in the evaluation of natural systems, including living organisms, ecological systems, and environmental systems.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system that assists in the evaluation of artificial or man-made systems, including economic systems, devices, engines, power plants and the like.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system that assists in the determination of the \u201chealth\u201d of a dynamic system, by providing visual information related to the nature or quality of the soundness, wholeness, or well-being of the system as related to historical or normative values.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that assists in the determination of the functioning of a system by measuring the interaction among a set of \u201cvital-signs\u201d normally associated with the health of the system.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system, which provides the gathering and use of sensor measured data, as well as the formatting and normalization of the data in a format suitable to the processing methodology.","A further object of this invention is to provide a method and system, which organizes a system's data into relevant data sets or critical functions as appropriate.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system, which provides a three-dimensional health-space for mapping the system's data.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system, which provides three-dimensional objects that are symbols of the critical functioning of the system being monitored.","It is an object of this invention to provide a method and system that shows the relationships between several critical functions that a user wishes to monitor.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system that permits an integrated and overall holistic understanding of the process being monitored.","A further object of this invention is to provide a method and system where three-dimensional objects are built from three-dimensional object primitives, including: cubes, spheres, pyramids, n-polygon prisms, cylinders, slabs.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system, wherein three-dimensional objects are placed within health-space based on the coordinates of their geometric centers, edges, vertices, or other definite geometric variables.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system which has three-dimensional objects that have three spatial dimensions, as well as geometric, aesthetic and aural attributes, to permit the mapping of multiple data functions.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system which shows increases and decreases in data values using changes in location, size, form, texture, opacity, color, sound and the relationships thereof in their context.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system, wherein the particular three-dimensional configuration of three-dimensional objects can be associated with a particular time and health state.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system that permits the simultaneous display of the history of data objects.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that provides for the selection of various user selectable viewports.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system that provides both a global and a local three-dimensional coordinate space.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system that permits the use of time as one of the coordinates.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system that provides a reference framework of normative values for direct comparison with the measured data.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system where normative values are based on the average historical behavior of a wide population of healthy systems similar to the system whose health is being monitored.","A further object of this invention is to provide a method and system that provides viewpoints that can be selected to be perspective views, immersive Virtual Reality views, or any orthographic views.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that permits the display of a layout of multiple time-space viewpoints.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system that provides for zooming in and out of a time and\/or space coordinate.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system that permits temporal and three dimensional modeling of data \u201chealth\u201d states based on either pre-recorded data or real-time data, that is as the data is obtained.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that presents the data in familiar shapes, colors, and locations to enhance the usability of the data.","A still further object of the invention is to provide a method and system that uses animation, and sound to enhance the usefulness of the data to the user.","It is an object of this invention to provide a method and system for the measurement, computation, display and user interaction, of complex data sets that can be communicated and processed at various locations physically remote from each other, over a communication network, as necessary for the efficient utilization of the data and which can be dynamically changed or relocated as necessary.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system for the display of data that provides both a standard and a customized interface mode, thereby providing user and application flexibility.","These and other objects of this invention are achieved by the method and system herein described and are readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon careful review of the following drawings, detailed description and claims.","This invention is a method, system and apparatus for the visual display of complex sets of dynamic data. In particular, this invention provides the means for efficiently analyzing, comparing and contrasting data, originating from either natural or artificial systems. This invention provides n-dimensional visual representations of data through innovative use of orthogonal views, form, space, frameworks, color, shading, texture, transparency, sound and visual positioning of the data. The preferred system of this invention includes one or a plurality of networked computer processing and display systems, which provide real-time as well as historical data, and which processes and formats the data into an audio-visual format with a visual combination of objects and models with which the user can interact to enhance the usefulness of the processed data. While this invention is applicable to a wide variety of data analysis applications, one important application is the analysis of health data. For this reason, the example of a medical application for this invention is used throughout this description. The use of this example is not intended to limit the scope of this invention to medical data analysis applications only, rather it is provided to give a context to the wide range of potential application for this invention.","This invention requires its own lexicon. For the purposes of this patent description and claims, the inventors intend that the following terms be understood to have the following definitions.","An \u201cartificial system\u201d is an entity, process, combination of human designed parts, and\/or environment that is created, designed or constructed by human intention. Examples of artificial systems include manmade real or virtual processes, computer systems, electrical power systems, utility and construction systems, chemical processes and designed combinations, economic processes (including, financial transactions), agricultural processes, machines, and human designed organic entities.","A \u201cnatural system\u201d is a functioning entity whose origin, processes and structures were not manmade or artificially created. Examples of natural systems are living organisms, ecological systems and various Earth environments.","The \u201chealth\u201d of a system is the state of being of the system as defined by its freedom from disease, ailment, failure or inefficiency. A diseased or ill state is a detrimental departure from normal functional conditions, as defined by the nature or specifications of the particular system (using historical and normative statistical values). The health of a functioning system refers to the soundness, wholeness, efficiency or well being of the entity. Moreover, the health of a system is determined by its functioning.","\u201cFunctions\u201d are behaviors or operations that an entity performs. Functional fitness is measures by the interaction among a set of \u201cvital-signs\u201d normally taken or measured using methods well known in the art, from a system to establish the system's health state, typically at regular or defined time intervals.","\u201cHealth-space\u201d or \u201cH-space\u201d is the data representation environment that is used to map the data in three or more dimensions.","\u201cH-state\u201d is a particular 3-D configuration or composition that the various 3-D objects take in H-space at a particular time. In other words, H-state is a 3-D snapshot of the system's health at one point of time.","\u201cLife-space\u201d or \u201cL-space\u201d provides the present and past health states of a system in a historical and comparative view of the evolution of the system in time. This 3-D representation environment constitutes the historical or Life-space of a dynamic system. L-space allows for both continuous and categorical displays of temporal dependent complex data. In other words, L-space represents the health history or trajectory of the system in time.","\u201cReal-Time Representation\u201d is the display of a representation of the data within a fraction of a second from the time when the event of the measured data occurred in the dynamic system.","\u201cReal-Time User Interface\u201d is the seemingly instantaneous response in the representation due to user interactivity (such as rotation and zooming).","A \u201cvariable\u201d is a time dependent information unit (one unit per time increment) related to sensing a given and constant feature of the dynamic system.","\u201cVital signs\u201d are key indicators that measure the system's critical functions or physiology.","In the preferred embodiments of this invention, data is gathered using methods or processes well known in the art or as appropriate and necessary. For example, in general, physiologic data, such as heart rate, respiration rate and volume, blood pressure, and the like, is collected using the various sensors that measure the functions of the natural system. Sensor-measured data is electronically transferred and translated into a digital data format to permit use by the invention. This invention uses the received measured data to deliver real-time and\/or historical representations of the data and\/or recorded data for later replay. Moreover, this invention permits the monitoring of the health of a dynamic system in a distributed environment. By distributed environment, it is meant that a user or users interacting with the monitoring system may be in separate locations from the location of the dynamic system being monitored. In its most basic elements, the monitoring system of this invention has three major logical components: (1) the sensors that measure the data of the system; (2) the networked computational information systems that computes the representation and that exchanges data with the sensors and the user interface; and (3) the interactive user interface that displays the desired representation and that interactively accepts the users' inputs. The components and devices that perform the three major functions of this invention may be multiple, may be in the same or different physical locations, and\/or may be assigned to a specific process or shared by multiple processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["a ","a ","a ","b","b ","a","b ","a","a ","b ","a,b","a ","a ","b "],"b":["101","101","102","102","102","102","103","103","103","101","101","101","101","101","103","104","104","101","101","104","105","108","105","108","105","106","101","107","107","107","101","108","108","109","101","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["b ","a ","b","b ","a","b ","a","a ","b ","a,b","a,b ","a,b ","a ","b "],"b":["110","111","111","111","111","112","112","112","110","110","110","110","110","112","113","113","110","110","113","114","117","114","117","114","115","110","116","116","110","101","116","116","117","116","113","117","118","110","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"c ","b":["119","120","120","121","120","122","122","123","122","123","124","125","126","123","127","130","127","130","128","131","129","131","132","133","134","135"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["d ","a,b,c ","a,b,c ","a,b,c ","a,b,c, ","a,b,c","a,b,c ","a,b,c.
