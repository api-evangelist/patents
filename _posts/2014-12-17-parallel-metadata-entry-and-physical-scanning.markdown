title: Parallel metadata entry and physical scanning
abstract: A scanning system provides for scanning documents and generating respective electronic copies with associated metadata. A scanner scans one or more documents to produce respective electronic copies. A user interface captures metadata entered by a user regarding the documents. A controller is communicatively coupled to the scanner and the user interface, and enables the user interface to capture the metadata concurrently with the scanner's scanning the documents. The electronic copy and the metadata can be associated with one another or incorporated into a common file. Parallel metadata entry and physical scanning reduces time a user spends to perform the overall process, resulting in increased user satisfaction.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE"],"p":["A multifunction printer (MFP) typically provides a number of services for processing documents, and can incorporate the features of a photocopier, printer, scanner, and\/or a fax machine, as well as an interface to communicate across a network. A MFP may also include an integrated user interface (UI), or may interface with a user across the network. In order to scan a document and produce an electronic copy of the document, a user typically positions the document at the scanner and sets scanning parameters at the UI. If the electronic copy is to include user-defined metadata, the user may also enter the metadata at the UI before or after the scan.","Example embodiments of the present invention provide a system for scanning documents and generating respective electronic copies with associated metadata. The system may provide for scanning the documents in parallel with entering metadata by a user, thereby minimizing the total time of a scanning operation. The system may include a scanner to scan one or more documents to produce respective electronic copies. A user interface captures metadata entered by a user regarding the documents. Further, a controller is communicatively coupled to the scanner and the user interface, and enables the user interface to capture the metadata concurrently with the scanner's scanning the documents. The controller may further associate the electronic copy and the metadata.","In further embodiments, the controller may update the electronic copy to incorporate at least a portion of the metadata, or to modify the electronic copy based on the metadata. Such metadata can include, for example, a filename, a file path, bibliographic information, and a watermark. The controller may also populate at least a portion of the metadata automatically by extracting content from the electronic copy of the documents and modifying the metadata to include the content. The documents may include several individual documents, and the controller enables the user interface to capture metadata for the plurality of documents concurrently with the scanner's scanning the several documents.","In still further embodiments, the controller may detect an interrupt event (e.g., an error) from the scanner or the user interface. The controller may control the user interface to display selectively the interrupt event and a prompt to capture the metadata based on a respective priority. The controller may also define parameters for the scanning of documents based on a selection by a user at the user interface. The controller may further modify the electronic copy based on information entered by the user at the user interface. Such information may indicate an image transformation for the electronic copy, such as a page layout format or dimensions.","In yet further embodiments, the controller may be communicatively coupled to the scanner across a network. Likewise, the user interface may be incorporated into a computing device (e.g., a workstation, smartphone, or tablet device) communicatively coupled to the scanner across a network. The controller may also be incorporated into the computing device, or may be incorporated into a server that is also communicatively coupled to the scanner across the network. The controller may also be communicatively coupled to a plurality of additional scanners.","In still further embodiments, the scanner may also provide for generating at least one physical copy of the at least one document. For example, the scanner may be implemented in a multifunction printer (MFP). Likewise, the scanner may be a MFP and the term \u201cscanner\u201d may be used herein interchangeably with the term \u201cMFP.\u201d","A further embodiment of the invention includes an apparatus used in cooperation with a system for scanning documents. The apparatus may include a controller having an interface configured to communicatively couple to a scanner and a user interface. The controller may be configured to enable the user interface to capture metadata entered by a user concurrently with enabling the scanner to scan at least one document, the controller being further configured to associate the electronic copy and the metadata.","A description of example embodiments of the invention follows.","Previous multifunction printers (MFPs) and other scanning systems provide a serial workflow, whereby the operations of metadata entry and document scanning are completed in succession. This serial workflow must be repeated for any number of documents to be scanned. As a result, the total time to complete a scan of one or more documents is extensive, and requires a user to be present at the scanning device for the duration of the scan.","Example embodiments of the invention provide a system for scanning documents and generating respective electronic copies with associated metadata. The system may provide for scanning the documents in parallel with entering metadata by a user, thereby minimizing the total time of a scanning operation. The system may include a scanner to scan one or more documents to produce respective electronic copies. A user interface captures metadata entered by a user regarding the documents. Further, a controller is communicatively coupled to the scanner and the user interface, and enables the user interface to capture the metadata concurrently with the scanner's scanning the documents. The controller may further associate the electronic copy and the metadata.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 3A-C"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","110","120","130","110","120","130"]},"The scanner  provides for capturing images of documents  to generate a respective electronic copy  of the document . The scanner  may be implemented, for example, in a flatbed scanner, a subsystem of a MFP, or another image-capturing device. The scanner  may be communicatively coupled to the controller , as well as to a data store  (e.g., a network server, a database, or an integrated storage device) for storing the electronic copy .","The user interface  enables a user  to initiate and control a scan of the documents , as well as to enter metadata  to be associated or incorporated into the electronic copy  of the documents . The user interface  may be a component of a MFP or implemented in a computing device such as a tablet, smartphone or workstation. The user interface  may include a touchscreen display for accepting user input and providing information to the user  regarding the scanning process and workflow. In particular, the user interface  may prompt the user  to initiate a scan, enter parameters for the scan (e.g., image properties, page formatting, output file type), enter metadata  regarding the scanned documents , and enter additional information for processing the documents  or the electronic copy . The metadata  may include, for example, a filename, a file path, bibliographic information, a watermark, and metadata fields associated with a particular file type of the electronic copy .","The controller  is communicatively coupled to both the user interface  and the scanner , and generally manages a scanning operation. In particular, the controller  may communicate with the user interface  to enable a user  to initiate a scanning operation and enter information regarding the scan, including scanning parameters and the metadata . Based on the scanning parameters, the controller  communicates with the scanner  to enable scanning the documents  to generate a respective electronic copy , which may be stored to the data store . In order to minimize the total time required for the scanning operation, the controller  may enable the user interface  to capture the metadata  concurrently with the scanner's  scanning the documents . Thus, both the scanning by the scanner  and metadata entry at the user interface  may occur in parallel and independently of one another. Further, when the documents  include multiple separate documents to be scanned in succession, the controller  may enable the user  to enter metadata  for each of the multiple separate documents while simultaneously controlling the scanner  to scan each of the multiple documents  in succession.","Once the scanning parameters are established, the controller  may control the scanner  to scan the entirety of the documents  without further prompting of the user . However, if the controller  detects an interrupt event (e.g., an error such as a paper jam indicated by the scanner ), the controller  may prompt the user , via the user interface , to address the interrupt event. The controller may selectively display such prompts, and optionally interrupt a metadata entry process, based on a given priority of the interrupt event.","The controller  may then further process the electronic copy , for example by associating it with the metadata  or updating the electronic copy  to incorporate at least a portion of the metadata . The controller  may also extract content from the electronic copy  (e.g., via optical character recognition (OCR) processing) to derive additional metadata, which can be used to populate metadata fields of the electronic document . As a result, the controller  provides a processed electronic copy  having associated and\/or incorporated metadata. The controller  may then forward the processed electronic copy  in accordance with destination parameters as defined by the user  at the user interface . For example, the controller  may store the processed electronic copy  to the data store  or another storage device (e.g., a networked database, a data server, a cloud-based storage service). The controller  may also forward the copy  to one or more email addresses as selected by the user , fax the document to a destination fax number indicated by the user , and\/or may enter the copy  into a document management system (e.g., SharePoint\u2122, iManage Worksite\u2122) based on the metadata  and\/or destination parameters entered by the user . An example scanning operation is described in further detail below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","175","155","130","205","110","175","210","120","130","155","220","175","115","230","120","245","120","175","110","246","110"]},"When the scanner  completes the scan () to produce the respective electronic copy  of the documents , and when the metadata entry at the user interface  is complete (), the controller  may further process the electronic copy  to associate and\/or incorporate at least a portion of the metadata  into the copy .
