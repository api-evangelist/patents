title: Machine processor
abstract: Disclosed are machine processors and methods performed thereby. The processor has access to processing units for performing data processing and to libraries. Functions in the libraries are implementable to perform parallel processing and graphics processing. The processor may be configured to acquire (e.g., to download from a web server) a download script, possibly with extensions specifying bindings to library functions. Running the script may cause the processor to create, for each processing unit, contexts in which functions may be run, and to run, on the processing units and within a respective context, a portion of the download script. Running the script may also cause the processor to create, for a processing unit, a memory object, transfer data into that memory object, and transfer data back to the processor in such a way that a memory address of the data in the memory object is not returned to the processor.

The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/648,349, entitled \u201cMACHINE PROCESSOR,\u201d filed Oct. 10, 2012; U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 13\/648,373, entitled \u201cPROVISION AND RUNNING A DOWNLOAD SCRIPT,\u201d filed Oct. 10, 2012.","The present disclosure is related generally to machine processors.","The OpenCL\u2122 framework is a framework for writing computer programs. OpenCL\u2122 provides for parallel computing to be performed. Further information on OpenCL\u2122 may be found, for example, in \u201cThe OpenCL\u2122 Specification Version: 1.1,\u201d A. Munshi, June 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Typically, websites, web pages, web applications, etc., are provided in the form of scripts (e.g., in HTML format or in JavaScript\u2122, etc.) and are not compiled computer programs.","Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, techniques of the present disclosure are illustrated as being implemented in a suitable environment. The following description is based on embodiments of the claims and should not be taken as limiting the claims with regard to alternative embodiments that are not explicitly described herein.","The present inventors have realized that as websites become more complicated there is a desire or need for websites, web pages, web applications, etc., to use the power of the computers they are running on (i.e., there is a desire for web pages, etc., to be able to use the multiple processor cores, graphics cards, etc., of a computer). The present inventors have realized that, in order to do so, a mechanism that allows access to the OpenCL\u2122 methods and functions from within a script needs to be provided.","Embodiments provide a machine processor (e.g., a virtual machine processor such as a JavaScript\u2122 module capable of executing JavaScript\u2122 commands) and a method performed by the machine processor. The machine processor may have access to one or more underlying processing units (e.g., a graphics processing unit or a central processing unit of a computer) for performing data processing. The machine processor may have access to a function library (e.g., an OpenCL\u2122 function library, which is described in more detail below) which may contain one or more functions (e.g., OpenCL\u2122 functions, which are described in more detail below). The functions may be implementable by the underlying processing units to perform parallel processing. The machine processor may be configured to acquire (e.g., by downloading over the Internet from a web server) a download script (e.g., a web page, etc.). This download script may comprise commands (e.g., written in JavaScript\u2122) for the machine processor that comprises a binding (e.g., a JavaScript\u2122 binding) to a corresponding function in the function library. The machine processor may be further configured to run the download script such that the commands are run. This may cause the machine processor to create, for each underlying processing unit, a context (i.e., a parallel context) in which one or more of the functions may be run, and run, on one or more underlying processing units and within a respective context, a portion of the download script.","Further embodiments provide a machine processor (e.g., a virtual machine processor such as a JavaScript\u2122 module capable of executing JavaScript\u2122 commands) and a method performed by the machine processor. The machine processor may have access to an underlying processing unit (e.g., a graphics processing unit or a central processing unit of a computer) for performing data processing. The machine processor may have access to a function library (e.g., an OpenCL\u2122 function library, which is described in more detail below) which may contain one or more functions (e.g., OpenCL\u2122 functions, which are described in more detail below). The functions may be implementable by the underlying processing unit, e.g., to perform parallel processing. The machine processor may be configured to acquire (e.g., by downloading over the Internet from a web server) a download script (e.g., a web page, etc.). This download script may comprise commands (e.g., written in JavaScript\u2122) for the machine processor that comprises a binding (e.g., a JavaScript\u2122 binding) to a corresponding function in the function library. The machine processor may be further configured to run the download script such that the commands are run. This may cause the machine processor to create, for the underlying processing unit, a memory object or buffer, thereby reserving at least part of the memory of that underlying processing unit into which data may be transferred from the machine processor, and to transfer data from the machine processor into that memory object or buffer. The memory object or buffer may be such that the underlying processing unit for which the memory object or buffer has been created may process the data transferred into the memory object or buffer. Running the script may further cause data (after having been processed by the processing unit) to be transferred back from the memory object or buffer to the machine processor in such a way that a memory address of the data in the memory object or buffer is not returned to the machine processor.","Further embodiments provide a machine processor (e.g., a virtual machine processor such as a JavaScript\u2122 module capable of executing JavaScript\u2122 commands) and a method performed by the machine processor. The machine processor may have access to an underlying processing unit (e.g., a graphics processing unit) for performing data processing. The machine processor may have access to a function library (e.g., an OpenCL\u2122 function library, which is described in more detail below) which may contain one or more functions (e.g., OpenCL\u2122 functions, which are described in more detail below). The functions may be implementable by the underlying processing unit, e.g., to perform parallel processing. The machine processor may also have access to a further function library (e.g., an OpenGL\u2122 function library, which is described in more detail below) which may contain one or more further functions (e.g., OpenGL\u2122 functions, which are described in more detail below). The further functions may be implementable by the underlying processing unit, e.g., to perform graphics processing or rendering. The machine processor may be configured to acquire (e.g., by downloading over the Internet from a web server) a download script (e.g., a web page, etc.). This download script may comprise commands (e.g., written in JavaScript\u2122) for the machine processor that comprises a binding (e.g., a JavaScript\u2122 binding) to a corresponding function or further function. The machine processor may be further configured to run the download script such that the commands are run. This may cause the machine processor to: create, for the underlying processing unit, a context in which one or more of the functions may be run; create, for the underlying processing unit, a further context in which one or more of the further functions may be run; run, on the underlying processing unit and within the context, a portion of the download script; and run, on the underlying processing unit and within the further context, a further portion of the download script.","Further embodiments provide methods and apparatus for providing download script for accessing or downloading by a machine processor (for running by the machine processor). The machine processor may have access to one or more underlying processing units (e.g., a graphics processing under or a central processing unit of a computer) for performing data processing. The machine processor may have access to a function library (e.g., an OpenCL\u2122 function library, which is described in more detail below) which may contain one or more functions (e.g., OpenCL\u2122 functions, which are described in more detail below). The functions may be implementable by the underlying processing units to perform parallel processing. The methods may comprise a computer sending (e.g., via the Internet), to a first web server, a request for an extension to be returned to the computer. The extension may specify one or more bindings to a corresponding function in the function library. The extension may be such that, when run (e.g., by the machine processor), a corresponding function from the function library is called. The method may further comprise, after receiving the request, the web server sending the extension back to the computer. The computer may then receive the requested extension which may then be used to write a script for implementation by the machine processor. The script may be uploaded to a further web server from which it may be accessed or downloaded by the machine processor.","Further embodiments provide methods and apparatus for storing (e.g., on a web server) and running a download script. The download script may be stored such that it is accessible or downloadable by a machine processor. The machine processor may have access to one or more underlying processing units (e.g., a graphics processing unit or a central processing unit of a computer) for performing data processing. The machine processor may have access to a function library (e.g., an OpenCL\u2122 function library, which is described in more detail below) which may contain one or more functions (e.g., OpenCL\u2122 functions, which are described in more detail below). The functions may be implementable by the underlying processing units to perform parallel processing. The script may be such that, when run by the machine processor, the machine processor creates, for an underlying processing unit, a memory object or buffer, thereby reserving at least part of the memory of that underlying processing unit into which data may be transferred from the web browser. The memory object or buffer may be such that a data type for each data item within the memory object or buffer is specified, thereby providing that data may be stored in the memory object or buffer as a typed array.","An apparatus for implementing any of the below described arrangements, and for performing any of the below described methods, may be provided by configuring or adapting any suitable apparatus, for example one or more computers or other processing apparatus or processors, or providing additional modules. The apparatus may include a computer, a network of computers, or one or more processors, for implementing instructions and using data, including instructions and data in the form of a computer program or plurality of computer programs stored in or on a machine-readable storage medium such as computer memory, a computer disk, ROM, PROM, etc., or any combination of these or other storage media.","It should be noted that certain of the processes depicted in the below described process flowcharts may be omitted or such processes may be performed in an order different from that presented below and shown in the process flowcharts. Furthermore, although all the processes have, for convenience and ease of understanding, been depicted as discrete and temporally-sequential, nevertheless some of the processes may in fact be performed simultaneously or at least overlapping to some extent temporally.","Referring now to the figures,  is a schematic illustration (not to scale) of an example network  in which embodiments can be implemented.","The network  comprises a first web server , a second web server , the Internet , a first computer , and a second computer .","The first web server  is described in more detail below with reference to .

These content objects tend to allow computing using an application programming interface that conforms closely to the OpenCL\u2122 API).","An advantage provided by the above described WebCL specification, methods, and systems is that increased security tends to be provided. Some OpenCL\u2122 methods, when implemented, return information that may be used to identify the one or more memory regions (e.g., a memory address) of a computer. A malicious party may use this information to access parts of the computer memory. The above described WebCL framework advantageously tends not to return (i.e., hides) this memory address information. Thus, the above described WebCL framework tends to provide a higher level of security than, e.g., the OpenCL\u2122 framework.","The above described WebCL specification tends to allow for a JavaScript\u2122 API design that is familiar to many computer programmers.","The above described WebCL specification tends to have fewer methods than other frameworks (e.g., the OpenCL\u2122). Method overloading has advantageously been exploited to provide this. The WebCL specification provides an object-oriented representation of OpenCL\u2122 that tends to be relatively simple compared to OpenCL\u2122.","An advantage provided by the above described WebCL specification, methods, and systems is that a method that creates an object is attached to the object that creates it. This is instead of that method being a constructor of the created object. For example, if a first WebCL object calls a, for example, \u201ccreate platform\u201d method, a \u201cWebCL Platform Object\u201d is returned. The first WebCL object is a \u201cparent\u201d of the WebCL Platform Object, i.e., the WebCL Platform Object is a \u201cchild\u201d of the first WebCL object. The parent and child objects are linked. For example, if a parent objects is deleted, its children are automatically deleted. This is advantageous, for example, during memory reclamation. This is in contrast to, for example, the OpenCL\u2122 framework.","In the above described WebCL framework, exceptions are used instead of error codes. If an exception is returned (or \u201cthrown\u201d), then an argument of the exception may contain details of the corresponding OpenCL\u2122 error. This use of exceptions as opposed to error messages advantageously tends to avoid a \u201ccascade\u201d of run-time errors. Thus, by using exceptions, lock-down (e.g., of the GPU) may be avoided.","In the above described WebCL framework, all objects are assigned to a unique module or package.","Conveniently, the constants used by the above described WebCL framework are those of the OpenCL\u2122 framework.","In the above described WebCL framework, OpenCL\u2122 Event and UserEvent classes are advantageously merged into a single class, namely the WebCLEvent class. Thus, in JavaScript\u2122 only a single Event Object is used. For a software developer, this tends to simplify the process of creating a computer program.","A method by which the above described WebCL framework may be extended is advantageously provided. For example, extensions that allow WebCL and WebGL to interoperate are advantageously provided. These extensions advantageously tend to facilitate rendering of GPU-accelerated buffers from OpenCL\u2122 using OpenGL standards. This tends to avoiding information transfer from the GPU to the CPU. Further extensions to the WebCL framework tend to provide JavaScript\u2122 representations of OpenCL\u2122 extensions for compiler features available in a GPU. This beneficially tends to allow a software developer to select the best kernel for various applications.","The above described WebCL framework advantageously tends to enable web applications to harness GPU and multi-core CPU parallel processing, e.g., from within a web browser. This tends to enable significant acceleration of applications such as image and video processing and advanced physics e.g., for WebGL games. Furthermore, the WebCL framework tends to extend the capabilities of, e.g., an HTML 5 web browser to accelerate computationally intensive and rich visual computing applications.","In the above embodiments, running the script (which in the above embodiments is JavaScript\u2122 but may be a different type of script) by the machine processor (which in the above embodiments is a JavaScript\u2122 module but may be a different type of machine processor) creates a context for an underlying processing unit (e.g., the GPU). Also in the above embodiments, running the script by the machine processor creates a memory object or buffer within the created context. However, in other embodiments, running the script by the machine processor may implement different types of objects within a created context or may implement different types of functions within the created context. This may be instead of or in addition to creating the memory object or buffer within the context. Also, in other embodiments running the script by the machine processor may create a memory object or buffer that is not within a created context.","In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the present discussion may be applied, it should be recognized that the embodiments described herein with respect to the drawing figures are meant to be illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the claims.
