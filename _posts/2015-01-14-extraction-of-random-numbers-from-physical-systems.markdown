abstract: A method of generating a random bit string includes receiving a binary input string, creating copies of the binary input string received from the min-entropy source, and providing each of the copies of the binary input string to one of a plurality of randomness extractors. The method further includes, for each randomness extractor, providing the respective extracted output binary string to one of a plurality of quantum devices, where each of the plurality of quantum devices is configured to (i) receive the extracted output binary string as a locally random input signal string, random only to that respective quantum device, and (ii) transform the received locally random input string into a globally random output signal string. Still further, the method includes combining the plurality of globally random output signal strings from the plurality of quantum devices to generate the random bit string.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates to generating random numbers and, more particularly, to techniques for extracting random numbers from untrusted quantum devices.","2. Brief Description of Related Technology","The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.","Randomness is an indispensable resource for modern day information processing. Without randomness, randomized algorithms, statistical scientific simulations, and secure cryptography would not exist. However, generating randomness is a fundamental problem that is far from fully solved. In fact, many secret keys currently in use can be broken by exploiting the insufficient randomness used in generating the keys.","Quantum mechanics is inherently random, therefore offers promising approaches to this problem. Indeed, commercial products to this end have started to emerge. However, numerous challenges remain. As classical beings, users of those quantum-based products cannot directly verify if the quantum states and quantum operations conform to the specifications. Implementations of quantum operations are, at least in the foreseeable future, far from ideal (e.g., the implementations include unpredictable deviations or errors). These imperfections call for secure protocols that tolerate deviations of quantum devices from ideal specifications. Furthermore, users requiring high levels of security often have to purchase devices from a vendor who is not necessarily trusted. Further still, while some proposed techniques are suggested to have higher levels of security, such techniques require quantum conditions that are not attainable in the real world settings.","In accordance with an example, a method of generating a random bit string comprises receiving, from a min-entropy source, a binary input string, creating copies of the binary input string received from the min-entropy source, and providing each of the copies of the binary input string to one of a plurality of randomness extractors, each randomness extractor configured to perform a different randomness extraction on the received copy of the binary input string to produce a respective extracted output binary string. The method further includes, for each randomness extractor, providing the respective extracted output binary string to one of a plurality of quantum devices, where each of the plurality of quantum devices is configured to (i) receive the extracted output binary string as a locally random input signal string, random only to that respective quantum device, and (ii) transform the received locally random input string into a globally random output signal string, random to each other of the plurality of quantum devices. Still further, the method includes combining the plurality of globally random output signal strings from the plurality of quantum devices to generate the random bit string.","In accordance with one example, a method of generating a random bit string comprises receiving, from each of one or more min-entropy sources, a binary input string and interacting with one or more input\/output devices, where each input\/output device is an untrusted system configured to produce a global randomness output from a local randomness input seed. The method further includes determining whether to accept the global randomness output from each of the input\/output devices or to reject the global randomness output from each of the input\/output devices, and outputting the random bit string, if the global randomness output from each of the input\/output devices is accepted.","In accordance with an example, a system for generating a random bit string comprises a classical controller configured (i) to receive, from a min-entropy source, a binary input string, (ii) to duplicate the binary input string to create copies of the binary input string, and (iii) provide each of the copies of the binary input string to one of a plurality of randomness extractors, each randomness extractor configured to perform a different randomness extraction on the received copy of the binary input string to produce a respective extracted output binary string. The system further includes a plurality of quantum devices each configured to (i) receive the extracted output binary string as a locally random input signal string, random only to that respective quantum device, and (ii) transform the received locally random input string into a globally random output signal string, random to each other of the plurality of quantum devices; and a combination stage configured to combine the plurality of globally random output signal strings from the plurality of quantum devices to generate the random bit string.","In accordance with an example, a system for generating a random bit string comprises a classical controller configured to receive, from each of one or more min-entropy sources, a binary input string and interact with one or more input\/output devices, where each input\/output device is an untrusted system configured to produce a global randomness output from a local randomness input seed. The classical controller is further configured to determine whether to accept the global randomness output from each of the input\/output devices or to reject the global randomness output from each of the input\/output devices, and output the random bit string, if the global randomness output from each of the input\/output devices is accepted.","The techniques of the present disclosure provide random number generation determined using randomness extractors. In comparison to conventional random number generators, the present techniques allow for a more expansive set of sources for random number generation. For example, the present techniques may be used with min-entropy and physical sources that have a certain amount of inherent randomness. The techniques employ extractors, employing a deterministic process, that interact with multiple physical sources with the purpose of outputting true randomness. The physical systems may be subject to easily verifiable constraints imposed by certain physical theories, such that the security of an extractor may be based on the validity of those physical theories.","In this way, the present techniques can circumvent the independent-sources limitations of conventional techniques, through the use of physical sources such as spatially separated untrusted physical sources of quantum randomness. For this latter implementation with untrusted quantum sources, the only additional source of randomness used is a single classical signal source of a guaranteed min-entropy. For implementation, the only additional quantum source would be a min-entropy input signal source. This combination of a weak-random input source (min-entropy) and spatially separated untrusted quantum-device physical sources is able to produce an output that is secure against adversary. Thus, the present techniques can be used for random number generation, random number expansion, quantum key distribution and secured communications, and other applications.","With conventional techniques for random number generation, there is a fundamental limit requiring two or more independent sources that the present techniques overcome. The research on the minimum assumptions under which true randomness can be obtained has led to theories of randomness extractors. An extractor is a deterministic process that transforms several sources of weak randomness into near perfect randomness. A basic component of conventional theories on extractors is that the amount of randomness in each weak source is quantified by the notion of min-entropy (or conditional quantum min-entropy when the adversary is quantum). The choice of this description is supported by the fact that the min-entropy of a source characterizes the maximum amount of securely extractible randomness with the help of additional randomness. On the other hand, deterministic extraction, i.e., in the absence of additional randomness, is considered to be impossible. To get around this perceived impossibility, some have settled on making additional independence assumptions, and aiming for a randomness extractor either with one short truly random seed, or by using two or more independent weak sources. In either case, independence is crucial for randomness extraction to be possible. A classical signal source (such as a random binary string) is said to be of min-entropy k, if no classical adversary can guess the signal correctly with more than 2^{\u2212k} probability. Likewise, the source is said to have k conditional quantum min-entropy, if no quantum adversary can guess it correctly with more than 2^{\u2212k} probability.","In contrast to conventional techniques, the present techniques provide random number generation that does not require independent sources, is quantum-secure, achieving close to optimal error parameters, and randomness that expands at an exponential or unbounded rate from a weak min-entropy source. The techniques can tolerate a constant, or uniform, level of imprecision in implementing each quantum operation. That is, with the present techniques, any honest implementation performing below an optimal level by a small constant amount, on average may still pass randomness and\/or security tests with overwhelming (and unexpected) probability.","The present techniques deploy quantum devices that exhibit protocols (which may be considered sub-protocols, to the over all system-level protocol) that enable practical random number generation, with the minimal assumption on the weak-random source and on the generating device. In some examples, the techniques work with any min-entropy source, instead of requiring a source possessing additional structure or quantum randomness. Requiring additional structures, such as independent sources, presents difficult challenges to achieve practically; therefore these challenges be avoided.","The present techniques may be resilient to the implementation imprecisions of the quantum devices used. That is the present techniques offer greater robustness over what was generally considered achievable with conventional techniques. Robustness, which includes allowing for a certain amount of inaccuracy in operation, is valuable for quantum information processing, in part, because quantum states are extremely fragile and quantum operations are inaccurate. Moreover, the present techniques may achieve a security parameter close to the best possible. The techniques have lead to a striking conclusion, that any min-entropy source of a fixed length can be used to extract, robustly and securely, from untrusted quantum devices, an arbitrarily long output randomness (random number) of close to the best possible quality.","In addition to the above implications on randomness extraction, these techniques can be used to create inherently random events in the laboratories with confidence of their unpredictability.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","104","102","104","102","104","102","104"]},"In some implementations, the quantum device  may include a plurality of components -(also labeled as D, D, . . . , Din ), where each of the plurality of components includes a corresponding input interface -, output interface -, and quantum system -. Generally, the quantum systems -may include any suitable systems governed by quantum-mechanical principles and capable of performing operations on data or input based on those quantum-mechanical principles. The quantum systems -may represent data or input via quantum-mechanical properties, such as spin, charge, polarization, optical properties, thermal properties, magnetic properties, etc., and, in some cases, each of the quantum systems -may include one or more \u201cqubits,\u201d such as two-state quantum-mechanical systems.","The quantum systems -may by implemented as physical sources, such as spatially separated untrusted quantum devices. These physical sources may be constructed from different physical devices, in some examples. In some examples, the physical sources may be separate physical sources of a single physical device. Each of the quantum systems -may be execute a protocol to convert a locally random input into a globally random output, as described below, as discussed in reference to , for example. In some examples, the quantum systems -may represent single quantum sources employ a protocol. In some examples, each quantum system -may represent multiple sub-systems, each employing the protocol.","By way of example and without limitation, the quantum systems -may include: (i) an Ising spin glass in which data is represented by Ising spins; (ii) non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter in which data is represented by braiding of anyonic quasiparticles; (iii) three dimensional (3D) lattice cluster states in which data is represented by topologically protected quantum gates; (iv) superconducting systems in which data is represented by small superconducting circuits (e.g., Josephson junctions); (v) trapped atoms, ions, or molecules (e.g., trapped by electromagnetic fields or optical lattices) in which data is represented by two or more energy levels, such as hyperfine levels; (vi) one or more quantum dots (or quantum wells) in which data is represented by confined excitations; (vii) linear optical elements in which data in represented by optical modes of photons; or (viii) Bose-Einstein condensates in which data is represented by one or more energetically protected two-level states. It is understood, that any suitable quantum system may represent data or input via quantum-mechanical properties and perform operations on that data based on the quantum-mechanical properties.","Preparation or manipulation of the quantum systems -and obtaining of results from the quantum systems -may include measurements performed by the corresponding input interfaces -and the corresponding output interface -, in some implementations. For example, in a case in which the quantum systems -include topologically ordered phases of matter (e.g., as in a topological quantum computer), the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include one or more interferometers to perform quasiparticle braiding, topological charge measurement, and\/or other topologically transformative manipulations. Alternatively, in the case in which the quantum systems -include superconducting systems, the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include various superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to measure magnetic properties with high sensitivity. It is understood, however, that the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include any appropriate combination of hardware, classical computer processing, and\/or software components configured to measure, manipulate, and\/or otherwise interact with the quantum systems -. Moreover, in some examples, the input interfaces -may include a duplicator and extractor, as described hereinbelow, that receives a common input signal and sends an extracted signal to the different sub-protocol portions of the quantum devices -. In some other examples, the duplicator and extractor are within the quantum systems -","Further, some or all of the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may be controlled by or communicate with the classical controller  in order to measure, manipulate, and\/or otherwise interact with the quantum systems -, in an implementation. For example, the input interfaces -may receive input data values (e.g., input bits) from the classical controller  that are subsequently encoded in the quantum systems -via operations (e.g., measurements) performed by the input interfaces -. Likewise, the output interfaces -may communicate results, obtained via measurements performed on the quantum systems -, to the classical controller  for further processing or utilization. In some cases, the classical controller  may implement software applications, via computer-readable instructions, that control all or some of the functionality of the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -. For example, the classical controller  may control when (e.g., periodically or at pre-defined times) and how (e.g., with what parameters, such as intensity, voltage, etc.) the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -perform measurements on the quantum systems -","In some implementations, the plurality of components -are configured such that information cannot be exchanged among the plurality of components -during certain quantum operations, such as random number generation, randomness expansion, or quantum key distribution. For example, the plurality of components -may be disposed in locations far apart from one another so as to ensure that during the period of generating a bit of a random number, the plurality of components -cannot exchange information due to a limit imposed by special relativity (i.e., information cannot travel faster than the speed of light). Such a separation of the plurality of components -may be referred to as \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cin isolation\u201d herein. In general, quantum communication or a quantum exchange of information may include any intentional or accidental coupling with an environment (e.g., a coupling that includes a decoherence of quantum states).","In other implementations, the plurality of components -are configured such that information cannot be exchanged among the plurality of components -during certain stages or phases of a quantum operation, while information can be exchanged during other stages or phases of the quantum operation. For example, the plurality of components -may be disposed in locations such that during one iteration of a protocol, such as the protocols discussed with reference to , information cannot be exchanged between the plurality of components -, while information can be exchanged in between iterations. Such a configuration of the plurality of components -may be referred to as \u201cresettable\u201d or \u201cbeing reset\u201d herein. In this manner, protocols may be implemented with reduced complexity, in some cases. For example, the quantum device  may establish entanglement \u201con-the-fly\u201d and needs only to maintain the entanglement (e.g., with a constant level of fidelity) for the duration of a single protocol iteration.","Communications between the classical controller  and the input interfaces -and the output interfaces -may include classical communications, in an implementation, facilitated by a control and measurement link . The control and measurement link  may carry communications from the classical controller to the interfaces -and -via electromagnetic signals (e.g., current signals) on a current-carrying conductor, such as a ribbon, coaxial, twisted pair, universal serial bus (USB), or other cable. The control and measurement link  may, in some implementations, carry encoded digital signals between the classical controller  and the interfaces -and -, such as signals encoded according to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) standard, Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCR), High-Speed LAN Instrument Protocol (HiSLIP), LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI), PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), etc. In general, the control and measurement link  may include any suitable wired and\/or wireless components, links, modems, routers, cables, buses, etc. allowing the classical controller  to communicate with and\/or control the quantum device .","The classical controller  may include various interfaces, implemented in any suitable combination of hardware and software, allowing the classical controller  to communicate with the quantum device  and various other devices or components. In particular, the classical controller  may include an instrument control interface  configured to send\/receive control signals (voltages, currents, digitally encoded messages, etc.) to and from the quantum device , respectively. The classical controller  may also include a data acquisition (DAQ) interface , such as a DAQ PCI card, to receive measurement values from the quantum device  (e.g., from the output interfaces -) and a network interface  allowing the classical controller  to communicate with various other network-enabled devices .","Users of the network-enabled devices  may interact with the classical controller  via a network  and network interface . The network-enabled devices  may include, by way of example, a network-enabled cellular wireless terminal, a phone, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, a server computer, a cluster of server computers, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smartphone, a laptop computer, a wearable wireless communication device such as a wearable computer, a portable media player, an e-reader, or other similar devices (not shown). Of course, any network-enabled device appropriately configured may interact with the classical controller  to, for example, generate a random number, expand a random number, and\/or generate or retrieve a quantum key. In some examples, the network-enabled devices  represent a network-enabled enterprise in communication with the classical controller  of another network-enabled enterprise. Example enterprises, including any two enterprises desiring to establish shared secured communications, such as a design enterprise creating intellectual property (e.g., an integrated circuit designer) and a manufacturing enterprise (fabrication enterprise or foundry).","The network  may be a proprietary network, a secure public Internet, a virtual private network or some other type of network, such as dedicated access lines, plain ordinary telephone lines, satellite links, combinations of these, etc. Where the network  comprises the Internet, data communication may take place over the network  via an Internet communication protocol. The network  may communicate with the network-enabled devices  through wireless or wired connections. Further, in some examples, the network  is a mobile (or cellular) communication network.","The network-enabled devices  need not necessarily communicate with the network  via a wired connection. In some instances, the network-enabled devices  may communicate with the network  via wireless signals; and, in some instances, the network-enabled devices  may communicate with the network  via an intervening wireless or wired device, which may be a wireless router, a wireless repeater, a base transceiver station of a mobile telephony provider, etc., or other access point.","The classical controller  also includes a program memory  and one or more processors  (e.g., microcontrollers or microprocessors). The program memory  may include an assortment of computer-readable media implemented as semiconductor memories, magnetically readable memories, and\/or optically readable memories, for example. Computer-readable media may be any media that may be accessed by the classical controller . By way of example, and not limitation, the media may include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. Media may also include computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media that stores information such as computer-readable instructions, program modules, data structures, or other data. Computer-storage media may include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, or other memory technology, optical storage disks, magnetic storage devices, and any other medium that may be used to store computer-accessible information. Communication media may be computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal or other transport mechanism. Communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as RF, infrared, and other wireless media.","The program memory  may store a basic input\/output system (BIOS), containing algorithms to transfer information between components within the classical controller . Also, data or program modules that are immediately accessible or are presently in use by the one or more processors  may be stored in the program memory . Data normally stored in the program memory  while the classical controller  is in operation may include an operating system, application programs, program modules, and program data. In particular, the program memory  may store a random number generation program , a randomness expansion program , and a quantum key distribution program , as discussed further with reference to .

Vidick, Fully device independent quantum key distribution. arXiv:1210.1810v2, (25 Nov. 2012), which are both hereby incorporated by reference. However, in contrast to these later described devices, the system  is configured to tolerate noise levels, assumed non-existent in theoretical systems, but that we recognize as valuable for practical systems. The present techniques, for example, suggest protocols that allow for noise levels not achievable in theoretical and conventional systems, and may be achieved when outputting only a single bit.","Random Amplification Protocol","In the illustrated example, each sub-protocol module -exhibits a protocol IT which may be a classical algorithm interacting with an untrusted quantum device with multiple, spatially separated components. Such a protocol is a randomness decoupling, alternatively referred to as a randomness certification protocol, and its goal is to generated certified uniform randomness from any weak source with sufficient entropy, using untrusted devices. The protocol may be made to satisfy two properties: (i) \u201ccompleteness\u201d which generally provides that when the devices are \u201chonest\u201d (i.e., following the prescribed design) and the source has sufficient entropy, the protocol should accept with high probability and the output should be close to uniformly random, and (ii) \u201csoundness\u201d, which generally provides when the devices are malicious, the probability of accepting their low-quality output is negligibly small. The definitions in (4.2) and (4.3) capture both properties for a random certification protocol, respectively. In particular, the protocol \u03a0 may include a randomness certification protocol, \u03a0, for (n, k)-source with completeness error, \u03b5, and soundness error, \u03b5, if it satisfies the following completeness and soundness properties, respectively.","1. (Completeness) There exists a quantum-admissible strategy for devices D such that for every source X the probability that the protocol fl accepts the input signal is greater than the completeness error, expressed as:\n\n()accepts]\u22671\u2212\u03b5.\u2003\u2003(4.2)\n","2. (Soundness) For every joint system \u03c1of the source, devices and the environment such that H(X|D)\u2267k, and let \u03c1=\u03c6id(\u03c1), then we have\n\n\u0394(\u03a0,\u03c1)=\u2225\u03c1\u2212\u03c6(\u03c1)\u2225\u2266\u03b5\u2003\u2003(4.3)\n","The source X (e.g., source ) need only have k bits of min-entropy conditioned on the devices, D, and not conditioned on both the devices and the environment E. This isolation of the min-entropy source gives better confidence on the amount of entropy in X that is sufficient of randomness generation using untrusted sources.","In examining (4.3), it is noted that the choice of H(ND) may be extended easily to a smooth min-entropy source, H (X|D), by allowing an extra error \u03b5in the soundness error. That is, the present randomness generation techniques are still able to sufficiently function and produce random bit strings, within the added error tolerance, with the configurations described.","In some examples, the desired properties for a randomness amplification protocol applied by sub-protocol modules -would be as follows. With the system , it is desirable to take a small amount of min-entropy k and efficiently generate a long and high-quality certified randomness (measured by output length l and soundness error \u03b5), where the efficiency can be measured by the number of devices t and the query and time complexity of the protocol \u03a0l. Note that since the sub-protocol modules -can generate randomness, one can expect that the output length l is larger than the investigated entropy, k, that is, to achieve expansion property. High-quality randomness is useful for some applications such as cryptography, and it is desirable to have soundness error to be poly-logarithmic in the investigated entropy k and the complexity of protocol \u03a0.","Moreover, to implement the protocol in physical systems, robustness should be achieved, that is, a strengthening of completeness such that the protocol accepts an input with high probability even when a small constant amount of noise is present in the sub-protocol modules -. This robustness is beneficially achieved by specifying a noise model for the protocol \u03a0, as described, where, in some examples, the noise model is dependent, at least partially, upon the type of quantum device (i.e., physical sources) used as sub-protocol modules -. Further examples are detailed hereinbelow in reference to .","Randomness Certification Protocol","In addition to employing a quantum processes, the modules -can employ a randomness certification protocol, \u03a0, where the goal is to certify uniform randomness produced by the devices (against the environment), based on the uniform seed. In an example, protocol \u03a0 includes a randomness certification sub-protocol with seed length n, and having a completeness error, \u03b5, and soundness error, \u03b5, that satisfies the following conditions, respectively. Again, while the values 4.2 and 4.3 may be satisfied for the protocol overall, for the randomness certification protocol, \u03a0, the following additional expressions for completeness and soundness may be used.","1. (Completeness) There exists a quantum-admissible strategy for devices D such that for every source X (not necessarily uniform),\n\n()accepts]\u22671\u2212\u03b5.\u2003\u2003(4.4)\n","2. (Soundness) For every joint system \u03c1of the source, devices and the environment such that \u03c1=U\u03c1, and let \u03c1=\u03c6id(\u03c1), then we have\n\n\u0394(\u03a0,\u03c1)=\u2225\u03c1\u2212\u03c6(\u03c1)\u2225\u2266\u03b5\u2003\u2003(4.5)\n","For randomness expansion, conventional techniques require the certified randomness output is longer than the original seed input. In contrast, the present techniques do not place such limits on the randomness output. Instead, the output may be close to uniform against the environment, E, with a min-entropy seed input X, such that the entropy comes from the quantum devices disconnecting the output from the input seed input. Indeed, because the output is not limited by the size of the original seed input, the randomness certification protocol may certify just a single bit from a long seed input.","In any event,  demonstrates an entire randomness amplification protocol, \u03a0 or flame, for random number generation, based on an input bit or string, X, from a weak source, applying a randomness amplification protocol, \u03a0, to X, which includes using the extractor Ext to turn X into a somewhere random source (S, . . . , S) where d is the seed length of Ext and S=Ext(X, i), and then for each i\u2208[2], applying a randomness certification protocol \u03a0with seed Sand distinct set of quantum devices D, each of which outputs (O,Z). If the percentage of acceptances is outside of some threshold 0\u2266\u03b7<1, then the overall protocol \u03a0may reject that seed through the accept\/abort decision block ; otherwise, \u03a0accepts the seed and outputs Z=\u2295Z.","At a high level, \u03a0relies upon the output of some extractor -(S) being close to uniform and thus can be used as the seed in \u03a0which certifies that the output Zfrom the modules -is close to uniform even conditioned on everything except D, which includes source X, environment E, the devices Dused by other blocks.

Generally, non-local games may differ in scenarios in which the games are \u201cplayed\u201d by, or implemented in, systems operating according to classical mechanics as compared to scenarios in which the games are \u201cplayed\u201d by, or implemented in, systems operating according to quantum mechanics. An example non-local game is a cooperative game involving two or more players (e.g., quantum systems). The players cannot communicate but may share common random bits or a common quantum state. A controller, or other suitable device, may send an input to one of the players who then responds with an answer. Winning, in the non-local game, may include satisfying a condition dependent on the inputs from the controller (e.g., inputs from a known probability distribution).","During each iteration of the protocol , which iteration produces a random value or bit, the quantum device plays the game G. That is, the quantum device receives an input, g, for a single round of the game and operates such that a result is produced. G may include any binary Exclusive Or (XOR) game, such as a game with inputs and outputs are binary and with a scoring function depending on the inputs and the XOR of the outputs, where the binary XOR game is strongly self-testing, in an implementation. The game G may be strongly self-testing, or non-local in that any strategy that is close (within an value E, or E-close) to optimal in its winning probability must be O(\u221a\u03b5)-close to a unique optimal strategy in both its state and its measurements, in an implementation. In this case, the term \u201cstrongly\u201d refers to the O(\u221a\u03b5) term, which is the best possible asymptotic bound for a non-local game. By way of example, strong self-testing games may include the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) game, but it is understood that the protocol  may utilize any such binary XOR game. Although, strong self-testing, or non-local games are discussed above and below by way of example and for clarity, some implementations of protocols for generating random numbers may utilize other contextuality games along with or as an alternative to non-local games, as further illustrated in .","The protocol  may include the following parameters, in an implementation: (i) N, a positive integer (e.g., the output length); (ii) \u03b7, a real \u2208(0, 1] (e.g., the abort threshold); (iii) q, a real\u2208(0, \u00bd] (e.g., the test frequency); (iv) G, an n-player non-local game that is a strong self-test; (v) D, an untrusted quantum device (e.g., from an untrusted party) that can play G repeatedly and cannot receive any additional information. In a single iteration (i.e., use of the protocol) the components  and  may not be allowed to communicate, but, in between iterations, there may be inter-component communication. For any real \u03c9\u2208(0, 1), the protocol , with appropriate parameters, converts any k uniform bits to exp(\u03a9(k)) extractible bits with exp(\u2212\u03a9(k)) error under a constant level of noise, in an implementation.","In some implementations, quantum-proof randomness extractors are applied to the outputs of the protocol  to produce near perfect random output from the protocol . The quantum-proof randomness extractors may be deterministic functions Ext(X, S) on two arguments: (i) X being the source, which in this case may be the output of the protocol ; and (ii) S being a perfectly random seed.

If g=1, the iteration of the method  is determined to be a \u201cgame round,\u201d and an input string is determined at random (block ). In some cases, the input string may be determined from {0, 1}, according a probability distribution specified by the game G, and given to a quantum device executing the method .

If the number of result values equals N, the resulting sequence of values (e.g., N-length sequence from the alphabet {P, F, H, T}) is output for subsequent storage or utilization. For example, the resulting sequence may be stored by a classical controller, such as the classical controller , for use as a random number or key. Alternatively, a classical controller may communicate the result sequence to a network-enabled device, such as one or more of the network-enabled devices .","In some implementations, a quantum device implementing the example method  may also determine if the \u201cfailure\u201d rate (e.g., out of all the game rounds) exceeds (1\u2212w+\u03b7), where wis the highest probability with which a quantum strategy can win the game G.

Instead of a multi-part binary device, we use a single-part binary device with trusted measurements.","2. Instead of playing a nonlocal game, at each round we simply use the bit g as input to the device and record the output.","This protocol is referred to herein as \u201cProtocol A.\u201d (See )","Note that Protocols A and R both involve conditioning on a \u201csuccess\u201d event. One of the central difficulties found in establishing quantum security is in determining the impact that this conditioning has on the randomness of the device D. In the classical security context, one can show that once we condition on the success event, \u201cmost\u201d uses of the device D (in an appropriate sense) generate random outputs. By elementary arguments, the outputs therefore accumulate min-entropy linearly over multiple iterations, and randomness expansion is achieved.","A successful way to interpret the success\/abort events in the quantum context may involves two adjustments to the classical approach outlined above. First, the quantum Renyi entropy is used in place of the smooth min-entropy. (The quantum Renyi entropies have elegant arithmetic properties which make them more amenable to induction.) Secondly, rather than directly considering \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cabort\u201d as discrete events, a graded measurement of performance interpolates between the two.","Suppose that E is a quantum system which is initially entangled with D.

(This device model allows communication in between rounds, in an implementation)","Now a somewhat more specific type of device is defined. Suppose that E is a single-part binary quantum device. Say that E is a partially trusted device with parameters (u, v) if the measurement operators Nthat E uses on input 1 decompose as:\n\n=()+(),\n\nwhere Pis perfectly anti-commutative with the other measurement N, and Qsatisfies \u2225Q\u2225\u22661 (and is otherwise unspecified). Essentially, the device behaves as follows. On input 0, it performs a perfect measurement. On input 1, it does one of the following at random: it performs a perfectly anti-commuting measurement (probability=v), or it performs an unknown measurement (probability=u\u2212v), or it ignores its quantum system and merely outputs a perfect coin flip (probability=1\u2212u). (The second possibility is referred to herein as a \u201cdishonest mistake,\u201d and the third is referred to herein as an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d)\n","Proving that untrusted devices can be simulated by partially trusted devices is an example of a task that is fairly easy in the classical security context but difficult in the quantum context.

For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connects the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of the example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.","Unless specifically stated otherwise, discussions herein using words such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d \u201cpresenting,\u201d \u201cdisplaying,\u201d or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine (e.g., a computer) that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within one or more memories (e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof), registers, or other machine components that receive, store, transmit, or display information.","As used herein any reference to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some embodiments may be described using the expression \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected\u201d along with their derivatives. For example, some embodiments may be described using the term \u201ccoupled\u201d to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term \u201ccoupled,\u201d however, may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201chaving\u201d or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, \u201cor\u201d refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).","In addition, use of the \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the description. This description, and the claims that follow, should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise.","This detailed description is to be construed as an example only and does not describe every possible embodiment, as describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible.
