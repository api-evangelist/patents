{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60\/343,973 filed Dec. 27, 2001.","The present invention relates generally to decoder circuits, and more particularly to decoder circuits in content addressable memory (CAM) devices.","Due to the increasing need for rapid matching capabilities, in networking hardware equipment for example, content addressable memories (CAMs) continue to proliferate. A CAM may perform matching functions by applying a search key or \u201ccomparand\u201d to a table of stored data values. A CAM may then determine if any of the data values match a given search key.","CAM devices may take a variety of forms. As but a few of the possible examples, some CAM devices are based on particular types of CAM cells. Such cells may include storage circuits integrated with compare circuits. Examples of storage circuits may be static random access memory (SRAM) type cells or dynamic RAM (DRAM) type cells. Alternate approaches may include RAM arrays, or the like, with separate matching circuits and\/or matching processes executed by a processor, or the like.","Conventional CAM devices may include both binary and ternary CAM devices. Binary CAM devices can provide a bit-by-bit comparison between a stored data value and a search key. Ternary CAM devices can provide maskable compare operations that can selectively exclude predetermined bits of a data value from a compare operation.","Typically, a conventional CAM device can generate match indications for each entry. That is, each entry can be compared with an applied search key value. If a search key value matches a stored data value, a match (or \u201chit\u201d) indication may be generated for the entry. Conversely, if a search key value does not match a stored data value, a mismatch (or \u201cmiss\u201d) indication may be generated for the entry.","Match results in a CAM device may include single match results, that can be generated when a single entry matches an applied key value, as well as multiple match results, that may be generated when more than one entry matches an applied key value.","While CAM entries can provide the above described match or search function, CAM entries may also include conventional data access functions, such as read or write operations, to read or write the data values that are compared to a search key.","Decoder circuits within CAM devices can conventionally select a CAM entry for a particular operation, such as a read or write. More specifically, conventional circuits may enable a particular CAM entry by coupling such a CAM entry to bit lines, or the like, so that data may be read from the entry or written into the entry. Mask data or similar data may be written for a given CAM entry in a similar fashion.","Conventional CAM decoder circuits can be conceptualized as being \u201cone-hot\u201d type decoders. That is, a typical conventional CAM decoder can receive a binary input value of N bits and output 2pre-decode output values. In response to each particular input value, one of the pre-decoder output values can be activated.","While one-hot type decoders can be suitable for read and write operations in a CAM device, it may be desirable to employ decoders that can provide more advanced functions in order to provide additional features in a CAM device.","According to the present invention, a decoder circuit may include a first string decoder that activates a different first pre-decode signal in response to different first input data values in a first mode. In a second mode, a first string decoder can activate different numbers of the first pre-decode signals in response to each different first input data value.","According to one aspect of the embodiments, a decoder circuit may also include a first compare circuit that compares two or more of the first pre-decode signals to generate a first comparison result.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a decoder circuit may also include first pre-decode signals that have an order with respect to one another. A first compare circuit can generate one comparison result when a lower order first pre-decode signal is active and a higher order first pre-decode signal is inactive, and generates another first comparison result when the lower order first pre-decode signal and higher order first pre-decode signal are both active.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a decoder circuit may also include an enable circuit. In response to one first comparison result from a first comparator, an enable circuit can generate decoder output signals according to second pre-decode signals. In response to another first comparison result from the first comparator, an enable circuit can generate predetermined decoder output signals.","In one particular approach, an enable circuit may include a first set of gates that are enabled in response to one first comparison result. An enable circuit may also include a second set of gates having inputs coupled to the outputs of the first set of gates. Such a set of gates can be enabled in response to another first comparison result.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a decoder circuit may also include a second string decoder that activates a different second pre-decode signal in response to different second input data values in a first mode. In a second mode, a second string decoder may activate a different number of the second pre-decode signals in response to each different second data value. In addition, a second compare circuit can compare at least two of the second pre-decode signals to generate a second comparison result.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, in a decoder circuit, a second comparison result can be provided to a first compare circuit.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a second compare circuit can logically combine a first comparison result with a second comparison result.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a decoder circuit can include a number of content addressable memory (CAM) entries arranged into groups of size N, a number of first compare circuits, and a number of second compare circuits. In a second mode of operation, first compare circuits can compare at least two of the first pre-decode signals to generate first comparison results that each enable a CAM entry group. Further, second compare circuits can compare at least two second pre-decode signals to generate second comparison results. Second comparison results can enable entries within a same CAM entry group.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a decoder circuit can further include a number of CAM entries formed in a first area of a substrate and a number of first compare circuits formed in a second area of the substrate adjacent to the first area. Further, a first string decoder can be formed in a third area of the substrate that is different than the second area.","The present invention may also include a method of activating decoder signals in a content addressable memory (CAM) device. Such a method may include activating one of a number of first pre-decode signals in response to different first input values in a first mode, and activating a different number of the first pre-decode signals in response to each different first input value in a second mode.","According to one aspect of the embodiments, a method may include the first pre-decode signals having an order with respect to one another. In addition, activating a different number of the first pre-decode signals can include activating a sequential number of the first pre-decode signals according to the order.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a method may include accessing a single CAM entry in a first mode, and searching a predetermined number of CAM entries according to first input values in a second mode.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a method may include activating a different number of second pre-decode signals in response to each different second input value in a second mode.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a method may include comparing second pre-decode signals to enable one of a plurality of decoder output signal groups in response to different second input values in a first mode. In addition, in a second mode, comparing second pre-decode signals to enable a different number of the output signal groups in response to each different second input values.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a method may include activating decoder output signals from one of the output signal groups according to the first pre-decode signals in both a first and second mode.","According to another aspect of the embodiments, a method may include the first pre-decode signals having a significance with respect to one another. A method may also include, in a second mode, in response to a particular first input value, activating all first pre-decode signals having greater significance than one first pre-decode signal activated in response to the same first input value in the first mode.","The present invention may also include an address decoder circuit that includes one or more circuits having at least two modes of operation. A first mode can produce a single active output signal for each possible input state combination. A second mode can produce multiple active output signals for each possible input state combination.","According to one aspect of the embodiments, multiple active output signals in a second mode are consecutive and range from the lowest order output signal to the same output signal as the single active signal in the first mode.","Various embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed in conjunction with a number of figures. The embodiments describe a decoder apparatus and method that may be included in a CAM device. A decoder apparatus and\/or method according to the present invention may provide conventional one-hot decoding in a first mode, but also provide \u201cstring\u201d decoding in a second mode. String decoding may activate a different number of pre-decode signals in response to each different input value.","Referring now to , a decoder circuit according to one embodiment is set forth in a block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character . A decoder circuit may include \u201cstring\u201d decoders - and -. A decoder circuit  may also include a compare circuit  and an enable circuit .","Each string decoder (- and -) may receive an input value (IN or IN) and provide corresponding pre-decode output signals (P-P(n\u22121) or Pn-P(2n\u22121)). In the embodiment of , each string decoder (- and -) may also receive a mode signal EXPL. In response to a mode signal EXPL, a string decoder (- and -) may provide one-hot or string decoding. Particular examples of such decoding will be described in more detail below.","A compare circuit  may receive at least two pre-decode signals from one string decoder - and compare such values to generate a comparison result CMP. A comparison result CMP may be provided to an enable circuit .","An enable circuit  may receive pre-decode signals from one string decoder -, and provide decoder output signals DEC-DEC(n\u22121). The generation of decoder output signals (DEC-DEC(n\u22121)) by an enable circuit  can be controlled by a comparison result CMP. As but one example, if a comparison result has one particular value, decoder output signals (DEC-DEC(n\u22121)) may be generated in response to received pre-decode signals (P to P(n\u22121)). However, if a comparison result has another particular value, decoder output signals (DEC-DEC(n\u22121)) may be predetermined values (e.g., all active and\/or all inactive).","Referring now to , one example of a string decoder operation is set forth in table form. The table of  includes columns INx, EXPL, and P-P. A column INx can represent a received input value. In the very particular example of , an input value can range from 0-7.","A column EXPL shows a mode signal that can determine a mode of operation for a string decoder. A mode value EXPL of \u201c0\u201d can indicate a conventional (e.g., one-hot) mode of operation for a string decoder. Such a mode may include writes and reads to single entries in a memory device, such as a CAM device. In contrast, a mode value EXPL of \u201c1\u201d can indicate an unconventional (e.g., one or more hot) mode of operation for a string decoder. Such a mode may include an \u201cexplore\u201d operation in a CAM device that may restrict a search operation to less than all available CAM entries.","Particular examples of explore operations (also referred to as restricted search and\/or search-beyond operations) are set forth in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/281,814 filed on Oct. 28, 2002 and entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RESTRICTED SEARCH OPERATION IN CONTENT ADDRESSABLE MEMORY (CAM) DEVICES\u201d by James et al. The contents of this application are incorporated by reference herein.","As can be seen in , when a mode signal has a value of 0 (a one-hot mode), a string decoder may function in the same general fashion as a conventional decoder, activating a different pre-decode signal (P-P) in response to each different input value INx.","Unlike a conventional decoder, when a mode signal has a value of 1 (a string mode), a string decoder may activate different \u201cstrings\u201d of values. More particularly, in , in response to each different input value, a string decoder may activate a different number of pre-decode signal (P-P) in response to each different input value INx.","In the very particular case of , in a string-hot mode, a string decoder may activate the same pre-decode signal as in the one-hot mode, but may also activate all pre-decode signals of higher significance. Thus, as shown in , when a mode signal EXPL is a \u201c0\u201d, a string decoder may activate pre-decode signal P in response to an input value INx of \u201c4\u201d. However, when a mode signal EXPL is a \u201c1\u201d, a string decoder may activate pre-decode signal P, and in addition, higher significant pre-decode signals P-P in response to an input value of \u201c4\u201d.","Looked at in another way, pre-decode signals may be conceptualized as having an order with respect to one another, in this case, a numerical order. In a one-hot mode a single pre-decode signal may be activated. However, in a string mode, multiple pre-decode signals may be activated in a consecutive order. In addition, a lowest signal in such an order may be the same signal that is activated in the one-hot mode.","A decoder circuit according to a second embodiment will now be described with reference to FIG. .  shows a decoder circuit, designated by the general reference character , that includes string decoders - to -, higher order compare circuit -, lower order compare circuits - and -, and enable circuits - and -. The example of  shows an example of 3-bit encoding, in that an output of each string decoder (- to -) may be generated from a 3-bit encoded value.","String decoders (- to -) may receive an input address ADD, and in response thereto, generate pre-decode signals P-P.  shows string decoders (- to -) arranged to enable hierarchical string decoding. Such an arrangement may allow for an enabling or disabling of different numbers of decoder output signal groups in response to each different higher order address portion. Thus, in , an address may include multiple portions having a significance with respect to one another. Such portions are shown as \u201cMORE\u201d, \u201cCORE\u201d and \u201cLESS\u201d. A lowest significance portion LESS may be provided as an input value IN to a string decoder -. A next significant portion CORE may be provided as an input value IN to a string decoder -. An even higher significance portion MORE may be provided as an input value IN to a string decoder -.","String decoders (- to -) may each operate in the same general fashion as shown in FIG. . Thus, string decoder - may activate one of pre-decode signals P-P in a one-hot mode. However, in a string mode, a string decoder - may activate one to eight pre-decode signals P-P depending upon a particular input value IN. Similarly, string decoder - may activate one of pre-decode signals P-P in a one-hot mode, and activate one to eight pre-decode signals P-P in a string hot mode depending upon a particular input value IN. In the same general fashion, string decoder - may activate one, to one to eight of pre-decode signals P-P, according to a mode.","A higher order compare circuit - may compare predetermined higher order pre-decode signals (in this case P-P) and provide such comparison results to lower order compare circuits (- and -). In one particular approach, a higher order compare circuit - may receive multiple pre-decode signals and determine if one such pre-decode signal is active, or if multiple such pre-decode signals are active. In the very particular example of , higher order compare circuit - may receive two pre-decode signals. If one particular pre-decode signal is active and the other is not, one comparison result GTA may be activated. However, if both pre-decode signals are active, another comparison result EQA may be activated.","In the very particular example of , a higher order compare circuit - may include a first gate - that can generate one compare result GTA, and second gate - that can generate another compare result EQA. Of course, while  shows a gate - as an AND gate and gate - as an AND gate with an inverting input, alternative logic may be employed to generate a same or similar result. Accordingly, the particular logic gate arrangement for higher order compare circuit - in  should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto.","In , higher order compare result GTA can be conceptualized as a \u201cgreater than\u201d address result. Such a \u201cgreater than\u201d address result can indicate that an address corresponding to a collection of decoder output signals is greater than a received address value. Thus, all such decoder outputs can be activated in a second mode or deactivated in a first mode.","In contrast, higher order compare result EQA can be conceptualized as an \u201cequal to\u201d address result. Such an \u201cequal to\u201d address result can indicate that one of decoder output signals in a collection of decoder signals has an address equal to a received address. Thus, groups within such a collection of decoder signals may be selectively activated according to lower order pre-decode signals (e.g., P-P).","Lower order compare circuits - and - may compare predetermined lower other pre-decode signals (in this case P-P) and provide such comparison results to corresponding enable circuits - and -. Thus, in , lower order compare circuit - can provide compare results GTB and EQB to enable circuit -, while lower order compare circuit - provides compare results GTC and EQC to enable circuit -.","In a similar fashion to higher order compare circuit -, in a very particular approach, lower order compare circuits (- and -) can receive multiple pre-decode signals and determine if one such pre-decode signal is active, or if multiple such pre-decode signals are active. In the very particular example of , lower order compare circuits (- and -) can receive two pre-decode signals. If one particular pre-decode signal is active and the other is not, one comparison result (GTB or GTC) may be activated. However, if both pre-decode signals are active, another comparison result (EQB or EQC) may be activated.","The operation of lower order compare circuits (- and -) may be affected by a higher order compare circuit -. In particular, lower order compare circuits (- and -) may be enabled according to one comparison result from a higher order compare circuit -. Further, a lower order compare circuit (- and -) result may be controlled by another comparison result from a higher order compare circuit -. For example, in , lower order compare circuits (- and -) may be enabled when compare result EQA from higher order compare circuit - is active. Further, lower order compare circuit (- and -) may result in GTB and GTC being forced active when compare result GTA from higher order compare circuit - is active.","In , one example of a lower order compare circuit - is shown in detail. Such a lower order compare circuit - may include a third gate - that can generate an initial compare result GTB\u2032, and a fourth gate - that can generate another compare result EQB. A lower order compare circuit - may also include a combining gate -, that can logically combine an initial compare result GTB\u2032 with a higher order compare result GTA, to thereby generate a compare result GTB. Of course, while  shows particular gate arrangements for lower order compare circuit -, alternative logic may be employed to generate a same or similar result. Accordingly, the particular logic gate arrangement for lower order compare circuit - in  should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto.","In , lower order compare results (GTB and GTC) can also be conceptualized as a \u201cgreater than\u201d address result. Such a \u201cgreater than\u201d address result can indicate that an address corresponding to a group of decoder output signals is greater than a received address value. Thus, all such decoder outputs can be activated or deactivated. For example, if compare result GTB is active, decoder output signal group DEC-DEC can be activated. Similarly, if compare result GTC is active, decoder output signal group DEC-DEC can be activated.","Lower order compare results (EQB and EQC) can be conceptualized as \u201cequal to\u201d address results. Such \u201cequal to\u201d address results can indicate that one of the decoder output signals in a corresponding group has an address equal to a received address. Thus, groups within such a collection of decoder signals may be selectively activated according to lower order pre-decode signals (e.g., P-P).","The very particular example of  shows an enable circuit - that can include a first set of logic gates - and a second set of logic gates -. A first set of logic gates - can logically combine each lowest order pre-decode signal P-P with one lower order compare result EQB. In particular, if compare result EQB is active (high in this example), outputs of logic gates - can follow received pre-decode signal P-P values. However, if compare result EQB is inactive (low in this example), outputs of logic gates - can be forced to predetermined values (e.g., all low).","A second set of logic gates - can logically combine each output from the first set of logic gates with another lower order compare result GTB. In particular, if lower order compare result GTB is inactive (low in this example), outputs of logic gates - can follow those of logic gates -. However, if lower order compare result GTB is active (high in this example), outputs of logic gates - can be forced to predetermined values (e.g., all high).","Having described the general structure of a second embodiment, the operation of the second embodiment will now be described with reference to  to C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A","FIGS. 4A","FIGS. 4A"],"b":["4","3","4","402","0","402","2","404","0","406","1","406","4","408","1","408","4","4","0","23","72","103"]},"Unlike ,  show a particular CAM application for a decoder circuit. Thus, decoder output signals DEC to DEC can be provided to CAM entries ENTRY to ENTRY.","It is understood that in the example illustrated, in a search operation, CAM entries (ENTRY to ENTRY) may each compare a stored data value to an applied search key value KEY. In response to such a comparison result, a CAM entry may generate a corresponding match indication (M to M). Still further, in a search operation, a CAM entry may be enabled according to a corresponding decoder input signal DEC to DEC. In contrast, in a read or write operation, a selected CAM entry (ENTRY to ENTRY) may receive or output a data value. Such a CAM entry may be selected according to a corresponding decoder input signal DEC to DEC.","In the examples of  to C, it will be assumed that entries can be enabled when a corresponding decoder output is active and disabled when a corresponding decoder output is inactive. Further, in  to C, a disabled entry may be represented by hatching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["4","0","2","2","23","16","16","1","15","8","15","8","8","0","7","0","7","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["2","4","1","15","8","10","8","0","7","0","3","0"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["2","1","0","4","23","16","17","15","8","11","7","0","4"]},"The operation shown in  will now be described.","Higher order compare circuit - may receive pre-decode signals P and P and compare such values.

That is, in an unrestricted search mode (e.g., all valid CAM entries active) a binary address of 000 000 000 can generate pre-decode signals of \u201c1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111\u201d thus providing a conventional CAM search function.","Having described various embodiments of decoder circuits that can include string decoders, various possible string decoder examples will now be described. It is understood that the below string decoders are but examples of various possible approaches to string decoding that would be understood by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the below examples should not necessarily be construed as limiting the invention thereto.","Referring now to , a block schematic diagram shows a string decoder, designated by the general reference character . A string decoder  may include a string decoder circuit , a one-hot decoder circuit , and a multiplexer (MUX) . A string decoder  may provide string type decoding as has been described above. A one-hot decoder circuit  may provide one-hot type decoding as also noted above. A MUX  may selectively output a result from a string decode circuit  or a one-hot decoder circuit  according to a mode signal EXPL.","Referring now to , a second example of a string decoder is shown in a block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character . A string decoder may include a mode controlled string decoder circuit , a conventional one-hot decoder circuit , and combining logic .","A mode controlled string decoder circuit  may provide string decode type outputs when a mode signal EXPL is active, and different type outputs when a mode signal is inactive. Such outputs can be combined within combining logic  with outputs from a one-hot decoder circuit  to generate desired pre-decode signals that vary according to mode.","Referring now to , one example of a mode controlled string decoder circuit is set forth in a block diagram and designated by the general reference character . A mode controlled string decoder circuit  may receive a number of inputs Ato A_, and in response thereto provide string outputs SD to SD.","The very particular example of  includes a decode section  and a mode set section . A mode set section  may receive inputs A_ to A_ and provide mode controlled values A\u2032 to A\u2032 to a decode section . Mode controlled values A\u2032 to A\u2032 may follow received inputs A_ to Ain string decode mode (e.g., mode signal EXPL high). Alternatively, mode controlled inputs A\u2032 to A\u2032 may be set to predetermined values in a conventional decode mode (e.g., mode signal EXPL high).","In the particular example of , a mode set section  may include NAND gates G to G that each have one input that receives a mode control signal. Gates G, G and G may receive input values A_, Aand A_, respectively, as another input. The outputs of gates G, G and G can provide mode controlled values A\u2032 to A\u2032. Thus, when mode signal EXPL is low, mode controlled values A\u2032 to A\u2032 may all be forced high. However, when mode signal EXPL is high, mode controlled values A\u2032 to A\u2032 may be the inverse of received inputs A_ to A_, respectively.","Decode section  may provide string outputs SD to SD. In the very particular example of , a decode section  may include an inverter INV that can invert a mode signal EXPL to generate string output SD. A NOR gate G may receive mode controlled values A\u2032 and A\u2032 as inputs. A NAND gate G may also receive mode controlled values A\u2032 and A\u2032 as inputs. An inverter INV can invert mode controlled value A\u2032, while an inverter INV can invert mode controlled value A\u2032.","Decode section  may also include a number of gate for providing string outputs. In particular, decode section  may include a NOR gate G having one input connected to the output of NAND gate G and another input connected to the output of inverter INV. The output of NOR gate G can be string output SD. Two more NOR gates can provide string outputs SD and SD. In particular, a NOR gate G can have one input connected to the output of inverter INV and another input connected to the output of inverter INV. The output of NOR gate G can be string decode output SD. A NOR gate G can have one input connected to the output of NOR gate G and another input connected to the output of inverter INV. The output of NOR gate G can be string decode output SD.","In the very particular decode section of , a mode controlled value A\u2032 can be provided as string output SD. Further, three NAND gates G-G can provide string outputs SD to SD. In particular, NAND gates G-G may all have one input connected to the output of inverter INV. Further, NAND gate G may have another input connected to the output of NAND gate G and provide string output SD, NAND gate G may have another input connected to the output of inverter INV and provide string output SD, and NAND gate G may have another input connected to the output of NOR gate G and provide string output SD.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["700","7"]},"Referring now to , one example of a one-hot decoder circuit is set forth in a schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character . A one-hot decoder circuit  may receive a number of inputs A_ to A_, and in response thereto provide one-hot outputs CD to CD.","In the very particular example of , a one-hot decoder  may include inverters INV to INV for generating inverses of the various inputs A_ to A_. Logic gates G to G can logically combine different combinations of inputs A_ to A_ (and their inverses) to provide one-hot outputs CD to CD.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":["800","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 7A","FIG. 8A"],"b":["802","800","0","7","802","19","26","19","7","7","20","26","6","0","6","0","19","26","0","7"]},"It follows from , that resulting pre-decode signals P-P may the same response shown in FIG. .","Of course one skilled in the art could arrive at alternate logic implementations for string decoder circuits, one-hot decoder circuits, and\/or combining logic. Further, the term logic gate is not intended to exclude logic based on enabling and disabling passgates, or other such logic approaches.","Referring now to , a semiconductor device according to an embodiment is set forth in plan view and designated by the general reference character .
