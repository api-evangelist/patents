{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","REFERENCE REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","SEQUENTIAL LISTING","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY"],"p":["Not applicable","Not applicable","Not applicable","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates to content distribution by publishers or end-users to service providers and, more particularly, to automated content distribution to multiple service providers through a single user interface.","2. Background of the Disclosure","Publishers, such as, bloggers, writers, website owners and developers, business owners, or other creators or distributors of content are constantly looking for ways to increase traffic to their content and drive more users to purchase or consume their products or services. Such content may be hosted on the publisher's website, for example, and may include a piece of information such as a URL, notes, status update, blog post, article, document, image, video, or other media. It is well known and documented extensively that backlinks, e.g., hyperlinks or referrals to the publisher's content, are the root driver for the amount of traffic directed to a website and are crucial for optimal search engine placement and click-through to the website. For this reason, publishers trying to drive traffic to their websites spend a great deal of time distributing the content using a manual re-keying process to submit content to each of a plurality of target services or service providers, e.g., social or business networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., bookmark aggregation services such as Del.icio.us, email providers, instant message services, blogs, websites, and other community or information portals where publishers submit content. This manual re-keying process is time consuming, costly, and inefficient.","Another well-known method to increase traffic and backlinks to a website is to provide website visitors the ability to bookmark and share the content with their friends and co-workers. This method of bookmarking and sharing typically involves providing a hyperlink to an end-user that they may email or bookmark to a single service, e.g., a social network or email address. Publishers can build their own website button or tool to provide their end-users with this bookmarking and sharing feature. However, as with the submission of content by a publisher to multiple service providers, prior bookmarking and sharing buttons or tools only allow a user to submit content to a single service at a time and require the user to manually re-key the content submission for each of a plurality of target services.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method of submitting content on behalf of a client to multiple service providers includes the steps of receiving a request from a client to submit content to a plurality of service providers and retrieving client login information necessary to submit the content to the plurality of service providers and logging on to the service providers using the client login information, if necessary. The method also includes the steps of identifying service providers that include a human verification request before submitting the content, developing a queue of the human verification requests, and dispatching the human verification requests to one or more processing consoles. The one or more processing consoles are utilized by operators who do not have knowledge of the underlying content submission request. The method further includes the steps of submitting responses to the human verification requests through a processing console without additional input from the client and submitting the content to the plurality of service providers through a client device. The responses are routed through the client device to the service providers to submit the responses and the steps of processing, retrieving, logging on, identifying, developing, and submitting the responses and the content are performed automatically by the server after the request is received without additional input from the client.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a system for submitting content on behalf of a client to multiple service providers includes a server that receives a request from a client to submit content to a plurality of service providers and retrieves client login information necessary to submit the content to the plurality of service providers. The server also logs on to the service providers using the client login information, if necessary. In addition, the server identifies serevice providers that include a human verification request before submitting the content, develops a queue of the human verfication requests, and dispatches the human verfication requests to one or more processing consoles. The server further submits responses to the human verification requests through a processing console without additional input from the client and submits the content to the plurality of service providers through a client device. The processing consoles are used by operators who do not have knowledge of the underlying content submission request and no additional input from the client is required to submit the content after the request is received.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for submitting content to multiple service providers includes a non-transitory computer readable medium in which is stored a computer executable program. The computer executable program includes a first routine that submits a request to a server to submit content to a plurality of service providers and a second routine that receives login information from the server. The computer executable program also includes a third routine that identifies service providers that include a human verification request before submitting the content and a fourth routine that develops a queue of the human verification requests. In addition, the computer executable program includes a fifth routine that dispatches the human verification requests from the queue of human verification requests to one or more processing consoles, which are utilized by operators who do not have knowledge of the underlying content submission request, and a sixth routing that submits responses to the human verification request through a processing console without additional input from the client. The responses are routed through the client device to the service providers to submit the responses. Further, the computer executable program includes a seventh routine that routes the login information and the content to each of service providers via a client device, wherein the content routed to the service provider is formatted in accordance with the service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","20"]},"Referring to , the system  according to one embodiment is a distributed hardware and software application network that includes a central server , client devices , content distribution tools , service providers , and one or more processing consoles . The server  can be any suitable combination of hardware, e.g., a computer with processors, memory, network connections, etc., and software stored on the server or otherwise executable by the server, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill. The various components of the system  are configured to communicate to each other through any suitable wired or wireless network, such as, the Internet. Modifications to the system  can be made without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure, e.g., the central server and the processing console can be combined into a single unit and\/or the content distribution tools need not be integrated into the client devices.","In use, a client, e.g., publishers and end-users, submits a request to distribute content through a content distribution tool  associated with a client device  or the server . Examples of client devices  include, for example, a PC or Mac computer or a mobile device. The content distribution tool  provides the client with one-click content submission capabilities and is responsible for communication between the server , the client device , and the service providers . In one embodiment, the content distribution tools  include a software application installed onto or otherwise executable through the client device . In , some specific examples of content distribution tools  include an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) A, a web browser plugin B, a bookmark and share button C, and a smartphone application D. The request submitted by the client is routed to the server , which processes the request and routes the submitted content through the client device  to submit the content to the service providers  without a separate re-keying process by the client for each of the service providers. In one embodiment, a visual indicator on the client device , e.g., in the client's web browser, informs the client that the content distribution tools  are communicating with the service providers . There are numerous reasons for this client-server model, such as, to ensure that all content publishing requests originate from the actual user who performed the submission. This reduces potential liability on the part of the owners and operators of the server  who did not create the original content. Another reason for the client-server model is to spread out the content submissions among multiple geographic locations, thus spreading out the risk of denial by the service providers .","Referring more specifically to , a client submits the request to distribute content to the server via one or more content distribution tools  based on the client's technical capabilities and preferences. In one embodiment, the content distribution tools  are installed onto at least one client device  that is located within the same physical network that the client utilizes to submit the request. The content distribution tools  may be written in any programming language and can exist as a standalone application or as a web browser plugin, e.g., the plugin B of . One of the benefits of utilizing the web browser plugin B is the ability for plugins to utilize pre-existing network proxy servers that are typically employed in an enterprise IT environment. Such web browser plugins B can be made available for a number of different browsers, e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer.","The bookmark & share button C is another content distribution tool  that can be placed on a client's web pages to provide end-users of the website with the same multi-submission features that the publisher uses to submit content. For example, an end-user can use the bookmark & share button C to share the content with multiple services, e.g., social and professional networking sites and emails of their friends or co-workers, in a simultaneous and automated fashion. Providing this functionality to end-users has an exponential impact on the number of backlinks provided to the client's website. The bookmark and share button C can be configured to function with any type of webpage as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill.","The API A allows clients to submit a request to distribute content to the server directly by transmitting a formatted HTTP query to the server. Such a formatted HTTP query can generally take on the form: http:\/\/serveraddress.com\/api\/add&url_address&title, wherein the query includes an address for the server , a website for the content, and a title of the content. However, the HTTP query can take on other forms and include more or less information, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. HTTP authentication with a username\/password may be required when submitting requests via the API A. In other embodiments, different data transfer formats, such as, JSON and XML, can be used without departing from spirit of the present disclosure.","The mobile device or smartphone application D is a mobile version of the content distribution tool  that is configured to run on smartphone devices, e.g., the iPhone and Android devices. The smartphone application D provides clients with the ability to submit content, manage postings, and analyze performance all from a mobile device. The smartphone application D performs the same routing of communications between the server  and the target services  as described above. From the perspective of the server , the publisher's mobile device looks just like any other client device  that can be utilized for the routing of content distribution requests.","Referring now to the processing console , many service providers  employ a human verification mechanism, e.g., Captcha, before the content can be submitted. Typical human verification mechanisms limit automation of the content submission process by requiring a user to enter an onscreen password before the submission of the content is accepted. The password can be a series of any characters that is designed to be unreadable by a computer. The processing console  provides a mechanism to submit the necessary passwords without requiring further input from the client, as will be described in more detail hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["40","20","28","40","42","22","28","20","22","28","22","22","30","22"]},"Next, at a block , the client installs any necessary software onto their client device  to support the content distribution tools  described hereinabove. The software can be accessible via the same website through which the client created the account. As discussed previously, such software may include a browser plugin B or a bookmark & share button C, for example. In one embodiment, the client can customize the appearance of the plugin B and the button C, as would be apparent to one of skill in the art.","After the client has created an account and has installed any necessary content distribution tools , the client is ready to submit a request to distribute content to one or more service providers . At a block , the client submits such request using any of the content distribution tools  described herein. The server  processes the request and submits the content to the target service providers  on behalf of the client at a block . In the present embodiment, the server  processes the request to identify the service providers  and any client login information necessary to submit the content to the service providers . The server  can also identify any human verification requests required to submit the content and submit responses to such requests, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. In the present embodiment, the server  routes the content through the client device  to the target service providers , enters the necessary client login information, and responds to any human verification requests to submit the content to the service providers. If no client login information and\/or human verification requests are required, then the server can merely route the content to the service providers, as would be apparent to one of skill in the art. The hardware and\/or software components of the server  can be configured to perform some or all of the steps of processing the request, identifying service providers, identifying and retrieving login information, identifying human verification requests, routing content through the client device, entering client login information, and responding to human verification requests, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill.","Next, control passes to a block  and the server  notifies the client via the content distribution tools , email, instant message, invoices, etc. when the submission process is complete and if there were any failures and what caused those failures, e.g., incorrect login information and\/or incompatible content. The block  may also report additional information to the client, e.g., a number of overall submissions, activity levels of sub-accounts within a publisher, pass\/fail statics, human verification requests performed, and analytics to monitor and track performance of the content submissions. Such analytics may include a number of backlinks that were created and how much increase in traffic is produced directly or indirectly from the submissions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["60","60","30","60","20","62","22","64","30","66","28","26","24","30","28","24","24"]},"The present disclosure provides publishers with the ability to submit content, e.g., web pages, articles, documents, status updates, and other forms of digital content, to multiple service providers through a single user interface.","Numerous modifications to the present disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is presented for the purpose of enabling those skilled in the art to make and use the disclosure and to teach the best mode of carrying out the same.
