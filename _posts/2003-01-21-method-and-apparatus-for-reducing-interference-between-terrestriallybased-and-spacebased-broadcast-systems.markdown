Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems and methods for broadcasting information signals, and in particular to a system and method for reducing interference between independent terrestrially-based and space-based broadcasting systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","It has been proposed to cooperatively share the current Broadcasting-Satellite Service (BSS) frequency bands to allow additional programming material to be transmitted to subscribers of other broadcast systems using the same frequency bands as currently used by BSS satellites. The other systems may be implemented through the use of non-geostationary orbit (GSO) and\/or terrestrially-based transmitters to transmit the additional programming. Such systems typically rely on spatial diversity to minimize the probability of interference. This usually requires a BSS satellite ground antenna having highly directional, monocular sensitivity characteristics in order to realize low interference levels.","Unfortunately, existing BSS antennae do not exhibit a highly directional sensitivity characteristic. Instead, as described in application Ser. No. 09\/480,089, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MITIGATING INTERFERENCE FROM TERRESTRIAL BROADCASTS SHARING THE SAME CHANNEL WITH SATELLITE BROADCASTS USING AN ANTENNA WITH POSTERIOR SIDELOBES,\u201d which application is hereby incorporated by reference, existing BSS antennae exhibit a sensitivity characteristic that includes substantial sensitivity in a rearward direction. They also exhibit sensitivity characteristics in the sideward and upward directions. This sensitivity can result in substantial interference between transmissions from BSS satellites and transmissions from non-GSO or terrestrial sources.","Solutions have been proposed to reduce interference, including those described in the related applications described above. However, even when using the methods described in the above-referenced patent applications, excessive interference with existing BSS system broadcasts may result.","Two-way communication systems has been proposed which would allow consumers to transmit narrowband interstitial return path signals within the 12.2\u201312.7 GHz frequency bands already used by digital broadcast service providers. However, these systems limit the interstitial transmission to reverse link transmissions (from subscribers to terrestrially based antennae). One of the reasons that such systems have been limited in the past to reverse link transmissions is because it has been assumed that the limited bandwidth available on the interstitial signals is suitable only for low data rate transmissions.","Interstitial return link transmissions are typically made possible by the use of high-directivity ground antennae at the subscriber's location. Such antennae make it feasible for each subscriber antenna to direct energy in a narrow beam to the terrestrial antenna, thereby spatial diversity can be used to minimize transmission interference. However, it is not economically feasible for the terrestrial antenna to direct an individual beam to each subscriber. Hence, such methods are generally inapplicable to forward link communications.","What is needed is a further method for isolating current BSS transmissions from proposed forward link transmissions from terrestrially based transmitters. The present invention satisfies that need at least in part by taking advantage of the spatial diversity provided by multiple and spot-beam capable broadcast satellites, and the use of spatial and polarization diversity to minimize interference while maximizing forward path transmission bandwidth.","To address the requirements described above, the present invention discloses a system and method for reducing interference between terrestrially-based and space-based communications systems. The system comprises a first communications system having a plurality of substantially geosynchronous satellites broadcasting a first set of information signals to a first plurality of terrestrial receiver stations and a second communications system having a plurality of terrestrially-based transmitters transmitting a second set of information signals to a second plurality of terrestrially-based terrestrial receiver stations, wherein the first set of information signals each have independent content from and are spatially diverse from the second set of information signals. The first set of information signals are broadcast via one or more of a first plurality of broadcast bands having guard bands therebetween, and the second set of information signals are broadcast on one or more of a second plurality of broadcast bands, each of the second plurality of broadcast bands associated with and substantially spanning one of the first information signal bands.","The method comprises the steps of broadcasting the first set of information signals via one or more of a first plurality of broadcast bands having guard bands therebetween having substantially no information signal; and broadcasting the second set of information signals via one or more of a second plurality of broadcast bands, each of the second plurality of broadcast bands associated with and substantially spanning one of the first information signal guard bands.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","114","132","132"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"132) at a plurality of receiver stations A and B (hereinafter alternatively referred to as receiver station(s) ) via a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other link . The control center  provides one or more of the first set of information signals to the uplink center , and coordinates with the receiver station(s)  to offer subscribers  pay-per-view (PPV) program services, including billing and associated decryption of video programs."}}}},"The uplink center  receives data and\/or program control information from the control center , and using an uplink antenna , transmits a first set of information signals via a first set of broadcast bands having guard bands therebetween to one or more satellites A and B (hereinafter alternatively referred to as satellite(s) ). The satellite(s)  receive and process this information, and transmit the data received from the uplink center  to the IRD(s)  at the receiver station(s)  via downlinks A and B (hereinafter alternatively referred to as downlink(s) ). The IRD(s)  receive this information using the subscriber antennae A and B (hereinafter alternatively referred to as subscriber antenna(e) ), to which each of the IRD(s)  are communicatively coupled.","As shown in , satellite A includes a first (odd) transponder bank A, which includes a plurality of transponders T, T, T, and T. Also, satellite B includes a second (even) transponder bank B, which includes a second plurality of transponders T, T, and T. The transponders T\u2013T each accept a signal from the uplink center  and retransmit (e.g. broadcast) the received signal to the receiver stations .","The transponders T\u2013T typically implement a \u201cbent-pipe\u201d communication system. That is, transponders T\u2013T typically receive and downconvert the signal from the uplink frequency to a downlink frequency, and retransmit that downconverted signal to the receiver stations . In one embodiment, the uplink signals are downconverted from the 17.3\u201317.8 GHz frequency band to the 12.2\u201312.7 GHz frequency band. Non-bent-pipe communication systems can also be used. For example, if desired, the satellites  may include modules for demodulating the uplink signal and remodulating the demodulated uplink signal to generate the downlink signal. Additional processing can also be performed using the received signal.","In one embodiment, the satellites A and B are disposed in a substantially geosynchronous (GEO) or geostationary (GSO) orbit. That is, the satellites are deployed so that their apparent position in the sky, when viewed by the receiver stations  either remains in one place does not move beyond the effective beamwidth of the receiving antenna .","The plurality of satellites A and B can be used to provide wider terrestrial coverage, to provide additional channels, or to provide additional bandwidth per channel to subscribers. Although six transponders (T\u2013T) are shown, a greater or lesser number of transponders may be used. In one embodiment of the invention, each of the satellite(s)  comprise 16 transponders to receive and transmit program material and other control data from the uplink center  and provide it to the subscribers . However, the transmission capacity of each transponder T\u2013T can be increased using advanced modulation and coding, data compression, and multiplexing techniques. For example, two-satellites  working together can receive and broadcast over 150 conventional (non-HDTV) audio and video channels via  transponders.","The uplink station  can transmit the same uplink information to both satellites A and B, or different information (e.g. only the information that is retransmitted by the satellite ) to each satellite . This can be accomplished using spatial diversity (e.g. a directional antenna  which is directed only at the selected satellite (A or B, but not both) and additional uplink stations , if desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","7"]},"Each transponder T\u2013T transmits in an assigned broadcast band ()\u2013(). The broadcast bands ()\u2013() (hereinafter alternatively referred to as broadcast band(s) ) are separated from adjacent broadcast bands by guard bands (\u2013)\u2013(\u2013) (hereinafter alternatively referred to as broadcast band(s) ). For example, broadcast bands () and () (used by transponders T and T, respectively) are separated by guard band (\u2013). The guard bands (\u2013)\u2013(\u2013) prevent signals from the broadcast bands ()\u2013() from interfering with one another. The width of the guard bands (\u2013)\u2013(\u2013) is selected to provide adequate isolation between broadcast bands ()\u2013() to prevent unacceptable interference. This is typically a function of the technique used to modulate the signal on broadcast bands ()\u2013(), the quality of the transponders T\u2013T and receiver stations , as well as other factors. In one embodiment, the broadcast bands are 24 MHz wide, whereas the guard bands are 5.16 MHz wide.","In the illustrated example, guard bands for the odd transponders T, T, T, and T are centered at the center of the broadcast bands for the even transponders T, T, and T. Hence, guard band (\u2013) is centered at the center of broadcast band (), guard band B(\u2013) is centered at the center of broadcast band () and so on.","It is noted that in the spectrum shown in , each of the broadcast bands ()\u2013() share a portion of a frequency spectrum with another of the broadcast bands ()\u2013(). For example, broadcast band () shares a spectrum band  with broadcast band (). With such a system, techniques are employed to prevent interference between the broadcast bands. This can be accomplished by via selection of appropriate modulation or multiplexing techniques, spatial diversity, and polarization diversity, or a combination of such techniques. For example, if antenna B is directed at satellite B and is sufficiently directional to exclude significant energy from the first satellite A, broadcast band (), used by transponder T on satellite A, will not interfere with broadcast band (), which is used by transponder T on satellite B. In another embodiment broadcast bands ()\u2013() can be distinguished from one another via polarization or modulation technique (e.g. QPSK, 8PSK, CDMA).","In one embodiment, the center frequency of the broadcast band for transponder T is 12.224 GHz and the guard band between adjacent transponders is 5.16 MHz.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","100","320","320","302","302","302","310","306","308","308","320"]},"Spatial diversity can be used to reduce interference between the first communication system  and the second communications system . This is accomplished by selecting the transmission characteristic A and B of the transmitter(s)  to direct the second set of information signals in a direction away from the sensitive axis of first communication system subscriber antennae  and in a direction towards the sensitive axis of the second communication system subscriber antennae  sensitive axis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["100","320","112","112","112","302","320","306","306","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["202","1","202","3","202","5","202","7","320","1","320","4","320","320","1","320","4","100","202","1","202","3","202","5","202","7","1","3","5","7","202","2","202","4","202","6","320","1","320","4"]},"The second plurality of broadcast bands of the second communications system  correspond to the odd numbered transponders of the first communications system . That is, the first broadcast band () (e.g. channel ) would completely overlap broadcast band () (24 MHz total bandwidth). Although spatial diversity can somewhat ameliorate the problem, if the polarization of the second communications system  were linear and the polarization of channels one and two of the first communications system  were left and right circularly polarized, respectively, channel one of the second communications system  may introduce interference into both channel one and channel two of the first communications system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["202","1","202","7","502","1","502","8","502","1","502","8","502","504","1","2","504","2","3","504","3","4","504","4","5","504","5","6","504","6","7","504","7","8","504","8","9","504","502","1","2","502","1","502","2","502","2","3","502","2","502","3"]},"Band-assignment parameters (e.g. number, distribution, and bandwidth of broadcast bands as well as the number, distribution, and bandwidth of the guard bands) can be chosen to minimize disruption of the data transmission and interference objectives of the first communications system  while simultaneously providing for data communications using the second communications system . In one embodiment, the bandwidth of the broadcast bands of the second communication system  is selected as substantially the same bandwidth as the guard bands of the first communication system , and the number and distribution of the broadcast bands of the second communications system  are selected to coincide with the guard bands of the first communications system . Preferably, at least one of the broadcast bands  of the second communications system  substantially span the associated guard band  of the first communications system . In one exemplary embodiment, the guard bands  of the first communications system  and the broadcast bands  of the second communications system  are both 5 MHz wide, and centered at the same frequencies. The frequency overlap between the second broadcast band () of the second communications system  and the first broadcast band () (transponder T) of the first communications system  is 5 MHz. In this situation, the overlap between the broadcast band () and () is 5 MHz\/24 MHz or 0.208 (or about \u22126.8 dB). Hence, if the power per Hz first communications system broadcast band () and the second communications system broadcast bands () are equal, the power of the signal from the second communications system  (broadcast using broadcast band ()) within the first communication system broadcast band () is about 6.8 dB less than that of the signal from the first communication system . Further, since second communication system broadcast bands () and () are within the guard bands (e.g. (\u2013) and (\u2013), the interference contribution from the channels using broadcast bands () and () will be much smaller than the contribution from channels using broadcast band ().","A reduction of \u22126.8 dB is significant, and has the effect of reducing the distance at which any specified interference threshold is found by more than one half. For example, if it is found that the threshold for harmful interference from the second communications system  on the first communications system  is at a distance of 4 kilometers from the transmission source  of the second communications system , the foregoing technique would reduce this distance to approximately \n\n\nthus permitting service to more customers and\/or reducing interference in existing broadcast satellite services. Similarly, the level of separation may be maintained, yet interference with the first communication system  reduced accordingly.\n","The bandwidth of the broadcast bands  of the second communications system  can be selected to be greater or less than that of the guard bands  of the first communications system . All other things equal, increasing the bandwidth of the broadcast bands  relative to the width of the guard bands  will increase interference between the first communications system  and the second communications system , and decreasing the bandwidth of the broadcast bands  relative to the width of the guard bands  will decrease interference, but will also reduce data throughput in the second communications system  channels. It should also be noted that while the frequency bands are presented with infinite rising and declining slopes (e.g. as if implemented with infinite pole filters), the actual delineation between broadcast bands and guard bands is not typically as well-defined, but rather, defined in terms of thresholded amplitude (e.g. a broadcast band may be defined as the band in which the signal magnitude exceeds \u221220 dB or other value from the amplitude at the center of the broadcast band). Indeed, one of the reasons for using the guard bands  of the first communication system  between broadcast bands  is to account for this characteristic and assure that there is adequate separation between broadcast bands so as to minimize interference. Hence, the phrase \u201csubstantially span\u201d as it is used above, refers to a relationship between the bandwidth and center frequency of each of the broadcast band(s)  of the second communications system  to the bandwidth and center frequency of the related guard bands  of the first communications system  such that the transmission capacity of the second communications system  on such broadcast bands  meets design objectives, while also minimizing interference to the broadcast bands  of the first communication system  to an acceptable degree. Thus, the bandwidth of the broadcast bands  of the second communications system  may be less than that of the bandwidth of the guard bands  of the first communication system  (e.g. to account for the non-ideal behavior described above), or may be greater than the bandwidth of the guard bands  of the first communication system (e.g. allowing some frequency overlap-induced interference that can be either accepted or ameliorated by other techniques, including spatial diversity, polarization diversity, or modulation techniques).","The data transmission capacity of the second communications system  can be selected to maximize data throughput and minimize interference. For example, if the channel allocation for the second communication system  shown in  included 16 channels with 24 MHz bandwidth and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, it could achieve a payload data rate of approximately 30.3 Mbits\/sec. With a 6\/7 code rate, a total payload data rate would be approximately 16\u00d730.3 Mbits\/sec=48.4 Mbits\/sec. However, if the channel allocation shown in  is used instead, the data rate (assuming the same modulation technique and code rate) would be approximately 30.3*(5\/24)=6.3 Mbits\/sec per channel. Using 34 channels would provide a total payload data rate of approximately 6.3\u00d734=214.2 Mbits\/sec. This is about 44% of the total payload data rate that is obtainable with the system shown in .","However, the data throughput of the second communication system  can be improved through judicious choice of channel center frequency and bandwidth allocation, in order to account for different modulation techniques and\/or signal characteristics between the first communication system  and the second communications system . Further, the modulation and\/or coding of the signal from the second communications system  and the first communications system  can be selected to further minimize interference and\/or provide additional data throughput. For example, a data rate of about 38 Mbits\/sec could be realized using the same carrier to noise (C\/N) ratio needed for QPSK 6\/7 modulation and coding. Hence, a channel on a 5 MHz bandwidth broadcast band of the second communication system  could have a payload data rate of about 38*(5\/24)=7.9 Mbits\/sec, thus providing about 268.6 Mbits\/sec on 34 channels. This is approximately 55% of the total payload rate that is obtainable with the system shown in .","Further techniques can be employed to maximize the data transmission capacity of the second communications system , including, for example, turbo-coding techniques. Such techniques are described in C. Berrou, A. Glavieux, and P. Thitimajshima, \u201cNear Shannon limit error-correcting coding and decoding: Turbo-codes(1),\u201d, in Proc. ICC'93, Geneva, Switzerland, May 1993, pp. 1064\u20131070\u201d, which is hereby incorporated in reference.","Although the foregoing has been described with respect to an embodiment in which the program material delivered to the subscriber is video (and audio) program material such as a movie, the foregoing method can be used to deliver program material comprising purely audio information or data as well.","Also, the present invention can be used to prevent communication interference between existing satellite subscription services and other services that use space-based (e.g. Middle Earth Orbit or Lower Earth Orbit), or suborbital (e.g. atmospherically based) subscription services.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
