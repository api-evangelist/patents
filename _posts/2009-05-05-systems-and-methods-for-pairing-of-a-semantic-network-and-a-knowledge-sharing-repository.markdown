title: Systems and methods for pairing of a semantic network and a knowledge sharing repository
abstract: Systems and methods for facilitating pairing of semantic networks with knowledge sharing repositories, such as wikis, are described. Information from a semantic network may be transferred to a knowledge sharing repository, and either automatically or manually updated based on changes in the semantic network information. Likewise, information in a knowledge sharing repository may be transferred to a semantic network and automatically or manually updated based in changes in the knowledge sharing repository.

No. 61\/050,588, entitled THE PAIRING OF A SEMANTIC NETWORK AND A KNOWLEDGE SHARING REPOSITORY, filed on May 5, 2008, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.","This application is also related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/115,543, entitled THE PAIRING OF A SEMANTIC NETWORK AND A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING INFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEM, filed on Nov. 18, 2009, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.","The present invention relates generally to semantic networks and generation, analysis and updating of such networks. More particularly but not exclusively, the invention relates to systems and methods for facilitating communication and transfer to and among a group of collaborating users of networks of knowledge, such as in a \u201cwiki,\u201d in a semi-structured way through a knowledge sharing repository.","A traditional semantic network is a formal structure for embodying or representing knowledge. It is designed to impose a rigorous structure upon knowledge so that an artificial intelligence computer program or expert system can operate on and reason from and with the knowledge. It is also used to embody the new knowledge resulting from the reasoning of such systems.","A traditional semantic network constrains how knowledge can be captured and organized so that it fits with the reasoning system's needs for reasoning, while still maintaining enough flexibility to handle variations in kinds of expert knowledge that needs to be reasoned with and about.","Most prior uses of semantic networks in computer software applications have been focused on managing information for the use of expert systems or other artificially intelligent programs. Experts setting about the task of entering their knowledge into such a traditional system are required to learn constrained methods for expressing what they know in a form that the expert system can use and reason with. Consequently, the methods used to operate on these traditional semantic networks have been tailored for the needs of the systems using the knowledge, and lack flexibility.","The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for pairing a semantic network with a knowledge sharing repository so as to update information in the semantic network based on information in the knowledge sharing repository, or vice-versa.","In one aspect, the present invention relates to a computer implemented method of sharing information between a semantic network stored in a memory on a first computer system and a knowledge sharing repository comprising generating, on the first computer system, a set of data based on information included in the semantic network, accessing, from the first computer system, the knowledge sharing repository and updating the knowledge sharing repository based at least in part on the set of data.","In another aspect, the present invention relates additionally to generating, on the first computer system, an additional set of data based on information included in the knowledge sharing repository and updating the semantic network based at least in part on the additional set of data.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a computer implemented method of sharing information between a semantic network stored in a memory of a first computer system and a knowledge sharing repository comprising accessing the knowledge sharing repository from the first computer system, retrieving, from the knowledge sharing repository, a set of data based on information included in the knowledge sharing repository and updating the semantic network based at least in part on the set of data.","In another aspect, the present invention additionally relates accessing the semantic network, retrieving, from the semantic network, an additional set of data based on information included in the semantic network and updating the knowledge sharing repository based at least in part on the additional set of data.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a computer implemented method of sharing information between a semantic network stored in a memory of a first computer system and a knowledge sharing repository comprising retrieving, from the semantic network, a set of data based on information included in the semantic network, accessing the knowledge sharing repository from the first computer system and transferring, from the first computer system, the set of data to a computer system hosting the knowledge sharing repository for incorporation into the knowledge sharing repository.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a computer readable medium including processor executable instructions for sharing information between a semantic network and a knowledge sharing repository, including instructions to generate, on a first computer system, a set of data based on information included in the semantic network, access, from the first computer system, the knowledge sharing repository and update the knowledge sharing repository based at least in part on the set of data.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a computer readable medium including processor executable instructions for sharing information between a semantic network and a knowledge sharing repository including instructions to access the knowledge sharing repository from the first computer system, retrieve, from the knowledge sharing repository, a set of data based on information included in the knowledge sharing repository and update the semantic network based at least in part on the set of data.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a computer readable medium including processor executable instructions for sharing information between a semantic network and a knowledge sharing repository including instructions to retrieve from the semantic network, a set of data based on information included in the semantic network, access the knowledge sharing repository from a first computer system and transfer, from the first computer system, the set of data to a computer system hosting the knowledge sharing repository for incorporation into the knowledge sharing repository.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a system for sharing information between a semantic network and a knowledge sharing repository comprising a processor, a memory coupled to the processor, wherein a semantic network is stored in the memory and a computer readable medium including processor executable instructions to access the semantic network, generate a set of data based on information included in the semantic network and update the knowledge sharing repository based at least in part on the set of data.","Various additional aspects of the present invention are further described below in conjunction with the appended drawings.","Various terminology is used herein to describe details of particular embodiments of the present invention. This terminology and associated definitions are used for purposes of explanation, not limitation. Accordingly, other terminology and definitions may also be used to represent the same or equivalent functionality as is described herein. In order to facilitate understanding of the terminology used herein, a summary of terms used herein and their associated definition is provided below:\n\n","A semantic network is a multi-dimensional web of ideas or things that are linked together in specific ways. Semantic networks have been historically used in fields such as artificial intelligence to aid in the organization and embodiment of expert knowledge to feed computer-automated deductive, problem solving or training applications.","A network editing and analysis tool is a computer software application for creating, modifying and exploring any network-like collection of links.","A knowledge sharing repository is any collection of user- or community-generated aggregations of information as web pages or in the form of a collection of entity-focused documents, pages or other electronic information. Knowledge sharing repositories are frequently referred to as, but are not limited to, so called \u201cwikis,\u201d such as may be found at the online site Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org). Other types of knowledge sharing repositories that have the same or similar key features that may be used by embodiments of the present invention may include blogs, social networking web sites or other similar or structurally equivalent sites or databases.","One primary aspect of the present invention relates to a specific approach to the creation, management and sharing of knowledge about a set of topics or entries by representing and manipulating them as both editable semantic network information and as editable pages or other data formats in a knowledge sharing repository. This aspect, which focuses on human experts, learners or peers capturing, managing and transferring network representations of knowledge in and among themselves through the pairing of a semantic network editing environment and a knowledge sharing repository, forms one basis of uniqueness and differentiation of the present invention from general wiki-editing or other knowledge repository management tools known in the art that are based on contributors manually editing individual pages as text, or through structured tools such as forms, spreadsheets and databases.","Attention is now directed to , which illustrates an example of a traditional semantic network . Semantic network  is an undirected, non-simple graph with labeled edges  and (possibly labeled) vertices . The vertices and edges may be interpreted individually or in combination to form one or more of the four fundamental semantic network constructs:\n\n","Every traditional semantic network is an assembly of these elements (vertices, edges, edge labels and entity types). Each one imposes rules about the ways in which vertices and edges are labeled or typed and about the ways in which reasoning is performed based on those labels or types.","The assignee of the present invention, Semantic Research, Inc., designs and develops tools for creating, editing and interacting with semantic networks. One provided product is Semantica\u00ae software, which supports a form of semantic network known as a Semantica\u00ae-style knowledge structure (also denoted herein as a \u201cknowledge structure\u201d for brevity).","A knowledge structure is an idealized and generalized structure for capturing knowledge. It is related in its most abstract form to the general description above of a traditional semantic network. However, in application, it is particularly appropriate for capturing data and information for human use that lacks explicit structure, that is difficult to impose a rigorous structure upon or that is tacit in nature (and hence not commonly or easily expressed in computer documents intended for direct comprehension by humans).","A knowledge structure provides extensive flexibility in how knowledge is captured and organized, while still maintaining an effective and unambiguous framework for qualitative, cognitive (human) interaction and quantitative, automated machine interaction, storage and retrieval. In this sense, a knowledge structure sits at an ideal midpoint between the abstract notion of how knowledge is composed and the forms in which knowledge is conventionally concretely organized in computer-based representations such as diagrams, word processing documents, spreadsheets, databases, and formal networks.","A knowledge structure may further extend the structure of a traditional semantic network by: a) promoting edges to the status of vertices or entities, often referred to as reifying the edges; b) promoting edge labels to the status of entity types, called relation types to distinguish them from other kinds of entity types; and\/or c) by promoting entity types to the status of vertices or entities, that is, by also reifying element types.","A knowledge structure may also be uniquely easy for humans to enter and organize compared with other more conventional representations. This ease of creation is particularly facilitated by allowing creation of individual edges without need for a context, and by providing great flexibility in the definition of edge labels and other entity types. This flexible editing may be instantly saved in a network database for shared access.","In various aspects, the present invention is focused on applying these constructs and techniques to two very different but related tasks:\n\n","As such, various embodiments of the present invention may be provided as a generalized tool for use on computer based systems to provide a variety of applications. This generalized tool may be incorporated directly into a network editing and analysis tool such as the Semantica\u00ae, software applications or other network editing and analysis tool. Alternately, embodiments of the present invention may comprise an \u201cadd on\u201d or \u201cplug-in\u201d application for incorporation into or operation in conjunction with a network editing and analysis tool. In yet other implementations, embodiments of the present invention may be in the form of a standalone application disposed the implement the functionality herein.","The present invention may be applied to a wide range of applications in different fields. These may include applications in a range of business processes, intelligence capture and analysis, as well as a wide variety of other applications. Specific applications to which the present invention may be applied include, but are not limited to: education and training; knowledge construction, management and transfer; bio-informatics; genealogy; law enforcement; insurance; intelligence; law; medicine; entertainment; other case-management fields; other fields involving sharing of knowledge; as well as other applications.","In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention may operate in conjunction with a specific form of semantic network denoted as a Semantica\u00ae-style knowledge structure (also denoted herein as a \u201cknowledge structure\u201d for brevity). Referring to , an example knowledge structure  is illustrated. knowledge structure  is, at base, a form of the structure shown in , i.e., an undirected, non-simple graph with labeled edges or links and vertices. However, knowledge structure  is made up of vertices and edges with additional structure imposed on them, as shown in .","These vertices and edges may be interpreted individually or in combination to form one or more of the fundamental knowledge structure constructs:\n\n","Knowledge Object , sometimes interpreted as a fifth fundamental construct depending on context, is a special case of an entity that encapsulates or points to a document such as a picture, a text note, the URL of a web page, or any other electronic document, allowing it to be linked to other entities. Examples of knowledge objects include the picture\/image  as shown in , and the various URLs to external web sites, and the various internal wiki-page links in the See Also section  and References sections  as shown in , and in the Sources  and External Links  sections as shown in . Every knowledge structure is an assembly of entities, relation types, triplets, element types and knowledge objects.","The methods and apparatus described herein depend upon the adaptation and generalization of the broadest features of a traditional semantic network described above to shift the focus of their application to support human reasoning and application in semi-structured and easily modifiable forms. These methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of business processes and other knowledge-related processes.","Similar tools as are known in the art are typically more limited because they enforce limited and pre-defined collections of elements on the underlying data. Most frequently, the set of possible relation types is very limited and frequently restricted to pre-defined fields in predefined data-entry forms, database tables or other highly-structured data formats.","As used herein, the term Concept (such as, for example, Concepts  as shown in ) describes each individual labeled vertex within a knowledge structure. In the most basic cases, the label is a locally unique identifier that each concept also has associated with it. These concepts represent individual objects, ideas or thoughts that have meaning. Since a knowledge structure is a non-simple graph, any two concepts within a knowledge structure may be connected by a common edge. In general these edges (known as triplets or instances of relation types as further described below) are graphically represented by lines on a two-dimensional plane or in a simulated three-dimensional space. However, the knowledge being represented has no physical dimensions per se and such dimensional representations are used purely as a medium for human visual perception and manipulation, and for publication on paper, computer screens, and web pages.","A Gap is a concept that has been marked to indicate that it is an unknown or unfilled-in value that is needed to specify this attribute's value.","The term Triplet (such as, for example, Triplet  as shown in ) is used to describe a link between two entities which has been labeled with a relation type. The two entities and the relation type are the three components that results in the terminology triplet. For example, Triplet  consists of a link connected between Concept  and Concept  and labeled RT. In a Semantica\u00ae-style knowledge structure, triplets contain two additional components; the element types of the two entities being linked.","The term Relation Type (such as, for example, relation types  as shown in ) is used to describe labels that are applied to triplets or links to categorize them and embody meaning represented by the link. An Anonymous Relation Type is a relation type that has been marked to indicate that the actual type of relationship is still unknown or unspecified and needs to be filled in at a later time when possible. In more sophisticated semantic networks, relation types form a type hierarchy, with each relation type having a super-type, and a predefined root for the most abstract of relation types. These are called \u201crelated\u201d in Semantica\u00ae software implementations.","The term Element Type (such as, for example, element type  as shown in ) is used to describe labels applied to entities to categorizing them and embody meaning about the kind of entity they represent. Associated with each element type is a separate network of linked, typed entities called a Semantica\u00ae-style knowledge structure Template (such as, for example, template  as shown in ) that includes links that are typically expected to be present in describing the details of entities of that type, although triplets connected to an entity of this element type are neither required to be among these Semantica\u00ae template links, nor limited to only these links.","In more sophisticated semantic networks, element types form a type hierarchy, with each element type having a super-type, and a predefined root for the most abstract of element types, called \u201cElement\u201d in Semantica\u00ae software implementations. Relation types are also element types, although this is not essential.","In a preferred embodiment, element types form a strict hierarchy, that is, only one parent element type for each element type; but elements are allowed to have any number of element types. Alternative embodiments that have been implemented include loosening to multiple parents for element types and limitation to single element types on elements. When the network editing tool supports only a strict hierarchy in its built-in element type structure but allows triplets that tie two element types together, as in the current preferred embodiment, a custom relation type such as \u201chas supertype\/has subtype\u201d may be used to store a non-hierarchical category structure to match a non-hierarchical ontology in the targeted knowledge sharing repository.","Together, the set of all element types and relation types, along with their possibly-re-entrant hierarchical structure and their templates and other appended information, constitute what is referred to as an Ontology for the semantic network. The ontology can be embodied entirely as a special case of a knowledge structure, but in a preferred embodiment it is implemented with more efficient specialized representations which can still be viewed as a network or knowledge structure.","Attention is now directed to , which illustrates an embodiment of a knowledge sharing repository  (also denoted herein as \u201crepository\u201d for brevity). As noted previously, knowledge sharing repository  may be any collection of user or community-generated aggregations of information stored on a computer system such as a server, Internet host computer system, proprietary system, or other computer system.","These aggregations are frequently presented in HTML form as web pages, but for the purposes of this invention may easily be presented via any of a variety of other methods that aggregate information about an entity together. The most well-known current form of knowledge sharing repository having the key features that may be used by this invention is frequently referred to as, but in no way limited to, a \u201cwild,\u201d which can be thought of as a user-editable online encyclopedia or information reference. Perhaps the most well known current wiki is Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia located at www.wikipedia.org.","Other kinds of knowledge sharing repositories that have the same or similar features include many types of blogs and social networking web sites which are commonly organized along the same concept, being collections of user-editable pages, each about an entity or topic, with enough structure to allow programmatic manipulation by embodiments of the present invention. Any of these alternate forms of knowledge sharing repositories may also be compatible with the present invention if they support the functionality and structure described herein.","Key features of a knowledge sharing repository upon which embodiments of the present invention may operate on and interact with include:","1. A Collection of Pages or Other Similar or Equivalent Data Structures\u2014This feature is a collection of pages, abstractly represented as  in , wherein each page is focused on a particular topic or entity. One specific example of such an entity-focused page is page  as shown in -. Page  is taken from Wikipedia, and focuses on the topic of \u201cWinchester Rifle.\u201d It is noted that page  is shown merely for purposes of explanation and example, and is not intended to be in any way limiting. It is also noted that the illustration of page  in -is shown over 8 pages in the drawings for clarity due to the size of this web page and quantity of associated content.","The following characteristics are typically stored for each entity page (or other data\/information structure in the knowledge sharing repository):","A Unique Label, Name or Other Designator\u2014A unique label and\/or name which can be used as unique identifiers, through a standard reference mechanism, to locate the page. In a preferred embodiment, the label and name for a particular entity are identical or can be easily derived from each other; however, other embodiments may allow duplicate names that are not derivable from the label or vice-versa. This concept is illustrated as label  in , which describes that the page and associated information is about the topic of Winchester Rifles.\n\n","Each category entity may have an optional Template page , which has a Template Infobox  containing the inherited attributes that the Infobox of entities labeled with that category can or should contain, for maximum benefit from use with this invention.","2. A Reference Mechanism\u2014This feature relates to one or more reference mechanisms, usable either manually or automatically by application programs, to access individual pages. Possible reference mechanisms for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, 1) a Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), 2) a communication method through a software and\/or hardware connection such as a named pipe or standard port or standard file location, and\/or other reference mechanisms as are known or developed in the art. Other proprietary or specialized methods are also possible, typically to the extent that as there is a unique label, name or other designator for each page that can be used to access it in some programmatic fashion.","3. Marking Methods\u2014This feature relates to marking methods that can be included in the body of unstructured or semi-structured text indicating that the text so marked should be considered an entity, and if a page for that entity exists should be used to link to that entity's page. These marking methods should generally include one which indicates a link to a known page and also one for indicating a \u201cgap\u201d that indicates that the actual entity to be linked to is currently unknown or not provided but needs to be provided at a later date.","4. User Editable Pages\u2014This feature relates to pages that are allowed to be edited by users, either manually by individuals or automatically by a program, or ideally by both. Where the page cannot be edited automatically by a program, embodiments of the present invention typically provide users with strings in their clipboard to help with manual editing. Where manual editing is not allowed, the transformations are done entirely automatically through a program and some, but not all, of the benefits of this invention may be unavailable. An example of this is shown in , which is a screen capture of the beginning of the Winchester Rifle Wikipedia page, including full graphics. As shown in , Wikipedia provides a tab  to allow users to edit the contents of the page. A screen capture of the editor and associated functionality initiated from tab  is shown in ","5. Page Sharing Among Users\u2014This feature relates to page sharing among multiple users who may be allowed a variety of access methods, including but not limited to:\n\n","6. Journal of Changes\u2014In their most capable form, the knowledge sharing repository maintains a complete journal of all changes\/edits, storing each change made along with the author, date, time, and\/or other relevant data or information. For example, tab  as shown in allows a Wikipedia user to review the history of edits to the associated web page. A screen capture of this journal\/history feature for the Winchester Rifle page is shown in ","7. Full Hierarchy of Categories\u2014In a preferred embodiment, the repository supports a full hierarchy of categories, each with associated Template Infoboxes, forming an analog of the semantic network ontology that can be mapped to and from it. For example, as shown in , the categories section  illustrates a hierarchy of categories associated with Winchester Rifle.","In various embodiments, the present invention addresses the need to update semantic networks (such as semantic networks in the form of a knowledge structure as described herein, as well as others) based on information in a knowledge sharing repository, such as a wiki. Conversely the present invention may also be used to update a knowledge sharing repository based on information stored in a semantic network. The information in the knowledge structure and knowledge sharing repository are stored on a computer readable medium, in the form of data, typically in a database or other storage format, on or in connection with a computer system configured to host the knowledge structure or knowledge sharing repository.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a system and associated method for pairing a semantic network and a knowledge sharing repository, such as a wild. The method may include stages of generating, on a first computer system, a set of data based on information included in the semantic network, and updating the knowledge sharing repository based at least in part on the set of data. The method may further include stages of generating a set of data based on information included in the knowledge sharing repository and updating the semantic network based at least in part on this set of data. In addition, in some embodiments the present invention may be used to generate a new semantic network from information contained in a knowledge sharing repository, or generate a new knowledge sharing repository from information contained in a semantic network.","In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention is directed to pairing a knowledge structure with a wiki to update the knowledge structure based on the wiki, or update the wiki based on the knowledge structure.","In some implementations, the semantic network and knowledge sharing repository may be stored on a common computer system, whereas, in other embodiments the semantic network may be stored on a different computer system than the knowledge sharing repository. In the latter case, the method may include the stages of communicatively coupling the first computer system, on which the semantic network is stored, to a second computer system on which the knowledge sharing repository is stored, and transferring the set of data based on information included in the semantic network, to the second computer system. In addition, this method may also include transferring the set of data based on information included in the knowledge sharing repository to the first computer system.","Updating and\/or transfer of information between the semantic network and the knowledge sharing repository may, in some implementations, be done automatically, whereas, in other implementations it may be done manually based on a user provided input requesting the update. In addition, the updating of the semantic network or the knowledge sharing repository may be done in conjunction with a semantic network editing program or a knowledge storage repository editing program, either through integration of a user interface into such a program or through an external user interface and\/or one or more APIs.","In order to implement the above described functionality, as well as other functionality as described herein, a system including a set of primary components may be used. For example, primary components and an environment upon which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented are shown in . These components include a computer system  (also denoted as Component ) configured to store or access data defining a semantic network , a computer system  configured to store or otherwise provide access to contents of a knowledge storage repository , a communications and data transfer infrastructure  (also denoted as Component ) to facilitate communications between computer system  and , as well as one or more user interfaces . Additional details of embodiments of these components are further described below.","Component \u2014This is typically a computer system, such as computer system , configured for running a network\/link editing and analysis environment. This will typically include a program for semantic network\/knowledge structure editing, such as the Semantica\u00ae applications provided by the assignee of this invention. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on top of a network\/link editing and analysis environment providing the key capabilities described above; however, they do not typically depend on a particular implementation of such a tool. In addition, computer system  typically stores a semantic network  or is configured to access semantic network  if it is hosted on an external system (not shown).","A typical computer system  for implementing embodiments of the present invention includes one or more microprocessors coupled to one or more memories or other data storage components, with the microprocessors configured to execute instructions that may be stored in the memories or on other machine readable media to implement the functionality described herein. Along with one or more memories configured for storing processor readable instructions and\/or data, the computer system may include input\/output (I\/O) interfaces coupled to the processors and\/or memory for communicating with external systems, one or more databases for storing and retrieving information and data, as well as other components and peripherals such as displays, monitors, keyboards, mice and the like. The system may include other components such as disk drives, network interfaces, drives for writing to CD, DVD, BD, or other readable or writable storage media, as well as other computer system components and peripherals as are known or developed in the art.","To the extent that some of the above-described capabilities are missing, some components may become harder to implement or require more manual work, primarily in the form of copying and pasting by the user, to make up for what cannot be automated. Such a lack of these capabilities may reduce some of the benefits provided by some embodiments of the present invention, without entirely eliminating its usefulness.","Component \u2014This may be a computer, server, or other computer based system, such as computer system  (in some implementations the same computer or a similar computer as described in Component  above), accessible through a communications network, such as network , that stores or provides access to a knowledge sharing repository, such as repository , having the wiki-like characteristics described previously. Although the knowledge storing repository is generally stored on computer system , in some embodiments it may be stored on computer system  or on an external computer system along with the semantic network. This computer generally includes the same type of components as described above with respect to component , but may include additional components to facilitate rapid multi-user access via the Internet or other networks, may comprise multiple servers, etc.","Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in conjunction with any knowledge sharing repository having the key capabilities described above (or, in some embodiments, a subset thereof), and do not generally depend on a particular implementation of a wiki, blog, social network, or other knowledge sharing repository. As noted previously, to the extent that some of the above-described capabilities are missing, some components may become harder to implement or require more manual work, primarily in the form of copying and pasting by the user to make up for what cannot be automated. Such a lack may reduce some of the benefits provided by various embodiments of the present invention without entirely eliminating its usefulness.","Component \u2014A communications and data transport infrastructure, such as infrastructure , connecting the semantic network editing tool and the knowledge sharing repository, and supporting HTTP, HTTPS, PKI, or other communications protocols, either secure or open, that allow for the exchange of data between the two tools and for each tool to initiate actions within the other and to maintain secure connections and establish encrypted or network-based user identification to provide element-level access control and other security measures. This infrastructure may include wired or wireless networks, cellular networks, landlines, or other network infrastructure. In a typical embodiment, this network structure will be based on a standard TCP\/IP protocol stack providing networked communications between computers as is typical in most computer environments. However, it could also use any mechanism that encodes packets of information from one computer, transmits them to another computer and translates them on that computer into invocation of the standard protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, PKI, HTML, CSS, etc. on the remote, or possibly the same, computer.","Component \u2014This may be any of a number of automated interfaces and\/or a manually invoked user interfaces, such as interface , that supports connecting the components of embodiments of the invention to the network editing tool, such as network editing tool , and the knowledge sharing repository, such as repository , to allow use of various aspects of the invention. These can be implemented inside either tool or externally as appropriate for a particular use.","A preferred embodiment of this component is in an environment in which the network editing tool is the primary workspace for the user, and the user interface is a collection of small plug-in UI tools or widgets embedded in the network editing tool's user interface at the places where a user can most conveniently invoke them when desired, sometimes from the main menu bar, and sometimes from a contextual menu. In an embodiment which more tightly couples an entire semantic network with a knowledge sharing repository so that all changes to either are immediately transferred to the other, most of this UI would not be needed.","In an embodiment where a network editing tool is still the user's primary environment but does not permit the addition of new UI elements, an external UI would typically be the best implementation. In an environment where the knowledge sharing repository is the primary workspace of the user, adding the UI to the repository's UI would be an alternative preferred embodiment. In each case, the desired actions provided by the components of the present invention described below would be the same and all that would typically change would be the place and manner in which a user would invoke them.","In particular, a preferred embodiment for this invention has been built as add-on (or plug-in) tools that can readily be added to the execution environment of the Semantica\u00ae family of software applications or to similar software applications. These can also easily be extended to any environment providing a semantic network\/knowledge structure persistence mechanism supporting the key features described above, including, but not limited to: i2 Analyst Notebook, Palantir, Inxight, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the like.","These implementations are easily modified to run against alternative persistence models such as A) the Semantica\u00ae TripletSphere\u2122 product which implements persistence for Semantica\u00ae-style knowledge structures in a stand-alone database with custom tools implementing the querying and editing of entities, triplets, and element types with their templates, B) the Semantica\u00ae Staging DB database which implements a simplified form of semantic network sufficient to support these same mechanisms, or C) any other storage mechanism for persisting entities and their connections through triplet-like links.","1. A Semantic Network\u2014This will typically be one or more semantic networks being edited with a semantic network editing tool. The target semantic network is typically a Semantica\u00ae-style knowledge structure, but could be any semantic network that provides the key knowledge structure features of entity types, relation types on triplets, and templates associated with entity types.","In typical embodiments, the present invention does not require that element types or relation types be allowed to be entities to provide the primary benefit.
