abstract: A rectifier circuit can include an input circuit and first and second silicon carbide (SiC) bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). The input circuit is configured to respond to an alternating current (AC) input signal by generating a first pair of opposite polarity AC signals and a second pair of opposite polarity AC signals. The first pair of AC signals has a greater voltage range than the second pair of AC signals. The first and second SiC BJTs each include an input terminal connected to receive a different one of the second pair of opposite polarity AC signals, a base terminal connected to receive a different one of the first pair of opposite polarity AC signals, and an output terminal connected to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit. The input circuit is further configured to control the first and second SiC BJTs through the first and second pairs of opposite polarity AC signals to forward bias the first SiC BJT while reverse biasing the second SiC BJT during a first half cycle of the AC input signal and to reverse bias the second SiC BJT while forward biasing the second SiC BJT during a second half cycle of the AC input signal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Army Research Laboratory Contract No. W911NF-04-2-0022. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to power conversion and, more particularly, to rectifier circuits that convert alternating current into direct current.","Full wave rectifier circuits convert alternating-current (AC) into direct-current (DC). Some rectifier circuits include a pair diodes that are configured to function as rectifying elements by alternately conducting in a complementary manner to each other responsive to positive and negative half-cycles of an AC input signal. The efficiency of such full wave rectifier circuits can be limited by the threshold forward voltage (about 0.3 V) for the diodes to become conductive. For low voltage applications, the threshold forward voltages of the diodes may result in an unacceptable loss of efficiency.","Some full wave rectifier circuits further include MOSFET transistors that are connected across the diodes to assist with rectification of the AC input signal. Although the MOSFETs can reduce the forward conduction losses through the rectifier, the complexity and cost of the additional MOSFET circuitry may be unacceptable. Moreover, when implemented in silicon, the diodes and MOSFETs may be limited to temperature ranges (e.g., below about 175\u00b0 C.) that can be unacceptable for some applications.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a rectifier circuit includes a silicon carbide (SiC) bipolar junction transistor (BJT) circuit having an output connected to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit. The SiC BJT circuit may include one or more SiC BJTs. The input circuit is connected to an input of the SiC BJT circuit and configured to respond to an alternating current (AC) input signal by forward biasing the SiC BJT circuit during a first half cycle of the AC input signal and to reverse bias the SiC BJT circuit during a second half cycle of the AC input signal to cause the SiC BJT circuit to generate a rectified output signal through the rectified signal output node during at least the first half cycle of the AC input signal.","In some further embodiments, the input circuit is configured to respond to the AC input signal by generating a first pair of opposite polarity AC signals and a second pair of opposite polarity AC signals. The first pair of AC signals has a greater voltage range than the second pair of AC signals. The SiC BJT circuit comprises first and second SiC BJTs that each include an input terminal connected to receive a different one of the second pair of opposite polarity AC signals, a base terminal connected to receive a different one of the first pair of opposite polarity AC signals, and an output terminal connected to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit. The input circuit is further configured to control the first and second SiC BJTs through the first and second pairs of opposite polarity AC signals to forward bias the first SiC BJT while reverse biasing the second SiC BJT during a first half cycle of the AC input signal and to reverse bias the second SiC BJT while forward biasing the second SiC BJT during a second half cycle of the AC input signal. Accordingly, the rectifier circuit may provide full wave rectification of the AC input signal at the rectifier signal output node.","In some other embodiments of the present invention, a rectifier circuit includes first and second SiC BJTs and first, second, and third transformers. The first and second SiC BJTs each include an input terminal, a base terminal, and an output terminal. The first transformer responds to an AC input signal by generating a pair of opposite polarity AC signals. The input terminals of the first and second SiC BJTs are connected to receive a different one of the opposite polarity AC signals from the first transformer. The second transformer responds to a signal from the output terminal of the first SiC BJT by generating a voltage across the base terminal and the input terminal of the first SiC BJT. The third transformer responds to a signal from the output terminal of the second SiC BJT by generating a voltage across the base terminal and the input terminal of the second SiC BJT. The output terminals of the first and second SiC BJTs are connected through the first and second transformers to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit.","In some other embodiments of the present invention, a rectifier circuit includes first and second SiC BJTs and first, second, third transformers. The first and second SiC BJTs each including an input terminal, a base terminal, and an output terminal. The first transformer responds to an AC input signal by generating a first pair of opposite polarity AC signals and a second pair of opposite polarity AC signals. The first pair of AC signals has a greater voltage range than the second pair of AC signals. The input terminals of the first and second SiC BJTs are connected to receive a different one of the second pair of opposite polarity AC signals. The base terminals of the first and second SiC BJTs are connected to receive a different one of the first pair of opposite polarity AC signals. The second transformer responds to a signal from the output terminal of the first SiC BJT by generating a voltage across the base terminal and the input terminal of the first SiC BJT. The third transformer responds to a signal from the output terminal of the second SiC BJT by generating a voltage across the base terminal and the input terminal of the second SiC BJT. The output terminals of the first and second SiC BJTs are connected through the first and second transformers to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown.

In response to the AC input signal  being applied to the input primary winding , the output secondary winding generates a pair of opposite polarity AC signals (e.g., 180\u00b0 out of phase to each other) between the first pair of tap nodes  and the center tap node , and generates another pair of opposite polarity AC signals between the second pair of tap nodes  and the center tap node . The AC signals between the first tap nodes  and the center tap node  have a greater voltage range than the AC signals between the second tap nodes  and the center tap node .","The first pair of tap nodes  of the output secondary winding can be configured to generate the first pair of AC signals with about an equal voltage range relative to a voltage of the center tap node , and the second pair of tap nodes  of the output secondary winding can be configured to generate the second pair of AC signals with about an equal voltage range relative to the voltage of the center tap node .","For the SiC BJT , the collector terminal  is connected to receive the AC signal from one of the second pair of tap nodes , the base terminal  is connected through a resistor R to receive the AC signal from one of the first pair of tap nodes , and the emitter terminal  is connected to a rectified signal output node  of the full wave rectifier circuit . For the other SiC BJT , the collector terminal  is connected to receive the AC signal from the other one of the second pair of tap nodes , the base terminal  is connected through a resistor R to receive the AC signal from the other one of the first pair of tap nodes , and the emitter terminal  is connected to the rectified signal output node . The center tap node  is connected to a return rectified signal node .","The resistance values of resistors R and R and the location of the first and second pairs of tap nodes  and  within the output secondary winding are selected to forward bias the SiC BJT  to generate a positive voltage at the rectified signal output node  while reverse biasing the other SiC BJT  during a first half cycle of the AC input signal , and to reverse bias the SiC BJT  while forward biasing the other SiC BJT  to generate a positive voltage at the rectified signal output node  during a second half cycle of the AC input signal .","Moreover, the resistors R and R and the location of the first and second pairs of tap nodes  and  can be configured to saturate the SiC BJT  while reverse biasing the other SiC BJT  during a major portion of the first half cycle of the AC input signal , and to reverse bias the SiC BJT  while saturating the other SiC BJT  during a major portion of the second half cycle of the AC input signal . For example, the transformer T may generate base to emitter voltages within a range of \u22125V to +5V during cycles of the AC input signal  to alternately saturate and then reverse bias the SiC BJTs  and .","For example, during one half cycle of the AC input signal , the tap nodes  and  of transformer T provide a positive voltage to forward bias the collector-to-base junction of the SiC BJT . The resistor R limits the current into the base  of the SiC BJT . The collector-to-emitter voltage of SiC BJT  may be reduced or minimized by the combination of forward bias on the collector-to-base junction and the emitter-to-base junction. This biasing forces SiC BJT  into hard saturation and thereby reduces or minimizes the collector-to-emitter voltage of SiC BJT . During this one half cycle of the AC input signal , the tap nodes  and  of transformer T provide a strong negative bias to the emitter-to-base junction and to the collector-to-base junction of SiC BJT , thereby forcing it deeply into cutoff. In contrast, during the second half cycle of the AC input signal , the tap nodes  and  of transformer T reverse this process, causing SiC BJT  to be driven into hard saturation and forcing SiC BJT  deeply into cutoff.","Accordingly, the full wave rectifier circuit  rectifies the AC input signal  to generate a rectified (e.g., DC) signal that is output through the rectified signal output node  (e.g., +DC) and is received back through the return rectified signal node  (e.g., \u2212DC). The full wave rectifier circuit  may be included as part of a power supply to supply a DC signal across nodes  and  to an external load, such as to electronic circuitry that requires a DC signal for operation. Because the rectifier circuit  uses SiC BJTs  and  as rectifier elements, it may provide higher efficiency signal rectification, may use less circuit elements, and\/or may enable operation at higher temperatures than conventional rectifier circuits that use Si Schottky diodes and\/or Si MOSFETs.
