No. 61\/156,874, EFS ID: 4890579, entitled \u201cImproved Magnetic Levitation Haptic Interface System,\u201d filed Mar. 2, 2009, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","This invention was made with support from the United States Government under Grant Number CNS0625796 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to human-computer interaction, and more particularly, to haptic computer interfaces which measure position\/orientation input from a computer user's hand while providing force\/torque output to the user's hand.","2. Description of Prior Art","The term \u201chaptics\u201d refers to the human sense of touch. In recent decades, there has been a great deal of attention to providing computer interfaces that, in addition to the usual keyboard and mouse input devices, and visual output provided by the display on a monitor, can also engage the computer user's sense of touch. Generally, these haptic devices have a manipulandum or handle that can be grasped and moved about by the user to provide position input to a computer, in a manner similar to that of a computer mouse. Unlike a mouse, which can be moved in the plane of the desktop [2 degrees of freedom (DOF)], some haptic devices allow translational movement in all 3 DOFs while providing force back to the user's hand, and still others add rotational DOFs which also provide torque feedback. Of particular interest are those haptic devices with 6 DOFs, because 6 DOFs are needed to position and orient a rigid body in space.","Prior art haptic devices fall into two broad categories: i) electromechanical devices which are small robot arms with serial or parallel kinematic configurations (or a combination of serial and parallel aspects), and ii) non-mechanical devices which use principles of magnetic levitation. Haptic devices in the first category have been available commercially for some time from companies such as Sensable Technologies, Woburn, Mass., USA; Immersion, San Jose, Calif., USA; Mimic Technologies Inc., Seattle, Wash., USA; Force Dimension, Nyon, Switzerland; MPB Technologies Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Quanser, Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada; Moog-FCS, Nieuw-Vennep, Netherlands; and Haption S. A., Soulge sur Ouette, France. Devices marketed by these and other firms, being electromechanical in nature, necessarily incorporate motors, encoders, links, joints, and transmission elements such as gears, capstans, cables, or belts. Whereas this body of prior art may serve as background for haptic interface devices per se, the present invention achieves similar functional goals through a fundamentally different mechanism, namely, magnetic levitation. Haptics based on magnetic levitation is capable of much higher performance since it can avoid unwanted artifacts associated with electro-mechanical devices.","Magnetic levitation (or magnetic suspension) devices have a long history and depend on various principles for their operation. These include magnetic bearings and magnetic levitation (\u201cmaglev\u201d) trains, as well as numerous toys illustrating magnetic levitation. Of particular interest is Downer, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,700,094, issued Oct. 13, 1987, which describes a magnetic bearing utilizing Lorentz forces for maintaining the rotation of a flywheel which may be subject to small disturbances. Of tangential interest is Anderson, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,156,548, issued May 29, 1979, which describes a magnetic suspension and pointing system utilizing Maxwell forces. Of closest interest is Hollis, U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,998, issued Oct. 17, 1989, which describes a magnetically levitated fine motion robot wrist using Lorentz force actuation with a workspace of several millimeters. None of this art pertains to haptics or haptic devices.","The first use of magnetic levitation principles for a haptic device is disclosed in Hollis and Salcudean, U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,566, issued Sep. 8, 1992. This patent shows a hexagonal levitated body supported by Lorentz forces and using optical position sensors, rendering it capable of six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion and force\/torque output. It is described as an input\/output system for computer user interface, i.e., it describes a haptic device. Further, the invention describes, in general terms, various software elements for connecting and communicating between a computer user's software program and the magnetic levitation device. The device lacks the large workspace, light weight composite levitating element, interchangeable handles, reorientation capability, and automatic software procedures of the present invention.","The paper \u201cLorentz levitation technology: a new approach to fine motion robotics, teleoperation, haptic interfaces, and vibration isolation,\u201d by R. L. Hollis and S. E. Salcudean, appeared in the International Symposium for Robotics Research, Hidden Valley, Pa., in Oct. 1-3, 1993, and further describes haptic interaction and other applications using magnetic levitation.","A motion scaling tele-operating system with force feedback suitable for microsurgery is disclosed in Salcudean, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,885, issued Jan. 17, 1995. The system uses a pair of hexagonal magnetic levitation devices in a master\/slave arrangement providing haptic feedback to the user. An alternative magnetic levitation tele-operation system with haptic feedback is described in the paper \u201cDesign and control of a force-reflecting teleoperation system with magnetically levitated master and wrist,\u201d Salcudean, Wong, and Hollis, , Vol. 11, pages 844-858, December, 1995. The paper \u201cInteracting with virtual environments using a magnetic levitation haptic interface,\u201d by P. Berkelman, R. Hollis, and S. Salcudean, in , Pittsburgh, August, 1995, pages 2296-2301, further describes haptic interaction between a computer program and a magnetic levitation device. Again, these devices lack the large workspace, light weight composite levitating element, interchangeable handles, reorientation capability, and automatic software procedures of the present invention.","Salcudean, et al., disclose an active joystick with optical position sensing in U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,083 B1, issued Feb. 27, 2001, which has a cubic configuration and very small workspace. This device was planned for commercialization, but never materialized. This device lacked the large workspace, light weight composite levitating element, interchangeable handles, reorientation capability, and automatic software procedures of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,108 issued to Salcudean, et al., on Aug. 4, 1998 describes a specific application of the Lorentz force coils in a hand controller.","The paper \u201cDesign of a hemispherical magnetic levitation haptic interface device,\u201d by P. Berkelman, Z. J. Butler, and R. L. Hollis, in the , Atlanta, November 1996, DSC-Vol. 58, pages 483-488, describes a design for a large workspace Lorentz magnetic levitation haptic device. This device lacks the light weight composite levitating element, interchangeable handles, reorientation capability, and automatic software procedures of the present invention.","Watanabe, et al. describe a magnetic actuator with reduced magnetic flux leakage and haptic sense in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2004\/0059245 A1, published Mar. 25, 2004 and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,336,006 B2. A similar much earlier design, by R. Hollis, \u201cUltrafast electrodynamic X, Y, and theta positioning stage,\u201d was disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,153,494, issued Oct. 6, 1992. These devices do not use magnetic levitation.","Li, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,483,499 B1, issued Nov. 19, 2002, disclose a 3D sculpturing input device using a magnetized stylus held by the user. Hu, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2006\/0209019 A1, published Sep. 21, 2006, discloses a magnetic haptic feedback system and methods for virtual reality environments. The system uses a magnetized tool upon which forces are generated with electromagnets. Neither of these devices use magnetic levitation as in the present invention.","The paper \u201cA novel coil configuration to extend the motion range of Lorentz force magnetic levitation devices for haptic interaction,\u201d by P. Berkelman, , San Diego, Oct. 29 through Nov. 2, 2007, pages 2107-2112, describes a magnetic levitation haptic device with permanent magnetic circuits and coil design to permit large translational and rotational motion. This device, while having a larger motion range than the present invention, does not have a light weight composite structure, and lacks a viable scheme for providing high resolution position\/orientation sensing.","In summary, each of the prior art haptic devices and systems, whether based on electro-mechanical methods or on magnetic levitation methods suffers from one or more limitations which the present invention overcomes.","Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the present invention are given below, where the term \u201cdevice\u201d refers to the haptic interaction device alone, and the word \u201csystem\u201d refers to the combination of the device and its hardware\/software controller.","(a) A six-degree-of-freedom haptic device that is free of friction, backlash, link bending, cable or belt stretch, limited encoder resolution, and motor cogging effects which limit the performance of current electro-mechanical haptic devices;","(b) a haptic device based on Lorentz magnetic levitation which has a usable workspace which is much larger than that afforded by previous magnetic levitation devices;","(c) a haptic device which has very high spatial resolution, of the order of 2 micrometers, compared with about 50 micrometers for the most popular electro-mechanical device;","(d) a haptic device which can emulate very high stiffness, of the order of 50 N\/mm, compared with about 2 N\/mm for the most popular electro-mechanical device;","(e) a haptic device which incorporates high mechanical damping as well as high electrodynamic damping and is free of spurious resonant behavior;","(f) a haptic device with very high position and force bandwidths to engage not only the user's kinesthetic senses, but also to a significant degree the user's cutaneous senses;","(g) a magnetic levitation haptic device that can be readily re-oriented to an attitude which accommodates a person's preferences;","(h) a magnetic levitation haptic device which has a manipulandum or handle which can be easily interchanged with alternate handles;","(i) a magnetic levitation haptic device that incorporates push buttons in the handle which can be used to signal a user's application program;","(j) a six-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation haptic device which incorporates an additional seventh, grasping degree of freedom;","(k) a magnetic levitation haptic system where the haptic device and haptic controller may be separated and located at a convenient distance from one another;","(l) a magnetic levitation haptic system whose levitated part, termed a flotor, can automatically take-off\/land from\/to resting configurations for the convenience of the user; and","(m) a magnetic levitation haptic system which can automatically cancel gravitational forces and torques on the levitated part for the convenience of the user.","The invention is a magnetic levitation haptic system (device and controller) with a handle operable by a person which sends position\/orientation information to a person's computer, while accepting force\/torque commands from the person's computer and applying them to the handle, thereby enabling a person to interact with a computer program using his or her sense of touch. Lorentz levitation permits the device part of the system to be free of static friction, link bending, encoder resolutions, motor cogging and backlash effects present in traditional electro-mechanical haptic devices. The handle may be moved about in six degrees of freedom, while the person using the device feels six-degree-of-freedom forces and torques on the handle. The invention may be part of a virtual reality system, or connected to a remote robot system capable of measuring forces and torques in the remote environment. Very high performance is obtained, in part, through having a light weight composite levitated element with high mechanical and electrodynamic damping. The device's handle is removable and interchangeable with other handles of various forms and functionality as may be required by the application. The system accommodates a particular kind of \u201cgrasping\u201d handle which constitutes an additional seventh degree of freedom, for example a pinching motion between thumb and forefinger. The device can be readily rotated by the user to any desired attitude according to the user's preferences. The system includes an Application Programming Interface and algorithms in the controller for automatically taking off and landing the handle, and for automatically finding and canceling gravitational forces and torques on the levitated part. Intended applications of the invention include virtual surgery and dentistry, data visualization, remote robot control, micro- and nano-manipulation, microsurgery, and character animation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["10","20","30","225","226","225","226","30","20","10"]},"Referring to , there is an overall view of device  showing haptic (force feedback) handle .

A preferred method, termed the reduced order method, due to Yu, Fries, and Hollis, is a fast numerical root-finding procedure that uses the flotor assembly motion history to obtain initial position guesses, directly solving for the flotor frame  position and orientation in real time. Referring to , the directions of the three vectors from the emitters to the virtual pinholes are known; i.e., they can be readily computed from the measured image positions on the photodiodes, and the (fixed) transformations of the sensor frames  and  from the stator frame . Only the magnitudes of the vectors are unknown, so the solution of the position and orientation of the flotor assembly can be reduced to a third-order problem. The virtual pinhole positions are given by S, and the LED positions are E; the LED-to-pinhole unit vector directions are band their magnitudes are u, where i=1 . . . 3.","For i, j=1 . . . 3 and i\u2260j it can be seen from  that\n\n,\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nand\n\n||,\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere a is the length of each side of the triangle determined by the three LEDs.

(7)-(9) to update uusing the previous solution values, then improving the accuracy of the approximation with an efficient iterative Newton gradient method using successive LU decompositions, which are well known in the art. In practice, it is found that two or at most three iterations are needed to converge to a position error of less than 10m, permitting this procedure to be executed at several thousand Hz. Finally, a simple fixed rotation transformation is needed to transform from the flotor frame  to the handle frame  (shown offset in ) which is easier to visualize. In operation, handle frame  (will be translated from frame  by a distance limited by the gap between inner stator assembly  and outer stator assembly , and rotated with respect to frame  by up to \u00b18\u00b0, limited by the effective range of sensor assemblies . This completes the description of how the position and orientation of handle  in flotor assembly  is computed.","Turning back to , Thread A, block , desired forces and torques to be exerted on flotor assembly , and thereby handle , grasped by the computer user, are computed. Simple control laws such as PD (proportional-derivative) can be used to stably levitate and control the motion of the handle. Translational control is straightforward. For rotation, it is easiest to represent the handle's orientation about a given center of motion with Euler angles such as roll, pitch, and yaw or (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8) as the three independent rotational variables to be controlled. If small angles and angular velocities are assumed, then the flotor assembly's dynamics can be modeled as six decoupled second-order systems. Given these approximations, the PD control law used for each axis is of the form f=\u2212K(x\u2212x)\u2212K(v\u2212v)+K, where f is the force to be generated by the actuator coils; x and xare the measured and desired handle position, respectively; v and vare the derived and desired handle velocities, respectively; and K, K, and Kare the proportional gains, damping gains, and feed-forward gains, respectively. Since velocity v is not directly measured, it must be estimated from successive filtered position measurements or from an observer. Feed-forward term Kis generally used for gravity cancelation and can also be used for impacts and other forces in a virtual environment. The total force F to be applied to the flotor handle is equal to the vector sum of the forces along the axes of handle frame  whereas the total torque \u03c4 is the vector sum of the torques around the axes of . The variables x, and v, and the parameters K, K, and K, are under control of the computer user's client computer, as read in by thread B shown in .","Referring to , the next step in Thread A is block . Here, the commanded force F and torque \u03c4 are used to compute the correct currents lin the six coils of flotor assembly .  shows six coils  and handle and stem assembly  of flotor assembly , with all other parts removed for clarity. Also shown for reference are three LEDs . There are three horizontal coils numbered 1, 3, and 5, and three vertical coils numbered 2, 4, and 6. It must be emphasized that whereas this non-limiting arrangement of coils is preferred, many other arrangements are also possible. As depicted in , it can be readily appreciated that equal currents I, I, and Iin the vertical coils create forces as shown which impart a clockwise torque about the handle frame 's z axis; reversing the direction of current imparts a counter-clockwise torque. Equal currents I, I, and Iin the horizontal coils create a force along the positive or negative z axis. In the general case, currents in each of the coils will each be different, as sketched in , creating forces of different magnitudes in six different directions. The six forces are equivalent to a single force F and torque \u03c4 acting through the center of flotor assembly  at handle assembly , commonly expressed as a 6-vector \u201cwrench,\u201d F=(F, F, F, \u03c4, \u03c4, \u03c4) where the first three elements are force components and the last three elements are torque components.","The forces and torques generated on the handle when the flotor assembly is in the centered position can be expressed as F=AI, where F is a 6-vector force-torque wrench exerted through the origin of handle frame , I a 6-vector of the coil currents, and A is the 6\u00d76 actuation matrix which maps them. The matrix A can be calculated from the sums of the Lorentz forces and torques, f=I\u00d7B, and \u03c4=c\u00d7f, where Bare the magnetic fields of each actuator magnet assembly and care vectors from the handle (origin of frame ) to the coil centers. The effective magnetic induction Bacting on coil k varies as much as 15% as the coil moves around in the gap of its associated magnet assemblies (see ). In principle, it is possible to calculate Bfor all positions and orientations of the coil, but in practice it is found sufficient to consider the field Bto be a constant B which is the same for all coils. Under this assumption, matrix A is the product of a purely geometric 6\u00d76 matrix G and the scalar B, which is the average strength of magnetic induction in the air gaps of the magnet assemblies.

If these conditions are triggered, immediate actions can be taken to mediate them, and exception flags are set which are monitored by thread C shown in .","Referring to , the next step in Thread A is block . Here, the computed coil currents from block  are output to digital-to-analog converter DAC  (see ). This completes the discussion of Thread A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"],"b":["30","204","320","30","1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0146","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["322","324","1","326","328","330"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["30","340","314","342","344"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 16"],"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00040","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00041","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00006.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00042","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00043","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00006.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00044","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00006.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00045","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00006.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00046","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00047","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00048","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00006.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00049","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00050","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00006.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00051","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00052","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00053","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00054","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00055","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00007.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}],"b":["308","312"],"sub":["k ","k "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0148"},"figref":["FIG. 22A","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"b":["30","100","150","350","352","354","310","356","358"],"sub":["d","d","d","d","d","d","d","d","d","d ","d ","d "],"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00056","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.46mm","file":"US08497767-20130730-P00008.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"Similarly,  is a flow diagram for landing flotor assembly  on outer stator assembly  in the configuration x=(0, 0, z, 0, 0, 0), where zis a position value slightly lower than the bottom of the flotor assembly's range of travel in z.
