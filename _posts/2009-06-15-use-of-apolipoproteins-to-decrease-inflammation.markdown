The initial discovery was made by comparing the inflammatory response to LPS in the presence of serum from species that exhibit differences in their LPS sensitivity. As a marker for the inflammatory response, cytokine expression, e.g., TNF or IL-6 levels, were measured in cell supernatants after stimulation with LPS. In addition, a correlation between in vitro cytokine production and in vivo LPS sensitivity, represented by the LD50 dose (mg\/kg), was investigated for various species, and it was determined that serum factors played an important role in LPS sensitivity. We now determined, after further characterization, that many of the serum factors are high density lipoproteins (HDL). As such, due to the difficulty in separating some of these proteins from each other, we purified HDL first, removed the lipid, and further purified the apolipoproteins. This approach yielded two to three peaks on a mass spectroscopy column. As described herein, one of the peaks that contained the highest activity in decreasing TNF production from macrophages contains Apolipoprotein A2 and Apolipoprotein C3. In view of our data, Apolipoprotein A2 and Apolipoprotein C3, alone, in combination, or in combination with one or more additional apolipoproteins, likely can be used to treat or reduce the risk of acquiring a chronic or acute inflammatory response resulting in a disorder in a mammal, such as a human.","The following examples are meant to illustrate the invention and should not be construed as limiting.","As shown in , total delipidated mouse HDL completely inhibited LPS-mediated induction of TNF in macrophages. In particular, total delipidated mouse","HDL was incubated with macrophages in the presence of LPS, a TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) agonist (Pam3Cys), or killed bacteria (10e3). The culture supernatants were assayed for the presence of TNF after 18 hours. These experiments were repeated and a similar, although less-marked effect was observed (). Total delipidated mouse HDL was then fractionated on a C4 reverse phase HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) column. The fractions were tested for activity in the TNF-induction bone marrow derived macrophage assay as described herein. Three peaks of activity were identified (). Protein analysis of fraction p6, the middle peak, by mass spectroscopy indicated that this peak contains Apolipoprotein A2 and Apolipoprotein C3.","To purify Apolipoprotein A2 and Apolipoprotein C3, twelve milliliters of mouse serum were adjusted to a median density of 1.21 g\/ml with KBr, and centrifuged (2 ml each tube) at 48,700 rpm in a Beckman SwrrTi rotor (250,000\u00d7g) at 4\u00b0 C. for 42 hours. The top thirds of the centrifuge tubes were collected and washed by a repeat centrifugation using identical conditions for 65 hours. The top third of the washed material was transferred to new tubes and adjusted to a density of 1.063 g\/ml with KBr. This material was centrifuged at 48,700 rpm (250,000\u00d7g) for 42 hours. The bottom third of this tube was collected after centrifugation and dialyzed against PBS for 48 hours. This material was delipidated with chloroform\/methanol as described by Brewer, Jr. et al. (\u201cIsolation and Characterization of Apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and A-IV,\u201d Methods in Enzymology 128:223-246, 1986). Briefly, 3 mls of the collected material above were mixed with same volume of chloroform:methanol (2:1, V\/V) and intermittent vortexing for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. The sample was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes at 5\u00b0 C. The top of material in the tube was saved and this same extraction was repeated 4 times. Following this procedure the material was dialyzed against water for 64 hours. This material (protein concentration 20 \u03bcg\/ml) was found to potently inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) when stimulated by LPS (a TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) agonist), Pam-3-Cys (a synthetic peptide TLR2 agonist), and killed bacteria. Fifty micrograms of this material was injected onto a C4 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column, and fractions from the resultant material were split and analyzed for the ability to decrease LPS-induced TNF from mouse bone marrow derived macrophages. The macrophage assay is described in more detail in Example 3. A fraction with high potency for decreasing LPS-induced TNF production (p6; ) was split and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. This analysis revealed Apolipoprotein A2 and Apolipoprotein C3.","The experiments described herein may be carried out using the following materials and methods.","Macrophage Assay","The macrophage assay has been optimized and streamlined for high sensitivity, small volumes, and rapid turnover of results. Any type of macrophage (e.g., mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages) may be used for this assay. The cells can be prepared in large numbers, frozen in aliquots and have less day-to-day variation than the RAW cell line. The cells can be prepared and stimulated with a fixed concentration of LPS on a sensitive portion of the dose response curve in the presence of separated fractions of mouse serum. LPS is used simply to activate macrophages for the assay and the results obtained using LPS-activated macrophages are indicative of results expected for activated macrophages in general. Fractions can be added to pre-prepared and slightly concentrated media to prevent dilution. Supernatants can be tested by ELISA for TNF (or IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or IL-10) and compared and fractions that suppress the production of TNF (or IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or IL-10) can be pooled for subsequent purification. Routine controls for the assay may include no LPS, LPS with no added fractions, and starting material with known suppressing activity. Results may be verified with a full dilution series of LPS, and with dilutions of active suppressing fractions to provide better measurements of the potency of the factor. To ensure that the compound purified from mouse serum reproduces the results observed with whole serum, active fractions may be tested to ensure that they suppress IL-6 production. Similarly, the active fractions may be tested for cytokine suppression using other stimuli, e.g., killed whole bacterial cells or the Pam-3-Cys synthetic peptide, to eliminate the possibility that the purified compound binds and neutralizes LPS, rather than acting at the cellular level. Activation of mouse or human macrophages by LPS may require LPS binding protein (LBP) for optimal signaling. If insufficient TNF is induced from the cells by the added LPS, small amounts of fetal calf serum or purified LBP (Biometec, Greifswald, Germany) may be added as a source of LBP. However, good activation of both mouse and human cells signaling is observed without serum or exogenous LBP, using either LPS or other PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns). Thus, it is not desirable to add LBP, as an LBP-dependent signal would not reflect signaling from other PAMPs. Mouse serum from LBP KO mice also suppresses TNF in the assay.","In another embodiment, a PAMP other than LPS may be used (which would not be affected by LBP) to stimulate the cells in the assay. As the factor acts on the cells when pre-incubated, physical interaction of the protein with the stimulant may not be required. In yet another embodiment, the cells may be pre-incubated with the fractions, washed, and then stimulated with LPS to remove LBP from the assay. This may avoid confounding effects of the possible presence LBP in the fractions from the assay.","Macrophage Cells","Mouse Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages","Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared from mice according to the protocol described by Schilling et al. (169:5874-5880, 2002). These cells can be frozen down in large numbers for use in multiple studies.","Femurs from female C57BL\/6 mice were isolated after euthanasia by COasphyxiation. The ends of the femur were cut off, and, to flush out the stem cells, the femurs were washed with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% mouse, human or fetal calf serum, 1% HEPES, 1% penicillin\/streptomycin (10,000 U\/ml), sodium pyruvate (100 mM), 1% nonessential amino acids (10 mM), and 0.5% \u03b2-mercapthoethinol, penicillin, and streptomycin (basic BMDM media). Red blood cells were lysed with red blood cell lysis buffer obtained from Sigma. After washing of lysis buffer by spinning, viable cells were counted by staining with trypan blue and reconstituted in basic BMDM media supplemented with 0.50% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 30% M-CSF (conditioned medium from cultures of L929 cells) (Weber et al., 151:415-424, 1993), and 0.5% glucose (Differential media) to a concentration of 5\u00d710cells\/30 ml basic medium supplemented with an additional 5% serum, 1.5 mM glucose, and M-CSF (30% conditioned medium from cultures of L929 cells) (Weber et al., 151:415-424, 1993). Cells were cultured one week at 37\u00b0 C., 5-10% COin pyrogen free bags (5\u00d730 cm) made of hydrophobic Teflon foil (BioFOLIE, Sartorius).","After culturing, bags were checked for contamination by microscope. Cells were collected by sterile technique into a single pellet and reconstituted in cryoprotective media at 1.5\u00d710cells\/ml and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. Cells were transferred to liquid nitrogen for 3-7 days. Before stimulating, cells were thawed, reconstituted in basic BMDM media, and plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 400,000 cells\/cm, and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C., 5-10% CO. Alternatively, cells may be incubated for 7 days at 37\u00b0 C., in 5% CO, harvested, and placed in wells of 48-well plates at a density of 4-6\u00d710\/cmfor 24-48 hours in to allow adherence. BMDMs may then be washed and stimulated in media containing either no serum or the same serum that the cells were harvested and cultured in.","Mouse Peritoneal Exudative Macrophages (PEM)","Female C3H\/HEN mice (commercially available at Charles River laboratories) can be injected intraperitoneally with 1 mL of sterile 3% brewer's thioglycollate (Call et al., 158:715-721, 2001); 4-5 days later exudate macrophages are harvested. Mice can be euthanized by COasphyxiation and peritoneal macrophages obtained by peritoneal lavage with 10 mL of sterile DMEM culture media. Viable cells can be counted by staining with trypan blue and plated in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 1.28\u00d710cells\/ml DMEM culture media in 100 ml\/well. Plates can be cultured at 37\u00b0 C., 5-10% COfor 3-4 hours before being stimulated.","Mouse Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (MPBMCs)","MPBMCs can be prepared by centrifugation using Lympholyte M (Cedarlane, Ontario) according to the manufacturer's directions rather than Ficol. Cells may be counted as above and differential cell numbers determined by staining of aliquots. Purity of cells can be assessed by flow cytometry. Prior to use, media can be replaced with media containing no serum, or mouse, human or fetal calf serum.","RAW264.7 Mouse Macrophage Cell Line (RAW Cells)","RAW cells can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown as specified by the ATCC. Cells can be maintained in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum or, as above, in autologous serum. Results from cells maintained in fetal calf serum may be compared with those maintained in autologous serum. Cells should not be passaged more that 10 times. Prior to the experiments, serum in the media may be replaced with media containing no serum, mouse serum, human serum, or fetal calf serum.","THP-1 Human Macrophage Cell Line (THP-1 cells)","Because THP-1 cells are deficient in CD14 on their surface, a stably transfected cell line of THP-1 with CD14 may be used (Werts et al., 2:346-352, 2001; originally obtained from R. Ulevitch (Scripps Clinic)). Cells can be grown and maintained in RPMI in the presence of fetal calf serum (or autologous serum), and washed and the media may be replaced with media containing no serum, mouse serum, human serum, or fetal calf serum for the experiments. Results obtained from cells maintained in fetal calf serum may be compared with those maintained in autologous serum.","Mouse Alveolar Macrophages (MAVs)","MAVs may be prepared essentially as described by Salez et al. (67:545-552, 2000). Cells can be prepared from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (8 washes of 0.5 ml each) from 7-week old mice immediately after sacrifice. Differential cell numbers may be assessed by staining of aliquots, and purity can be determined by FACS analysis.","Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (HPBMCs)","HPBMCs can be prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs may be washed and suspended in RPMI medium. In some experiments, after Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation, monocytes may be prepared by aggregation at 4\u00b0 C. followed by rosetting with sheep red blood cells (Petit-Bertron et al., 73:145-154, 2003; Armant et al., 155:4868-4875, 1995). In other experiments, monocytes may be prepared by magnetic depletion of other cells using an anti-lineage antibody cocktail (CD7, CD19, CD45RA, CD56, and anti-IgE antibodies) and passage through a magnetic column. The flow through containing the enriched monocyte population may be centrifuged, and monocytes may be washed in medium. Cells may be plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5-6\u00d710cells\/cm. Purity of cells can be determined by FACS analysis. The media may be replaced with media containing fetal calf, mouse, or human serum prior to stimulation.","Cellular Activators","Multiple microbial products, including LPS, bacterial lipoproteins, CpG DNA, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan and whole bacteria have been reported to stimulate inflammation. These different stimulants may be selectively used according to the goal of the experiments.","LPS","LPS derived from O111:B4 was purchased from Sigma Chemical, St Louis, Mo. or List Co (Campbell, Calif.). LPS may be further purified to remove contaminating proteins (Manthey and Vogel, 1:84-91, 1994).","Pam3Cys","Pam3Cys that has been synthetically manufactured may be purchased from EMC Microcollection, Tubingen, Germany and used as a TLR-2 agonist.","Peptidoglycan-Associated Lipoprotein (PAL)","PAL is an outer membrane protein involved in maintaining cell wall integrity (Lazzaroni and Portalier, 6:735-742, 1992; Vianney et al., 178:4031-4038, 1996; Mizuno T., 86:991-1000, 1979). PAL induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in low nanogram concentrations (Hellman et al., 277:14274-14280, 2002) and activates endothelial cells (unpublished data). PAL may be purified from as described in Hellman et al. (277:14274-14280, 2002).","Flagellin","Flagellin from and may be purchased from Inotek (Beverly, Mass.). Material free of LPS by passage over anti-LPS columns may also be purchased from this vendor.","CpG DNA","Phosphodiester oligonucleotides, including activating oligodeoxynucleotide and non-activating oligodeoxynucleotide can be purchased from Sigma-Genosys.","Peptidoglycan (PG)","PG may be purchased from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, Fla.) and can be analyzed for contaminating LPS by LAL, and for contaminating outer membrane proteins by immunoblotting with anti-PAL, anti-MLP, and anti-OmpA antibodies.","Heat-Killed Bacteria","Heat-killed O111:B4, O18, and Cowan strain can be prepared by growing the strain in appropriate broth, washing the bacteria extensively by centrifugation, counting the bacteria by dilution and plating the bacteria on agar. The bacteria are killed by boiling, washed again, lyophilized, and weighed.","Cytokine Assays","Mouse TNF concentrations were measured using a Duoset ELISA kit for mouse TNF (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, Minn.). Human IL-6 concentrations can be measured using Duoset ELISA kit for human IL-6 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, Minn.). ELISAs are performed following the manufacturer's protocol.","A mouse IL-6 sandwich ELISA can be carried out using rat IgG anti-IL-6 as a capture antibody (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, Minn.) and goat IgG anti-IL-6 as a detection antibody (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, Minn.). A similar protocol may be used as for the R&D Duoset ELISA kit.","The present invention features method of reducing or preventing, in a mammal (e.g., a human), a chronic inflammatory response such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis or an acute inflammatory response that does not involve sepsis such as an inflammatory response resulting from an injury. In general, these methods involve administration of a compound (e.g., Apolipoprotein A2 or Apolipoprotein C3 (either purified or recombinantly expressed)) in an amount sufficient to reduce or prevent the chronic or acute inflammatory response. In desirable embodiments, Apolipoprotein A2 and Apolipoprotein C3 are administered together or in combination with another protein. Administration of the compound(s) may decrease a cytokine response in the mammal, including a decrease in TNF\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-8 expression or activity. Alternatively administration of the compound(s) may increase a cytokine response, including an increase in IL-10 expression or activity. Inflammatory responses that may be treated by administration of the compounds include, for example, those involving p38 MAP kinase, erk1\/2, and NF-\u03baB activation.","The compound is typically administered to the subject by means of injection using any routes of administration such as by intrathecal, subcutaneous, submucosal, or intracavitary injection as well as for intravenous or intraarterial injection. Thus, the compound may be injected systemically, for example, by the intravenous injection of the compound into the subject's bloodstream or alternatively, the compound can be directly injected at the site of an inflammation.","The compound(s) may be administered to the subject in a single dose or in multiple doses. When multiple doses are administered, the doses may be separated from one another by, for example, one day, two days, one week, two weeks, or one month. For example, a compound that modulates a cytokine response may be administered once a week for, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, or more weeks. It is to be understood that, for any particular subject, specific dosage regimes should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compound. For example, the dosage of a compound that modulates a cytokine response can be increased if the lower dose does not provide sufficient anti-inflammatory activity. Conversely, the dosage of a compound that modulates a cytokine response can be decreased if the inflammation is cleared from the subject.","While the attending physician ultimately will decide the appropriate amount and dosage regimen, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that modulates a cytokine response, may be, for example, in the range of about 0.0035 \u03bcg to 20 \u03bcg\/kg body weight\/day or 0.010 \u03bcg to 140 \u03bcg\/kg body weight\/week. Desirably a therapeutically effective amount is in the range of about 0.025 \u03bcg to 10 \u03bcg\/kg, for example, about 0.025, 0.035, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, or 9.0 \u03bcg\/kg body weight administered daily, every other day, or twice a week. In addition, a therapeutically effective amount may be in the range of about 0.05, 0.7, 0.15, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0, or 18.0 \u03bcg\/kg body weight administered weekly, every other week, or once a month. Furthermore, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that modulates a cytokine response may be, for example in the range of about 100 \u03bcg\/mto 100,000 \u03bcg\/madministered every other day, once weekly, or every other week. In a desirable embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount is in the range of about 1,000 \u03bcg\/mto 20,000 \u03bcg\/m, for example, about 1,000, 1,500, 4,000, or 14,000 \u03bcg\/mof a compound that modulates a cytokine response administered daily, every other day, twice weekly, weekly, or every other week.","The administration of a compound that modulates a cytokine response may be by any suitable means that results in a concentration of the compound that modulates a cytokine response that, combined with other components, has anti-inflammatory properties upon reaching the target region. The compound may be contained in any appropriate amount in any suitable carrier substance, and is generally present in an amount of 1-95% by weight of the total weight of the composition. The composition may be provided in a dosage form that is suitable for parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal) administration route. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice (see, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed.), ed. A. R. Gennaro, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000 and Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York).","Pharmaceutical compositions containing Apolipoprotein A2 and\/or Apolipoprotein C3 as the active compound may be formulated to release the active compound immediately upon administration or at any predetermined time or time period after administration. The latter types of compositions are generally known as controlled release formulations. A pharmaceutical composition may be in a form suitable for sterile injection. To prepare such a composition, the suitable compound that modulates a cytokine response is dissolved or suspended in a parenterally acceptable liquid vehicle. Among acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, water adjusted to a suitable pH by addition of an appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide or a suitable buffer, 1,3-butanediol, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The aqueous formulation may also contain one or more preservatives (e.g., methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate). In cases where one of the compounds is only sparingly or slightly soluble in water, a dissolution enhancing or solubilizing agent can be added, or the solvent may include 10-60% w\/w of propylene glycol or the like.","All patents, patent applications, and publications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each independent patent, patent application, or publication was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"E. coli "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
