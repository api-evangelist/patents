Still more particularly, the present invention is related to a logical data model for storing and organizing web site visitor profile information within an E-Business customer relationship management system.","As the World Wide Web evolves into an increasingly dynamic channel for marketing and commerce, web sites are becoming mission-critical components of overall business strategies. Sophisticated businesses no longer view the web as a venue of relatively anonymous transactions, but as a crucial point of contact between the business and its customers\u2014a place where lasting customer relationships can be forged and maintained. Businesses realize that, at each point of customer contact, significant amounts of data are being gathered and stored. The data from these disparate systems needs to be sorted, merged and coalesced into meaningful business information.","Companies for whom the Internet is a primary, if not the primary, conduit for managing customer relationships have invested heavily in their online businesses. To measure the return on this investment, and make the most of the web-marketing channel, managers need an E-Business Data Warehouse solution that can provide answers to the following types of questions:\n\n","Whereas the success of a company's web site was once measured in hits and page views, with the web master as primary audience for reports based on those metrics, the performance and information obtained from the web site is now critical to many members of the organization. To answer questions like the samples above, an E-Business Data Warehouse solution must be able to correlate click stream data with data from other disparate sources and transform it into actionable information available to users throughout the Enterprise.","While understanding online customers is necessary for an E-Business company's success, and extracting business information from web site traffic is imperative, web site complexity is growing exponentially. Today's complex web sites often employ geographically distributed servers and a mix of solutions, e.g., Ad Servers, Application Servers, Profile Servers, Content Management Systems and various Personalization technologies, to offer visitors a richer, more dynamic personal experience in the hope of turning those visitors into loyal customers. In addition, more and more companies are moving traditional business applications to the web and linking back-office systems to their online environments. These complex information architectures linking intranets, extranets and the Internet create vast amounts of raw data. The resulting site complexity, disparate data sources, and data volumes makes accurate and complete customer analysis difficult to impossible for most vendor solutions.","NCR Corporation has developed an E-Business Data Warehouse solution to provide the answers, embedded in this complex E-Business environment, to questions about online customers. NCR Corporation's E-Business Data warehouse solution, referred to herein as the Teradata Solutions for E-Business (TSEB), provides the decision support engine and surrounding technology to turn disparate customer information into knowledge. The ability to easily handle large amounts of data coupled with the ability to integrate data from many sources allows NCR. Corporation to provide the most robust and scalable complete E-Business Data Warehouse Solution available in the industry.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for capturing and storing detailed business web site visitor profile information for use within an E-Business customer relationship management system.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a logical data model that defines the structure for storing and organizing profile data concerning web sit visitors within an E-Business data warehouse solution.","The foregoing objects are accomplished through utilization of a database system for storing profile data related to web site visitors to a web store web site operated by an E-Business retailer. Data is organized within the database system in accordance with a logical data model comprising a plurality of entities and relationships defining the manner in which profile information is stored and organized within the database system.","In the preferred embodiment, the E-Business logical data model includes PROFILE and VISITOR subject areas defining the manner in which web site visitor profile information is stored and organized within a customer relationship management system for an E-Business retailer.","Visitors may include any individuals, households or organizations that are of interest to the E-Business retailer. The profile information collected and organized within the database system in accordance with the logical data model may include information concerning household and organizational affiliations of said visitors; information concerning occupations of said visitors; information concerning income levels of said visitors; information concerning educational levels of said visitors; marital status information about said visitors; gender information about said visitors; ethnicity information about said visitors; residence information about said visitors; and language information about said visitors.","Profile information may further include a customer score associated with each web site visitor, wherein a visitor's customer score is determined from previous behavior of the visitor with the E-Business retailer, and is an indication of the visitor's future behavior with the E-Business retailer.","Still other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein the preferred embodiments of the invention are shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated of carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description thereof are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["107","111","109","113","107","111","101","115","117","103","105","119","127"]},"In the operational architecture shown in , Dimensional Data Models  and Metadata Database  are components of MicroStrategy Incorporated Decision Support System (DSS) software toolset. These two components work together with external MicroStrategy DSS server components  and MicroStrategy applications  and  to create and modify E-Business and web site reports.","Operational data  and web logs  are loaded into the staging tables on a regular basis, using extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tools  and , respectively. The data is then transferred from the staging tables  to the TSEB LDM physical database  using ETL tools . The MicroStrategy DSS tools, used to analyze the data in the TSEB, require a star schema database to create multidimensional reports. To create this schema, a dimensional LDM  is defined using views and tables in the TSEB physical database.","The operational data, i.e. filters, templates and reports, for MicroStrategy is contained in the metadata database . This database is created using a MicroStrategy SQL Script, and populated with project information via MicroStrategy Architect  and Agent . When one of the MicroStrategy applications performs a function that accesses the dimensional LDM, the appropriate information is extracted from the metadata database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 2","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["Teradata warehouse running on an NCR UNIX SVR4 MP-RAS or a Windows NT server ; and","Analysis and data mining applications running on a separate Windows NT server ."]}}}},"The TSEB configuration should be implemented as a two-tier (minimum) or three-tier (preferable for databases more than 3 GB) architecture. The Teradata data warehouse , for security and performance, should run on a remote server  and the other components run on separate servers. Other components may include an NT or UNIX server  for housing operational database , a web server  for housing web logs , and an NT server  and NT or Windows client workstation  supporting MicroStrategy server components  and applications  and .","The source of the data that will be stored in the data warehouse depends upon the type of business for which the warehouse is being implemented. At a retail site, customer data will come from the business' operational database, web interaction data will come from the business's web logs, and transactional and product data will come from the business' commerce database. For an ISP support business (such as an E-Advertiser), customer data will come from registration and purchase information. Web data will come from web logs gathered from many sites, and transactional data will come from many businesses.","A logical data model (LDM) is an abstract construct that is physically realized in the database or data warehouse. The data model provides an architecture for the information that will be included in a data warehouse. The database provides the physical realization of that architecture in a form that can be efficiently maintained and used. There may well be some differences between the logical data model and the final database design. The database may include some tables (summary tables, etc.) or columns that have no direct correlation in the logical data model. Elements in the logical model may be grouped differently in the physical database.","A logical data model is organized by Subject Areas, each comprised of numerous Entities, Attributes and Relationships. The data model hierarchy includes one or more Subject Areas. Each Subject Area includes one or more Entities or Tables, each having Attributes and Relationships. Each Attribute describes a fact about an Entity. Relationships between two or more Entities are further defined by Cardinality. The Relationships define which entities are connected to other entities and the cardinality of the relationships. Each of these elements will be described in greater detail below.","A subject area is a subset of objects taken from the universe of data objects for a particular line of business or industry that focus on a particular Business Process. Typically, a subject area is created to help manage large data architectures that may encompass multiple business processes or business subjects. This is the highest-level data concept within a conceptual entity\/relationship (E\/R) model. Working with subject areas is especially useful when designing and maintaining a large or complex data model. Dividing the enterprise into several distinct subject areas allows different groups within an organization to concentrate on the processes and functions pertinent to their business area.","An Entity represents a person, place, thing, concept, or event (e.g. PARTY, ACCOUNT, INVOICE, etc.). It represent something for which the business has the means and the will to collect and store data. An Entity must have distinguishable occurrences, e.g., one must be able to uniquely identify each occurrence of an entity with a primary key (e.g. Party Identifier, Account Identifier, Invoice Number, etch). An Entity is typically named with a unique singular noun or noun phrase (e.g., PARTY, BILLING STATEMENT, etc.) that describes one occurrence of the Entity and cannot be used for any other Entity. It should be exclusive of every other Entity in the database. An Entity cannot appear more than once in the conceptual entity\/relationship (E\/R) model. Each Entity may have relationships to other Entities residing in its own Subject Area or in other Subject Areas.","An Attribute is a data fact about an Entity or Relationship. It is a logical (not physical) construct. It is data in its atomic form. In other words, it is the lowest level of information that still has business meaning without further decomposition. An example would be FIRST NAME, or LAST NAME. An example of an invalid attribute would be PERSON NAME if it includes both the first and last names, as this could be further decomposed into the separate, definable (first name, last name) data facts.","A Relationship is an association that links occurrences of one or more Entities. A Relationship must connect at least one Entity. If only one Entity is connected, the Relationship is said to be Recursive. A Relationship is described by a noun or passive verb or verb phase that describes the action taken in the Relationship. A Relationship represent a static state of being between the occurrences of the Entities it connects. Relationships are not intended to represent processes or data flows. They cannot be linked to another Relationships. They may optionally represent future, present, and\/or past relatedness. The time frame must be explicitly defined in the data definition. Relationships may contain attributes. In a normalized model, a Relationship containing Attributes will result in the creation of an Entity.","In order for a data model to be considered accurate, it must contain both the maximum and minimum number of Entity occurrences expected. This is controlled by rules of cardinality, which describes a relationship between two Entities based on how many occurrences of one Entity type may exist relative to the occurrence of the other Entity. Typically, it is a ratio, commonly depicted as a one-to-one (1:1); one-to-many (1:N); and many-to-many (M:N) relationship.","The maximum cardinality may be an infinite number or a fixed number but never zero. The minimum cardinality may be zero, or some other positive number, but it must be less than or equal to the maximum cardinality for the same relationship.","The logical data model for the E-Business will now be described in more detail. The logical data model uses IDEF1X modeling conventions, as shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Entity Conventions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Convention","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"13.46mm","wi":"18.88mm","file":"US07043497-20060509-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Independent entity.
