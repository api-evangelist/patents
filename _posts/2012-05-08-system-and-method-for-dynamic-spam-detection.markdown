title: System and method for dynamic spam detection
abstract: A flexible, extensible, and dynamically configurable anti-spam facility that operates on a general quanta of data (such as for example a Short Message Service message, a Multimedia Message Service message, an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem message, a Wireless Application Protocol stream, an Electronic Mail message, an Instant Messaging exchange, streaming (audio, video, etc.) data, etc.), innovatively analyzes various attributes of same (such as for example originating address and destination address), and—when an instance of spam is identified—performs one or more remediation activities (such as for example updating a blacklist, updating a greylist, dropping a message, issuing an alert, etc.). The facility may optionally leverage the capabilities of a centrally-located Messaging Inter-Carrier Vendor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that can enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various communication paradigms including, inter alia, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), Electronic Mail (E-Mail), Instant Messaging (IM), streaming (audio, video, etc.) data, etc.","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward (through various flavors of 2G, 3G, 4G, and beyond) the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS)\u2014for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) that is serviced in some way by possibly inter alia a Wireless Carrier (WC)\u2014of their WD grows substantially. By way of (non-limiting) example, a WD may comprise inter alia a mobile (e.g., feature, smart, etc.) telephone; a portable computing device; a desktop, laptop, pad, handheld, etc. computer; a Personal Digital (or Data) Assistant (PDA); a home, automobile, etc. audio and\/or video system; etc.","One consequence of the growing importance of WDs is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs carry them at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities.","(Note: While portions of the discussion below will, for simplicity of exposition, refer to messaging generally and certain types of messaging\u2014including inter alia SMS, MMS, etc.\u2014specifically, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that application of aspects of the present invention to numerous other communication paradigms (including inter alia a Voice Over IP (VoIP) data stream, software application (e.g., game, etc.) data, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-addressed artifact, a video data stream (e.g., a movie, a video conference call, etc.), a voice telephone call, an audio data stream (e.g., a song, etc.), signaling and other command-and-control data, etc.) is easily possible and may indeed be considered to be fully within the scope of the present invention.)","Over the past several years various factors (including the ubiquitous nature of WDs) have driven a steady annual increase, year over year, in among other things the number of SMS, MMS, etc. messages that have been exchanged by and between WDs. That steady increase shows no sign of abating. For example, as reported by the industry group CTIA (see ctia.org on the World Wide Web) in the U.S. there were over 2.3 trillion SMS messages sent during 2011 (up from approximately 2.0 trillion messages sent during 2010 and approximately 1.6 trillion messages sent during 2009) and there were over 53.0 billion MMS messages sent during 2011 (up from approximately 35.0 billion messages sent during 2009 and approximately 15.0 billion MMS messages sent during 2008).","As MSs have employed their WDs for ever more activities (including among other things different flavors of messaging) their WDs have become increasingly more vulnerable to a range of undesirable behaviors. One undesirable behavior is spam (e.g., unsolicited, undesired, possibly bulk-dispatched messages).","Internet-based Electronic Mail (E-mail) spam has become notorious. As has been noted by NetZero, spam \u201c . . . is the Internet's equivalent of junk mail. The Internet abuse generally referred to as spamming ranges from annoyances like electronic mass mailings, mass advertisements, junk email, chain letters, and off-topic newsgroup postings on one hand to more serious abuses such as perpetration of scams or confidence games, transmission of fraudulent product or service promotions and harassing or threatening emails on the other. All types of spam waste the valuable time, energy and resources of the recipients, the service providers involved, and the whole Internet community.\u201d","A number of efforts or initiatives have arisen in response to the growth of Internet-based E-mail spam including, inter alia, purely technical efforts (such as, e.g., the SpamHaus project) and legal initiatives (such as, e.g., the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act)).","Since spam artists are now targeting WDs within wireless messaging ecosystems (in fact, the term \u201cSpaSMS\u201d has been coined to describe SMS-based spam), a range of new, enhanced anti-spam mechanisms are necessary to efficiently, dynamically, etc. identify or detect, and optionally eliminate, spam within a wireless messaging ecosystem. Some of the approaches that have been tried, each having a different level of success, include:","1) Message body or content (e.g., keyword) analysis. Given the staggering message volumes (as described above) such an approach can consume significant computing resources and potentially add unwanted latency to message processing operations.","2) Message rate analysis by for example originating address. Such an approach can be overcome by spammers by among other things using a large pool of originating addresses, distributing their message quantity over time, etc. Such an approach is also susceptible to false positives given the legitimate, rapid message-based conversations that are frequently carried out by many MSs (such as for example teenagers).","The present invention provides a generalized infrastructure that offers, among other things, enhanced dynamic anti-spam capabilities (that can be employed alone or in combination with other anti-spam mechanisms) and addresses various of the (not insubstantial) challenges that are associated with same in new and innovatory ways.","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a computer-implemented method for detecting spam that includes at least (1) receiving an SMS message, (2) processing the SMS message, including (a) incrementing by one a counter in a cache entry for the originating address of the SMS message when the destination address of the SMS message is unique for the originating address within a defined period of time, (b) when a counter value exceeds a defined threshold setting a spam indicator, and (c) when the spam indicator is set performing one or more remediation activities including at least updating a blacklist.","In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a computer-implemented method for detecting spam that includes at least (a) receiving an SMS message, (b) processing the SMS message including creating a message processing artifact, (c) incrementing by one a counter in a cache entry for the originating address of the message processing artifact when the destination address of the message processing artifact is unique for the originating address within a defined period of time, (d) accessing various of the cache entries, evaluating a value of a counter in same, and when a value exceeds a defined threshold performing one or more remediation activities including at least updating a blacklist","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention, along with their attendant advantages, will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, generally, like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Additionally, generally, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears. For example, in  the reference numeral  would direct the reader to  for the first appearance of that reference numeral.","The following detailed description of the present invention refers to the accompanying drawings that illustrate exemplary embodiments consistent with this invention. Other embodiments are possible, and modifications can be made to the embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the detailed description is not meant to limit the invention.","Note that in this description references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d mean that the feature being referred to is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Further, separate references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d in this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment; however, neither are such embodiments mutually exclusive, unless so stated and except as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","In the discussion below aspects of the present invention are described and illustrated as residing within a centrally-located, full-featured MICV facility. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a discussion of the concept of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that may be performed by a MICV, and a discussion of various of the advantages that may arise from same. A MICV may, for example, be realized through any combination of, possibly inter alia, any one or more of (1) an element of a WC, an element of a landline carrier, or multiple such elements working together; (2) a Third-Party (3P) such as possibly inter alia a merchant, a Content Provider (CP, such as for example a news organization, an advertising agency, a brand, etc.), a financial institution, a Service Provider (SP, such as for example a provider of mobile services), etc.; (3) multiple 3P entities working together; (4) a service bureau; (5) a message service provider, and\/or (6) other entities.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral  a MICV  is disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC, WC,\u2192WC) on one side and multiple SPs (SP\u2192SP) on the other side and is, in effect, a horizontally and vertically scalable \u2018hub\u2019 that may among other things \u2018bridge\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC WC\u2192WC (and, by extension, all of the MSs (MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS) that are serviced by the WC WC\u2192WC) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs SP\u2192SP, and","2) A SP SP\u2192SP with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs WC\u2192WC (and, by extension, to all of the MSs (MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS, MS MS) that are serviced by the WCs WC\u2192WC).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS\u2190\u2192MS, MS\u2190\u2192SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's messaging traffic.","While the discussion below will include a MICV, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","As just one example of an alternative arrangement, aspects of the present invention may be offered by a SP. A SP may, for example, be realized through any combination of, possibly inter alia, any one or more of (1) an element of a WC, an element of a landline carrier, an element of a MICV, or multiple such elements working together; (2) a 3P such as possibly inter alia a merchant, a CP (such as for example a news organization, an advertising agency, a brand, etc.), a financial institution, etc.; (3) multiple 3P entities working together; (4) a service bureau; (5) a message service provider; and\/or (6) other entities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","104","110","112","114","118","120","120","202"],"sub":["1 ","a ","1 ","c ","1 ","x ","x "]},"While the discussion above referred to one specific alternative arrangement, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other alternative arrangements (including inter alia the use of multiple SPs; the sharing, blending, etc. of functionality between a MICV and one or more SPs; etc.) are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","For variety, completeness etc. of exposition, portions of the discussion below will include a single MICV. As noted above, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are easily possible (e.g., any combination of one or more of inter alia a single MICV, multiple MICVs, a single SP, multiple SPs, etc.).","In the discussion below reference is made to messages that may be sent, for example, between a MS and a MICV. As set forth below, a given \u2018message\u2019 sent between a MS and a MICV may actually comprise a series of steps in which the message is received, forwarded and routed between different entities, including possibly inter alia a MS, a WC, and a MICV. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, it will be understood that reference to a particular message generally includes that particular message as conveyed at any stage between an origination source, such as for example a MS, and an end receiver, such as for example a MICV. As such, reference to a particular message generally includes a series of related communications between, for example, a MS and a WC; a WC and a MICV; etc. The series of related communications may, in general, contain substantially the same information, or information may be added or subtracted in different communications that nevertheless may be generally referred to as a same message. To aid in clarity, a particular message, whether undergoing changes or not, is referred to by different reference numbers at different stages between a source and an endpoint of the message.","For purposes of illustration,  and reference numeral  depict one possible logical implementation of aspects of a MICV  under one particular arrangement (interposed between WCs WC\u2192WC on one side and SP\u2192SP on the other side). The figure depicts among other things Gateways ( and  that for example provide information\/data receipt and dispatch capabilities\u2014from\/to WCs, SPs, and possibly other entities\u2014across possibly inter alia different application-level communication protocols), Queues ( and  that for example provide interim storage and buffering capabilities), a Data Highway (DH , that for example provides interconnection capabilities), and DPEs \u2192.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","312","404","414","406","416","410","420","408","418","412","422","426"],"sub":["1 ","a ","1 ","b ","1 ","d ","1 ","c ","1 ","e "]},"A dynamically updateable set of one or more Receivers (Rx\u2192Rx in the diagram) \u2018get\u2019 messages from a MICV DH and deposit them on an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram) for subsequent processing.","A dynamically updateable set of one or more Queues (Q\u2192Q and Q\u2192Q in the diagram) operate as intermediate or temporary buffers for incoming and outgoing messages.","A dynamically updateable set of one or more WorkFlows (WorkFlow\u2192WorkFlow in the diagram) remove incoming messages from an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram), perform all of the required operations on the messages, and deposit the processed messages on an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram). The WorkFlow component will be described more fully below.","A dynamically updateable set of one or more Transmitters (Tx\u2192Tx in the diagram) remove processed messages from an intermediate or temporary Queue (Q\u2192Q in the diagram) and \u2018put\u2019 the messages on a MICV DH.","An Administrative Engine  provides a linkage to all of the different components of a DPE so that a DPE, along with all of the different components of a DPE, may be fully and completely administered or managed .","Aspects of a MICV may \u2018plug into\u2019 different layers\/levels\/etc. of legacy, current, and\/or future technology of inter alia WCs, SPs, etc. and among other things may for example facilitate interoperation between such technologies.","For example, from a traditional messaging context an entity (such as for example a WC, a 3P such as a CP, etc.) may direct their Short Message Service Center (SMSC) complexes, their Multimedia Message Service Center (MMSC) complexes, etc. to connect to a single, simple, consolidated, etc. interface mechanism that is exposed by a MICV and subsequently seamlessly exchange message traffic.","For example, from a traditional wireless context an entity (such as for example a WC, etc.) may direct aspects of their infrastructure to connect to a single, simple, consolidated, etc. interface mechanism that is exposed by a MICV and subsequently seamlessly exchange SS7-based and\/or IP-based signaling data, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Roaming Exchange (GRX) data, location and presence data, etc.","Central to the operation of a MICV is the unit of information within a MICV that is received, manipulated or otherwise operated on, dispatched, etc. Unlike prior environments that might operate just on, and thus potentially be limited just to, an SMS message or a MMS message, the unit of information within a MICV is a more general quanta of data. Accordingly a MICV is natively capable of operating on inter alia an SMS message, a MMS message, an IMS message, an E-Mail message, a VoIP data stream, a video data stream (e.g., a movie, a video conference call, etc.), a voice telephone call, signaling and other command-and-control data, an audio data stream (e.g., a song, etc.), IM data, games and other software applications, pictures and other static images, data from software applications such as games, etc.","Within a MICV a flexible, extensible, and dynamically configurable IMO (see for example  and reference numeral  and  and reference numeral ) may be employed as an internal representation of aspects of a received quanta of data. An IMO ( and ) may logically contain possibly inter alia one or more headers ( and ), properties (), a body ( and ), etc. within which for example aspects of a received quanta of data may be preserved (\u2192 and \u2192). An IMO may physically be realized through any combination of possibly inter alia proprietary data structures, Java Message Service (JMS) messages or objects, flat files, database entries, in-memory constructs, etc.","For purposes of illustration, within an SMS context a MICV may support the receipt and dispatch of information through possibly inter alia Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP and Mobile Application Part (MAP) via SS7. Under such a context:","1)  and reference numeral  depict an exemplary incoming SMS message received via for example SMPP with for example the data elements associated with the SMS message \u2192 encapsulated within a SMPP Protocol Data Unit (PDU)  encapsulated within a TCP Segment  encapsulated within an IP Packet .","2)  and reference numeral  depict an exemplary incoming SMS message received via for example MAP with for example the data elements associated with the SMS message encapsulated within a Message Signal Unit (MSU) .","3)  and reference numeral  depict a hypothetical IMO  that is possible in support of an SMS message received via for example SMPP, and","4)  and reference numeral  depict a hypothetical IMO  that is possible in support of an SMS message received via for example MAP.","The artifacts that are depicted by FIGS. \u2192 are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that among other things numerous alternative IMO arrangements\u2014in connection with for example different contexts (such as inter alia MMS, VoIP, a voice call, signaling data, command-and-control data, software application data, etc.), different communication protocols, etc.\u2014are easily possible. For example, information on the identity, location, capabilities, etc. of an originating party and\/or a destination party may be captured, preserved, etc. in any number of ways.","As noted above, a WorkFlow component (see for example WorkFlow\u2192WorkFlow in ) may perform a range of processing operations on inter alia a message.","Among other things a WorkFlow component may leverage a comprehensive, flexible, scalable, etc. address resolution facility to support, possibly inter alia, its routing operations. Such a facility may provide authoritative answers to inquiries like \u201cAt this moment in time what carrier services the Telephone Number (TN) 1-703-555-1212?\u201d, \u201cWhat entity services the SIP addresss sip: john.doe@bigcompany.com?\u201d, etc. Among other things such a facility may address (1) the complexities that are associated with all of the different TN numbering plans, schemes, etc. that exist around the world; (2) the complexities that arise with worldwide Mobile Number Portability (MNP) regimes; etc.","A depiction of an illustrative address resolution facility is presented in  and reference numeral . Such a facility may consist of, possibly inter alia:","A) An Electronic Numbering (ENUM) fa\u00e7ade  through which possibly inter alia various elements of a WorkFlow component (E, E, E,\u2192E in ) may connect, submit routing inquiries, receive routing responses, etc.","B) A dynamically updateable set of one or more In-Memory Databases (In-Memory Database\u2192In-Memory Database in the diagram) that optionally house or host selected data (including, possibly inter alia, data from a Composite Routing Database (CRD) ) to provide, as one example, optimal performance.","C) A Real-Time Query Facility (RTQF)  through which inquiries may be dispatched real-time to authoritative bodies (such as, for example, TN assignment administrators) around the world. A RTQF  may support multiple communication channels, paradigms, protocols, etc. (such as, possibly inter alia, SS7 , TCP\/IP , User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP, SMPP , etc.).","D) A CRD  containing comprehensive routing information for, possibly inter alia, TNs within all of the different TN numbering plans, schemes, etc. that exist around the world. A CRD  may receive updates (e.g., dynamically, on a scheduled basis, etc.) from any number of sources or feeds including, possibly inter alia, domestic  (such as, for example, from a Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG), from one or more Number Portability Administration Centers (NPACs), etc.) and international  (such as, for example, from Hong Kong, from the United Kingdom, etc.).","An address resolution facility as described above may support a wide range of address types including among others a TN (such as 703-555-1234), a Short Code (SC, such as 46625), a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI, such as sip:mark@mydomain.com), a Tel URI (such as tel:+19257652333), a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), etc.","A WorkFlow component may be implemented or realized in any number of ways. For example,  and reference numeral  depict aspects of a hypothetical implementation of a WorkFlow environment  wherein possibly inter alia:","1) A dynamically adjustable number of threads (Thread, Thread, Thread,\u2192Thread) may be inter alia created, started, allowed to operate or execute, quiesced, stopped, destroyed, etc. under control of for example the WorkFlow environment . Among other things one or more threads may for example realize aspects of one or more elements of a MICV (such as for example routing operations, protocol conversion operations, message transmission operations, anti-spam operations, etc.) and\/or a single thread may for example realize aspects of one or more elements of a MICV (such as for example routing operations, protocol conversion operations, message transmission operations, anti-spam operations, etc.).","2) Different elements of a MICV (such as for example routing operations, protocol conversion operations, message transmission operations, anti-spam operations, etc.) may communicate, interact, etc. with various of the threads (Thread\u2192Thread) (see for example , , and ).","3) Various of the threads (Thread\u2192Thread) may among themselves communicate, interact, etc. (see for example ).","4) Various of the threads (Thread\u2192Thread) may communicate, interact, etc. with inter alia a Shared Memory Region () (see for example ).","A WorkFlow component may support, enable, realize, etc. various of the anti-spam capabilities as offered by aspects of the present invention.
