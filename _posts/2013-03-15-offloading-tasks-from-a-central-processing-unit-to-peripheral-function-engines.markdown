{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/662,817, filed Jun. 21, 2012.","The present disclosure relates generally to microcontrollers and particularly to components of a microcontroller.","A system on chip (SoC) may include a central processing unit (CPU) and multiple other components for performing various functions, operations, calculations or actions. Often complex calculations are performed by the CPU of the SoC because the other components of the SoC are not complex enough or do not have enough processing power to perform the complex calculations. For example, calculation of a square root value is often performed by the CPU. In another example, performing automatic gain control is often performed by the CPU. In a further example, calculating the root mean square is often performed by the CPU. As the requirements of users and applications executed by the SoC become more complex, the burden on the CPU increases because the CPU performs most, if not all of the complex calculations or operations. This may cause delays when the CPU performs multiple operations and may also cause the CPU to user more processing resources which may cause the CPU to user more power.","The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems, components, methods, and so forth, in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that at least some embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Thus, the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.","In one embodiment, certain processing tasks are performed outside of a central processing unit (CPU) using a network of distributed universal digital blocks (UDBs) connected via DMA and programmable logic.

Additionally, reconfigurable routing of the analog subsystem may allow intra-block routing or intra-channel routing for specific functions (DAC, comparators, SC\/CT functional blocks, opamps, etc.). The reconfigurable routing may be controlled by the microprocessor (CPU), the DMA, register interfaces or by programmable digital logic. In one embodiment, UDBs may be configured to provide the programmable digital logic that controls the analog reconfigurability.","Signal processing characteristics of analog and mixed-signal blocks, banks (of blocks) or channels may be controlled by programmable digital logic regardless of their type. For example, an ADC and a comparator, which are not part of the same analog block or bank or channel may be reconfigured to output or process signals by the same control element, such as a UDB or DMA controller.","Data and clock signals from analog and mixed-signal blocks, banks or channels may be routed on-chip to other analog and mixed signal blocks, banks or channels or to digital subsystem components to extend the signal processing capability of the device. For example a digital filtering of an ADC output, spread spectrum clocking and clocking with variable jitter may be accomplished by routing analog and mixed-signal outputs through the programmable interconnect to other on-chip elements.","Additionally, analog and mixed-signal blocks, banks and channels may be controlled synchronously or asynchronously by digital signals from the clocking or digital subsystems through analog routing.","As discussed above, a UDB (e.g., peripheral function engine) includes a datapath, PLDs, a status and control block, and a clock and reset control block. In one embodiment, the data path may be where a majority of arithmetic and computational operations are formed. For example, if an 8-bit counter is implemented using a UDB (e.g., peripheral function engine) the increment and decrement functions may be implemented in the datapath. In one embodiment, the datapath may be a configurable ALU with configurable FIFOs and working registers. The datapath may have no program memory associated with it. The datapath may be programmed with different op-codes that may cause the ALU to perform different functions (e.g., adding, subtracting, incrementing, decrementing, XORing, ANDing, multiplying, shifting, etc.) In one embodiment, the PLDs may control the operation of the datapath. For example, the PLDs may be used to control the order of operations performed by the data path. Many functions, operations, actions, and\/or tasks may be performed using the datapaths and PLDs of the UDBs. For example, a delta sigma modulator, cyclic redundancy check, or I2C component may be implemented using UDBs. In one embodiment, the PLDs can be chained together to create larger implementations of a function as well. For example, multiple PLDs from multiple UDBs may be chained together to implement a 16-bit counter instead of an 8-bit counter.","In one embodiment, the status and control block may be used as an interface with the rest of the system (e.g., the other components of the PSoC\u2122). For example, the status and control blocks of different UDBs may be connected to facilitate a higher level control of the UDBs (e.g., changing modes, speeds, reading component status, etc.). The status and control block may also be a public location for control or status data for the different components of the system. The status and control block may function as an interface between the firmware and digital domains.","When performing more complicated tasks, functions, or operations, a single UDB or multiple chained UDBs may be insufficient. For example, implementing a single pole IIR filter or a square root calculator may use a more complicated configuration of UDBs (e.g., an array of peripheral function engines). In one embodiment, the datapaths of a first set of UDBs may perform calculations that help control the datapaths of another set of UDBs that are performing the arithmetic or logical operations. For example, as discussed further below in conjunction with , when configuring UDBs to calculate the square root of a number, a first datapath in one UDB may be a counter whose maximum value is constantly decrementing. This helps the other datapaths in the other UDBs keep track of shifting. The datapaths in the first set of UDBs may be controlled by a state machine (e.g., by PLDs). The other datapaths may be chained or may execute different functions in parallel. The state machines are implemented in the PLDs to control each set of datapaths. DMA may be configured to facilitate data transfer between different datapaths in different UDBs, between RAM, and between status and control blocks.","In one embodiment, datapaths may be configured by specifying the op-codes that the datapaths may execute. For example, when configuring UDBs to perform square root calculations, the square root calculation algorithm may be divided into a finite set of operations and the order in which the operations should be executed. These operations may be mapped to the capabilities of the UDBs datapath. For example, addition may be mapped to addition capabilities of the datapath, multiplication may be mapped to a series of shifts and additions capabilities of the datapath, etc. These operations sometimes may be combined with other operations to save program space. Some operations may involve movement or sharing of data between datapaths, or from one datapath's output to the same datapath's input, etc. DMA may be used to move or share data between datapaths or UDBs. Datapaths may be configured using a configuration tool, such as an application, program, software module, or software component, that may be executed by a SoC (e.g., by the CPU of a SoC). In one embodiment, the configuration tool may translate data such as op-codes, mask values, shift preferences, etc., into a Verilog macro or code. The Verilog macro or code may be used to configure the datapath when programming the SoC.","The DMA may be configured using a programming language (e.g., the C programming language or another high level language) or using application programming interfaces (APIs). The APIs may be used to translate abstract functions like allocating a memory location (e.g., a register) to the register writes executed by the CPU to the DMA Controller (DMAC). In one embodiment, the DMA may be configured by the CPU (e.g., when the SoC starts up) to respond to digital signals from the datapaths or their controlling state-machines implemented in PLDs.

In one embodiment, a user (e.g., a designing engineer) may determine that certain tasks or functions may be offloaded to the array of UDBs. For example, a task that completely handles or performs a certain functionality, handles or performs the beginning or end of the functionality may be offloaded to the array of UDBs. For example, performing automatic gain control may free CPU time for other operations. In another example, front end filtering allows the CPU more contiguous processing time before the CPU takes the input value and processes the input value. In a further example, calculating a square root value may be a final calculation that may be provided straight to a serial interface after completion. By calculating the square root value using the array of UDBs, this may reduce the computational bandwidth used by the CPU.","The user may store different configuration data (e.g., Verilog macros, APIs, source code such as C source code files, etc.) that may include information that may be used to configure the UDBs to perform tasks that the user determines may be offloaded to the UDBs. A configuration module or component may use the configuration data to configure the UDBs in the SoC. A configuration module or component may be a software application or component (e.g., a compiler), a hardware component (e.g., a circuit that is coupled to the SoC or is part of the SoC), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, when an SoC performs functions or operations (e.g., when the SoC executes an application), the user may provide user input to indicate to the configuration module that one or more tasks should be offloaded to the UDBs. The user may also provide user input that indicates to the configuration module which configuration data should be used by to configure the UDBs to perform the one or more tasks. The configuration module may use the configuration data to configure the UDBs. In another embodiment, when an SoC performs functions or operations (e.g., when the SoC executes an application) the configuration module may detect that the SoC is about to perform one or more tasks that may be offloaded to the UDBs. The configuration module may prompt a user with the list of one or more tasks and may receive user input selecting a task (or multiple tasks). The configuration module may use the configuration data for the selected task (or multiple tasks) to configure the UDBs to perform the selected task (or multiple tasks). In a further embodiment, when an SoC performs functions or operations (e.g., when the SoC executes an application) the configuration module may detect that the SoC is about to perform one or more tasks that may be offloaded to the UDBs. The configuration module may automatically access configuration data for the one or more tasks and may configure the UDBs to perform the one or more tasks based on the configuration data.","At block , the method  receives data indicating which functions should be performed by each UDB in the array of UDBS. For example, the method  may receive a list of op-codes and functions or actions that a datapath in a UDB may perform when an op-code is received. These functions may be the computational portion of an algorithm or task. Complicated portions of this algorithm or task may be broken down further into functions achievable in UDBs and the process (e.g., the sequences or order of functions) by which they are achieved. At block , the method  receives additional data indicating the sequence by which the task is completed. For example, the method  may receive information that may be used to generate a state machine in the PLD of a UDB. The method  may receive the data received in block  and the additional data received in block  at the same time in a combined data that includes both the data and the additional data. At block , the method  configures the datapaths in the UDBs based on the data. For example, the method  may configure an ALU in a datapath of the UDB to perform certain functions when certain op-codes are received. At block , the method  configures PLDs in the UDBs based on the additional data. For example, the method  may configure the PLD to function as a state machine that controls the sequence of operations performed by the datapath for a UDB. At block , the method  may couple multiple datapaths to each other. For example, the method  may couple the output of a datapath to an input of a second datapath. At block , the method  may couple the outputs of datapaths to registers (e.g., memory registers) of other datapaths. For example, two datapaths may be connected in serial and the output value from a first datapath may be used by a second datapath when the second datapath performs calculations. After block , the method  ends.","Embodiments of the present invention include various operations described herein.
