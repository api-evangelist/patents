No. 60\/440,652, and filed Jan. 16, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of contract #5710000193 awarded by the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency and contract #DABT63-98-1-0009 awarded by the Army Research Office MURI Program.","The present invention generally relates to the fabrication of microelectronic components. In particular, the present invention relates to microfabricated integrated inductors and the magnetic cores included therewith.","As electronic devices, in particular, computing devices continue to decrease in size, engineers are working to decrease the size of the devices' power units, or power converters. A power transformer is at the heart of the power converter; in order to reduce the size of the complete power converter, the dimensions of the power transformer should be reduced. An integrated inductor formed of two conductive coils wrapped around a ferromagnetic core generally takes up a large portion of a power transformer.","It is possible to reduce the size of the inductor by switching to a higher operating frequency. However, a higher operating frequency causes higher flux oscillation frequency inside the inductors's soft magnetic material. Unless the ferromagnetic core is suitably designed, more important losses due to eddy current effects will accompany higher flux oscillation frequency in the soft magnetic material.","The problem may be addressed by using a ferromagnetic material with very high electrical resistivity, such as ferrites and iron powder magnetic cores. However, these materials are limited in terms of maximum flux densities that they can carry. The maximum flux density is usually referred to as B. The lower the B, the larger the cross section of the magnetic core of the inductor, therefore preventing further reduction of the overall dimensions of the magnetic core. High Belectrodepositable material with high electrical resistivity do not exist. The most common high Bmaterial are alloys of nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), and cobalt (Co) alloyed with various other metals such as vanadium or molybdenum. They are unfortunately excellent electrical conductors as well. In order to reduce the eddy current losses inside a magnetic core made of such high Bmaterial, laminated cores are created.","A suitably laminated magnetic core is such that it is formed with multiple electrically isolated layers of the given high Bferromagnetic material. These layers are suitably physically oriented in order to allow quantities, such as magnetic fluxes, to flow in the desired direction. Keep in mind that the relevant thickness of each individual layer is a function of multiple physical and technical parameters, such as the conductivity, the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material, and the range of frequency at which the complete device is supposed to work.","Up to now, it has been hard to fabricate structures with multiple laminations whose individual thickness is, because of the increase of the frequency of operation, in the range of a few micrometers. In macro-scale magnetic devices, low-loss laminated cores are typically achieved by stacking alternating layers of core material and insulating material (which block eddy current flow), and laminating the entire stack together. Laminations have also been utilized in micromachined magnetic components. Previous approaches to micromachined laminations include one-step electroplating of vertical high-aspect-ratio structures, repeated deposition of insulator, seed layer, and permalloy (NiFe) films; multiple sputtering of thin magnetic and dielectric layers; and mechanical lamination of polymer-coated NiFe foils.","Although these approaches have demonstrated improvement in device performance, processability and scaling remain as unaddressed issues. As permeability and desired operation frequencies increase, lamination thickness should be reduced to the micron range (i.e., on the order of the magnetic skin depth), while simultaneously maintaining total core thickness of tens to hundreds of microns to prevent saturation.","These requirements dictate large numbers of thin, high-aspect-ratio laminations, which are difficult to achieve using the previously proposed approaches. For example, in the case of vertically-laminated structures, the required aspect ratio of the mold laminations increases, making mold fabrication difficult. Horizontal lamination using repeated deposition of magnetic thin films and insulators, e.g., by sequential sputtering, overcomes this difficulty but may not be able to achieve the required overall stack thickness due to stress issues. Electroplating of horizontal laminations offers the possibility of fabricating structures of sufficient overall thickness, but the repeated switching of substrates between plating bath and vacuum systems becomes unmanageable as the number of layers increase. Finally, conventional foil lamination becomes difficult as the foil thickness approaches the micron range, especially since mechanical strain of magnetic foils has been demonstrated to degrade magnetic properties.","Due to the shortcomings of the prior art, it would be desirable to have a manufacturable approach allowing micron-scale (or smaller) laminations and large total core thickness.","A microfabricated magnetic inductor core and an integrated inductor are disclosed, as well as the novel methods for manufacturing such devices. The magnetic inductor core of the present invention have reduced eddy current losses. For this reason, the integrated inductor of the present invention exhibit significantly improved performance over solid-core devices. The methods for fabricating these devices are less time-consuming and simpler then other approaches, and lend themselves toward batch processing.","A first embodiment of the present invention may be construed as a method for manufacturing a highly-laminated magnetic inductor core. The method includes depositing at least a first layer of a ferromagnetic material; depositing at least a first layer of a sacrificial conductive material; depositing a support structure formed of a ferromagnetic material; and removing the sacrificial conductive material, thereby leaving the at least first layer of ferromagnetic material mechanically supported by the support structure.","A second embodiment of the present invention may be construed as a method for manufacturing an integrated inductor. The method is as follows: micro-molding and electroplating a conductive material atop a substrate to form a bottom portion of a conductor coil; depositing and patterning a layer of photosensitive epoxy atop the bottom portion of the conductor coil; and sequentially electrodepositing at least a first layer of a ferromagnetic material and at least a first layer of a sacrificial conductive material atop the photosensitive epoxy; electrodepositing a support structure formed of a ferromagnetic material; selectively etching the sacrificial conductive material, thereby leaving the at least first layer of ferromagnetic material mechanically supported by the support structure which forms a magnetic core for the integrated inductor; depositing a layer of epoxy resist over the magnetic core; and patterning the epoxy resist to form vertical electrical vias for the vertical portions of the conductor coil; depositing a layer of photoresist over the epoxy resist; patterning the photoresist to form horizontal spaces for a top portion of the conductor coil; and electrodepositing a conductive material filling the vertical electrical vias and the horizontal spaces, thus forming the conductor coil integrally wrapped around the magnetic core.","A third embodiment of the present invention may be construed as a magnetic inductor core. The magnetic inductor core includes a first stack of ferromagnetic layers spaced apart a first predetermined distance and a second stack of ferromagnetic layers spaced apart a second predetermined distance. A ferromagnetic support structure is included to mechanically support the first and second stack.","A fourth embodiment of the invention may be construed as an integrated inductor. The integrated inductor includes a magnetic inductor core that includes: a first stack of ferromagnetic layers spaced apart a first predetermined distance, a second stack of ferromagnetic layers spaced apart a second predetermined distance, and a ferromagnetic support structure mechanically supporting the first and second stack. The integrated inductor also includes an integrated conductor coil microfabricated around the magnetic inductor core.","Other embodiments, features, and advantages of the present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention.","As will be described in greater detail herein, a novel laminated magnetic core and integrated inductor comprising the same is disclosed. Referring now in more detail to the drawings,  illustrates the effects caused by operating with a solid conducting core . As components become smaller and smaller, the magnetic core  becomes smaller and smaller by way of the individual laminations  becoming closer and closer together. Eventually, the laminations  become so close together that they collectively behave much like a solid conducting core. As current, I(t),  is applied through a conductive coil (not shown) wrapped around the core , an eddy current is generated and flows through a closed loop formed of the stacked, electrically conductive laminations . This results in a lossy conducting core .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["6","3","3","2","3","3","6","3"]},"Proposed is a novel laminated magnetic core that solves the above-mentioned problems.  is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a highly-laminated magnetic core  as it is developed through its manufacturing process.  is a perspective view of the embodiment of the highly-laminated magnetic core  as developed in . It should be noted that several variations can be made to the magnetic core , and subsequently to the process by which it is fabricated. Moreover, steps may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrently or in reverse order, depending on the functionality involved. Features of the manufactured devices may vary as well. For example, the thickness, the overall dimensions, and the total number of laminations can be adapted in order to yield the realization of wide variety of devices. Furthermore, although certain materials are utilized for the magnetic core , substitute materials may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, permalloy (NiFe) is used for the ferromagnetic layers, but other materials, including other alloys, could be utilized instead. For example, NiFeCo and CoFe which are high Bmaterials could be utilized as well as NiFeMo which is a low hysteresis-loss material.","At step a), using standard techniques, a seed layer  is deposited on a substrate  and a thick photoresist layer  is processed in order to create a mold . The mold  is formed of two low aspect ration trenches , in the preferred embodiment, 30 \u03bcm deep and 500 \u03bcm wide. The mold  is a 4 mm\u00d74 mm square ring, and the ring  is 1 mm wide. As just stated, the preferred dimensions are just that, preferred. One of skill in the art will appreciate that these dimensions may vary without departing from the scope of the present invention. With these variances, the specific shape of the mold , and thus the core  can vary. For instance, a rectangular toroid shape may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. Alternatively, a circular toroid shape or a bar type solenoid shape may be utilized.","Once the photoresist layer  is placed to form the mold , the mold is filled with sequential electrodeposition of a ferromagnetic, in this case permalloy (NiFe; about 80%\u201320%), and sacrificial, in this case copper (Cu), layers  and , respectively (step b)). In the preferred embodiment, two stacks of three 4 \u03bcm thick layers  of NiFe are deposited. Each layer  of NiFe is separated from the next NiFe layer  by a 6 \u03bcm layer  of Cu. Note that during the formation of the stacks, each layer provides a good electrical base for the electrodeposition of the subsequent layer.","The photoresist layer  and  is removed to form two adjacent Cu\/NiFe multi-layered structures separated by a central trench . It should be noted that the two structures will include layers of NiFe and Cu of roughly similar dimensions. In other words, the first stack will eventually have spacings between adjacent NiFe layers that are the same as the spacings of adjacent NiFe layers of the second stack. In alternative embodiments, however, the stacks could have non-similar dimensions.","A new layer  of photoresist is patterned leaving the central trench  (step c)). A final NiFe layer  is then electrodeposited over the two stacks and the central trench  (step d)), leaving a central spacing . This 4 \u03bcm thick layer coats the sidewalls inside the trench  as well as the upper surface of each stack.","Once again the photoresist layer  is removed leaving the NiFe\/Cu stacks joined by the NiFe final layer  sitting atop the substrate  (step e)). The fabrication of the core  ends with the selective etching of the Cu layers  between the NiFe layers  (step f)). The central NiFe layer  is a support structure holding in place each individual NiFe lamination layer  once the Cu layers  are removed.","The dimensions of the central spacing  may vary and are a function of the desired compactness of the magnetic core . In general, the spacing  should be as narrow as possible to still provide for sufficient electrical isolation. Early experiments have found a spacing  of 50 microns to be sufficient.","The dimensions of each NiFe layer  may vary as well. Lamination of the core  of an inductor is particularly effective when the thickness of an individual lamination layer  is on the order of (or smaller than) the skin depth of the given material at a given frequency of operation. The preferred magnetic material used in the core  is electroplated NiFe although alternative magnetic materials could be utilized. NiFe's reported relative permeability and conductivity are 800 and 5\u00d710(\u03a9.m), respectively. Using these values, the skin depth of NiFe is approximately 5 microns at a frequency of 2 MHz, thus each lamination layer  may be fabricated in this, or less than this, thickness range. The skin depth",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["\u03b4","c"]}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c0","f"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":["\u03bc","c"]},{"mi":["\u03c3","c"]}]}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["c ","c "],"b":"18"},"The spacing between NiFe layers  may vary but should be around 0.1 microns \u02dc5 microns. The thinner, the better, for the compactness of the magnetic core . The number of NiFe layers  may vary as well depending on the performance and design characteristics of the magnetic core . In order to handle a certain amount of magnetic energy, a certain amount of magnetic core volume is required. Since individual magnetic core thickness is limited (less than one skin-depth thickness at a given operating frequency), the number of NiFe layer should be increased proportionally to the required magnetic core volume.","The preferred approach to fabricating the core  is sequential electroplating. Sequential electroplating allows for micron-scale (or smaller) laminations and large total core thickness without the need for interposing vacuum steps or sub-micron lithography. Although avoiding these approaches is an advantage of the present invention, one of skill in the art will appreciate that these approaches could alternatively be utilized. The NiFe layers  and Cu layers  are sequentially electroplated, followed by a sacrificial etching of the Cu layers . Since the copper sacrificial layers  are themselves conducting, they acts as a plating base for the subsequent deposition of NiFe without the necessity of multiple vacuum steps, multiple coating of insulating layers, or multiple photolithography steps. Highly laminated structures can therefore be achieved merely by alternating plating baths during fabrication, followed by selective removal of the sacrificial layers to provide electrical insulation between the surfaces of adjacent magnetic layers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":"10"},"Having illustrated the process by which a magnetic core  may be manufactured in accordance with the present invention, we will now illustrate how to integrate an integrated coil process in with the manufacture of the magnetic core .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["50","10","60","78","60","62","64","10"]},"Before removing the sacrificial Cu layers ( of ), a thin photoresist  is spin-cast and patterned (step c)) in order to clog the electrical vias  and protect the underlying Cu lines  during the sacrificial Cu etching (step d)).

The layer of epoxy  is patterned using photolithography to form vertical vias  (step e)). The vertical vias  allow for the deposition of the vertical sections of the 3D conductor coil.
