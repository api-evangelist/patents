title: Airfoil with hybrid drilled and cutback trailing edge
abstract: An apparatus for a gas turbine engine includes an airfoil, a metering opening for metering a cooling fluid, a cutback slot configured to deliver the cooling fluid from the metering opening, and a cooling hole. The airfoil defines a trailing edge, opposite first and second faces, and a mean camber line. The cutback slot is defined along the first face of the airfoil adjacent to the trailing edge and offset from the mean camber line of the airfoil. The cooling hole has an outlet that is located at the trailing edge and substantially aligned with the mean camber line of the airfoil. The cooling hole delivers a portion of the cooling fluid from the metering opening.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention was developed, at least in part, with government funding pursuant to Contract No. N00019-02-C-3003 awarded by the United States Navy. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to fluid-cooled airfoils, and more particularly to fluid-cooled airfoils suitable for use with gas turbine engines.","Airfoils, such as those used in gas turbine engines, often operate in relatively hot environments. In order to help ensure air foil integrity, airfoils can utilize high temperature alloys, thermal barrier coatings, and cooling fluid delivery. However, known cooling schemes may be inadequate for some desired applications. Inadequate cooling fluid delivery can lead to spallation of coatings, and other wear or damage to the airfoil (e.g., crack formation), which may necessitate repair or replacement of the airfoil. Such a need for repair or replacement of an airfoil is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, it is desired to provide for improved fluid cooling for an airfoil, particularly at a trailing edge of the airfoil.","An apparatus according to the present invention for use with a gas turbine engine includes an airfoil, a metering opening for metering a cooling fluid, a cutback slot configured to deliver the cooling fluid from the metering opening, and a cooling hole. The airfoil defines a trailing edge, opposite first and second faces, and a mean camber line. The cutback slot is defined along the first face of the airfoil adjacent to the trailing edge and is offset from the mean camber line of the airfoil. The cooling hole has an outlet that is located at the trailing edge and substantially aligned with the mean camber line of the airfoil. The cooling hole delivers a portion of the cooling fluid from the metering opening.","In general, the present invention relates to a fluid-cooled airfoil having a film-cooling cutback slot located along a pressure face adjacent to the trailing edge and a convective-cooling hole extending to the trailing edge. A cooling fluid from a plenum is metered through a metering opening, and passes to the cutback slot to provide film cooling. A portion of the cooling fluid delivered to the cutback slot is directed through the cooling hole extending to the trailing edge to provide convective cooling to the airfoil. In that way, hybrid film cooling and convective cooling is provided at or near the trailing edge, which can help maintain regions of the trailing edge of the airfoil at or below suitable thermal operating limits. In one embodiment, an inlet of the hole extending to the trailing edge is located at or downstream from an upstream boundary of the cutback slot along the pressure face of the airfoil, and an outlet of the hole extending to the trailing edge is substantially aligned with a mean camber line of the airfoil.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","10","24","10","18","20","22","10"],"sub":"L "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["26","28","30","28","32","34","32","26","24","10","26","36","30","38","26","36","26","26","26","30","26","36","26","40","32","30","26"],"sub":["1 ","2","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["26","3","3","42","26","32","34","30","44","26","44","26"],"sub":"1"},"Each of the cooling passages  (one is shown in ) includes a metering opening , a cutback slot , and a trailing edge cooling hole . The metering opening  is fluidically connected to the plenum  to receive and meter cooling flows. The cutback slot  is located downstream from the metering opening , and is configured to deliver cooling fluid to the pressure face  at an outlet defined between an upstream boundary  and a downstream boundary . The downstream boundary  of the cutback slot  is located adjacent to and slightly upstream from the trailing edge . The cutback slot  is generally offset from the mean camber line . Additional details of the cutback slot  are discussed below.","The trailing edge cooling hole  extends from the cutback slot  to the trailing edge , between an inlet  and an outlet . In the illustrated embodiment, the inlet  of trailing edge cooling hole  is located essentially within the cutback slot , that is, the inlet  is located approximately at or downstream of the upstream boundary  of the cutback slot  and at or upstream of the downstream boundary . Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, the outlet  of the trailing edge cooling hole  is substantially aligned with the mean camber line  at the trailing edge . The outlet  and other portions of the trailing edge cooling hole  has a substantially circular cross-section in the illustrated embodiment. In alternative embodiments, other shapes of the outlet  are possible, such as an elliptical or \u201cracetrack\u201d shape with a major axis arranged in the spanwise direction. The outlet  has a diameter (or width) D. In one embodiment, the diameter Dof the trailing edge  is at least approximately three times larger than the diameter Dof the outlet . Having the diameter Dsignificantly larger than the diameter Dhelps promote structural integrity of the trailing edge .","Although in the illustrated embodiment only a single trailing edge cooling hole  extends from each cutback slot , in further embodiments multiple trailing edge cooling holes  can extend from a given cutback slot . For example, multiple trailing edge cooling holes  can extend from a given cutback slot  at different angles relative to the centerline Cand each have separate inlets . Alternatively, multiple trailing edge cooling holes  extending from a given cutback slot  could share a common inlet .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["26","48","48","56","58","50","36","10","50","48","36","48","50","36"],"sub":["L ","L"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["26","60","62","62","32","34","26","30","60","44","36","36","60","48","60","60","48","32","26","30","62","26","26","60","60","50","60","48","30","30","26","60","62"]},"The second portion B of the cooling fluid flow  also provides aerodynamic benefits by helping to straighten fluid flows at or near the trailing edge  of the airfoil .
