{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a non-provisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 61\/390,118, entitled \u201cVDI-in-a-box Virtual Desktop System and Method,\u201d filed Oct. 5, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","Traditionally, personal computers have been implemented as hard-coded combinations of operating systems, applications, and user settings, which are managed individually by owners or administrators on an ongoing basis. However, many organizations are now using desktop virtualization to provide a more flexible option to address the varying needs of their users. In desktop virtualization, a user's computing environment (e.g., operating system, applications, and\/or user settings) may be separated from the user's physical computing device (e.g., smartphone, laptop, desktop computer). Thus, using client-server technology, a \u201cvirtualized desktop\u201d may be stored in a remote central server, rather than in the local storage of the client computing device.","There are several different types of desktop virtualization systems. As an example, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) refers to the process of running a user desktop inside a virtual machine that resides on a server. VDI and other server-based desktop virtualization systems may provide personalized desktops for each user, while allowing for centralized management and security. Servers in such systems may include storage for virtual desktop images and system configuration information, as well as software components to provide the virtual desktops and allow users to interconnect to them. For example, a VDI server may include one or more hypervisors to create and maintain multiple virtual machines, software to manage the hypervisor(s), a connection broker, and software to provision and manage the virtual desktops.","In light of the foregoing background, the following presents a simplified summary of the present disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description provided below.","According to certain aspects, one or more virtual workplace software components may be selected and\/or provided to an organization server based on certain characteristics of the organization. For example, one or more inputs may be received via a user interface or other means corresponding to organization characteristics such as organization type and\/or size, along with other possible organization characteristics. Additional input may be received corresponding to one or more characteristics of a requested virtual workplace environment to be provided at an organization server. Based on certain organization characteristics and\/or other relevant information, one or more virtual workplace software components may be selected for an organization server. The selection of the virtual workplace software may be output, and, in certain embodiments, may be downloaded and\/or installed at the organization server to provide desktop virtualization for the organization's users.","According to other aspects, virtual workplace software at a desktop virtualization server may be used to provide virtual desktops to end users and\/or management functionality to administrators. For example, certain virtual workplace software may be used to provide a login user interface and authenticate users at the desktop virtualization server. The virtual workplace software may, in some embodiments, identify a user as an authorized end user and provide the user with access to a virtual machine corresponding to the user's identity and virtual machine template associations. In some embodiments, the virtual workplace software may identify a user as an authorized administrator and may provide the administrator with access to one or more desktop virtualization server management functions.","In the following description of the various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.","As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art upon reading the following disclosure, various aspects described herein may be embodied as a method, a data processing system, or a computer program product. Accordingly, those aspects may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. Furthermore, such aspects may take the form of a computer program product stored by one or more computer-readable storage media having computer-readable program code, or instructions, embodied in or on the storage media. Any suitable computer readable storage media may be utilized, including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, magnetic storage devices, and\/or any combination thereof. In addition, various signals representing data or events as described herein may be transferred between a source and a destination in the form of electromagnetic waves traveling through signal-conducting media such as metal wires, optical fibers, and\/or wireless transmission media (e.g., air and\/or space).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","100","101","101","103","105","107","109","115"]},"I\/O module  may include a mouse, keypad, touch screen, scanner, optical reader, and\/or stylus (or other input device(s)) through which a user of generic computing device  may provide input, and may also include one or more of a speaker for providing audio output and a video display device for providing textual, audiovisual, and\/or graphical output. Software may be stored within memory  and\/or other storage to provide instructions to processor  for enabling generic computing device  to perform various functions. For example, memory  may store software used by the generic computing device , such as an operating system , application programs , and an associated database . Alternatively, some or all of the computer executable instructions for generic computing device  may be embodied in hardware or firmware (not shown).","The generic computing device  may operate in a networked environment supporting connections to one or more remote computers, such as terminals . The terminals  may be personal computers or servers that include many or all of the elements described above with respect to the generic computing device . The network connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. When used in a LAN networking environment, the generic computing device  may be connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the generic computing device  may include a modem  or other network interface for establishing communications over the WAN , such as computer network  (e.g., the Internet). It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are illustrative and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Generic computing device  and\/or terminals  may also be mobile terminals (e.g., mobile phones, smartphones, PDAs, notebooks, etc.) including various other components, such as a battery, speaker, and antennas (not shown).","The disclosure is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the disclosure include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","Referring to , a diagram is shown illustrating a high-level architecture of an illustrative desktop virtualization system. In this example, the desktop virtualization system includes a server  (e.g., a VDI server) configured to provide virtual desktops to one or more client access devices . The server  includes a processor  and memory , and also may include one or more of the features of the general computing device  discussed above.","In this example, the server  includes a hypervisor  capable of creating and managing virtual machines  on the server . The hypervisor  is a software layer that may execute directly on the hardware of the server , or may execute within the operating system of the server . Although only one hypervisor  is shown in this example, servers in desktop virtualization systems may include multiple different hypervisors , each supporting its own set of virtual machines .","The server  in this example also includes virtual workplace software . The virtual workplace software  may include one or more software components having the functionality to control the hypervisor , create and manage virtual machines , and to enable authorized access to the virtual machines  by end users at client access devices . As shown in this example, the virtual workplace software  may execute on the hypervisor  within server . For example, the virtual workplace software  may run as a virtual machine on the hypervisor  that it manages. In other examples, virtual workplace software  may execute as an application on a separate machine different from the server , and may communicate with the hypervisor  via a network protocol.","Each virtual machine  created and\/or managed by the virtual workplace software  may support one or more virtual desktops for users at client devices . As described in more detail below, clients  may connect to a virtual machine  over a network (e.g., the Internet ) to initiate a virtual desktop for a user at the client device  (e.g., thin client, laptop, or mobile device, etc.). For example, users may use web browser software to access a web-based console provided by the virtual workplace software . In other examples, a graphical user interference client application may be installed on the client devices  which is designed to connect to and communicate with the virtual workplace software . When a user at client device  attempts to access the virtual workplace software  to initiate a virtual desktop session, or to perform any of the management or administrative functions of the desktop virtualization system, the virtual workplace software  may authenticate the user to confirm that the user has the proper authority to perform the functions requested by the user. After the user has been authenticated, the virtual workplace software  may select a virtual machine  for the user's virtual desktop session and provide the user with the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the selected virtual machine  and\/or may connect the user's access device  to the remote desktop protocol client running on the virtual machine .","As described below in more detail, the virtual workplace software  also may provide a graphical user interface through which administrators can manage the desktop virtualization system and\/or an application programming interface (API) that may be accessed by other programs to perform management functions for the desktop virtualization system.","The virtual workplace software  may control the hypervisor  to create the virtual machines  running the virtual desktops for clients . Each virtual machine  may be created from a template that identifies one or more virtual machine characteristics, for example, the operating system the virtual machine  will run, a set of applications the virtual machine  will contain, amounts of the CPU and RAM resources of the server  that the virtual machine  is permitted to consume, and other such characteristics that may be required to create and run virtual machines . As described below, authorized administrators may create different types of virtual machine templates via the virtual workplace software . Administrators also may specify valid and\/or invalid users, and assign users and groups of users to different templates using the virtual workplace software .","Referring now to , a functional component diagram is shown for an example virtual workplace software component . In this example, the virtual workplace software  may be one or more software components configured to provide out-of-the-box support for desktop virtualization systems. Thus, the virtual workplace software component(s)  may perform a wide variety of desktop virtualization functions, for example, managing the hypervisor, creating and destroying virtual machines, and setting-up connections between the virtual machines and users.","In this example, the virtual workplace software  includes an actualization engine  configured to communicate with the hypervisor  and memory\/storage system  of the server . The actualization engine  may use an API published by the hypervisor to create, start, clone, modify, shutdown, and delete virtual machines . The actualization engine  may also provide the media access control (MAC) addresses, virtual networks, storage and other resources required by the virtual machines . Additionally, the actualization engine  may provide one or more APIs, which may be used by the state engine  or other components, to allow these components to manage the data storage of the desktop virtualization system (e.g., request and modify various storage sizes, remaining capacities, etc.), and to write and retrieve data from the storage system . Through these APIs and\/or additional programming techniques, the actualization engine  may provide a layer of abstraction to the hypervisor , allowing the virtual workplace software  to run successfully on different types of hypervisors .","The virtual workplace software  in this example includes a state engine . The state engine  may store a comprehensive view of the state of the desktop virtualization on the server , for example, data corresponding to all virtual machines  and their states, lists of virtual machine templates along with their associated users and groups, and policy and configuration information required to manage the templates, users, and virtual desktops. The state engine may also maintain current virtual desktop session information such as a list of the users\/clients  that are currently logged in, the virtual machines  the each user is logged into, how long each user has been logged in, and other state information needed to manage user sessions and to recover from session failures. The data maintained by the state engine  may persist across a reboot of the virtual workplace software  and\/or server , and the state engine may use an API provided by the actuator  to persist its state information to the storage system .","A policy engine  also may be included in the virtual workplace software . The policy engine (or director) component , may include the software logic for orchestrating multi-step activities or asynchronous activities performed by the desktop virtualization system. For example, the policy engine  may coordinate and control the creating and\/or deleting of multiple virtual machines . The policy engine  also may control creation, deletion, and re-generation of virtual machines  from their virtual machine templates.","In this example, the virtual workplace software  includes a desktop service  configured to communicate with a desktop agent software component  running on each virtual machine . The desktop service  may send\/receive messages from each of its associated desktop agents , and then leverage the policy engine , state engine , and actuation engine  to manage virtual machines , virtual machine templates, and user associations, etc. The desktop service  may also provide a connection broker that accepts login credentials from users at client devices  (e.g., via a web server or other client-server configuration), and then creates and\/or assigns virtual machines  to authorized users, and provides management consoles to authorized administrators.","A desktop agent software component , which may execute on some or all of the virtual machines  in the virtualization system, may monitor the health and status of its virtual machine  and provide the relevant information to the virtual workplace software . For example, each desktop agent  may send a periodic message to the desktop service  to confirm that the virtual machine  is still operating. The desktop agent  also may send a message to the desktop service  whenever a user logs in or out of its virtual machine , including the name of the user.","Having described an example high-level architecture of a desktop virtualization system in , and having described certain functionality of such virtualization systems in , the following paragraphs provide additional examples of various methods and systems relating to desktop virtualization. In , methods and systems are described for providing virtual workplace software to a desktop virtualization server based on selected organization characteristics and other information. In , methods and systems are described for using the virtual workplace software at a desktop virtualization server to create and provide virtual machines  to end users and\/or to provide virtual workplace management consoles to authorized administrators.","Referring now to , a component diagram of a system for selecting and providing desktop virtualization software (e.g., virtual workplace software ) to a computer server  (e.g., desktop virtualization system server ) is shown. In this example, the desktop virtualization system server  may correspond to the desktop virtualization server  described above in reference to , and the virtual workplace software provider  may be a computer server including many or all of the elements described above relative to the general computing device  (e.g., a processor, memory, etc.). The software provider  and desktop virtualization server  may be connected via one or more computer networks, including a LAN (e.g., an organizational Intranet), a WAN (e.g., the Internet), and\/or other networks.","The software provider  and desktop virtualization server  in this example may be operated in a client-server configuration, for example, communicating via a web-based client-server application in which the software provider  includes a web server allowing the desktop virtualization server  to access web pages and download software from the software provider  via a web browser application. In other examples, the desktop virtualization server  may execute a standalone client software application configured to access a non-web based service or other application on the software provider  in order to download and\/or install the virtual workplace software.","Referring now to , a flow diagram is shown illustrating a method of selecting and providing virtual workplace software to a desktop virtualization system server. The embodiments described in reference to the flow diagram in , and the example user interface screens in , may be implemented by software executed by the client-server system in , or by one or more computer devices including some or all of the features of the general computing device  discussed above.","As described below in the steps of , the desktop virtualization server  may request and receive virtual workplace software (e.g., VDI server software or virtual workplace software , including one or more of hypervisor management software, a connection broker, virtual machine management software, etc.) from a software provider server . Thus, although the desktop virtualization server  operates as a server with respect to the client access devices , the server  may first operate as a client with respect to selecting, downloading, installing, and configuring its virtual workplace software .","In step , a virtual workplace software provider  may receive input corresponding to an organization type for an organization that uses or may potentially use desktop virtualization. For instance, an organization may desire to install (or re-install, upgrade, etc.) virtual workplace software  onto one or more of its computer servers  to provide desktop virtualization services the organization's users. As described below in step , certain versions, features, and\/or configurations of the virtual workplace software  may provide advantages for some organizations (e.g., with respect to cost, security, scalability, reliability, performance, etc.), while different versions, features, and\/or configurations of the virtual workplace software  may provide potential advantages to other organizations. Thus, the input in step  corresponding to the organization type may be used by the software provider  to help select a virtual workplace software component  for the organization's desktop virtualization server .","The organization input in step  may be received by the software provider  via a user interface, for example, in a web-based or standalone client-server application. In other examples, the organization input may be received using other electronic means (e.g., mobile device application, email, SMS, etc.) The input in step  may be received from the organization server  on which the virtual workplace software  may be installed. Alternatively, the organization input may be received from another source, for example, from a separate computer of a manager or IT professional performing research and comparing potential virtual workplace software implementations.","A user interface provided by the software provider  or other source to receive the organization input may include a selectable list of organization types, for example, a healthcare institution organization type (e.g., hospital, clinic, etc.), an educational institution organization type (e.g., school, university, etc.), a financial institution organization type (e.g., bank, credit union, insurance company, etc.); and a governmental institution organization type (e.g., federal, state, or local government office, etc.). In certain examples, a user interface may provide a set of relevant organizational factors or priorities that may be selected instead of, or in addition to, specific organization types. For example, the input in step  may consist of user selections or rankings of one or more of the following organization priorities: cost, security, scalability, reliability, and performance. Thus, the organization type need not correspond to the types of products and services provided by the organization (e.g., bank, hospital, school, etc.). Rather, as in this example, the organization type may be stored and expressed as a set of one or more organization factors or priorities (e.g., low cost and scalable, high security and high performance, etc.).","In step , the virtual workplace software provider  may receive input corresponding to an organization type for the organization that uses or may potentially use the virtual workplace software . As in step , the organization size input may be received in step  via a user interface (e.g., web page, client-server application, etc.) or other electronic means from the organization server  or from another source. The organization size input may be number or estimate of the organization size (e.g., 50 people, 500 people, 5,000 people) or may correspond to a subset of the organization that will have access to the virtual workplace software  on the server . For example, if a large company of 10,000 employees plans to provide a desktop virtualization system intended only for a smaller group of 500 remote workers and contractors, then the user providing the organization size input may enter \u201c500\u201d or select an appropriate size range corresponding to that number, rather than entering the entire organization size. Size may also be defined in other ways including by a number of servers or client devices that are used or will be used, an amount of revenue, a number of offices and the like.","In step , the virtual workplace software provider  may receive input corresponding to a set of features and\/or characteristics for a virtual workplace environment that the organization uses or may potentially use. As in steps  and , the set of virtual workplace features\/characteristics may be received in step  via a user interface (e.g., web page, client-server application, etc.) or other electronic means from the organization server  or from another source. The virtual workplace features received in step  may include many different types of data relating to various aspects of desktop virtualization systems that potentially may be used by the organization. The software provider  may provide a robust user interface for managers, administrators, IT professionals, and others who may wish to research and compare different combinations of features and configuration settings for virtual workplace software implementations.","The set of features\/characteristics for potential virtual workplace environments that may be specified includes, for example, the type of desktop virtualization to be used in the virtual workplace environment (e.g., VDI and blade PCs, other server-based or client-side virtual desktop models, etc.) and the number of desktop virtualizations servers  to be used in the virtual workplace environment (e.g., single server or multi-server installation). The virtual workplace features\/characteristics also may specify the minimum\/maximum number and type of the virtual machines  to be used in the virtual workplace environment. For example, min\/max numbers of virtual machines  may be selected for one or more pre-defined or currently existing virtual machine templates. As described above, virtual machine templates may define the characteristics of the virtual machines  from which they are created, including the operating system of the virtual machine , set of applications that will be provisioned on the virtual machine , and\/or various user and administrative settings for the virtual machine. In other examples, a user may specify an operating system, settings, and\/or applications separately without using virtual machine templates. Virtual machine names, descriptions, and other virtual machine properties may also be specified in step . Additionally, in step , users and\/or groups may be defined and associated with virtual machine templates or specific virtual machines.","In certain embodiments, the software provider  may recommend a set of features\/characteristics for the organization server  based on the selection of the organization type in step  and\/or the selection of the organization size in step . For example, based on a specified organization type and size, the software provider  may recommend a single-server installation VDI providing a certain number of virtual desktops for members of the organization. In such examples, the software provider  may customize the user interface in step  to reflect the recommendation (e.g., by ranking or preselecting the corresponding features\/characteristics).","In step , the virtual workplace software provider  may determine the virtual workplace server software  for the organization based on the inputs received in steps -. Step  may include selecting one or more software components for a single organization server  or for multiple organization servers. For instance, if a user specifies a multi-server installation in steps  or , then the software provider  may identify separate and different virtual workplace software  to be installed on each of the organization's servers . Additionally, as discussed above, the virtual workplace software  for each server  may include a single downloadable software component  or a combination of components.","After analyzing the relevant information received in steps -, the software provider  may perform the determination in step  by selecting one or more virtual workplace software components  from a set of available software components based on the inputs and characteristics of the organization. For example, if the organization is an educational institution, then the software provider  may select virtual workplace software  that is equipped or preferred for educational institution usage. For instance, the selected virtual workplace software  for an educational institution may be lightweight, lower cost, and highly scalable. In another example, if the organization is a governmental institution, then the selected virtual workplace software  may be highly secure, highly resilient, and highly scalable. If the organization is a financial institution, then the selected virtual workplace software  may be high performance, highly secure, and flexible. If the organization is a healthcare institution, then the selected virtual workplace software  may be cost effective and moderately secure.","Additionally, although the software provider  in this example may analyze all inputs and relevant information received in steps -, in other examples the determination may be based on a smaller subset of factors or even a single factor. For instance, the virtual workplace software  may be selected based on organization type alone (step ), without regard to organization size (step ) or any specified software features\/characteristics (step ). Similarly, the virtual workplace software  may be selected based solely on organization size, or based solely on one or more specified software features\/characteristics, without regard for other factors or information received. In a particular example, the various factors may be weighted according to importance or relevance. Accordingly, each of steps , , and  may be optional in certain embodiments.","In step , the selection of the virtual workplace software  may be output and\/or the corresponding software may be provided to the organization. For example, the software provider  may output a description of the selected virtual workplace software  via a user interface. The description may include the selected software component(s) for one or more organization servers , along with additional information such as configuration settings for the software , cost estimates for the software , and other relevant data to allow users to review and compare potential virtual workplace software  implementations.","In certain embodiments, software provider  may provide the capabilities for users of the organization to review and\/or modify the selected virtual workplace software  and configuration settings, and then directly purchase the software  via the user interface. After it is purchased, the virtual workplace software  may be provided to the organization either directly or indirectly. For example, if a manager at a central office selects and purchases one or more virtual workplace software components  for an organization, the manager may request that the software components  be shipped to one or more various locations for installation by the organization personnel at those locations. In other examples, a manager, IT professional, or other user, may select and purchase virtual workplace software  directly from the organization server  on which the software  is to be installed. In these examples, the software provider  may allow the user to directly download and install the software  via the user interface.","Referring now to , a series of example user interface screens are shown in which virtual workplace software  may be selected and\/or provided to an organization to be deployed in a virtual workplace environment. As discussed above, the user interface screens in these examples may be provided by a software provider , for example, in a web-based application accessible using a web browser, or other client-server application.","In , the user interface  prompts a user to select an organization type from a predetermined set of organization types -. As described above, the organization types - in this example are merely illustrative, and different organization types may be provided in different examples. In certain embodiments, the user interface  may provide user interface components for selecting relevant organizational priorities, factors, or limitations (e.g., a price range, security requirements, scalability requirements, performance requirements, etc.), instead of, or in addition to, the product-based organization types shown in .","In , the user interface  provides a set of components allowing the user to select a set of features that may be included in the virtual workplace software . In this example, a user may add or remove a set of features - for VDI system software selected for a financial institution, including MAC VDI desktop support , PC VDI desktop support , hosted shared desktop support , and a set of business applications to be provided on the virtual machines . The prices of the respective software features - are displayed in the user interface, and a shopping cart  with a current total price is provided.","In , the user interface  provides a set of configuration components and options based on the features selected for the virtual workplace software . In this example, a set of features - have been selected for a VDI system, and the user may now review and configure one or more of the selected features - with the appropriate configuration options and settings. For example, a user may select a software configuration for a VDI system by identifying the selected software  as a single-server installation using a user interface component  (e.g., checkbox, numerical input, etc.). As another example, when configuring the hosted shared desktop support feature  for a VDI system, the user may be prompted to provide a site name and description to setup the hosted shared desktops.","In , the user interface  provides a summary screen including a description of the selected virtual workplace software  (e.g., a VDI system for a bank or financial institution), the selected features for the virtual workplace software , and the configuration settings and respective prices for the software features. In this example, users may review and\/or modify the selected virtual workplace software , features and configuration settings, and then either save the selection of the virtual workplace software  or proceed to purchase and\/or download the corresponding software .","In , the user interface  provides a purchasing screen allowing the user to buy the selected virtual workplace software , including the selected software features and having the selected configuration settings.","In , after the user has purchased the selected virtual workplace software , the user interface  may provide a downloading screen allowing the user to immediately download the selected virtual workplace software , including the selected software features and having the selected configuration settings, onto an organization server . In certain examples, the software downloading user interface  may prompt the user to run an installation program to install the virtual workplace software  directly onto the server . In other examples, the virtual workplace software  may be downloaded via the user interface , to be installed later on one or more different computers from the computer receiving the software download.","Having described various techniques, embodiments, and examples of providing virtual workplace software  to a desktop virtualization server  in , the following paragraphs describing  provide additional examples of various methods and systems for using the virtual workplace software  installed on a desktop virtualization server , for example, to provide virtual desktops to authenticated remote users at client devices  and\/or to provide virtual workplace management consoles to local or remote authenticated administrators.","Referring now to , a flow diagram is shown illustrating a method of providing virtual desktops and\/or a virtual workplace management consoles within a desktop virtualization system. The embodiments described in reference to the flow diagram in , and the example user interface screens in , may be implemented by software executed on one or more computer servers, such as the desktop virtualization server  and\/or additional computing devices configured to perform desktop virtualization functionality.","In step , a user at an organization server  or other computing device may provide input to a software provider  for determining a selection of virtual workplace software  for the organization server . Thus, as discussed above in steps -, the user may interact with a user interface provided by the software provider  (e.g., via a web browser or other client application) to provide various information regarding the organization and the features and configuration settings for the virtual workplace software  to be installed on the organization server . An organization user may, for example, identify an organization type, relevant organizational priorities, factors, or limitations, an organization size, and may specify and\/or configure various software features that may be included in virtual workplace software .","In step , the selected virtual workplace software , including the selected software features and having the selected configuration settings, may be downloaded and\/or installed on an organization server . Thus, after installation of the virtual workplace software , the server  may be referred to as a desktop virtualization server (or virtual workplace server)  and may be configured to perform one or more of the various desktop virtualization functions described herein (e.g., managing hypervisors , creating and managing virtual machines , and creating and managing connections between client access devices  and virtual machines , etc.).","In certain embodiments, rather than downloading the virtual workplace software , the virtual workplace software  may come pre-installed and packaged as a virtual appliance running on an open source operating system (e.g. Ubuntu or CentOS). In these examples, the user may simply load the virtual appliance and power it on, thereby potentially avoiding the tasks of installing the virtual workplace software  on the server  and integrating it into its environment.","In step , the virtual workplace server  may receive a login request from a client access device . In this example, the login request may include the user's authentication credentials (e.g., username and password), so that the virtual workplace server  may authenticate the login request to determine the user's identity and confirm that the user is a valid user within the desktop virtualization system. For example, the virtual workplace server  may provide a secure and\/or encrypted web page with a login window within a web-based application, or may use other secure authentication techniques, to request and receive the user's authentication credentials.","After receiving and validating the user's authentication credentials (e.g., username-password combination), the virtual workplace server  may then retrieve a set of user permissions and\/or security credentials associated with user, for example, a user account or user profile, access control lists (ACL) for the user and\/or user groups associated with the user, or other security\/permissions information.","The login request received in step  also may include an indication of one or more types of service requested by the user via the client access device . For example, the login request in step  may be a request by a user to login to a virtual machine  and initiate a virtual desktop session at the client device . In other examples, the login request in step  may be a request by an authorized administrator to perform management functions associated with the desktop virtualization system. The indication of what type of services the user is requesting may be determined implicitly, for example, by receiving a login request via a web page or other client user interface dedicated to a specific function (e.g., initiating a virtual desktop session on a specific virtual machine). In other examples, a user may login via a multi-purpose login screen, from which users may initiate different types of virtual desktop sessions on various different virtual machines, or may perform one or more management functions for the desktop virtualization system.","In step , the virtual workplace server  determines whether the logged in user is an administrator authorized to perform management functions, or a non-administrator user that is only authorized to initiate virtual desktop sessions at one or more virtual machines . In this example, if the user is an authorized administrator, the administrator may be directed to the user interface of a management console in step  that is provided to allow the administrator to perform the various management functions for the desktop virtualization system. If the user is not an administrator in this example, the user may be prompted or directed to initiate a virtual desktop session in step , and might not be permitted to access the management console user interface.","In other embodiments, the user interface and\/or functionality made available to the user may be determined using other techniques as well. For example, during the authentication process the virtual workplace server  may identify a set of functions and\/or interactions that the user is authorized to perform on the desktop virtualization system. For example, a first low-level user may be authorized to initiate a virtual desktop session at certain virtual machines , however, the user might not be authorized for sessions at other virtual machines  or to perform any management functions. Other users may have authorization for different sets of functions and\/or interactions relating to initiating virtual desktop sessions at virtual machines  and to perform various management functions on the system. Thus, after identifying the user and determining (e.g., retrieving from the server memory ) the set of functions\/interactions that the user is authorized to perform, the virtual workplace server  may customize the user interface options based on the user's permissions. For instance, if a user is only authorized to initiate a virtual desktop session at a single virtual machine , then upon logging in to the server  the user may be immediately prompted or redirected to initiate a virtual desktop session at that virtual machine , without having the option to connect to other virtual machines  or access a management console. As another example, if the server  determines that an administrator is authorized to perform certain management functions and not others, then the server  may provide the authorized administrator with a management console user interface including the set of functions that the administrator is authorized to perform, and not including any functions that the administrator is not authorized to perform.","Referring now to , a series of example user interface screens are shown for a web-based user interface provided by virtual workplace server  to allow users to initiate a virtual desktop sessions and\/or perform management functions within the desktop virtualization system.","In , an example web page user interface screen  is shown including a login window . As discussed above, the user interface screen  may be generated by the virtual workplace server  to be accessed by a user on a client access device  or other computing device. In this example, upon entering a username and password, the user may be provided a virtual desktop if they are an authorized end user, or may be entered into the management console if they are an authorized administrator. Additionally, if an authorized end user has access to many types of virtual desktops (e.g., different virtual machines  or virtual machine templates), then user interface screen  may allow the user to select a virtual machine  or template on which to initiate a virtual desktop session.","In this example, a connection broker software component within the virtual workplace software  may accept the user credentials and provide the validation and connectivity service. If the user is an administrator, the connection broker may authenticate the user and, if valid, may provide access to the management console. If the user's credentials are invalid, the connection broker may notify the user that they do not have the privilege to access the management console. If the user is a non-administrator end user, the connection broker may poll the state engine  to determine if the user is authorized for access to a virtual desktop (e.g., virtual machine ). If not, the connection broker may return an error notification to the user. Otherwise, if the user is authorized to access one or more virtual desktops, and if at least one of such virtual machines  is available, the connection broker may provide an Internet Protocol (IP) address of an available virtual machine  to the client application. If the user is authorized but no virtual machines  are currently available, the connection broker may instruct the policy engine  to create a new virtual machine  appropriate to the user's needs and authentication credentials. If the user already has an existing virtual desktop session and has specified (e.g., via the login screen user interface) that they want to connect to the existing session, the connection broker may enable that connection.","After an authorized end user logs in to initiate a virtual desktop session, the desktop agent  running on the virtual machine  may notify the virtual workplace software  that a user has logged in and may provide the credentials of the user. The virtual workplace software  may use this information to update the records of active user sessions and to confirm that the logged-in user is the same as the user authenticated by the connection broker. Similarly, after an end user logs out of a virtual desktop session, the desktop agent  running on the virtual machine  may notify the virtual workplace software  that the user has logged out of the virtual machine . The virtual workplace software  may use this information, along with the template policy of the virtual machine , to determine what to do with the virtual machine . For instance, based on the virtual machine's  template policy, the virtual workplace software  may determine that it should immediately destroy the virtual machine  and create a fresh one, or it may schedule the virtual machine  for a later destruction-creation, or it might not destroy the virtual machine  at all unless it is explicitly requested by an administrator. Other virtual desktop management policies are also possible. Additionally, the virtual workplace software  may use the logout information to update the records of active user sessions. As noted above, the desktop agents  also may send periodic messages to the virtual workplace software  indicating that it the virtual machine  is alive. These periodic messages may allow the virtual workplace software  to ensure that user sessions are active and functional.","In order for a user to interact with a virtual machine  from a client access device  in a virtual desktop session, a remoting protocol may be used. One example is the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. (\u201cMicrosoft\u201d), however, the desktop virtualization systems and methods described herein need not be limited to one or more remoting protocol(s), but may be performed using multiple different remoting protocols applicable to server and client agents in which the server agent executes on the virtual machine  and the client agent runs on the client access device . Using a remoting protocol, keyboard and mouse inputs from the client access device  may be communicated to the remoting protocol server agent on the desktop agent , which in turn communicates the inputs to the operating system of the virtual machine . The virtual machine  operating system may process the user input and communicate changes to the virtual machine, including all user interface changes, back to the client agent running on the client access device .","In , an example web page user interface screen  is shown for configuring and initializing the virtual workplace software . These functions may be performed locally on the desktop virtualization server , or remotely from another computer (e.g., client access device ). In configuring the virtual workplace software , the user may identify the hypervisor  to allow the actuation engine  to manage the hypervisor  by sending commands and receiving responses and status information from the hypervisor . In this example, the user may enter a unique identifier of the hypervisor, for example, its IP address or DNS name, along with its storage system, and valid user credentials for accessing the hypervisor . In other examples, additional configuration information may be required depending on the hypervisor  and the level of resource management the virtual workplace software  is designed to provide.","Additionally, in certain embodiments, user management may involve integrating with an LDAP or Active Directory server that may contain information about the users in the organization and their computer user names. In such examples, this database of user information may be used to assign users to virtual machine templates without having to re-enter the user names. As when identifying the hypervisor , when integrating with an LDAP or Active Directory server, a unique identifier (e.g., IP address or DNS name) and credentials for a valid account on the server  may be needed.","In , a set of example web page user interface screens - are shown creating and managing the lifecycle of virtual machine templates. As discussed above, a virtual machine template may include an image of a specific virtual machine , including its operating system (e.g., Windows XP, MAC OS), its applications, and configuration and user settings. Additionally, a virtual machine template may include its desktop agent  that communicates with the virtual workplace software  and the remoting protocol server agent at the client access devices . A virtual machine template also may include certain metadata and policy information, for example:\n\n","In certain examples, multiple virtual machine templates with different metadata and policy information may utilize the same base desktop image.","Virtual machine templates may be created from an existing virtual machine  running a desktop operating system (e.g. Windows XP, Ubuntu), or from another template created by the virtual workplace software . When creating a virtual machine template from an existing virtual machine , the existing virtual machine  may be imported into the hypervisor , for example, using tools provided by the hypervisor vendor.","In the example shown in , when one of the buttons  or  is selected, the user interface may prompt the user to specify the name of a virtual machine template () or a specific virtual machine  (). Then, the virtual workplace software  may verify that the specified entity (i.e., template or virtual machine) exists, and then use the hypervisor API to power the entity on and provide a set of controls  to take the entity through the template creation lifecycle.","In this example, the virtual machine template creation and modification process may include the following steps:\n\n","After a new virtual machine template is created and saved (or after an existing virtual machine template is modified and saved), the template may appear in the list of virtual machine templates  shown in . In this example, the template list  may provide template information and any necessary controls for an administrator to access, modify, copy, and delete the template throughout its lifetime.","Referring now to , an example web page user interface screen  is shown for associating users and groups of users with various virtual machine templates. In this example, the left pane  includes a list of the virtual machine templates currently stored on the server , and the right pane  includes two tab-controlled lists of users and groups. The administrator may select a virtual machine template from the left pane , and then select one or more users and\/or groups from the right pane  to associate those users\/groups with the selected template. In certain embodiments, the lists users and groups  may be obtained from LDAP or Active Directory, or may be stored and maintained manually in a database (e.g., storage system ) by the virtual workplace software . Once the associations between users\/groups and templates have been selected and stored, these associations may be retrieved during the authorization process to determine which users and groups have access to which virtual machines . For example, the associations of users and groups to templates may be kept in persistent server storage  and used by the connection broker of the virtual workplace software  to determine the type of virtual machine  to provide to an end user. As discussed above, users and groups also may have the ability to access and initiate virtual desktop sessions with more than one type of virtual machine . In this case, users may be permitted to choose one of their associated virtual machine templates during or after login time in order to initiate a virtual desktop session with a virtual machine from that template.","Referring now to , an example web page user interface screen  is shown of a real time system view and operation screen for the desktop virtualization server  and\/or the desktop virtualization system as a whole (e.g., for multi-server installations). In this example, the real time system view screen includes three sections, a desktops list , a user sessions list , and a capacity bar .","The desktops list  provides a list of information for each virtual machine template currently stored at the server . For each template, the desktops list  in this example includes the maximum and minimum number of virtual machines  that are to be created from that template, and the number of virtual machines  based on that template that are \u201cactive\u201d (i.e., in use), \u201cready\u201d (i.e., waiting to be logged into by users), and \u201cstarting\u201d (i.e., in the process of being dynamically created).","The user sessions list  in this example provides a list of information about each currently active user session supported by a virtual machine  on the server . For each active session, the sessions list  includes the user, the type of virtual machine (i.e., the template) being used for the session, the IP address of the virtual machine  being used, the IP address of the client access device , and information corresponding to when and for how long the user has been logged in. In different examples, additional relevant information may be provided in the user sessions list  to further allow users to manage, monitor, and record information about the active user sessions on the server . In certain embodiments, user interface  may provide a control enabling the administrator to select and terminate a user session from the list .","Capacity bar  may be used to provide a high-level view of the current capacity of the server . In this example, the capacity bar  provides a visual representation of the server's capacity with respect to a combination of the server's  active and ready virtual machines . In other examples, the capacity bar section  may include multiple capacity bars to separately display the capacities for the server's  active and ready virtual machines . Additional capacity bars and\/or other data may be included as well, for example, an estimated server capacity if the maximum number of virtual machines  were to be created for all existing templates on the server .","Various aspects described herein may be embodied as a method, an apparatus, or as one or more computer-readable media storing computer-executable instructions. Accordingly, those aspects may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment, or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. Any and\/or all of the method steps described herein may be embodied in computer-executable instructions.
