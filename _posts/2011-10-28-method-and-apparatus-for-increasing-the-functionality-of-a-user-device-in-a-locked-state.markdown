{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. On a daily basis, users utilize different user devices (e.g., mobile phones, PDAs, computers, etc.) to perform various tasks (e.g., make phone calls, check emails, chat, log onto an internet service, etc.) User devices, such as those with touch screens and\/or keypads, have a locking feature to avoid any accidental functioning and\/or unauthorized use of the user device. The lock screen, however, requires additional time to unlock before accessing and using an application and\/or a service that is run on the user device. There is a need, therefore, to increase the functionality of the user device while it is in an, at least in part, locked state.","Some Example Embodiments","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for increasing utility of a process for unlocking a user device while the device is in an, at least in part, locked state.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises causing, at least in part, a presentation of a first user interface associated with an, at least in part, locked state of a device.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for increasing utility of a process for unlocking a user device while the device is in an, at least in part, locked state are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Accordingly, a system  of  introduces the capability to combine functionality of particular applications with an unlocking process at a user device (e.g., when the user device is locked) and to efficiently present one or more beneficial services to the user. For example, when a user wants to unlock a device (e.g., indicated by the user activating the screen of an, at least in part, locked device), the system  can display the normal unlocking user interface with additional user interface elements from a second or unrelated application or user interface. In one embodiment, The second application or user interface can (1) present information (e.g., advertising information); (2) display a competition question, poll, or etc; (3) request any interaction with another application presented in the lock screen; and the like. Then, depending on how the user chooses to interact with the lock screen (e.g., unlock the screen normally, answer a challenge or poll question, interact with the other application, etc.), the system  can unlock the device and provide additional functionality based on the nature of the interactions and the applications supporting the interactions.","In other words, the system  enables one or more applications to determine when a user device is in an, at least in part, locked state, determine when a user attempts to unlock the user device and determine to combine functionalities of one or more applications with the unlocking process for presenting one or more services, contents and\/or applications to the user.","For example, steps of combining one or more applications with unlocking process of a user device such as that discussed above may be as follows: get the user device from the user's pocket, press a key on a keypad or press the power button, an application on the user device indicates that the user device is in an, at least in part, locked state, presents a first user interface prompting the user to enter a user password, present a second user interface prompting the user to interact with the second user interface wherein upon receiving correct entries in both the first and second user interfaces, the user device is unlocked and one or more applications, services and\/or contents are presented to the user either preceding or succeeding the unlocking of the user device. In this example, the application or a sub-process of the application for presenting the second user interface in an, at least in part, locked state can be running and accessible without having to unlock the phone, search for the application, access the application and run the application. Such an implementation may be based on close integration between a device's software and an application processing manager because lock screen content and behavior is usually controlled by the device's resident operating system. In one embodiment, the integration may be enabled by an operating system provided application programming interface to access lock screen rendering and functionality.","In various embodiments, a user device may be locked by a user and\/or may have one or more predefined and\/or configurable configurations for automatically locking the user device wherein portions of a touch screen area and\/or a keypad area of the user device would be locked in order to prevent accidental operation and\/or unauthorized use of the device. Further, a user may initiate an unlocking process by interacting with the user device via one or more keys on a keypad, a power button, a touch on one or more portions of a touch screen, audio (e.g., voice input), video (e.g., facial gestures), hand gestures and movements, or a combination thereof wherein the user may enter\/submit one or more user passwords\/passcodes for unlocking the user device for utilization.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  having connectivity to an application processing platform , content providers -(collectively referred to as content provider ), and a service platform  via a communication network . In one embodiment, the UE  has sensors  the detect context information about the location of the UE  and\/or orientation information about the UE . The UE  may be in an, at least in part, locked state, and once a display is activated, the UE  displays one or more applications  such as a user interface, a map, a media player, a web browser, a messaging application, that may be one of many applications functioning in the locked state. The UE  may switch between applications  and\/or alternative views based on a movement of and\/or an attempt to utilize the UE , which may be detected by the sensors , application processing manager  and\/or one or more applications . The application processing platform  may be resident within the UE  or external to the UE  and\/or the functionality of the application processing platform  may be replaced or shared by an application processing manager  that is resident within the UE . For simplicity, the application processing manager  will be described in the context of the application processing platform , herein. The application processing platform  may determine whether a switch or a button of the UE  has been actuated, whether a standard power mode or a low power mode should be activated on the UE  for running an application in the locked state, and process any context information that the processing platform  may receive by way of the sensors , for example. In one embodiment, the UE  includes a data collection module  for collecting information such as user profile information, use history, user preferences, location information and the like. In certain embodiments, one or more GPS satellites  may be utilized in determining the location of the UE  in connection with one or more spatiotemporal or GPS transceivers of the data collection module .","Further, one or more information items presented\/submitted by a user during an unlocking process may be presented for evaluation to the service platform , the content provider  and\/or the application processing platform  via a communication network .","Furthermore, one or more content items include one or more identifiers, metadata, access addresses (e.g., network address such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address; or a local address such as a file or storage location in a memory of the UE , description, or the like associated with the content. In one embodiment, content includes live media (e.g., streaming broadcasts), stored media (e.g., stored on a network or locally), metadata associated with media, text information or a combination thereof. Also, the content may be provided by the service platform  which (e.g., music service, mapping service, video service, social networking service, content broadcasting service, etc.), the content provider  (e.g., online content retailers, public databases, etc.) and\/or other content sources available or accessible via the communication network .","By way of example, the UE  may execute the applications  to receive content and\/or mapping information from the content provider  or other components of the communication network . As mentioned above, the UE  may utilize GPS satellites  and\/or assisted GPS (A-GPS) to determine the location of the UE  to utilize one or more contents and\/or one or more location-based services provided by the service platform .","In certain embodiments, the UE  may be in an, at least in part, locked state and when a user attempts to unlock the user device, the application processing manager  may cause, at least in part, a combining of one or more applications with a password application for unlocking the user device. For example, a UE  is in an, at least in part, locked state and a user attempts to unlock the UE . The application processing manager  presents a password application and substantially concurrently one or more other applications (e.g., a media item, a map, a text box, etc.) on the user interface of the UE .","In one embodiment, a first user interface (UI) associated with an, at least in part, locked state of a user device is presented to a user. For example, the UI prompts the user to enter a password wherein the password may include one or more entries of textual, numerical, graphical, biometric, and the like parameters. For example, a user has setup a password including text, special and numerical characters, for example, \u201cfootball-is-number-1\u201d. In another example, the password is an audio capture of the user's voice uttering a predefined number of words (e.g., \u201cI love soccer\u201d).","In various embodiments, one or more portions of a second user interface are presented associated with the first user interface, wherein the second user interface is associated with one or more applications and\/or one or more services, wherein the one or more applications and\/or the one or more services relate, at least in part, to an advertising service, a polling service, a competition service, a testing service and the like. For example, a user is presented with a question\/challenge and a prompt (e.g., a second UI) for entering\/selecting an answer to the question wherein the prompt may be combined and\/or integrated with the first UI. In another embodiment, one or more interactions with the first user interface and\/or with the one or more portions of the second user interface are determined and\/or are processed to cause, at least in part, a change of the device to an, at least in part, unlocked state. For example, (1) a user attempts to unlock a user device, (2) is prompted in a first prompt (e.g., in a first UI) to enter his predefined password (e.g., a numeric code), (3) is prompted in a second prompt (e.g., a second UI) to enter\/select (e.g., second entry) between a list of burger restaurants.","In other embodiments, the one or more applications, the one or more services and\/or the one or more interactions are determined, at least in part, by the device, a service provider, a content provider and the like. In one embodiment, the application processing manager  on the user device determines the one or more interactions between the user and the user device, for example, whether the user correctly answered a question presented in the second prompt. In another embodiment, the one or more interactions are processed by a service provider to ascertain validity of the user response. For example, the service provider may have presented a question (e.g., what is the cost of a burger?) related to a certain vendor (e.g., Joe's Burgers), wherein one or more incentives (e.g., a coupon for Joe's Burgers) can be presented to the user upon receiving a correct response from the user.","In various embodiments, the user has a choice to ignore the second prompt and proceed to present the password for evaluation by an application (e.g., a password application) for unlocking the device, or the user can respond to the second prompt wherein the first entry (e.g., the password entry) and the second entry (e.g., a selection of a burger restaurant) are presented to one or more applications for evaluation and for unlocking the device, and wherein one or more applications, one or more services or a combination thereof may be presented on a UI preceding or succeeding an unlocking of the user device.","In another embodiment, one or more interactions by the user with the user device are processed in order to determine whether one or more functions of one or more applications and\/or one or more services are to be initiated. For example, if the user elects to interact with the second prompt (e.g., answers a questions presented in the second UI portion), then one or more applications and\/or services (e.g., an application to present a coupon) may be initiated. In another example, if the user decides not to interact with the second prompt (e.g., ignore, cancel, etc.) then the password entered by the user in the first prompt is evaluated and if valid, the user device is unlocked.","In another embodiment, one or more content items may be cached at the user device (e.g., stored at the storage device in the user device). For example, a service provider can send (e.g., via a wireless service, via internet, etc.) to the user device one or more contents (e.g., applications, widgets, contents, services and the like) so that the user device may store the one or more contents at the user device and utilize them as needed. In a user case scenario, a service provider sends several coupons (e.g., related to one or more services and\/or products) to a user device and the user device stores the coupons at a local storage. Further, the user device can monitor user activity (e.g., user is near a shopping mall) and can utilize one or more of the contents to present to the user, if the user attempts to unlock the user device while near the shopping mall. In another embodiment, the user device may contact a service provider and\/or a content provider to request for one or more contents, for example, while the user device is idle, or there are no more locally stored contents, or free and\/or low cost connection is available, or remaining locally stored content does not match user preferences and the like.","In another embodiment, one or more interactions by the user with the user device can cause, at least in part, a generation of the one or more content items. For example, the application processing manager  may determine that the last interaction by the user with the user device before the user device was locked (e.g., by the user or automatically) was that the user was consuming a media item (e.g., listening to a musical album by an artist) wherein the application processing manager , the service platform  and\/or the content provider  can cause to generate one or more content items related to the media item (e.g., short segment of a new song by the artist) and present it (e.g., play it) to the user during the next unlocking process if the user chooses to accept the content.","In another embodiment, one or more interactions by the user with the user device are processed to determine one or more applications, one or more services, or a combination thereof. For example, a user may be utilizing an application on the user device to study\/learn a language; further the application processing manager  can determine to combine with the unlocking process a presentation of a language skills task (e.g., translation of a word into a different language). In another embodiment, the user can predefine that anytime the user attempts to unlock the user device, the application processing manager  should cause one more applications to present a predefined task for the user (e.g., translate a word into a target language) wherein the application processing manager  can cause the one or more applications and\/or the one or more services from a local storage, from a service provider and\/or a content provider. In another example, the user may be touring a museum and attempts to unlock his user device wherein the application processing manager  can combine with the unlocking process a presentation of an image of a painting being exhibited in the museum and further can present a question related to the painting.","In another embodiment, one or more interaction histories are generated based, at least in part, on one or more interactions by the user with the user device. For example, the application processing manager  can generate an interaction history indicating that a user has elected to interact more frequently with one or more particular applications and\/or services than other applications and\/or services. In various embodiments, the service platform  and\/or the content provider  may collect the user interaction information and generate one or more interaction histories.","In another embodiment, by processing the interaction history, the application processing manager , the service platform  and\/or the content provider  can determine one or more applications and\/or one or more services to be rendered\/presented to the user during an unlocking process. For example, a user interaction history may indicate that the user favors interaction with certain types of applications and\/or service. For example, an interaction history may indicate that a user more frequently interacts with sports related applications and\/or services. In another example, a user may be interacting with applications and\/or services only during certain time of the day (e.g., during lunch time, after office hours, etc.)","In one embodiment, the application processing manager , the service platform  and\/or the content provider  can cause, at least in part, an initiation of one or more applications and\/or one or more services based, at least in part, on a change of the user device to an, at least in part, unlocked state. For example, if a user elects to interact with a second prompt during an unlocking process of the user device, then once the user device is in the unlocked state, one or more applications and\/or one or more services can be initiated and presented to the user. In another example, if during the unlocking process the user interacted with a second prompt related to a service (e.g., music download), then once the user device is unlocked, one or more applications and\/or one or more services are initiated and presented to the user in a UI wherein the user may further interact with the one or more applications and\/or one or more services (e.g., follow a link to a music website.) In another embodiment, one or more applications and\/or one or more services initiated in the locked state may continue on to the unlocked state of the user device. For example, if during an unlocking process of a user device a user interacted with one or more applications and\/or one or more services (e.g., music download), then the one or more applications and\/or the one or more services may continue on and initiate one or more applications and\/or one or more services (e.g., launch an application, connect to a website, play a musical selection identified in the second prompt in the unlocking process and\/or download the musical selection.)","In certain embodiments, the UE  may be running an application in an, at least in part, locked state and wherein the application may have multiple views or user interfaces available. The user, in this embodiment, may switch between views, user interfaces, or applications by actuating a switch (e.g., physical or virtual) that is part of the UE . For example, the user may hit a power button on the UE  to activate a display, and may then hit the power button again, or a volume button to change the view.","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the sensors  may be any of a camera, an orientation sensor, a movement sensor, a location sensor, a proximity sensor, a light sensor and the like.","By way of example, the UE , the application processing platform , the content provider ; and service platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer ) header, a data-link (layer ) header, an internetwork (layer ) header and a transport (layer ) header, and various application (layer , layer  and layer ) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","101","101","101","117","201","203","205","101","207","101","209","211","213","215","111","101","207","101"]},"As mentioned previously, the location module  can determine a user's location, which can be determined by a triangulation system such as GPS, assisted GPs (A-GPS), Cell of Origin, or other location extrapolation technologies. Standard GPS and A-GPS systems can use GPS satellites  to pinpoint the location of a UE . The location module  may also utilize multiple technologies to detect the location of the UE , for example, a Cell-of-Origin system can be used to determine the cellular tower that a cellular UE  is synchronized with. This information provides a coarse location of the UE  because the cellular tower can have a unique cellular identifier (cell-ID) that can be geographically mapped. Location coordinates (e.g., GPS coordinates) can give finer detail as to the location of the UE  when one or more location-based services are utilized and synchronized with the communication network .","The context module  receives context information by way of the communication module  about the UE  that may be detected by the sensors . A user profile may also be resident on the UE  or receivable from another network entity that communicates with the application processing platform . The context information that is received may be processed by the context module  to determine locations of interest to a user of the UE  such as landmarks, restaurants, bars, transportation information, hotels, etc. The display module  determines what information is to be displayed, and based on the determination made by the actuation determination module , determines which user interface or view of the application or other applications is to be displayed.","In one embodiment, the communication module  can be used to communicate with a service platform  or other UEs . Certain communications can be via methods such as an internet protocol, messaging (e.g., SMS, MMS, etc.), or any other communication method (e.g., via the communication network ). In some examples, the UE  can send a request to the content provider  and\/or to the service platform  via the communication module . The content provider  and\/or the service platform  may then send a response back via the communication module . In certain embodiments, location and\/or orientation information is used to generate a request for content and\/or services.","The user interface  can include various methods of communication. For example, the user interface  can have outputs including a visual component (e.g., a screen), an audio component, a physical component (e.g., vibrations), and other methods of communication. User inputs can include a touch-screen interface, a scroll-and-click interface, a button interface, a microphone, etc. Moreover, the user interface  may be used to display maps, navigation information, camera images and streams, augmented reality application information, POIs, virtual reality map images, panoramic images and the like from the memory  and\/or received via the communication module . Input can be via one or more methods such as voice input, textual input, typed input, typed touch-screen input, other touch-enabled input, etc. Further, the user interface  can additionally be utilized to add content, interact with content, manipulate content, or the like. Further, the user interface  may be utilized to filter content from a presentation and\/or select criteria. Moreover, the user interface may be used to manipulate objects, cause presentation of images or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 7"],"b":["109","300","109","207","300","101","115"]},"In step , the application processing manager  causes, at least in part, a presentation of a first user interface associated with an, at least in part, locked state of a device. In one embodiment, one or more portions of one or more user interfaces (e.g., a touch screen, a keypad, etc.) on UE  are locked. In one embodiment, one or more sensors on the UE  (e.g., a power button, a key on a keypad, an accelerometer, etc.) detect one or more interactions (e.g., a touch on the screen, a key press, a movement of the UE , etc.) Further, upon detection of the one or more interactions, the application processing manager  present a UI wherein a user may enter\/submit one or more passwords (e.g., textual, numerical, audio, biometrical, a combination thereof, etc.) for evaluation.","In step , the application processing manager  causes, at least in part, a rendering of at least a portion of a second user interface associated with the first user interface, wherein the second user interface is associated with one or more applications, one or more services, or a combination thereof.
