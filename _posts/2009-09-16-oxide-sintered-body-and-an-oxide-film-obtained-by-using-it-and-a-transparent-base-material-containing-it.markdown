This application also claims the benefit of Japanese Application No. 2006-31201, filed in Japan on Feb. 8, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an oxide sintered body which mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen, and a transparent base material comprising an oxide film obtained using the oxide sintered body and its oxide film.","In particular, it relates to a transparent base material comprising an oxide sintered body having a low content of an indium oxide phase, and an oxide film with high light transmittance at a near-ultraviolet region wherein a film is formed by using the oxide sintered body as a sputtering target.","2. Description of the Related Art","Since a transparent conductive oxide film is excellent in electrical conductivity and light transmittance in a visible region, it has been used as a transparent electrode of various devices.","As a practical thing, tin oxide (SnO) which contains antimony and fluorine as a dopant, zinc oxide (ZnO) which contains aluminium and gallium as a dopant, indium oxide (InO) which contains Sn as a dopant etc., have been known.","Especially, among them, the indium oxide film which contains Sn as dopant is called ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide) film, and it has been extensively used since the transparent conductive oxide film having low resistance can be obtained easily.","As a method of forming a transparent conductive oxide film, the sputtering method, the evaporation method, the ion plating method, and the chemical solution coating method have been used widely.","Among such methods, a sputtering method is an effective method, when using material with a low vapor pressure, or when precise film thickness control is needed.","In the sputtering method, generally, argon gas is used under gas pressure of about 10 Pa or less, a substrate is used as an anode, and a sputtering target which is a raw material of the transparent conductive oxide film to be formed as a cathode and voltage is supplied to them.","Between the electrodes to which voltage is applied, glow discharge occurs, and then argon plasma occurs, and argon ions in plasma collide with the sputtering target of the cathode.","Particles which are flipped one after another off by this collision are deposited one by one on the substrate, and a thin film is formed.","The sputtering method is classified according to generating method of argon plasma. A method using plasma generated by high frequency power is called as RF sputtering method, and a method using plasma generated by direct current power is called as direct current sputtering method.","Especially, the direct current sputtering method is an optimal film forming method since it has such features that there are less heat damages to a substrate, high-speed film forming is possible, power supply equipment is cheap, and operation is simple and so on.","Generally, the direct current sputtering method is used for formation of ITO film.","The ITO film formed at room temperature shows low specific resistance of 5\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm.","The ITO film is good also about the light transmittance of a visible region, and has the light transmittance of an average of 80% or more.","Moreover, it is excellent at chemical and thermal stability.","The luminescent material and luminescence device which have a function of near-ultraviolet light luminescence (for example, wavelength of 300 nm\u02dc400 nm) (for example, LED, laser, organic or inorganic EL) have been widely used and these development have been made briskly (with respect to a near-ultraviolet LED, refer to Applied physics, volume 68 (1999), No. 2, pp. 152-155, and SEI Technical Review, September, 2004 (No. 165), and pp. 75\u02dc78) Applied physics, the 68th volume (1999), No. 2, pp. 152\u02dc155 and the SEI technical review, the September, 2004 (No. 165), and pp. 75\u02dc78)","A transparent electrode is indispensable to these electron devices also.","In a conventional luminescence device in which importance is given to visible light with wavelength of 400 nm\u02dc800 nm, the ITO film and the transparent conductive oxide film of ZnO and the like or SnOand the like have been used as a transparent electrode.","These conventional transparent conductive oxide films had characteristics such that an average transmittance of a visible light with wavelength of 400 nm\u02dc800 nm is excellent, but to a near ultraviolet light with wavelength that was short wave less than 400 nm, transmittance was not sufficient since an absorption occurs at the wavelength of 400 nm.","The following proposals have been made for a transparent conductive oxide film applied to a luminescent material or a luminescence device (for example, LED, laser, organic or inorganic EL) which has a luminescence function of the near-ultraviolet light (for example, wavelength of 300 nm-400 nm).","In Japanese published unexamined patent application Toku Kai Hei 7-182924, it has been proposed that gallium indium oxide (GaInO) which is doped by a little amount of different valent dopants like a quadrivalent ion.","It is disclosed that since a crystal film of this oxide is excellent at transparency and has low refractive index of about 1.6, refractive-index consistency with a glass substrate is improved, and furthermore, electrical conductivity comparable as that of a broad prohibition area semiconductor which has been currently used can be realized. However, as for the crystal film disclosed there, absorption of a near-ultraviolet light occurs, and it is difficult to use it industrially without improvement since film forming at a high temperature, that is, a substrate temperature of 250\u00b0 C.\u02dc500\u00b0 C. is required.","In Published Unexamined Patent Application Toku Kai 2002-093243, an ultraviolet transparent conductive oxide film has been proposed, and it has been disclosed that the ultraviolet transparent conductive oxide film is characterized in that it consists of GaOcrystal, and in the range of the wavelength of 240 nm\u02dc800 nm, or wavelength (240 nm\u02dc400 nm), it is transparent, and has electrical conductivity owing to an oxygen defect or a dopant element, and manufacturing is carried out by using one of methods of pulsed laser deposition method, sputtering method, CVD method, and MBE method under such condition that one element or more elements of Sn, Ge, Si, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W is used as a dopant, and a substrate temperature is set at 600\u00b0 C.\u02dc1500\u00b0 C., and oxygen partial pressure is set at 0\u02dc1 Pa, have been shown.","In order to acquire electrical conductivity, it is necessary to form a film of GaOcrystal film shown in the above, at a substrate temperature of 600\u00b0 C.\u02dc1500\u00b0 C.","Since this temperature range is too high, industrial use is very difficult.","Recently, inventors of the present invention have found, as disclosed in the patent application No. 2005-252788, a new transparent conductive thin laminated film, which has not only a high transmittance in a visible region, and a low surface resistance (6\u03a9\/\u25a1\u02dc500\u03a9\/\u25a1), but also has a high light transmittance in a visible light short wavelength region with wavelength of 380 nm\u02dc400 nm and also in a near-ultraviolet light region (300 nm\u02dc380 nm) of short wavelength.","Namely, the inventors have found out that the above-mentioned subject can be solved, by having paid attention to a transparent conductive film having a lamination structure in which a surface of a metal thin film is covered by a transparent thin film of oxide, in a transparent conductive film wherein the transparent thin film of oxide is thin film of an amorphous oxide which mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen, or the transparent thin film of the amorphous oxide which mainly consists of gallium and oxygen, and the gallium contained in the transparent thin film of oxide is contained at a rate 35 at. % or more, and less than 100 at. % to all metal atoms.","The object of the present invention is to provide an oxide film having a high light transmittance in a near-ultraviolet light region where a shortest wavelength in which the light transmittance of the film itself becomes 50% or more is 320 nm or less, or an oxide sintered body which can be used for a sputtering target required for obtaining the oxide film, and furthermore a transparent base material containing the obtained oxide film.","After having eagerly studied various kinds of oxide sintered bodies in order to attain such purposes, the inventors of the present invention have found that an oxide sintered body which mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen, wherein a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and less than 100 at. % with respect to all metallic elements, and a content of the gallium is preferably more than 65 at. % and 90 at. % or less with respect to all metallic elements, is very useful as a source of oxide film formation.","The inventors have found that when an oxide film is formed by a sputtering method by using this oxide sintered body as a sputtering target for example, an amorphous oxide film wherein the oxide film which mainly consists of gallium, indium and oxygen, and a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and less than 100 at. % with respect to all metallic elements, and a content of the gallium is preferably more than 65 at. % and 90 at. % or less with respect to all metallic elements, is an oxide film in which a shortest wavelength, where the light transmittance of the film itself becomes 50%, is 320 nm or less.","Furthermore, in order to obtain such an oxide film, the inventors have found out that it is necessary to form a film using the sputtering target which can control generation of a indium oxide phase (InOphase) of the bixbyite type structure which causes decrease of light transmittance of an oxide film at a wavelength of 400 nm or less, and eventually they have invented the present invention.","Namely, the first invention of the present application provides an oxide sintered body characterised in that it mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen, wherein a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and less than 100 at. % with respect to all metallic elements, and a density of the sintered body is 5.0 g\/cmor more","The second invention of the present application provides the oxide sintered body of the claim , wherein a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and 90 at. % or less with respect to all metallic elements, and a density of the sintered body is 5.5 g\/cmor more and when it is used as a sputtering target, it is possible to form a film by the direct current sputtering method.","The third invention of the present application provides the oxide sintered body of the claim  or , wherein it is constituted by one phase or more selected from a gallium-oxide phase which has \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaOphase), a gallium-indium-oxide phase having \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaInOphase) or (Ga, In)Ophases.","The fourth invention of the present application provides the oxide sintered body according to the

However, the present invention is not limited to the following embodiments.","The oxide sintered body according to the present invention, comprises an oxide sintered body which mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen, wherein a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and less than 100 at. % with respect to all metallic elements, and the density of the oxide sintered body is 5.0 g\/cmor more.","Further, the oxide sintered body comprises gallium, a content of which is more than 65 at. % and 90 at. % or less with respect to all metallic elements, and the density of the sintered body is 5.5 g\/cmor more, and when it is used as a sputtering target, it is possible to form a film by a direct current sputtering method.","Furthermore, the oxide sintered body according to the present invention is an oxide sintered body which mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen. However, if it is mainly constituted by the above-mentioned elements, other inevitable impurity can be included.","It is desired that the above-mentioned oxide sintered body is constituted by one phase or more phases selected from a gallium-oxide phase which has \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaOphase), a gallium-indium-oxide phase having \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaInOphase), or (Ga, In)Ophases.","When the oxide sintered body has one phase or more phases selected from a gallium-oxide phase which has \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaOphase), a gallium-indium-oxide phase which has \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaInOphase), or (Ga, In)Ophase phases, and it is constituted by an indium oxide phase (InOphase) of bixbyite type structure, it is desirable that a ratio in which the indium oxide phase (InOphase) of the bixbyite type structure is contained is 5% or less in term of X-ray diffraction peak intensity ratio defined by the following formula (1).\n\nInOphase (400)\/\u03b2-GaOphase (\u2212202)+\u03b2-GaInOphase (111)+(Ga,In)Ophase (2\u03b8\u224833\u00b0)}\u00d7100[%]\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Here, information concerning the structure of each phase, has been clearly shown by JCPDS cards which are 41-1103 (\u03b2-GaOphase), 21-0334 (\u03b2-GaInOphase), 14-0564((Ga,In)Ophase), and 06-0416 (InOphase).","Main peaks of \u03b2-GaInOphase and InOphase in X-ray diffraction, are based on (111) reflection and (222) reflection, respectively, but, since InOphase (222) reflection laps with \u03b2-GaInOphase (002) reflection, with respect to InOphase it is evaluated by (400) reflection having the next highest intensity.","The oxide sintered body which does not have a metal indium phase can be obtained by sintering the oxide sintered body in an inert gas atmosphere, at 800\u00b0 C.\u02dc1000\u00b0 C. of sintering temperature by a hot pressing method, and under the condition of pressure 4.9 MPa\u02dc29.4 MPa,","When an oxide film is formed by the sputtering method, using these oxide sintered bodies as a sputtering target for example, it is possible to obtain an oxide film such that it has a composition range wherein it mainly consists of gallium, indium and oxygen, and a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and less than 100 at. % with respect to all metallic elements, and more preferably, more preferably has a composition range wherein a content of gallium is more than 65 at. % and 90 at. % or less with respect to all metallic elements, and a shortest wavelength is 320 nm or less, where the light transmittance of the film itself except a substrate is 50%.","Furthermore, in order to obtain the above-mentioned oxide film, it is desired that a film is formed using as a sputtering target, an oxide sintered body in which generation of an indium oxide phase (InOphase) of the bixbyite type structure, which causes fall of the light transmittance of an oxide film in the region of the wavelength of 400 nm or less, is suppressed.","The oxide sintered body according to the present invention mainly consists of gallium, indium and oxygen, and a content of the gallium is more than 65 at. % and less than 100 at. % with respect to all metallic elements, and it is required that it is in a composition range excluding gallium-oxide.","Furthermore, it is required that the density of the oxide sintered body is 5.0 g\/cmor more.","Here, when a content of gallium is 65 at. % or less, to all metallic elements, and an oxide film is formed by using this oxide sintered body as a sputtering target for example, a shortest wavelength where the light transmittance of the film itself except a substrate is 50% exceeds 320 nm.","Since sintering becomes remarkably difficult in a composition range of gallium-oxide, it becomes difficult to obtain a high-density oxide sintered body.","When sputtering is performed by using an oxide sintered body that has not yet become high density, as a sputtering target, a problem occurs, namely, abnormal electric discharge of arc discharge etc. occur frequently, and consequently, the shortest wavelength where the light transmittance of the film itself except a substrate becomes 50% is 320 nm or less. Therefore, good quality oxide film cannot be obtained.","When the oxide sintered body having the density of the sintered body less than 5.0 g\/cmis used as a sputtering target, generation of nodule and generating of arc discharge in long-time use occur, and film characteristics of the oxide film obtained get worse.","Furthermore, in the oxide sintered body according to the present invention, it is more desired that it contains gallium content of which is more than 65 at. % and 90 at. % or less with respect to all metallic elements, and the density of the sintered body is 5.5 g\/cmor more, and when it is used as a sputtering target, forming of a film can be made by a direct current sputtering method.","The reason is that since an oxide sintered body in this range has sufficient conductivity and the density of the sintered body, abnormal electrical discharge of arc discharge etc. does not occur, and accordingly the direct current sputtering can be carried out successfully.","In a direct current sputtering method mentioned here, a sputtering method (direct current pulsing method) in which a negative voltage applied to a target is ceased periodically, and during the period, by applying a low positive voltage, neutralization of positive charging is carried out by electrons is also included.","The direct current pulsing method is desirable, since it has advantages such that a film can be formed while controlling arcing in a reactive sputtering using reactant gas of oxygen, and control of impedance consistency circuit like in the RF sputtering method is not required, and, film forming speed is quicker than that of the RF sputtering method.","Further, it is desired that the oxide sintered body according to the present invention is constituted by one or more phases selected from a gallium-oxide phase which has \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaOphase), a gallium-indium-oxide phase having \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaInOphase), or (Ga, In)Ophases.","Furthermore, it is desired that the oxide sintered body according to the present invention is constituted by one or more phases selected from a gallium-oxide phase which has \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaOphase), a gallium-indium-oxide phase having \u03b2-GaOtype structure (\u03b2-GaInOphase), or (Ga,In)Ophases, wherein it is constituted by an indium oxide phase (InOphase) of bixbyite-type structure, a ratio in which the indium oxide phase (InOphase) of the bixbyite-type structure is contained is 5% or less in term of X-ray diffraction peak intensity ratio defined by the following formula (1).\n\nInOphase(400)\/{\u03b2-GaO}phase(\u2212202)+\u03b2-\u03b2-GaInOphase(111)+(Ga, In)Ophase(2\u03b8\u224833\u00b0)}\u00d7100[%]\u2003\u2003(1)\n","If the X-ray diffraction peak intensity ratio of the formula is 5% or more, since a contribution to optical characteristics of the oxide film by the indium oxide phase (InOphase) having a bixbyite-type structure of a sputtering target is large, a shortest wavelength where the light transmittance of the film itself except a substrate is 50% exceeds 320 nm.","Here, as for the indium oxide phase (InOphase) of bixbyite-type structure, it may be that in which oxygen deficit has been introduced, or a part of indium has been replaced by gallium.

When a pressure is lower than this range, the sintering is not carried out enough. Therefore, good quality oxide sintered body with high density cannot be obtained.","Even when the pressure is set at higher than this range, the density of the sintered body is not improved, and breakage of a mold used for the hot pressing occurs easily.","Furthermore, an oxide film of the present invention is an oxide film obtained using the sputtering method, wherein the oxide sintered body is used as a sputtering target, and mainly consists of gallium, indium, and oxygen.
