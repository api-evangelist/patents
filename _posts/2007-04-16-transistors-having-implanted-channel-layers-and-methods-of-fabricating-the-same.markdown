{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION AND CLAIM OF PRIORITY","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION","EXPERIMENTAL"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/814,516, filed Jun. 16, 2006, entitled \u201cTRANSISTORS HAVING IMPLANTED CHANNEL LAYERS AND METHODS OF FABRICATING THE SAME,\u201d the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. This application is related to co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/700,268 entitled \u201cTRANSISTORS HAVING IMPLANTED CHANNELS AND IMPLANTED P-TYPE REGIONS BENEATH THE SOURCE REGION AND METHODS OF FABRICATING THE SAME\u201d filed Jan. 1, 2007.","The present invention was made, at least in part, with support from The Office of Naval Research, contract number N00014-02-C-0250. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to microelectronic devices and more particularly to transistors, for example, metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs).","Electrical circuits requiring high power handling capability (>20 watts) while operating at high frequencies, such as radio frequencies (500 MHz), S-band (3 GHz) and X-band (10 GHz), have in recent years become more prevalent. Because of the increased interest in high power, high frequency circuits, there has been a corresponding increase in demand for transistors that are capable of reliably operating at radio frequencies and above while still being capable of handling higher power loads. Previously, bipolar transistors and power metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been used for high power applications, but the power handling capability of such devices may be limited at higher operating frequencies. Junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) have been used for high frequency applications, but the power handling capability of previously known JFETs may also be limited.","Recently, metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) have been developed for high frequency applications. The MESFET construction may be preferable for high frequency applications because only majority carriers carry current. The MESFET design may be preferred over current MOSFET designs because the reduced gate capacitance permits faster switching times of the gate input. Therefore, although all field-effect transistors utilize majority carriers to carry current, the Schottky gate structure of the MESFET may make the MESFET more desirable for high frequency applications.","In addition to the type of structure, and perhaps more fundamentally, the characteristics of the semiconductor material from which a transistor is formed also affect the operating parameters. Of the characteristics that affect a transistors operating parameters, the electron mobility, saturated electron drift velocity, electric breakdown field and thermal conductivity may have the greatest effect on a transistor's high frequency and high power operational characteristics.","Electron mobility is the measurement of how rapidly an electron is accelerated to its saturated velocity in the presence of an electric field. In the past, semiconductor materials which have a high electron mobility were preferred because more current could be developed with a smaller field, resulting in faster response times when a field is applied. Saturated electron drift velocity is the maximum velocity that an electron can obtain in the semiconductor material. Materials with higher saturated electron drift velocities are preferred for high frequency applications because the higher velocity translates to shorter transit times from source to drain.","Electric breakdown field is the field strength at which breakdown of the Schottky junction occurs, and the current through the gate of the device suddenly increases. A high electric breakdown field material is preferred for high power, high frequency transistors because larger electric fields generally can be supported by a given dimension of material. Larger electric fields allow for faster transients, as the electrons can be accelerated more quickly by larger electric fields than by smaller fields.","Thermal conductivity is the ability of the semiconductor material to dissipate heat. In typical operations, all transistors generate heat. In turn, high power and high frequency transistors usually generate larger amounts of heat than small signal transistors. As the temperature of the semiconductor material increases, the junction leakage currents generally increase, and the current through the field effect transistor generally decreases due to a decrease in carrier mobility with an increase in temperature. Therefore, if the heat is dissipated from the semiconductor, the material will remain at a lower temperature and be capable of carrying larger currents with lower leakage currents.","In the past, high frequency MESFETs have been manufactured of n-type III-V compounds, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) because of their high electron mobilities. Although these devices provided increased operating frequencies and moderately increased power handling capability, the relatively low breakdown voltage and the lower thermal conductivity of these materials have limited their usefulness in high power applications.","Silicon carbide (SiC) has been known for many years to have excellent physical and electronic properties which should theoretically allow production of electronic devices that can operate at higher temperatures, higher power levels and higher frequencies than devices produced from silicon (Si) or GaAs. The high electric breakdown field of about 4\u00d710V\/cm, high saturated electron drift velocity of about 2\u00d710cm\/sec and high thermal conductivity of about 4.9 W\/cm-\u00b0 K indicate that SiC would be suitable for high frequency, high power applications. Unfortunately, difficulty in manufacturing has limited the usefulness of SiC for high power and high frequency applications.","MESFETs having channel layers of silicon carbide have been produced on silicon substrates (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,806 to Suzuki et al. and 4,757,028 to Kondoh et al.). Because the semiconductor layers of a MESFET may be epitaxial, the layer upon which each epitaxial layer is grown affects the characteristics of the device. Thus, a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a Si substrate generally has different electrical and thermal characteristics then a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a different substrate. Although the SiC on Si substrate devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,806 and 4,757,028 may have exhibited improved thermal characteristics, the use of a Si substrate generally limits the ability of such devices to dissipate heat. Furthermore, the growth of SiC on Si generally results in defects in the epitaxial layers that result in high leakage current when the device is in operation.","Other MESFETs have been developed using SiC substrates. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/540,488 filed Jun. 19, 1990 and now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated entirely herein by reference, describes a SiC MESFET having epitaxial layers of SiC grown on a SiC substrate. These devices exhibited improved thermal characteristics over previous devices because of the improved crystal quality of the epitaxial layers grown on SiC substrates. However, to obtain high power and high frequency it may be necessary to overcome the limitations of SiC's lower electron mobility.","Similarly, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,554 to Palmour describes a SiC MESFET having source and drain contacts formed on n regions of SiC and an optional lightly doped epitaxial layer between the substrate and the n-type layer in which the channel is formed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,895 to Sriram et al. also describes a SiC MESFET and a structure that is described as overcoming \u201csurface effects\u201d which may reduce the performance of the MESFET for high frequency operation. Sriram et al. also describes SiC MESFETs which use n source and drain contact regions as well as a p-type buffer layer.","Furthermore, conventional SiC FET structures may provide nearly constant operating characteristics during the entire operating range of the FET. i.e. from fully open channel to near pinch-off voltage, by using a very thin, highly doped channel (a delta doped channel) offset from the gate by a lightly doped region of similar conductivity type. Delta doped channels are discussed in detail in an article by Yokogawa et al. entitled -, MRS Fall Symposium, 2000 and an article by Konstantinov et al. entitled --, MRS Fall Symposium, 2000.","However, one potential problem associated with conventional SiC MESFET designs is that it may be difficult to control the thickness, doping and\/or conductivity of the epitaxially grown channel layers. Because of variations in such properties, it may be difficult to reliably fabricate devices having consistent operating characteristics.","Some embodiments of the invention provide a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor including a silicon carbide layer, spaced apart source and drain regions in the silicon carbide layer, a channel region positioned beneath a surface of the silicon carbide layer between the source and drain regions and doped with implanted dopants, and a gate contact on the silicon carbide layer.","The transistor may further include a recess in the silicon carbide layer, and the gate contact may be positioned in the recess. The recess may extend into the silicon carbide layer by about 600 \u212b. Furthermore, the recess may extend into the channel region.","The channel region may have a concentration of implanted dopants of 1\u00d710cmor more. For example, the channel region may further have a peak concentration of implanted dopants in a range of from about 3\u00d710cmto about 2\u00d710cm. The peak concentration may be located in a range of from about 100 nm to about 350 nm from a surface of the silicon carbide layer.","The transistor may further include a cap layer on the channel layer, and the gate contact may extend through the cap layer to the silicon carbide layer.","The channel region may include a concentration profile of implanted dopants including multiple implant peaks. For example, the implanted dopants may form a dual peak dopant profile in the channel layer.","The channel region may include a first sublayer, a second sublayer and a third sublayer disposed between the first and second sublayers. The third sublayer may have a dopant concentration less than a dopant concentration of the first sublayer and\/or the second sublayer. The gate contact may extend through the first sublayer and into the third sublayer.","In some embodiments, the channel region may include a first sublayer having a first dopant concentration and a second sublayer having a second dopant concentration beneath the first sublayer. The first sublayer may have a higher dopant concentration than the second sublayer. The gate contact may extend into the first sublayer.","The silicon carbide layer may have a thickness of from about 0.5 to about 0.8 \u03bcm and may include an unintentionally doped silicon carbide layer. The silicon carbide layer may include an epitaxial silicon carbide layer and\/or a bulk silicon carbide layer. In particular, the bulk silicon carbide layer may include a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate.","The channel region may have a mobility in a range of about 100 cmV-s to about 240 cm\/V-s, an implant charge density in a range of about 3\u00d710cmto about 2\u00d710cm, a peak doping in the range of about 3\u00d710cmto about 2\u00d710cmand\/or a sheet resistivity in a range of about 4000 ohms\/square to about 7500 ohms\/square.","Methods of forming a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor according to some embodiments of the invention include providing a layer of silicon carbide, forming spaced apart source and drain regions in the silicon carbide layer, implanting impurity atoms to form a channel region beneath a surface of the silicon carbide layer between the source and drain regions, annealing the implanted impurity atoms, and forming a gate contact on the silicon carbide layer.","Implanting impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature above room temperature. For example, implanting impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of at least about 1100\u00b0 C.","Annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of at least about 1400\u00b0 C. For example, annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of from about 1400\u00b0 C. to about 1700\u00b0 C. In particular, annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed at a temperature of about 1600\u00b0 C. Moreover, annealing the implanted impurity atoms may be performed for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes.","The methods may further include forming a recess in the silicon carbide layer, forming the gate contact may include forming the gate contact in the recess.","The methods may further include forming a cap layer on the silicon carbide layer and forming a recess through the cap layer, and forming the gate contact may include forming the gate contact in the recess. The methods may further include forming a second recess in the silicon carbide layer, and forming the gate contact may include forming the gate contact in the second recess.","The layer of silicon carbide may include an unintentionally doped layer of epitaxial silicon carbide and\/or a bulk silicon carbide layer. In particular, the bulk silicon carbide layer may include a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the , which illustrate various embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in the Figures, the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures of the present invention. Furthermore, various aspects of the present invention are described with reference to a layer being formed on a substrate or other layer. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, references to a layer being formed \u201con\u201d another layer or substrate contemplates that additional layers may intervene. References to a layer being formed on another layer or substrate without an intervening layer are described herein as being formed \u201cdirectly on\u201d the layer or substrate. Furthermore, relative terms such as beneath may be used herein to describe one layer or regions relationship to another layer or region as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, layers or regions described as \u201cbeneath\u201d other layers or regions would now be oriented \u201cabove\u201d these other layers or regions. The term \u201cbeneath\u201d is intended to encompass both above and beneath in this situation. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that although the terms first and second are used herein to describe various regions, layers and\/or sections, these regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second region, layer or section, and similarly, a second region, layer or section may be termed a first region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Transistors according to embodiments of the present invention may be useful in, for example, high efficiency linear power amplifiers, such as power amplifiers for base stations using complex modulation schemes such as code division multiple access (CDMA) and\/or Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA).","Referring to , transistors, for example, metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs), according to some embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. As seen in , a substrate  is provided. The substrate  may be a single crystal bulk silicon carbide (SiC) substrate of either p-type or n-type conductivity or semi-insulating. The substrate  of either p-type or n-type may be very lightly doped. The substrate may be formed of silicon carbide having a polytype selected from the group of 6H, 4H, 15R or 3C silicon carbide. Although the present invention is described herein with reference to a SiC substrate, the present invention is not limited to SiC. For example, in some embodiments, the substrate  may also include, for example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) and\/or Gallium Nitride (GaN). Moreover, devices according to some embodiments of the invention may not have a substrate. For example, some devices may include semiconductor layers removed from a growth substrate and mounted to a carrier substrate and\/or a submount.","An optional buffer layer  of, for example, p-type silicon carbide may be provided on the substrate . The buffer layer  may be formed of p-type conductivity silicon carbide of 6H, 4H, 15R or 3C polytype. The buffer layer  may, for example, have a carrier concentration of from about 2\u00d710cmto about 6\u00d710cm. Suitable dopants include aluminum, boron and\/or gallium. The buffer layer  may have a thickness of about 2 \u03bcm. Although the buffer layer  is described above as p-type silicon carbide, the invention is not limited to this configuration. Alternatively, the buffer layer  may be undoped silicon carbide (i.e. unintentionally doped) or very low-doped n-type conductivity silicon carbide. If a very low doped n-type silicon carbide is utilized for the buffer layer , the carrier concentration of the buffer layer  is preferably less than about 5\u00d710cm.","The buffer layer  may be disposed between the substrate  and a second buffer layer . The second buffer layer  may be, for example, p-type silicon carbide having a carrier concentration of from about 1\u00d710cmto about 5\u00d710cm, but typically about 1.5\u00d710cm. The p-type silicon carbide buffer layer  may also have a thickness of from about 0.5 \u03bcm or less to about 1 \u03bcm. Although the second buffer layer  is described above as being of p-type conductivity silicon carbide, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to this configuration. Alternatively, for example, the second buffer layer  may be of n-type conductivity, for example, very lightly doped n-type conductivity SiC or undoped SiC as discussed above with respect to the buffer layer . In some embodiments of the present invention, the second buffer layer  may be provided directly on the substrate . A channel layer  is provided on the second buffer layer , as illustrated in . The channel layer  may be formed of silicon carbide having a 6H, 4H 15R or 3C polytype and may be undoped and\/or unintentionally doped. As used herein, \u201cunintentionally doped\u201d means that dopant atoms are not intentionally introduced into the layer during growth. However, some background dopant impurities may be present in the layer.","After formation of the channel layer , n-type impurity atoms such as nitrogen and\/or phosphorus are implanted into the channel layer  to form an implanted channel region  therein. The implanted channel region  may have a dopant concentration greater than about 1\u00d710cm, and may have a peak dopant concentration in a range of from about 3\u00d710cmto about 2\u00d710cm. In particular embodiments, the implanted channel region  may have a peak dopant concentration of about 1\u00d710cm. The implanted channel region may have a thickness of from about 50 nm to about 300 nm. In particular embodiments, the implanted channel region  has a thickness of about 100 nm. The peak concentration of implanted dopant atoms may be located about 60 nm to 200 nm from the surface of the channel layer . In particular embodiments, the peak concentration of implanted dopant atoms may be located about 150 nm from the surface of the channel layer .","Conventionally, implanted channel layers have not been used in SiC MESFETs because of the reduced carrier mobility resulting from damage to the semiconductor lattice caused by the implantation process. However, embodiments of the present invention may employ a low-damage implant process to form implanted channel regions  having acceptable mobility, sheet resistance and\/or other properties.","Since the channel region  of a device according to some embodiments of the invention is implanted, many different dopant profiles can be accurately and repeatably created within the channel layer . Accordingly, operational properties of MESFET devices according to some embodiments of the invention may be more accurately controlled and\/or engineered compared to conventional MESFET structures in which the channel region is doped during epitaxial growth.","For example, delta doping of channels may be accomplished more accurately and reliably according to some embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, in some embodiments according to the invention, the implanted channel region  may have a dual peak configuration. That is, the implanted channel region  may include a pair of dopant concentration peaks formed in multiple implant steps and spaced apart from one another to provide a channel region having first, second and third sub-layers similar to the structure described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/136,456 to Sriram, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. In brief, the more highly doped regions near the concentration peaks may act as carrier supply regions for the central region of relatively low dopant concentration between the two dopant peaks. The central region may have increased mobility compared to the more highly doped regions, which may result in improved device performance.","Ion implantation is a well-known method of doping a semiconductor layer with impurities. Ion implantation is useful for selective doping of crystalline material in order to form desired regions in the material, such as p-n junctions, highly conductive contact regions, field spreading regions, etc. In an ion implantation process, ionized impurity atoms are accelerated through an electric field towards a target layer, where they become embedded. The number of ions directed at a target layer is referred to as the dose, which is typically expressed in ions\/cm. The ions are accelerated at an energy level, typically expressed in electron-volts (eV). The distribution of ions in the implanted layer depends on the dose and energy of the implant, sometimes referred to as the implant conditions, as well as the type of ions implanted, the type of material the ions are implanted into, the angle of the implants, and other factors. In each implant step, the implanted ions typically form a concentration distribution that has a peak concentration at a particular depth (i.e., the \u201cimplant range\u201d). Multiple implant steps may be performed using different implant conditions to build up a desired dopant concentration profile.","Typically, after impurities are implanted into a semiconductor layer, it is desirable to anneal the implanted impurities at a high temperature, i.e. a so-called activation anneal. An activation anneal may repair damage caused by the implantation of high-energy ions into the semiconductor lattice. Implant damage may include, for example, broken and\/or rearranged chemical bonds within the semiconductor lattice. The activation anneal may also assist implanted impurity ions in finding a suitable site in the crystal lattice at which the ions may appropriately act as acceptors and\/or donors.","In some embodiments of the invention, implantation of ions to form implanted channel region  may be performed at relatively low implant energies and\/or doses, and\/or at relatively high temperatures in order to provide an implanted channel region  having acceptable mobility. For example, the implanted channel region  may be formed by implanting ions with an implant energy of 90 keV or less and\/or with a dose of 9\u00d710atoms\/cmor less.","Furthermore, the implants may be performed at an elevated temperature, for example, at a temperature greater than about 350\u00b0 C. In particular embodiments, the implants may be performed at a temperature of about 1100\u00b0 C. By performing the implants at an elevated temperature, lattice damage that may occur during the implantation process may be annealed out as it occurs. Accordingly, the crystal quality of the implanted region may be maintained, or even improved, during the implantation process.","After implantation of dopants into the channel layer  to form the implanted channel region , an activation anneal may be performed at a temperature in a range of about 1400\u00b0 C. to about 1700\u00b0 C. for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes. Following the activation anneal, the implanted channel layer  may have excellent crystal quality. For example, the implanted channel layer  may have lattice damage that is below the threshold at which the lattice damage may affect the mobility of the layer.","As further illustrated in , n regions  and  are provided in the source and drain regions of the device, respectively. As used herein, \u201cp\u201d or \u201cn\u201d refer to regions that are defined by higher carrier concentrations than are present in adjacent or other regions of the same or another layer or substrate. Regions  and  are typically of n-type conductivity silicon carbide and have carrier concentrations that are greater than the carrier concentration of the channel layer . For the n regions  and , carrier concentrations of about 1\u00d710cmmay be suitable, but carrier concentrations as high as possible may be advantageous.","The n regions  and\/or  may extend to\/into the implanted channel layer  as illustrated in .","Ohmic contacts  and  are provided on the implanted regions  and , respectively, and are spaced apart so as to provide a source contact  and a drain contact . The ohmic contacts  and  are preferably formed of nickel and\/or other suitable metals. An insulator layer , such as an oxide, may be further provided on the exposed surface of the device to provide mechanical protection and electrical isolation to the exposed surface of the device, as well as to passivate unterminated chemical bonds on the surfaces of the semiconductor layers.","Referring again to , the gate contact  may be provided on the channel layer  between the source region  and the drain region . In some embodiments of the present invention, the gate contact  may be provided in a recess  in the channel layer  as illustrated in . Furthermore, as described below, a cap layer  may be provided on the channel layer  as illustrated in , and the gate may be formed in a double recess (i.e. a first recess  through a cap layer  and a second recess  into the channel layer ).","The gate contact  may be formed of chromium, platinum, platinum silicide, nickel, gold, and\/or TiWN, however, other metals known to one skilled in the art to form Schottky contacts to SiC, may be used. The Schottky gate contact  typically has a three layer structure. For example, the gate contact  can optionally include a first gate layer of chromium (Cr) contacting the n-type conductivity channel layer . Such a structure may have advantages because of the high adhesion of chromium (Cr). The gate contact  may farther include an overlayer of platinum (Pt) and gold  or other highly conductive metal. Alternatively, the gate contact  may include a first layer of nickel in the first recess  on the channel layer . The gate contact  may further include an overlayer on the first layer of nickel that includes a layer of gold.","As further illustrated in , metal overlayers ,  and  may be provided on the source contacts , the drain contact  and the gate contact , respectively. The overlayers ,  and  may be gold, silver, aluminum, platinum and\/or copper. Other suitable highly conductive metals may also be used for the overlayers.","In selecting the dimensions of the MESFET, the width of the gate is defined as the dimension of the gate perpendicular to the flow of current. As shown in the cross-section of , the gate width runs into and out of the page. The length of the gate is the dimension of the gate parallel to the flow of electrons from the source  to the drain . The gate length is the dimension of the gate  that is in contact with the channel layer . For example, the gate length of the MESFET according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be from about 0.4 \u03bcm to about 0.7 \u03bcm. Another important dimension is the source to gate distance, i.e., the distance from the n source region  to the gate contact . The source to gate distance according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 0.7 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the distance from the n drain region  to the gate  may be from about 1.5 \u03bcm to about 2 \u03bcm. Embodiments of the present invention may further include a plurality of unit cells of MESFETs, and the distance from a first gate of the unit cells to a second gate may be, for example, from about 20 \u03bcm to about 50 \u03bcm.","Referring now to , a cross-sectional view of a transistor according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Like numbers refer to like elements in previously described figures, thus, detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. As seen in , transistors according to certain embodiments of the present invention include a first recess  in the channel layer . The first recess  is provided between first and second no regions  and , i.e. between the source region and the drain region of the device. The first recess  extends into the channel layer . In some embodiments, the first recess  may extend towards, but not into, the implanted channel region . In other embodiments, the first recess  may extend to and\/or into, the implanted channel layer .","The first recess  may be formed by partially etching the channel layer . The first recess  may be formed by an etching process, such as a dry or wet etch process. For example, the first recess  may be formed by dry etching, for example, Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching. Techniques for etching silicon carbide are well known in the art and need not be described further herein. Since the conductivity and\/or the location of the implanted channel layer  may be more accurately controlled by utilizing embodiments of the present invention, etching the channel layer  may be more easily performed. For example, a timed etch may be performed to form the first recess , which may avoid the need for repeatedly etching the recess and testing the sheet resistance of the channel region after each iteration to determine if the etch process should be repeated.","Referring now to , a cross-sectional view of a transistor according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Like numbers refer to like elements in previously described figures, thus, detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. As seen in , transistors according to some embodiments of the present invention may include a double recessed structure containing first and second recesses as illustrated in . In particular, an n-type silicon carbide cap layer  may be formed on the channel layer . A first recess  has a floor  that extends through the cap layer  to the channel layer . A second recess  into the channel layer  is provided between the sidewalls ,  of the first recess. A first sidewall  of the first recess  is between the source  and the gate  and a second sidewall  of the first recess  is between the drain  and the fate . The floor of the second recess  extends into the channel layer  by, for example, a distance of about 600 \u212b. The double recessed structure is discussed further in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/136,456 to Sriram. According to some embodiments of the invention, the second recess  may extend into the channel layer  but not into the implanted channel layer . In other embodiments, the first recess  may extend to and\/or into the implanted channel layer .","The cap layer  may have, for example, a carrier concentration of about 1\u00d710cmand a thickness of about 900 \u212b.","Referring now to , a cross-sectional view of a transistor according to further embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Like numbers refer to like elements in previously described figures, thus, detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. As seen in , in some embodiments, an implanted channel region  may be formed in a silicon carbide substrate . Moreover, as the cap layer  is optional, fabrication of SiC MESFETs may be greatly simplified, as the device may be formed without the necessity of forming epitaxial layers on a growth substrate. In the embodiments of , the substrate  may be a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate fabricated as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,680 to Carter et. al. entitled \u201cSemi-insulating Silicon Carbide Without Vanadium Domination\u201d, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. Such a semi-insulating substrate may be produced by providing silicon carbide substrates with sufficiently high levels of point defects and sufficiently matched levels of p-type and n-type dopants such that the resistivity of the silicon carbide substrate is dominated by the point defects. Such a domination may be accomplished by fabricating the silicon carbide substrate at elevated temperatures with source powders that have concentrations of heavy metals, transition elements or other deep level trapping elements of less than about 1\u00d710cmand preferably less than about 1\u00d710cm.
