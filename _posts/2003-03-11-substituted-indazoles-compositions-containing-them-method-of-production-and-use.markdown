{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority of French Patent Application No. 02\/02,996, filed Mar. 11, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates in particular to novel chemical compounds, particularly novel substituted indazoles, to the compositions containing them, and to their use as medicinal products.","More particularly, the invention relates to novel specific indazoles exhibiting anticancer activity via the modulation of the activity of proteins, in particular of kinases.","To date, most of the commercial compounds used in chemotherapy pose considerable problems of side effects and of tolerance in patients. These effects may be limited insofar as the medicinal products used act selectively on cancer cells, with the exclusion of healthy cells. One of the solutions for limiting the undesirable effects of chemotherapy may therefore consist in using medicinal products which act on metabolic pathways or elements constituting these pathways, expressed mainly in cancer cells, and which would be expressed very little or not at all in healthy cells.","Protein kinases are a family of enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of specific protein residues such as tyrosine, serine or threonine residues. Such phosphorylations can widely modify the function of proteins; thus, protein kinases play an importane role in regulating a large variety of cell processes, including in particular metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration or cell survival. Among the various cellular functions in which the activity of a protein kinase is involved, certain processes represent attractive targets for treating cancer-related diseases and also other diseases.","Thus, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide compositions having anticancer activity, acting in particular with respect to kinases. Among the kinases for which modulation of the activity is sought, FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) is preferred.","FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in transduction of the signal transmitted by integrins, a family of heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors. FAK and the integrins are colocalized in perimembrane structures called adhesion plaques. It has been shown, in many cell types, that the activation of FAK, and also phosphorylation thereof on tyrosine residues and in particular autophosphorylation thereof on tyrosine 397, are dependent on the binding of integrins to their extracellular ligands and are therefore induced during cell adhesion [L. Kornberg, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 267(33): 23439-442. (1992)]. The autophosphorylation of FAK, on tyrosine 397, represents a binding site for another tyrosine kinase, Src, via its SH2 domain [Schaller et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:1680-1688. 1994; Xing et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:413-421. 1994]. Src can then phosphorylate FAK on tyrosine 925, thus recruiting the Grb2 adaptor protein and inducing, in certain cells, activation of the ras and MAP Kinase pathway involved in the control of cell proliferation [Schlaepfer et al. Nature; 372:786-791. 1994; Schlaepfer et al. Prog. Biophy. Mol. Biol. 71:435-478. 1999; Schlaepfer and Hunter, J. Biol. Chem. 272:13189-13195. 1997]. The activation of FAK can also induce the jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and result in the progression of cells fo the G1 phase of the cell cycle [Oktay et al., J. Cell. Biol. 145:1461-1469. 1999]. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3-kinase) also binds to FAK on tyrosine 397, and this interaction might be necessary for the activation of PI3-kinase [Chen and Guan, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 91: 10148-10152. 1994; Ling et al. J. Cell. Biochem. 73:533-544. 1999]. The FAK\/Src complex phosphorylates various substrates, such as paxillin and p130CAS in fibroblasts [Vuori et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 16: 2606-2613. 1996].","The results of many studies support the hypothesis that FAK inhibitors might be used in the treatment of cancer. Studies have suggested that FAK may play an important role in cell proliferation and\/or survival in vitro. For example, in CHO cells, some authors have demonstrated that overexpression of p125FAK leads to an acceleration of the G1 to S transition, suggesting that p125FAK promotes cell proliferation [J.-H Zhao et al. J. Cell Biol. 143:1997-2008. 1998]. Other authors have shown that tumor cells treated with FAK antisense oligonucleotides lose their adhesion and enter into apoptosis (Xu et al, Cell Growth Differ. 4:413-418. 1996). It has also been demonstrated that FAK promotes cell migration in vitro. Thus, fibroblasts deficient for the expression of FAK (mice which are knockout for FAK) exhibit a rounded morphology and deficiencies in cell migration in response to chemotactic signals, and these deficiencies are eliminated by reexpression of FAK [D J. Sieg et al., J. Cell Science. 112:2677-91. 1999]. Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of FAK (FRNK) blocks the extension of adherent cells and decreases cell migration in vitro [A. Richardson and J. T. Parsons Nature. 380:538-540. 1996]. Overexpression of FAK in CHO or COS cells or in human astrocytoma cells promotes migration of the cells. The involvement of FAK in the promotion of cell proliferation and migration in many cell types in vitro suggests the potential role of FAK in neoplastic processes. A recent study has effectively demonstrated an increase in the proliferation of tumor cells in vivo after induction of FAK expression in human astrocytoma cells [L. A. Cary L. A. et al. J. Cell Sci. 109:1787-94. 1996; D. Wang et al. J. Cell Sci. 113:4221-4230. 2000]. In addition, immunohistochemical studies of human biopsies have demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed in prostate cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colon cancer melanoma, brain cancer and lung cancer, the level of FAK expression being directly correlated with the tumors exhibiting the most agressive phenotype [T M Weiner, et al. Lancet. 342(8878):1024-1025. 1993; Owens et al. Cancer Research. 55:2752-2755. 1995; K. Maung et al. Oncogene. 18:6824-6828. 1999; D Wang et al. J. Cell Sci. 113:4221-4230. 2000].","Indazoles are not very common in pharmaceutical products on the market. Included among the indazoles substituted at position 5 are essentially sulfonic acids, which are widely used in the field of photosensitization, with a predilection in the photographic field. Moreover, a sulfonamide is known, from JP 62025747, which claims N-(1H-indazol-5-yl)-methanesulfonamide as a film preserver and inhibitor of shadow formation. A therapeutic use is neither described nor envisioned here.","The following documents propose the therapeutic use of indazoles substituted at position 5.","Patent application WO 99\/64004 discloses quinazoline derivatives, some of which contain an N-(1H-indazol-5-yl)sulfonamido substituent. These products are reputed to be of use for inhibiting a cGMP phosphodiesterase, and for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The use of these products in oncology is not envisioned.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,151 claims pentafluorophenylsulfonamide derivatives for treating atherosclerosis. This patent gives an example of indazole substituted at position 5 with a pentafluorophenylsulfonamide group. The same series of products is claimed in application WO 98\/05315, for use as anti-proliferative agents, and also for treating inflammatory diseases, myocardial infarction, glomerular nephritis, transplant rejection, and infectious diseases such as HIV infections and malaria. In particular, product 15, the preparation of which is described on page 37, is the only indazole which appears in the patent application. The use of these products as kinase inhibitors is not mentioned. On the contrary, these products are aimed at inhibiting tubulin polymerization, which is a result of different mechanisms of inhibition of cell proliferation.","Patent application WO 00\/73264 claims cell proliferation inhibitors, and in particular tubulin polymerization inhibitors. That patent application gives the preparation of many products, including a single indazole (page 42, example 34: N-(1H-indazol-5-yl)-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzenesulfonamide). This product is tested (page 20) at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM against NCI-H460 cells (18.5% growth inhibition) and HCT-15 cells (47.6% growth inhibition). The activity of this product is very modest compared to that obtained for the other compounds tested. In addition, it should be noted that the use of these products as kinase inhibitors is neither described nor suggested, the applicant placing the emphasis particularly on the 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzenesulfonamide group to which it is possible to add a large number of substituents, including an indazole.","Patent application WO 01\/53268 claims 3,5-disubstituted indazoles as CDK kinase inhibitors, and for inhibiting cell proliferation. The substituents at position 5 are always hydrocarbon-based chains or cyclic, aromatic or heteroaromatic groups.","Patent application WO 02\/10137 claims indazoles substituted at positions 3 and 5 with many different groups. Out of the 438 examples of indazoles described, only example 42 is an indazole substituted at position 5 with a phenylsulfonylamino group. The products described here are of use for inhibiting the JNK protein.","Patent application WO 02\/083648, published on Oct. 24, 2002, claims indazoles which inhibit JNK protein. In that application, only the products I-18 to I-20 and I-64 to I-71 are 5-sulfonylaminoindazoles substituted at position 3 with an aryl group.","Patent application WO 03\/004488, published on Jan. 16, 2003, discloses 2-(3-benzimidazolyl)indazoles of use as inhibitors of tyrosine and serine\/threonine kinases. These products are indifferently substituted at positions 4 to 7 of the indazole and\/or the imidazole. Examples 843 to 854 are indazoles substituted at position 3 with a benzimidazol-2-yl substituent, and at position 5 with an (alkyl\/aryl)sulfonamido substituent. All these benzimidazoles are substituted at position 6 with N,N-dialkylamino substituents. No test on FAK is given. No relationship between the activity of the compounds and their structure is discussed.","Now, surprisingly, it has been found that indazoles substituted at position 5 with a series of substituents Z-X\u2014 as defined below, and optionally substituted at position 3, exhibit considerable kinase-inhibiting activity, in particular against FAK.","Another of the merits of the invention is to have found that substitution of the indazole at position 5 with a suitable group leads to considerable inhibition of FAK kinase, even when the indazole is not substituted on any other position, in particular at position 3.","Another of the merits of the invention is to have found that substitution of the indazole ring at a position other than position 5 systematically leads to a decrease in activity against the kinases tested here. Thus, when a series of substituents Z-X\u2014 is placed at one of positions 1, 4, 6 or 7 of the indazole ring, this results in a very large loss of activity which then makes the product unsuitable for use as a kinase inhibitor, particularly FAK. In addition, insofar as the indazole is substituted at position 5 with a suitable group Z-X\u2014 as claimed, it is possibile to substituted the indazole at position 6 with a small substituent, such as a C1-C3 alkyl group, although this is not preferred.","In addition, one of the merits of the invention is to have demonstrated that, even when the indazole is correctly substituted with a suitable group X, it is essential for the nitrogen at position 1 of the indazole not to be substituted, in order to conserve satisfactory inhibitory activity.","These products correspond to the following formula (I): \n\n\nin which:\n\n","It has been observed that, quite unexpectedly, products of general formula (I) in which Z-X\u2014 is Z-SOO\u2014 exhibit levels of activity similar to those observed when Z-X\u2014 is Z-SONH\u2014.","Preferably, R1 will not be H.","Specifically, another of the merits of the invention is to have discovered that substitution of the indazole at position 3 with a group R1 other than H significantly improves the inhibitory properties against kinases.","Z may advantageously be substituted aryl. More preferably, Z may be phenyl substituted with one to three substituents.","According to a very preferred variant, Z may be phenyl substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of: 3-fluoro; 3,4-dichloro; 3,4-difluoro; 2-methylsulfonyl.","Preferably, R1 may be selected from the group consisting of H, CH, C-Calkyl, Cl, Br, I, CN, C(O)NH(R2), NHC(O)(R2), aryl, substituted aryl, alkylene [sic] and substituted alkylene [sic].","The products according to the invention may advantageously be chosen from the group consisting of\n\n","More generally, the list of the products below is representative of the invention:\n\n","According to a second aspect, the invention relates to products corresponding to the following formula (I): \n\n\nin which:\n\n","Subst is chosen from 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl, 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl, methyl, and \n\n\nin which Ra and Rb are independently selected from the group consisting of NH, NOand Cl, or Ra and Rb form a ring \u2014NH\u2014CH\u2550N\u2014.\n","According to its second aspect, a product in accordance with the invention is advantageously a product of formula (I) in which Z-X is chosen from Z-S(O)\u2014NH and Z-S(O)\u2014O.","According to its second aspect, R is preferably a hydrogen atom.","According to its second aspect, the invention relates to a product of formula (i) in which Z is substituted aryl, preferably phenyl substituted with one to three substituents.

The pharmaceutical composition can be in the form of a solid, of a liquid or of liposomes.","Among the solid compositions, mention may be made of powders, gelatin capsules or tablets. The oral forms can also include solid forms protected against the acidic environment of the stomach. The carriers used for the solid forms consist in particular of inorganic carriers, such as phosphates or carbonates, or of organic carriers, such as lactose, celluloses, starch or polymers. The liquid forms consist of solutions, of suspensions or of dispersions. They contain, as dispersing carrier, either water or an organic solvent (ethanol, NMP or others) or of mixtures of surfactants and of solvents or of complexing agents and of solvents.","The liquid forms will preferably be injectable and, as a result, will have a formulation acceptable for such a use.","Acceptable routes of administration by injection include intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection usually being preferred.","The administered dose of the compounds of the invention will be adjusted by the practitioner as a function of the route of administration to the patient and of the patient's condition.","The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or as a mixture with other anticancer agents. Among the possible combinations, mention may be made of:\n\n","It is also possible to combine the compounds of the present invention with a radiation treatment. These treatments can be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially. The treatment will be adjusted by the practitioner according to the patient to be treated.","The products of the invention are of use as agents for inhibiting a reaction catalyzed by a kinase. FAK is a kinase for which the products of the invention will be particularly useful as inhibitors. The products of the invention may also be of use as inhibitors of Aurora and\/or KDR kinases. More generally, the products of the invention may also be of use as inhibitors of Src, Tie2, IGF1R, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases, preferably Src and Tie2 kinases.","Reasons for which these kinases are chosen are given below:","KDR","KDR (Kinase insert Domain Receptor), also known as VEGF-R2 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2), is expressed only in endothelial cells. This receptor binds to the angiogenic growth factor VEGF and thus acts as a mediator to a transduction signal via the activation of its intracellular kinase domain. Direct inhibition of the kinase activity of VEGF-R2 makes it possible to reduce the phenomenon of angiogenesis in the presence of exogenous VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor:) (Strawn et al., 1996, vol. 56, p. 3540-3545). This process has been demonstrated in particular using VEGF-R2 mutants (Millauer et al., 1996, vol. 56, p. 1615-1620). The VEGF-R2 receptor does not appear to have any function in adults other than that related to the angiogenic activity of VEGF. Consequently, a selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of VEGF-R2 should show only slight toxicity.","In addition to this central role in the angiogenic dynamic process, recent results suggest that the expression of VEGF contributes to the survival of tumor cells after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, underlining the potential synergy of KDR inhibitors with other agents (Lee et al. 2000, vol. 60, p. 5565-5570).","Aurora2","Many proteins involved in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly have been identified in yeast and drosophilia. Disruption of these proteins leads to non-segregation of chromosomes and to monopolar or disorganized spindles. Among these proteins, certain kinases, including Aurora and Ipl1, originating respectively from and from drosophilia, are necessary for chromosome segregation and centrosome separation. A human analog of yeast Ipl1 has recently been cloned and characterized by various laboratories. This kinase, called aurora2, STK15 or BTAK, belongs to the serine\/threonine kinase family. Bischoff et al. have shown that Aurora2 is oncogenic and is amplified in human colorectal cancers (EMBO J, 1998, 17, 3052-3065). This has also been exemplified in cancers involving epithelial tumors such as breast cancer.","Src","It has been noted that the Src kinase, involved in many signaling cascades, is often activated or overexpressed in many types of cancer, such as colon cancer or breast cancer (M M Moasser et al. Cancer Res. 1999. 59:6245-6152; Wiener et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999. 5:2164-2170). In addition, Src appears to play a predominant role in the development of bone metastases, by virtue of its involvement in the development of bone tissue (P. Soriano et al. Cell 1991. 64:693-702; Nakagawa et al, Int. J. Cancer 2000. 88:384-391).","Tie2","Tie-2 (TEK) is a member of a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, specific for endothelial cells. Tie2 is the first receptor possessing tyrosine kinase activity for which both the agonist (angiopoietin 1 or Ang1) which stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptor and cell signaling [S. Davis et al (1996) 87, 1161-1169] and the antagonist (angiopoietin 2 or Ang2) [P. C. Maisonpierre et al. (1997) 277, 55-60] are known. Angiopoietin 1 can act synergistically with VEGF in the final stages of neoangiogenesis [Asahara T. . (1998) 233-240]. Knockout experiments and transgenic manipulations of the expression of Tie2 or of Ang1 result in animals which exhibit vascularization defects [D. J. Dumont et al (1994) 8, 1897-1909 and C. Suri (1996) 87, 1171-1180]. The binding of Ang1 to its receptor results in the autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of Tie2 which is essential for neovascularization and also for the recruitment and interaction of the vessels with pericytes and smooth muscle cells; these phenomena contribute to the maturation and stability of the newly formed vessels [P. C. Maisonpierre et al (1997) 277, 55-60]. Lin et al (1997) 100, 8: 2072-2078 and P. Lin (1998) 95, 8829-8834, have shown an inhibition of tumor growth and vascularization and also a decrease in lung metastases during adenoviral infections or during injections of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 (Tek) in breast tumor and melanoma xenograft models.","Tie2 inhibitors can be used in situations where neovascularization takes place inappropriately (i.e. in diabetic retinopathy, chronic inflammation, psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic neovascularization due to macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, infantile hemangioma and cancers).","IGF1R","The type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I-R) is a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity which binds initially to IGFI but also to IGFII and to insulin with lower affinity. The binding of IGF1 to its receptor leads to oligomerization of the receptor, activation of the tyrosine kinase, intermolecular autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cell substrates (main substrates: IRS1 and Shc). The receptor activated by its ligand induces mitogenic activity in normal cells. However, IGF-I-R plays an important role in \u201cabnormal\u201d growth.","Several clinical reports underline the important role of the IGF-I pathway in the development of human cancers:","IGF-I-R is often found overexpressed in many tumor types (breast, colon, lung, sarcoma, etc.) and its presence is often associated with a more aggressive phenotype.","High concentrations of circulating IGF1 correlate strongly with a risk of prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer.","In addition, it has been widely documented that IGF-I-R is necessary for establishing and maintaining the transformed phenotype in vitro as in vivo [R Baserga, Exp. Cell. Res., 1999, 253, pages 1-6]. The kinase activity of IGF-I-R is essential to the transforming activity of several oncogenes: EGFR, PDGFR, SV40 virus large T antigen, activated Ras, Raf, and v-Src. The expression of IGF-I-R in normal fibroblasts induces a neoplastic phenotype, which can then lead to the formation of a tumor in vivo. The expression of IGF-I-R plays an important role in substrate-independent growth. IGF-I-R has also been shown to be a protector in apoptosis induced by chemotherapy and radiation, and apoptosis induced by cytokines. In addition, the inhibition of endogenous IGF-I-R by a dominant negative, the formation of a triple helix or the expression of an antisense causes suppression of the transforming activity in vitro and a decrease in tumor growth in animal models.","CDK2 and CDK4","Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) constitute a family of protein kinases which are involved mainly in the control of progression between the various phases of the cell cycle. During the G1 phase, CDK4 associates with cyclin D and phosphorylates the Rb protein, which results in its inactivation, and induction of dissociation of the transcription factors E2F and DP1. These transcription factors then enter the nucleus, where they control the genic expression required for the G1\/S transition and progression into S phase. The CDK2-cyclin E complex is also responsible for the G1\/S transition and, in addition, regulates centrosome duplication. Deregulation of the kinase activity of CDKs in many tumors has stimulated an intensive search for inhibitors, for antiproliferative purposes (see, for example, TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences Vol.23 No.9 September 2002).","Definitions","The term \u201chalogen\u201d refers to an element chosen from F, Cl, Br and I.","The term \u201calkyl\u201d refers to a saturated, linear or branched, hydrocarbon-based substituent having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms.

After purification by LC\/MS, the fractions containing the desired compounds are (optionally pooled) evaporated to dryness (Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator), weighed (Mettler Toledo Automated Workstation LA200), and diluted to 10 mM in DMSO (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical). Each solution obtained is analyzed by LC\/MS.","The following compounds were isolated and characterized by their retention time and molecular peak in mass

(Mettler-Toledo, Viroflay, France), and 1.75 ml of the solution of tert-butyl 3-iodo-5-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-methylsulfonylbenzenesulfonylamino)indazole-1-carboxylate prepared above are distributed into each one of the reactors using a Zinsser automated diluting device (Zinsser Analytical, Frankfurt, Germany). 200 \u03bcl of each solution of boronic acid described above (Table 3) are then added, followed by 320 \u03bcl of a saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution. A suspension of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) in dimethylformamide is then distributed (50 \u03bcl per well), and the reactors are then closed and heated to a temperature in the region of 105\u00b0 C. using a suitable heating jacket (Mettler-Toledo, Viroflay, France). After one night at this temperature, the reaction mixtures are filtered, under hot conditions, in suitable collecting racks (Mettler-Toledo, Viroflay, France) equipped with 75\u00d7100 mm hemolysis tubes, and then, after returning to ambient temperature, each reaction medium is diluted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate and transferred into a 13\u00d7100 mm tube for liquid-liquid extraction (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical, Frankfurt, Germany). The following extraction sequence is applied twice to each reaction medium: addition of 2 ml of distilled water, mixing, settling out, removal of the aqueous phase, which is returned to its tube of origin. At the end of these operations, the organic extracts are transferred (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical, Frankfurt, Germany) into pre-tared tubes (AWS LA200, Mettler-Toledo, Viroflay, France); before evaporation, 10 \u03bcl of each organic extract are transferred (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical, Frankfurt, Germany) into a microtitration plate and diluted with 40 \u03bcl of dimethyl sulfoxide, thus constituting 65 crude samples used for the LC\/MS analysis. The tared tubes containing the organic extracts are finally evaporated to dryness (Genevac HT8 or Savant centrifugal evaporator), thus providing the crude samples. Before purification, the samples are prepared in the following way: each sample is solubilized in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide, and filtered in a filtering plate. The filtrates are then distributed in two wells each of 500 \u03bcl and subjected to purification by LC\/MS (conditions B).","After purification by LC\/MS, the fractions containing the desired compounds are (optionally pooled) evaporated to dryness (Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator), weighed (Mettler Toledo Automated Workstation LA200), and diluted to 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical). Each solution obtained is analyzed by LC\/MS. The following compounds were isolated and characterized by their retention time and molecular peak in mass spectrometry.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e20612","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"Molecular"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"UV",{},"ion"]},{"entry":["Example","NAME","MW","Formula","purity","Tr

LC\/MS analyses were carried out on a Micromass device model LCT connected to an HP 1100 device. The abundance of the products was measured using an HP G1315A diode array detector over a wave range of 200-600 nm and a Sedex 65 light scattering detector. The acquisition of the mass spectra was carried out over a range of 180 to 800. The data were analyzed using the Micromass MassLynx software. The separation was carried out on a Hypersil BDS C18, 3 \u03bcm (50\u00d74.6 mm), column, eluting with a linear gradient of 5 to 90% of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v\/v) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water containing 0.05% (v\/v) TFA over 3.5 min at a flow rate of 1 mL\/mn. The total time of analysis, including the column reequilibration period, is 7 min.","Purification by LC\/MS: Conditions A:","The products were purified by LC\/MS using a Waters FractionsLynx system composed of a Waters gradient pump model 600, a Waters regeneration pump model 515, a Waters Reagent Manager dilution pump, a Waters autoinjecter model 2700, two Rheodyne valves model LabPro, a Waters diode array detector model 996, a Waters mass spectrometer model ZMD and a Gilson fraction collector model 204. The system was controlled by Waters FractionLynx software. The separation was carried out alternately on two Waters Symmetry columns (C, 5 \u03bcM, 19\u00d750 mm, catalogue reference 186000210), one column undergoing regeneration with a 95\/5 (v\/v) water\/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.07% (v\/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, while the other column was in the process of separation. The columns were eluted using a linear gradient of 5 to 95% of acetonitrile containing 0.07% (v\/v) of trifluoroacetic acid in water containing 0.07% (v\/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 10 mL\/mn. On leaving the separating column, one thousandth of the effluent is separated with LC Packing Accurate, diluted with methyl alcohol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL\/mn and sent to the detectors, in a proportion of 75% to the diode array detector and the remaining 25% to the mass spectrometer. The remainder of the effluent (999\/1000) is sent to the fraction collector, where the flow is eliminated as long as the mass of the expected product is not detected by the FractionLynx software. The FractionLynx software is provided with the molecular formulae of the expected products, and triggers collection of the product when the mass signal detected corresponds to the ion [M+H] and\/or to [M+Na].
