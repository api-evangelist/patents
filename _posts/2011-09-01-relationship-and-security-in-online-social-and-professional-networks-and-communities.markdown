No. 12\/619,451 filed 11\/16\/2009, now abandoned which in turn claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/272,010 filed 08\/06\/2009 and all of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to configuration of networked entities for coordination of interaction between the networked entities.","In today's multifaceted society, there are a number of industries (e.g. healthcare) that can be characterized as having a particularly fragmented workforce\u2014in healthcare from physicians to nurses to practice administrators\u2014that are extremely busy in their day to day activities. Day to day work for individuals in today's industries can be highly irregular and unpredictable, and with so many different parts working in isolation there are limited opportunities for people to be exposed to one another. Further, with few networks supporting these people or groups in reaching out and connecting with each other, it's easy for them to become isolated. All of this makes it very difficult for industry professionals to get in touch with who they want when they need to, to stay in touch with colleagues and co-workers within and\/or between different industries, and to coordinate productive interactions with each other.","Social and professional networking is valuable to business professionals and healthcare professionals of all types. When people become members of social and professional online networks, they need to connect with other members in order to share information with, interact with, and network through those members. In cases where people are connecting to business professionals, business relationships are important and need to be entered into with care. Each relationship is different, each relationship has a level of trust, and people do not want to connect online with each of their professional contacts in the same way. Ultimately, it's not a one size fits all world when it comes to connecting online and the representation electronically (i.e. online) of the mixture of real world business and professional relationships is problematic using today's electronic relationship models.","Accordingly, in the current one size fits all world, a system is needed that enables community members to connect with their business connections in a way that represents their multifaceted life with the plurality of other members in the community (both known and unknown to the community member) because the members do not want to share the same information, communicate and interact in the same way, nor enable people to network through them in the same way, in view of real-world relationships. An example of this is that not everyone is \u201cbest\u201d friends with every other person they have met in their real-world life. There are varying degrees of friendship\/acquaintance in the real-world and there is a need to represent this in the online\/electronic forum, amongst other possible types of relationships between people.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an benefit and rule configuration environment to obviate or mitigate at least some of the above-presented disadvantages.","In the current one size fits all world, a system is needed that enables community members to connect with their business connections in a way that represents their multifaceted life with the plurality of other members in the community (both known and unknown to the community member) because the members do not want to share the same information, communicate and interact in the same way, nor enable people to network through them in the same way, in view of real-world relationships. An example of this is that not everyone is \u201cbest\u201d friends with every other person they have met in their real-world life. There are varying degrees of friendship\/acquaintance in the real-world and there is a need to represent this in the online\/electronic forum, amongst other possible types of relationships between people. One method is provided for evolving a defined online existing relationship between a first member and a second member, the online existing relationship defined by a plurality of existing relationship features for use in managing network interaction on a communications network between the first member and the second member. The method comprising: receiving a new online relationship having new relationship features such that the new features are different from the existing relationship features, the new relationship features being characteristic of the new relationship; aggregating the existing relationship features and the new relationship features as aggregate relationship features a combination of the existing relationship features and the new relationship features in order to define an aggregate relationship; storing the aggregate relationship features in a storage as relationship data representing, the aggregate relationship defined by the relationship features; and accessing the relationship data in order to determine whether a selected network interaction from one of the members is permitted in view of at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features of the aggregate relationship, and facilitating the selected network interaction between the members when determined as permitted; wherein said at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features of the aggregate relationship is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","A first aspect of the present invention provided is a method for evolving a defined online existing relationship between a first member and a second member, the online existing relationship defined by a plurality of existing relationship features for use in managing network interaction on a communications network between the first member and the second member, the method comprising the steps of: receiving a new online relationship having new relationship features such that the new features are different from the existing relationship features, the new relationship features being characteristic of the new relationship; aggregating the existing relationship features and the new relationship features as aggregate relationship features a combination of the existing relationship features and the new relationship features in order to define an aggregate relationship; storing the aggregate relationship features in a storage as relationship data representing the aggregate relationship defined by the relationship features; and accessing the relationship data in order to determine whether a selected network interaction from one of the members is permitted in view of at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features of the aggregate relationship, and facilitating the selected network interaction between the members when determined as permitted; wherein said at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features of the aggregate relationship is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","A further aspect provided is a method for evolving a defined online existing relationship pair between a first member and a second member, the online existing relationship pair defined by a first existing relationship role assigned to the first member having a plurality of first existing role features for use in managing network interaction on a communications network between the first member and the second member, and a second existing relationship role assigned to the second member having a plurality of second existing role features for use in managing the network interaction between the first member and the second member, the method comprising the steps of: receiving a new online relationship pair having a new first relationship role and a second new relationship role, such that the corresponding first new role features and the second new role features are different from the first existing role features and the second existing role features, the first new role features and second new role features being characteristic of the new relationship pair; aggregating the first existing role features and the first new role features as aggregate first role features being a combination of the first existing role features and the first new role features in order to define an aggregate first role; aggregating the second existing role features and the second new role features as aggregate second role features being a combination of the second existing role features and the second new role features in order to define an aggregate second role;

and accessing the relationship data in order to determine whether a selected network interaction from one of the members is permitted in view of at least one of the corresponding aggregate role or aggregate role features of at least one of the aggregate first role or aggregate second role of the aggregate relationship pair, and facilitating the selected network interaction between the members when determined as permitted; wherein said at least one of the corresponding aggregate role or aggregate role features of at least one of the aggregate first role or aggregate second role of the aggregate relationship pair is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","A further aspect provided is a method for evolving a defined online existing relationship pair between a first member and a second member, the online existing relationship pair defined by a plurality of existing relationship features for use in managing network interaction on a communications network between the first member and the second member, the method comprising the steps of: receiving a new online relationship pair having corresponding new relationship features different from the existing relationship features, the new relationship features being characteristic of the new relationship pair;

wherein at least one of the corresponding combined role features of the new relationship pair is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","A further aspect provided is a method for defining an online relationship pair between a first member and a second member, the relationship pair including a first relationship role assigned to the first member having a plurality of first role features for use in managing network interaction on a communications network between the first member and the second member, and a second relationship role assigned to the second member having a plurality of second role features for use in managing the network interaction between the first member and the second member, the method comprising the steps of: assigning the first relationship role to the first member such that the first role features are characteristic of the first relationship role; assigning the second relationship role to the second member such that the second role features are characteristic of the second relationship role, such that the second member must confirm the second relationship role in order for the first member to be able to use the first relationship role in the network interaction between the first and second members;

wherein said at least one of the corresponding relationship roles or role features of at least one of the first role or second role of the relationship pair is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","Relationship Environment Network ","Referring to , relationship and security in online social and professional networks and communities is provided by a relationship environment network . The network  provides for members  (i.e. registered users) and non-members  (i.e. unregistered users) of a relationship administration system  to connect\/communicate  over a communications network  with each other in ways that enhance their real world relationship, such that their online accounts (relationship data , otherwise known as a configured relationship matrix  for the plurality of members  and their optionally assigned relationship roles ) share information electronically and the members\/non-members ,  interact with each other electronically in accordance with a defined connection\/shared relationship (e.g. relationship pair ) defined and administered by the relationship administration system . It is recognised that both members  and non-members  will hereafter be referred to generically as members  for the sake of simplicity, such that members  can be of a type registered or unregistered (i.e. non-members). The administration system  provides for a plurality of defined relationship pairs  assigned to selected pairs of members  to adapt and change over time through amendment in the one or more relationship roles (or to their commonly assigned relationship features  that are not assigned to any particular role ) assigned to the members  for representing any changes in the professional and\/or personal relationship(s) between the members  with each other over time, as facilitated by relationship pair aggregation further described below.","It is also recognised that the term member  can be assigned to a single user and\/or a group (e.g. two or more users) by the administration system , such that any individual of the group can use the group member  as a conduit to electronically interact with other group and\/or individual members  via the network . For example, a group member  can be a number of individual doctors working together in the same clinic and an individual member  can be a sales representative connecting with and making appointments with the group member  as a customer of the sales representative (e.g. for selling medical supplies for the group individuals as a whole). It would be up to the individuals of the group member  to arrange amongst themselves who would be meeting the sales representative at the arranged time\/place of the appointment, as the sales representative would not be concerned with whom of the individuals of the group member  attend the appointment\u2014just that at least one of the group individuals would be available and make able to make\/relay decisions concerning buying of medical supplies.","The administration system  could consider the group member  as a distinct member  of the relationship environment , realizing that any of the individuals of the group member  would have the same capabilities\/features\/privileges  and can use the group member  account  to interact  with other members . Alternatively, the administration system  could consider the group member  as a distinct member  of the relationship environment , realizing that certain individuals of the group member  would have slightly differing defined capabilities\/features\/privileges\/restrictions  (e.g. defined individuals when signed on as the group member  would only be able to view  appointments but not to confirm  them) when using the group member  account  to interact with other members  associated with the relationship administration system .","One example application of the network  and associated administration system  is for the healthcare industry, which can be characterized as having a particularly fragmented with a workforce\u2014from physicians  to nurses  to practice administrators \u2014that are extremely busy in their day to day activities. Day to day work in industry can also be highly irregular and unpredictable, and with so many different parts working in isolation there are limited opportunities for people to be exposed to one another. All of this makes it very difficult for industry professionals  to get in touch  with who they want when they need to, to stay in touch  with colleagues  and co-workers  within and\/or between different industries, and to coordinate productive interactions  with each other. Accordingly, the ability to coordinate  meaningful and expected online relationships  between members , in particular the evolution of relationships between members  in a flexible and transparent manner is desirable, as further discussed below.","The relationship administration system  can be a web-based service\/application, accessible by browser applications of the members , and can provide a medium for the community of members  for people (in healthcare and other industries) to electronically (i.e. online) find  and connect  with peers and\/or non-peers, electronically communicate  and exchange ideas between members , and electronically coordinate interactions  (both online and in person, for example) between members ; so that community members  can develop business networks (for example in conjunction with different types of friendships), build knowledge, and\/or engage in purposeful productive relationships  outside of their immediate business environment. It is recognised that the electronic communications\/connections  between the members  are conducted in the framework of the defined role pairs , for example, and the associated features\/capabilities , as coordinated by the administration system  further discussed below.","Customer-Vendor Example","Referring to , an example of the role pair  is Vendors (role ) who use the system  to have access to customer relationship management tools  that let them, as companies or as individual representatives with companies, reach out and connect  directly to target their Customers (role ) for their proffered goods and services. The management tools  provide the members  with different types of connection  options with one another over the network . The system  provides features that support the vendor  and the customer  in building new relationships , in enhancing\/evolving existing relationships , and in enabling electronic communication, coordination, and value exchanges  between the assigned roles of the role pair .","In economics, economic output can be divided into goods and services. When an economic activity yields a valuable or useful thing, it can be known as production output of the totality of products (e.g. goods or services) in an economy that the vendor  makes available  for use by the customers . Products as goods can range from a simple safety pin, food, clothing, computer components to complex aircraft. Products as services are the performance of any duties or work for another (e.g. helpful or professional activity) and can be used to define intangible specialized economic activities such as but not limited to: providing access to specific information; web services; transport; banking; legal advice; accounting advice; management consultant advice; and medical services. The vendor  providing the products can be a businessperson\/individual engaged in wholesale\/retail trade, an organization, an administration, and\/or a business that sells, administers, maintains, charges for or otherwise makes available product(s) that are desirable by the customers . Accordingly, the vendor  can be one person, or an association of persons, for the purpose of carrying on some enterprise or business; a corporation; a firm; etc. Further, it is recognized that the offered  (electronically and\/or in person) products\/services can be applied to vendor  activities not related to specific product(s), for example activities such as customer service, community activities, and\/or sponsorships. These general activities of the vendor  are also considered as part of the definition of vendor  products.","It will be understood that for the purposes hereof, the customer  may be any user (i.e. first hand product experience) of vendor  products (e.g. goods and\/or services). For example, the customer  may be an individual who purchases vendor  goods and\/or services for personal use, and not for resale or for use in the production of other goods and\/or services for resale. Or the customer  may be a business purchasing vendor  goods and\/or services for use in its business, i.e., for resale or for use in the production of other goods and\/or services for resale. Further, it is recognized that customer  may not purchase the goods and\/or services. For example, the customer  may have acquire the goods and\/or services pursuant to a free trial offered by the vendor .","Any business or organization can be called an enterprise, while consumers are individuals or households that purchase and use goods and services generated within the economy. It is recognized that both enterprises and consumers can be included in the definition of customers . For example, the definition of B2C (Business-to-Consumer) is used to define the interaction between a business\/vendor  (e.g. enterprise) that sells products or provides services to end-user consumers (e.g. customers ). Further, for example, Business-to-Business (B2B) can be used to represent for relations between enterprises (e.g. between a business vendor  and a business customer ), contrary to relations between enterprises and other groups (e.g. customers, public administration). The term B2B can be used to define marketing activities as well as electronic communication relations between enterprises. For example, B2B-Marketing can be used to describe all products and services used by enterprises. B2B marketing can be considered more complex than B2C marketing because on the buyer's side, there can be more than one person involved in a B2B sale\/purchase, the buying center.","Accordingly, it is recognized that the customer  can be a private individual desiring information\/purchase (e.g. B2C) of the vendor  products or can be a person, or an association of persons, for the purpose of carrying on some enterprise or business (e.g. a corporation, a firm, etc.) that desires information\/purchase (e.g. B2B) of the vendor  products. It is recognized that the customer  can communicate  with the vendor  as a potential purchaser (i.e. window shopping) or as an intended purchaser of the vendor's  products, as desired.","Relationship Matrix ","When two or more members  are engaged in one or more relationship pairs  (active and\/or passive), these members  interact  with each other on the administration system  (via the network ) in accordance with their relationship pair(s)  and their respective optional roles the members  have in those relationship pair(s) . It is recognised that between any pair of members , a plurality of distinct types of relationship pairings  can be assigned to them, which facilitates the evolution of their overall online relationship with one another. For example, any two members  can first start off with being the role of associates in an associate based relationship pair  (having associate features\/capabilities for coordination of the various connections\/actions  enabled by the associate based relationship pair . At a later date, the two members  then add (e.g. aggregate) being the role of customer-vendor in a customer-vendor based relationship pair  having customer or vendor based features\/capabilities for coordination of the various connections\/actions  enabled by the customer-vendor based relationship pair . In other words, the members  now have a general relationship with one another that is a combination of associate\/customer or associate\/vendor with one another and therefore all of the features\/capabilities assigned to each member  is a combination of associate\/customer or associate\/vendor , as further described below with respect to relationship banding and relationship aggregating. The relationship matrix  is used as a memory construct\/database (e.g. table, chart, etc.) for defining\/storing all of the features\/capabilities , roles , and\/or all the possible interactions  between members  over the network .","It is also recognised that as an alternative embodiment the defined online existing relationship  between a first member  and a second member  can be defined by a plurality of existing relationship features  for use in managing network interaction  on the communications network  between the first member  and the second member . The relationship features  are characteristic of the relationship , such that at least one of the corresponding relationship features  of the relationship  is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction  type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format. It is recognised that the relationship features  can be between the first member  and the second member  (i.e. each of the members  do not have a defined relationship role , in the relationship ). Or, as further discussed above, it is recognised that a first portion of the relationship features characterizes the first relationship role and a second portion of the relationship features characterizes the second relationship role of the relationship pair , such that the first relationship role and the second relationship role are part of the relationship defined as the relationship pair  between the first and second members . In other words, the aggregate relationship pair , described above by example only, can be administered by the administration system  as a role-less relationship , such that the relationship features  are shared between the members  for managing their inter-member  interactions , or can be administered as a roled relationship pair , such that each of the roles have characteristic role features ","Referring to , any possible interaction  that can occur between two members  can be defined and therefore enabled\/disabled in the relationship matrix  via the respective features  and the actual implementation of the interaction  is assessed (through reference to the matrix ) and either accepted or declined by the Relationship Gate . The relationship matrix  is therefore available (locally or remotely over the network ) to the Relationship Gate , to maintain an understanding of the roles inside of the assigned relationship pairs  in affect (e.g. active and\/or passive) at any point in time between members ","The feature or capabilities available between members  can include such as but not limited to: information visibility\/sharing  (via profiles, searches, contact records, etc.); notifications and updates ; communications ; Events Coordination ; Interactions  Online and Coordination  of Interactions Offline; Preferences for the features\/capabilities (i.e. limited member  specific customization of the general features\/capabilities available under the role(s) ); and Relationship views .","Further, it is recognised that the matrix  is used by the relationship gate  to determine whether or not an action  initiated by the member  with respect to another member  (e.g. send a meeting request for sales call) will be completed as an allowable Relationship Interaction  (as defined by the features\/capabilities , , shared or distributed in defined roles ), or whether the action  is halted because it cannot occur (i.e. the desired action  is not compatible with one or both of the feature\/capability sets , of the member(s) .","Further, it is recognised that the administration system  can provide feedback communication to the requesting member  if the action  resulted in no Interaction (e.g. not allowed). Also, it is recognised that the administration system  can provide feedback communication to the requesting member  if the action  resulted in Interaction (e.g. allowed). Also, it is recognised that the administration system  can provide feedback communication\/notification to the intended recipient member  of the action  if it resulted in no Interaction (e.g. not allowed). Also, it is recognised that the administration system  can provide feedback communication\/notification to the intended recipient member  of the action  if it resulted in Interaction (e.g. allowed).","Referring again to , the capabilities\/features\/privileges\/restrictions (hereafter referable as features  for the sake of simplicity) are grouped as associated\/assigned to the respective individual relationship role , for example. For example, a first role type RT would have a set\/group of assigned features F,F,F,F,F,etc. and a second role type RT would have a set\/group of assigned features F,F,F,F,F,etc. It is recognised that the sets\/groups of assigned features  can have some individual features  in common (e.g. overlapping sets\/groups of features ), however each set\/group of features  as a whole is unique in feature  content to the respective role type that they are assigned. In this manner, the administration system  can facilitate that a first role type RT has a unique first set of assigned features  and therefore cannot be confused with a second role type RT having a unique second set of assigned features , such that the first and second set of features  are not identical. For example, the role type of a Colleague would have different set of features  than that of a Vendor, otherwise a Colleague could be confused for a Vendor during interactions  over the network  as defined by the particular role features  set that is unique to the particular role type ","It is also recognised that some features  can be superseded by other features , either in whole or in part (e.g. to take the place of such as replace or to augment so as to make an already assigned feature  greater\/lesser in size, extent, or influence), during aggregation of relationship pairs  and their corresponding roles and features , as further described below with respect to aggregate relationship pairs  (see ).","Interactions\/Connections\/Communications ","Referring again to , members  via the administration system  can connect  with each other in ways that represent their real world trusted relationships, including nonmember  interactions. It is recognized that the following discussed member  interactions  (as facilitated\/defined through the features\/capabilities that are shared between members of the relationship pair  and\/or are associated with the role types of the relationship pair ) is for exemplary purposes only, recognizing that nonmembers  can and will have at least some of the features\/capabilities that are appropriate to their base relationship profile (e.g. public) recognized by the system .","Referring to , the types of relationships (i.e. role of the defined role pair ) that member  (M) is in with other members (Mn), and the administration system  connection relationships that a M has with a specific member (M), will impact: the information M can enter  into the relationship data  about themselves; the information M is able to share  about themselves, and who they're able to share it with; the features\/capabilities  a member  is able to use in their defined role(s) ; the features\/capabilities  M is able to use when interacting with Mn; the ability for M to join a Group; the types of requests\/responses  that the member M can have over the network ; and\/or the results  of any searches member M executes . Further, the relationships that a person may be dependent on factors such as: the role pair  assigned to the member ; service package(s) purchased or otherwise acquired  by the member  as facilitated by the system ; and organization type and relationship of the organization with the system . For example, in  member M (via their defined two role pairs  of customer-vendor and colleague-colleague) can communicate  (as enabled\/defined through their various features\/capabilities  as share and\/or as assigned  to respective roles ) with member M being both a fellow colleague and a respective customer of member M (being a colleague and vendor ). For example, member M and member M can interact  with each other as colleagues by sharing  their in-office calendars (e.g. showing both personal and business activities) as well as placing  and accepting  orders respectively for particular beauty products (i.e. member M is a part-time vendor of skin creams and candles).","Member M can also communicate  with other vendors (defined by the system ) of the members Mn (for example other part-time vendors of skin creams) to find out whether their customers may be interested in their products (i.e. candles) and to make an introduction\/referral  to the member Mn customers . This is an example where member M has an active relationship role  of customer-vendor and colleague-colleague with member M and member M has passive relationship roles of vendor-vendor with other members Mn. It is recognised that the system  (and enforce via the relationship gate  see ) the various capabilities\/features of the vendors differently for the above-described role pair customer-vendor  and vendor-vendor . For example, member M could offer  their products for sale to member M with the ability to provide 14 order forms and invoicing. However, member M could not do these same interactions  with member Mn, rather member M could only perform with member Mn initial contact  and request  introductions to the customers of the member Mn. On the other hand, members M and Mn could decide to enter into customer-vendor relationships  and then member M would gain the additional vendor features\/capabilities commensurate with members Mn being their customer ","It is recognised that the content (e.g. text, image, video, enclosures, message type (email, telephone, text message, etc.), message enclosures, content size\/amount\/length) and\/or format (e.g. form of the content such as colour, font style, message priority, etc.) of the interactions  can be defined and their generation by the member  coordinated by the associated features\/capabilities  (e.g. of the role ) that the member  is using\/operating under on the administration system  with selected (active and\/or passive) other members .

The process enables CUSTOMERS to identify  when they have AVAILABLE TIME (either MEETINGS or FLEX CALLS) for VENDORS to visit.","For MEETINGS, the CUSTOMER simply sets up 14 when he wants a VENDOR to come (e.g. 10 to 10:15 am on Wednesday or 12:30 to 1:30 pm for lunch on Thursday.) FLEX CALLS are periods of time that the CUSTOMER has indicated they will accept a number of drop-in calls (e.g. between 1 pm and 3 pm on Fridays they would accept up to three FLEX CALLS.), as visible on their online profile .","Only members  who are connected to a CUSTOMER as a VENDOR can see 14 AVAILABLE MEETINGS and\/or AVAILABLE FLEX CALLS as visible on their online profile . VENDORS who want to BOOK  any OPEN MEETINGS or FLEX CALLS will do so on a first come first serve basis, and in accordance with any preferences designated by the CUSTOMER as visible on their online profile .","Only one VENDOR may be able to BOOK  a single MEETING. Once booked, the AVAILABLE MEETING is BOOKED and may be not visible to other VENDORS for booking. (Note that a VENDOR or CUSTOMER can CANCEL the meeting, which could reopen the AVAILABLE MEETING to be booked by a different VENDOR.","Multiple VENDORS can book  calls during an AVAILABLE FLEX CALL period as visible on the CUSTOMER\u2032S online profile . The number is limited by the maximum specified by the CUSTOMER. A FLEX CALL that has been BOOKED by a VENDOR is a period when they will be expected to drop in to see the CUSTOMER. The system  can divide the FLEX CALL period into a number of set length (and overlapping, if needed) windows. VENDORS who book a FLEX CALL book a specific window, and this distributes the bookings and reduced situations where multiple VENDORS call on a CUSTOMER at the same time.","The specific time within the AVAILABLE FLEX CALL TIME when the call is to be made is up to the VENDOR. This enables them to choose  a time that works best with their schedule, but also provides flexibility to the CUSTOMER who has no obligation to maintain an exact meeting time, as input and then made visible on their online profile . Also, the actual discussion produced with a FLEX CALL has no set length, and will be something that works for the VENDOR and the CUSTOMER.","Only system  USER TYPES that are in the CUSTOMER class of user types can create 14 AVAILABLE TIME. Further, only system  Users who are a VENDOR CONTACT (i.e. part of the role pair(s)  defined between the VENDOR and CUSTOMERS) of these CUSTOMERs can view  the AVAILABLE TIME as visible on the CUSTOMER online profile  to book it.","A VENDOR can view  a CUSTOMER's calendar on their online profile  to find and BOOK any OPEN (not booked) AVAILABLE FLEX CALL WINDOWS. Each FLEX CALL WINDOW will have a start time and an end time (usually 60 minutes apart.)","Only the VENDOR or a CUSTOMER can see and book  the AVAILABLE FLEX CALLS on the online profile  for the CUSTOMER, as defined and enabled via their defined role pair . To other member types (such as colleagues, co-workers, etc) the time where an AVAILABLE FLEX CALL can appear  on the member's online profile  to be BUSY time, whether the call is BOOKED or OPEN. (This is because the CUSTOMER is saying this time is booked for my VENDORS, and is therefore expected to be booked.). Accordingly, it is recognized that the online visible profile  of any particular member  to any other member  is influenced by the role pair(s)  defined between the respective members .","Once a FLEX CALL WINDOW maximum booking number (BWmax) is reached, that window is considered FULL and is not viewable by VENDORS other than those that have booked it. For both AVAILABLE MEETINGS and for AVAILABLE FLEX CALLS, the system  can permit the CUSTOMER to set PREFERENCES  for the calls. These PREFERENCES  can take the form of:\n\n","The system  can also facilitate the capability to support multi CUSTOMER calls, and allowing multiple VENDORS to book  the same FLEX CALL PERIOD. This would be an event situation. CUSTOMERS can also customize the FLEX CALLS to have FLEX CALL WINDOWS of any length. (e.g. 60 minutes in length, except when the entire AVAILABLE FLEX CALL DURATION is 30 minutes when the window can also be only 30 minutes.","Relationships Defined Using Relationship Pairs ","Referring to , control and transparency of all connection relationships  in the networked environment  promotes member  confidence in interactions . Members  know who they're connecting  to, how they're connecting  to them, how they're being seen  by other members  they're connected to, and exactly what it means to be connected  to another member  in a specific relationship pair .","Further, members  have control of their relationships , just like they have in real life. It's not a one size fits all world and, in business, people have different relationships , the administration system  provides for this, for example through paired relationship roles , letting members  decide what relationship role of a paired relationship  they want to have with another member . The paired relationship roles (and optional directional relationships , further described below) can provide that, when a member  engages  in an online relationship  with another member , they know the role they play in the relationship and the corresponding role the connected (of the relationship pair ) member  plays. If a pair of members  who are in only one customer-vendor relationship , then one of the members  must be the vendor role and one must be the customer role . Example, in a colleague-colleague relationship pair  or in a customer-vendor relationship pair , it's clear to both sides exactly what role each member  is playing. For example, I can't be someone's vendor , and not have them be my customer .","The relationship environment network  provides a social network to the members , by enabling members  to connect to each other in ways that represent their real world business relationships using defined relationship pair(s) , including within the pairs  example roles such as but not limited to: as an associate; as a colleague; as a co-worker; as a customer; as a vendor; etc. Selected roles are compatible with other selected roles  and other selected roles are not compatible with certain roles , as further described below (for example, a role of vendor may not be compatible with the features\/capabilities  of a role type of colleague, while a role of vendor would be compatible with the features\/capabilities  of a role type of customer). It is recognised that each of the associated roles of the role pair  includes a plurality features\/capabilities  that are defined by the administration system , as further discussed below. Once connected via the system , members  users of the administration system  communicate, share information, and\/or coordinate interactions via communications  with each other in accordance with their professional and\/or person relationship defined by their role(s) with each other in the role pair(s)\/pairing(s) . It is recognized that the communications  can consist of messages (e.g. SMS messages, texting, emails, phone calls, etc.) sent to one another, as well as viewing the online profiles  (e.g. system  Web page showing the profile of the member  with user name, interests, other member  connections, hobbies, etc.) of the members .","Some relationships require both members  to be in the same role , such as in a Colleague to Colleague relationship . Other relationships, such as Customer to Vendor relationships , require each user to have a different role ","Referring to , in any relationship pairing , there can be two relationship roles that may be of the same or different role types. In M is the colleague and M is also the colleague , such that both members  M to M want to be Colleagues so both users must play the role of a Colleague in this Colleague to Colleague relationship . In M is the customer and M is the vendor , such that the two members  M and M want to be in a Customer to Vendor relationship  where M plays the Customer role and M plays the Vendor role . In M is the customer and M is the vendor for one relationship pair  and M is the vendor and M is the customer for another relationship pair \u2032 that they have, such that the same M and M members  can also have a second Customer to Vendor relationship \u2032 where M plays the Customer role and M plays the Vendor role ","A relationship role is the specific capacity a member  takes when acting in a system  supported relationship  with another member  who has a specific counter\/associated role to that relationship pairing . It is recognised that the capabilities and features  between two paired roles may not be the same. For example, in a Customer to Vendor relationship , one user must always be the role of Customer  while the other user must always be the role of Vendor , since the customer  is the one who asks questions about and purchases items from the vendor , while the vendor  is the one that provides answers about products and facilitates sale of their products. The administration system  would define (via the matrix ) and can assign of the allowable features specific to the assigned role of the role pair . In other words, for example, the customer  would not have (i.e. the matrix  would not enable these features for the customer role ) the vendor type features of offering  products for sale and invoicing  for same over the network  with the vendor  (since that is what a vendor  does), while at the same time the vendor  would not have (i.e. the matrix  would not enable these features for the vendor roles ) the customer type features of requesting  product information and paying  invoices for purchased products over the network  with the customer  (since that is what a customer  does). Accordingly, in this case, it is clear that a particular member  can only be the customer role with corresponding features when paired to the particular member  who is the corresponding vendor role with corresponding features , for the relationship pairing  of customer-vendor for the paired members . It is also recognised that the features  of a selected relationship pair  can be shared between the members  of that relationship pair  in a role-less relationship pair .","For example, referring to , the system  provides a plurality of predefined role pairs  for selection by each of the members  (e.g. a plurality of different defined role pairs  having respective role associated with role , such that each of the defined role pairs  have assigned respective different feature\/capability sets ) that can be assigned to any particular pair of the members . Therefore, each of the defined role pairs  has list of available features\/capabilities  that are associated with the particular role pair , for example role of role pair  has a list of features\/capabilities that is compatible with the list of features\/capabilities of the role of the role pair . It is recognized that the features\/capabilities may or may not be exactly the same as the features\/capabilities , i.e. may be different for each member  of the pair  such as for vendor-customers, student-teacher, etc. This is different from the case where the roles are the same\/equal such as for colleague to colleague, friend to friend, member to member. In the case where the features\/capabilities are the same, this could be where the relationship role pair  has two equal roles (e.g. public to public, friend to friend, colleague to colleague). In the case where the features\/capabilities are not the same, this could be where the relationship role pair  has two associated dissimilar roles (e.g. vendor to customer, student to teacher), however, it is recognized that the dissimilar features\/capabilities would be compatible with one another as defined by the role pair . It is also recognised that the features\/capabilities assigned to the roles can be directional, such that there may be more assigned features\/capabilities for the role  a as compared to the that the features\/capabilities assigned to the role of the role pair , as further described below.","The features\/capabilities  assigned to the roles  are reflected in type of connections  that can be initiated (and responded to) by the members  in their relationship role(s) , An example of this is where the first member  having the role could be a vendor and be able to send vendor communications  listing products\/services for sale, while the second member  having the paired role of a customer would be able to receive , view , and respond  to the original vendor communications  (e.g. order to buy offered products\/services), i.e. the members are in a Vendor-Customer role pair  relationship, as defined in the system . It is recognized that the customer would not be able to send vendor communications  to the vendor and the vendor would not be able to place orders  to the customer, in this case, unless the members  had their relationship role data  defining both a Vendor-Customer role pair  and a Customer-Vendor role pair  between them, such that each member is both a customer and a vendor with respect to the other member  of their defined role pair(s) .","It is also recognized that for an active relationship  in the administration system , both sides of the relationship pair  can be cognizant of the assigned roles of their other member  of their member pair , i.e. a vendor knows who their customer is and the customer knows who their vendor is and each is knowledgeable of the features\/capabilities  of the others role . In other words, a first member  cannot hide the fact from a second member  that the members  have defined and dissimilar roles that are compatible with one another (e.g. a customer of a vendor knows that they are identified in the system  as the customer of the respective vendor and the vendor of the customer knows that they are identified in the system  as the vendor of the respective customer. It is also recognized that each of the members  can have a plurality of different roles (of respective role pairs ) with the same and\/or different member(s) , such that each of the role pairs  (active and\/or passive) have an inbound and an outbound role connection (i.e. directional roles ) to the other member  associated in the role pair .","For example, a first member  signs onto the system  and provides a user role\/profile (e.g. their profession, their specialty, their country, hobbies, and any other personal defining information). The first member  may also set up with the system  certain defined roles that may or may not have accepted member pair relationships  (e.g. the first member  can have a vendor role with a confirmed\/accepted customer role with a second member  that defines an active pair relationship , and\/or the first member  can register with the system  as a vendor of a specific product\/service and therefore have information  available to other members  as passive pair relationships ). The system  can use the user role definitions\/parameters as well as any defined roles as set up by the first member  to provide for both active and passive exchanges of information  between the first and second members . For example, in the case where the first member  is a general physician and the second member  is a vendor for office medical supplies, the system  would use the user role\/profile of general physician and the defined vendor role to inform the first member  of the second member  as a potential supplier\/vendor of medical supplies and the second member  of the first member  as a potential customer of their vendor role . The mappings between potential role pairs  (i.e. customer with vendor ) as well as for accepted pairs  can be monitored\/maintained by the relationship matrix , as further described below.","Therefore, providing members  control over the connection types (relationship role pair(s) ) they have with other members  provides they feel secure in that defined relationship . It is recognized that the relationship administration system  can have one or more default role pairs  that can be assigned to nonmembers  trying to communicate  with one or more members\/nonmembers  via the system . For example, each nonmember  can be recognized as having a public role profile when trying to communicate via the system  with other members\/nonmembers , who will also be associated with a public role profile for facilitating communications  via the system  with the non-member .","Example definitions of the various roles available in the plurality of relationship pairs  is as follows. Associate is a person who shares actively in anything as a business, enterprise, or undertaking as a partner or fellow worker. Colleague is a fellow member of a profession, staff, or academic faculty. Friend is a person attached to another by feelings of affection or personal regard and is a person who gives assistance as a patron\/supporter. Teacher is a person who teaches or instructs, as a profession as an instructor. Coworker is a fellow worker. Vendor is a person or agency that sells products\/services. Customer is a person who purchases goods or services from another as a buyer\/patron. Student is a person formally engaged in learning, especially one enrolled in a school or college as a pupil. Manager is a person who has control or direction of an institution, business, etc., or of a part, division, or phase of it. \u201cCo\u201d (e.g. co-manager, co-vender, etc.) is a fellow person with potentially the same business\/personal duties as another person. Delegate is a person designated to act for or represent another or others, for example as a deputy\/representative. Patient is a person who is under medical care or treatment. Provider is a person or thing that provides a service (e.g. healthcare related) to another person or thing.","Directional Relationship roles ","\u2022It is recognised that the relationship pairings  can be non-directional and\/or directional relationship roles and associated non-directional and\/or directional relationship features\/capabilities . For example, if two members  are in a customer-vendor relationship pair , it is possible for those members  to engage in another customer-vendor relationship pair . In the first relationship pair , member M may be the vendor and member M may be the customer, while in the second relationship pair, member M may be the customer, and member M may be the vendor. In this case, M would only be enabled for the first relationship pair  for directional outgoing vendor interactions  (i.e. to customer) and incoming vendor interactions  (e.g. from customer) in terms of the available features\/capabilities for a vendor . As well, M would only be enabled for the second relationship pair  for directional outgoing customer interactions  (i.e. to vendor) and incoming customer interactions  (e.g. from vendor) in terms of the available features\/capabilities for a customer , for example. Further, M would only be enabled for the first relationship pair  for directional outgoing customer interactions  (i.e. to vendor) and incoming customer interactions  (e.g. from vendor) in terms of the available features\/capabilities for a customer . As well, M would only be enabled for the second relationship pair  for directional outgoing vendor interactions  (i.e. to customer) and incoming vendor interactions  (e.g. from customer) in terms of the available features\/capabilities for a vendor , for example.","Another way to think about it is that relationship pairs can be optionally directional, from one role to the other. Therefore, the capabilities and features between two members  may not be the same, because the direction of the relationship pair  matters. For example, in a Customer to Vendor relationship pair , one member  must always be the Customer role while the other member  must always be the Vendor role . In this case, there is one Customer-Vendor relationship pair , but two separate Relationship Roles in that relationship pair : one Customer and one Vendor. This is talking to the fact that two people  can have to customer-vendor relationships , one in each direction, but that they can have different features\/capabilities because the users  may customize how the accept\/broadcast those features ","Therefore, it is recognised that each relationship pair  provides capabilities to the members . The relationship matrix  is in contact with the Relationship Gate , to maintain an understanding of the roles and relationship pair(s)  in affect at any point in time between members .","Active\/Passive Relationship Pairs ","Each relationship between a pair of members  (e.g. member with member, member with non-member, or non-member with non-member) can consist of one or more relationship pairs  (e.g. a first role of the pair  is assigned to one member  of the member pair and an associated\/complimentary second role of the pair  is assigned to the other member  of the member pair). It is recognized that there can be both passive (one of the roles of the pair  has not been formally accepted by one of the members  of the member pair ) and active relationships in the system  (i.e. both of the roles of the pair  have been recognized and accepted by each member  of the member pair \u2014e.g. a first member  of the member pair  registers with the administration system  in one of the roles of the pair  and the second member  of the member pair  formally accepts a role invitation  from the first member  for the other role of the pair , as defined by the administration system ).","Referring to , there are two types of Relationship pairs : Activated\/Active Relationships  and Inherent\/Passive Relationships . Inherent relationships  can exist without the member  or members  having to do anything specific to engage or activate the relationship  between one or more members  accessible by the member via the administration system  (e.g. via the relationship gate ). For example, a relationship pair request  from a first member  does not have to be received from and accepted by a second member , in order to establish the inherent relationship pairing  and (and optional associate roles ) between two or more members . The relationship pair  is automatically put in place by the administration system  when specific member  actions  occur that would enable the use of their inherent optional relationship role(s) and assigned features or as their shared features  of the relationship pair .  shows how the two inherent relationships  are always on.","Some inherent relationship pairs  include: a) Member (M) to Public (P) (which exists between any member  and any non-member ; b) Member (M) to Member (M) (which exists between every member ; and c) Family Health Team mate (FHT) to Family Health Team (FHT) mate (which exists between all members  of a specific family health team;","Further, activated Relationship pairs  are started by one of the members  who wants to engage in the selected relationship pair . To start an active relationship pair , one member  Initiates a Handshake (request  to enter into the relationship pair ) to a selected other member  of the administration system . By executing  the Handshake by the other member , the other member  activates the requested relationship pair  and therefore the requesting member assumes the role and the accepting member  assumes the role of the relationship pair  with the associated features\/capabilities associated with their roes ","It is recognised that Most relationships can be Activated Relationship pairs , including a plurality of relationship pair  types such as but not limited to: Friend (F) to Friend (F); Associate (As) to Associate (As); Colleague (Co) to Colleague (Co); Coworker (Cw) to Coworker (Cw); Customer (Cu) to Vendor (V)\/Vendor (V) to Customer (Cu); Student (St) to Teacher (Te)\/Teacher (Te) to Student (St); Report (Re) to Manager (Mg)\/Manager (Mg) to Report (Re); Delegate (Dte) to Delegator (Dtr)\/Delegator (Dtr) to Delegate (Dte); CoVender to CoVender (CV); CoTeacher to CoTeacher (CT); CoManger to CoManager (CM); and Patient (Pat) to Provider (Pro)\/Provider (Pro) to Patient (Pat), as shown in  as example roles ","Therefore, when two members (assume M and M) are in a relationship pair  with each other, there are Passive and\/or Active relationship interactions  that may take place within the features\/capabilities (optimally associated with the roles ) of the relationship pair  of the members M,M. For example, Active Interactions  can be triggered by an action  taken by member M or M, such as active interactions but not limited to: Vendors request to \u2018view available time\u2019 and see the available flex calls of their Customers; Vendors booking available time for a call, since only vendors can book available time; and a member  changing their contact information (e.g. mobile phone number), such that this change is then shared with all of his Colleagues. In terms of passive interactions , these can happen without member M or M triggering the specific interaction. Examples of passive interactions  are such as but not limited to: the capability for assuming M and M are colleagues; and a third member (M) to see who M is and that they are connected as colleagues to M.","In an active exchange , there are connecting cooperative features between the members . Every feature can have an entry way and an exit way. In an active exchange , the relationship role of the Initiator  must be such that the feature can \u2018Fit\u2019 to allow the initiation of the exchange  (e.g. create and send meeting request), and the relationship role of the Receiver  must be such that the cooperative feature will Fit the receiving end (e.g. receive and accept\/decline meeting request) of the exchange .","It is recognised that whether or not a relationship pair  can exist, is available to start, and\/or is maintained, etc, with respect to the members  of the administration system  is coordinated the Relationship Gate , further described below.","The Relationship Gate ","Referring to , sending of interactions  (e.g. messages, emails, or viewing, or other network  enabled communications) does not always require that the member  be in an active relationship pair , as in the case where the profile  of the member  is being viewed by a non-member .","The Relationship Gate  is used by the administration system  to provide for allowed interactions  (e.g. in type, content and\/or format) between any members  over the network . The relationship gate  has access to the relationship matrix  (see ) that stores all the available roles and\/or corresponding features to a respective member  (e.g. for example in the case of a non-member , the administration system  can assign a default role(s)  and corresponding feature(s) ). The relationship gate  can be used to restrict the transmission via the network  of any generated interactions  that do not match with the sender member  and\/or receiver member  assigned roles and\/or features (shared or not). Alternatively, or in addition to, the relationship gate  can be used to restrict the generation of any interactions  that do not match with the sender member  and\/or receiver member  assigned roles and\/or features (shared or not).","For example, the member  may generate a vendor-based communication  and then try to send the vendor-based communication  to a non-customer of the member , for which the relationship gate  would review the roles and\/or features (shared or not) of the non-customer member , determine that the vendor-based communication  is inappropriate for the non-customer member  and then block or otherwise inform (e.g. using a message that informs the role incompatibility of the non-customer member  with a suggestion of sending an invitation instead to enter into a vendor-customer relationship role  with the member ) the vendor member  of the inability to transmit the vendor-based communication . In this situation, the relationship gate  could also modify and\/or suggest (to the sending member ) modifications to the vendor-based communication  to include a customer role invitation for sending to the non-customer member . In an alternative embodiment, the relationship gate  could block the member  from generating a message  that is not consistent (e.g. in terms of message type, content, and\/or format) with any of their current roles and\/or features (shared or not). For example, the member  may want to generate a solicitation email for a new product line being sold by the vendor member , however the product line and materials associated therewith (e.g. invoices, ordering forms, brochures, etc.) may not be enabled in the roles and\/or features (shared or not) of the member  in the matrix . The relationship gate  could respond to the member  to inform the member of the roles and\/or features lacking in their account , which needed in order to be able to generate the desired new product line message . For example, maybe the member's account  needs to be upgraded for multiple product line vendor status before the new product line can be a subject of communications by the member .","Accordingly, the relationship gate  is used by the administration system  to check whether any relationship pair , associated roles , and\/or features (shared or not) are in place, may be enabled, or are to be disabled, in order to facilitate the interactions  desired by any of the members  with respect to other selected members  of the system . If, at any time, two members  are in a relationship pair  where the relationship pair becomes unavailable or either relationship role becomes unavailable to one of the members , then the relationship pair  can become cancelled from the matrix . For example, one of the members  of the relationship pair  can leave the administration system , thereby cancelling their account . In this case, all of the relationship pairs  with this member  would be cancelled and all of the corresponding relation roles would be deleted or otherwise treated as inactive in the matrix by the administration system . It is recognised that the relationship gate  could be used to update the matrix  for changes in roles , and\/or features (shared or not), as desired.","Referring again to , or example, for Member  (M) to be a customer and Member  (M) to be a Vendor : 1. M is able to be a Customer ; 2. M is able to be a Vendor ; 3. M does not have any Relationship pair  Restrictions preventing them from initiating (or maintaining) a Relationship pair where they are the Customer ; 4. M does not have any Relationship Restrictions preventing them from initiating (or maintaining) a Relationship pair where they are the Vendor ; 5. M does not have any Organization Restrictions preventing them from being a Customer ; 6. M does not have any Organization Restrictions preventing them from being a Vendor ; 7. M and M do not (in a Customer to Vendor relationship) work at the same Organisation; 8. M is not in any relationship pairs  that would restrict or prevent them from initiating or maintaining a Customer to Vendor relationship pair and being the Customer ; 9. M is not in any relationship pairs  that would restrict or prevent them from initiating or maintaining a Customer to Vendor relationship  and being the Vendor , for example Relationship count limits fall in here since a member  cannot initiate a new relationship pair  of a specific type if he or she has already used up all the availability of that relationship pair type ).","Further to the above, it is recognised that features of a particular role can contribute to revenue generation and enhanced relationships possible with differentiated relationship pairs  having uniquely characterizing role(s) and associated features (as compared to other different role(s) , in relationship pairs ), such that the healthcare providers (or other industry specific members ) can comfortably connect with both their colleagues and their vendors. Members  may have to pay to be able to be engage in specific relationship pairs  and\/or to gain desired features (e.g. feature enhancements) for their selected roles . For example, a service package that a member  purchases from the administration system  may restrict\/enable not only the types of relationship roles the member  can be, but the number of times the member  can engage in a relationship pair  where they are playing that role ). For example, the administration system  may charge marketing professionals  a marketing charge (e.g. $100\/month) to be able to be a Vendor in customer-vendor relationship pair . Further, the $100 package may only allow the member  to have limited number (e.g. 50) customer-vendor relationship pairs  where they are the Vendor , while an increased value ($200\/month) package may allow more\/additional\/increased (e.g. ) customer-vendor relationship pairs , for example.","Handshake Example","Referring to , , and , in Relationship Creation or Handshaking, e.g. for active relationship pairs , there is a Sender M (or Initiator) and a Receiver M. The Relationship Gate  decides, based on matrix data  for sender\/receiver members , whether or not a relationship pair  is already in place, may be enabled, or is to be disabled. There matrix defined factor(s) (e.g. matrix data  of the relationships including optional role and\/or feature (shared or not) for the members ) that impact whether a member  can or cannot initiate a relationship and play a specific relationship  with another member , such as but not limited to: 1. the Sender M capability to be in the specific Relationship Role ; 2. the Receiver M capability to be in the specific Relationship Role ; 3. if Sender M has any Relationship pair  Restrictions and\/or Relationship Enhancements (which for example can be provided via paid for service packages, organization affiliation, member affiliations, etc.); 4. if Receiver M has any Relationship Restrictions  band\/or Relationship Enhancements ; 5. the Type of Organization the Sender M works with; 6. the Type of Organization the Receiver M works with; 7. whether or not the Sender M and Receiver M work at the same organization; 8. whether or not the Sender M shares a relationship pair  with any other member (e.g. M) that would restrict the sender M being able to enter into this relationship pair ; and\/or , whether or not the Receiver M shares a relationship pair  with any other member (e.g. M) that would restrict the receiver M being able to enter into this relationship pair .","Referring again to , assume Member M wishes to initiate a relationship pair  with Member M, such that they have not activated any relationships previously. The Member to Public (P) is always active, but is superseded in this exchange by the Member to Member \u2018Port\u2019 (such that the relationship gate  can have a number of ports open and\/or operable for the members  depending upon their roles and\/or features . The Member to Member (M) Port is engaged between any two members . Assume the matrix  has data  that is compatible with the potential initiation invitations  for the potential relationship pairs  displayed in . In reviewing the relationship roles that sender M can initiate with M, \u2022Associate (As) is available; Colleague (Co) is available; CoWorker (CW) is unavailable with M because they are not at the same organisation ; Vendor (V) is unavailable with anyone; Customer (Cu) is available with M who can be a Vendor ; Teacher (Te) is unavailable with anyone; Student (St) is unavailable with M because M cannot be a Teacher to anyone: Manager (Ma) is unavailable with anyone; and Report (Re) is unavailable with M because M cannot be a Manager to anyone.","Relationship Banding","Referring to , the features and capabilities  (shared or not) associated with each relationship pairing  has a specific number of defined features  as part of a minimum boundary\/band feature set , (e.g. combined) for each of the relationship pair  types (i.e. the features  in the minimum boundary\/band feature set , must remain enabled by the members  if they are to remain in the accepted relationship  selected\/established between them. For example, the relationship pair  type \u201cAssociate to Associate\u201d has a minimum band feature set  of F to F and the \u201cColleague to Colleague\u201d has a minimum band feature set  of F,F,F,F to F. The members  in the \u201cAssociate to Associate\u201d relationship pair  know that each of the members  has these minimum number of features  in their minimum band feature set  for the respective relationship pair  type, in order to maintain transparency and trust about the relationship pair  the members  created between each other (i.e. representative of what it means to be in the relationship  characterized as associate to associate).","In the event that the relationship  between the members  evolves to include a second enriched relationship pair  (e.g. Colleague to Colleague), which builds upon the first relationship pair  (e.g. associate to associate), the administration system  manages that additional features of a respective minimum boundary\/band feature set  for the second relationship pair  are added to the now aggregate relationship , while providing that the first minimum boundary\/band feature set  is maintained by the members  in the aggregate relationship pair  (i.e. characterizing the combination of the associate to associate and colleague to colleague relationships). In this manner, the members  in the aggregate relationship pair  understand that the aggregate relationship pair  is characterized by at least the features  contained in both minimum boundary\/band feature sets ,.","Also in , it is shown that when in just a \u201cmember to member\u201d public relationship pair , the minimum boundary\/band feature set  is F, F, F, F, F and F-F, such that these features  are all superseded (i.e. replaced, substituted) when the relationship pair  evolves to the associate to associate and the colleague to colleague. In other words, the relationship features  for associate to associate completely supersede those for the member to member relationship pair . It is recognised that the banded features  can be optionally part of the individual roles of the relationship pair , as desired.","Accordingly, relationships of the same name (e.g. relationship pair  type), as defined by the administration system , always have minimum boundary\/band feature sets , even when they are being used by different members . This minimum number of features  enforced in the relationship pair  provides for that all members  understand what a colleague is, and what a vendor is, and what a customer is, for example. Though there can be some flexibility in relationship pairs , meaning that members  can have some control as to how much information (e.g. enabled features ) they have in a specific relationship pair  type, the minimum boundary\/band feature sets  provide that no one member can deviate too far from those respective minimum features  of the relationship pair . For example, one member  as a colleague role cannot have the same features  and information sharing capabilities  as another member  as a vendor role , otherwise relationship roles would cease to have any meaning in the context of different relationship pair  types having different features ","One embodiment of the defined roles provides for the banding of the features\/capabilities , such that progression from one lesser role to the next greater role between any member pair  (e.g. from friend to colleague) provides for a minimum number of the features\/capabilities of the lesser role  to be included as default features (e.g. part of the minimum boundary\/band feature sets ) for the greater role . This banding provides for members  to truly represent their accepted role when interacting with the other members  of the member pair  using the assigned defined role . For example, a member  who has accepted another member  as a friend cannot simply turn off access  to the other member  from their contact information (e.g. phone number, email address, home address, etc.) that appropriately represents the friend role . It is understood that to be an accepted friend, some member information (and any other appropriate features\/capabilities ) cannot be restricted from the other member  of the member pair  on an adhoc basis. In other words, turning off or otherwise disabling of features  from the minimum boundary\/band feature set(s)  would cause the stated relationship pair , to lose the understood (by the members ) role characteristics inherent in the relationship pair , assigned to the members . It is also understood that the evolution of the minimum boundary\/band feature sets  for aggregate relationship pairs  can be hierarchical in assignment.","Referring again to , the capabilities\/features\/privileges\/restrictions  are grouped as associated\/assigned to the respective individual relationship role . It is recognised that the sets\/groups , of assigned features  can have some individual features  in common (e.g. overlapping sets\/groups , of features ), however each set\/group , of features  as a whole is unique in feature  content to the respective role type that they are assigned. In this manner, the administration system  can facilitate that a role  type has a unique first set  of assigned features  and therefore cannot be confused with a second role  type having a unique second set  of assigned features , such that the first  and second set  of features  are not identical. For example, the role type of a Colleague would have different set  of features  than that of an Associate, as would the aggregate role  of associate+colleague (see ) would have an aggregate set + of features ","It is also recognised that some features  can be superseded by other features , either in whole or in part (e.g. to take the place of such as replace or to augment so as to make an already assigned feature  greater\/lesser in size, extent, or influence), during aggregation of relationship pairs  and their corresponding roles and features sets ,, as further described below with respect to aggregate relationship pairs  (see ).","As an alternative embodiment to relationships  and banding, it is also recognised that the defined online existing relationship  between a first member  and a second member  can be defined by a plurality of existing relationship features  for use in managing network interaction  on the communications network  between the first member  and the second member . The relationship features  are characteristic of the relationship , such that at least one of the corresponding relationship features  of the relationship  is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction  type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format. It is recognised that the relationship features  can be between the first member  and the second member  (i.e. each of the members  do not have a defined relationship role , in the relationship ). Or, as further discussed above, it is recognised that a first portion of the relationship features characterizes the first relationship role and a second portion of the relationship features characterizes the second relationship role , such that the first relationship role and the second relationship role are part of the relationship defined as the relationship pair  between the first and second members . In other words, the aggregate relationship pair , described above by example only, can be administered by the administration system  as a role less relationship , such that the relationship features  are shared between the members  for managing their inter-member  interactions .","Relationship Aggregation","Referring to , the relationship pairs  and the associated roles that are assigned to a respective member  by the administration system  can change over time, as the online relationship the member  has with other members  also grows\/changes\/evolves over time. Flexibility in relationship  evolution management is facilitated by the ability of the administration system  to aggregate relationship pairs . Members  may not always have the same relationship with each other over time, and therefore the administration system  provides the environment for member relationships to alter, grow, and\/or diminish in their relationship characteristics (e.g. relationship roles and associated features and interaction  abilities.","Therefore, relationships  and optional relationship roles can change, as coordinated by the administration system , and in changing some relationship features  and\/or roles can supersede (either in whole or in part) one another. For example, two members  could be paired  as Associates but then become closer and decide to become paired  as Colleagues. In becoming colleagues, their associate relationship  could be superseded because all of the features and capabilities  of the Associate relationship  could be within the Colleague relationship .","Further, individual relationships  and the corresponding relationship roles need to be able to grow, in order to provide for desired richer (e.g. additional feature  supported) interaction(s)  between the members  of the evolving\/growing relationship . One mechanism provided by the administration system  to support the evolution of relationships is the coordination of aggregate relationship pairs  that can involve multiple relationship sub-pairs . For example, two members  could be in a colleague-colleague relationship pair , but also want to engage in a customer-vendor relationship pair  as well as a student-vendor relationship pair . The administration system  facilitates the management of the associated roles as an aggregate role  and the associated features set  as an aggregate feature set  by enabling individual relationship pairs  that have different features and capabilities  to aggregate.","An example of relationship evolution between members  is Joe Smith M goes to University to be a Doctor. While at University, the teachers have decided to use a valuable medical industry social CRM network\u2014administration system \u2014to work with their students . One of Joe's M professors is Dr. Jones M. Joe M connects with Dr. Jones M on the administration system  in a Student-Teacher relationship pair RP-ST. Joe M gels his residency at Toronto General, as shown in . He leaves university to start his new full time position. In leaving school, the system  asks him to confirm that his relationship pair RP-ST (as Student to Teacher) be cancelled or changed, shown deleted by stippled lines for R-T,F-T and R-S,F-S in ","Next, the final result of relationship evolution is shown in , where first Joe M requests, via a handshake , that Dr. Jones  accept new relationship pair RP-AA\u2014an Associate to Associate. Joe M is now a physician at Toronto General, and he meets Dr. Jones M one day in the hall as Dr. Jones M is now performing many consultations at the hospital. They M,M end up being able to become closer, and are now colleagues. They change their administration system  via interactions  with one another to reflect this, i.e. to add a colleague to colleague pair RP-CC. Joe M decides he is no longer interested in working with the providers, and interviews with AstraZeneca to work with their medical department. They accept that, and he moves to AZ. He keeps his Colleague to Colleague relationship pair RP-CC with Dr. Jones M, but now also requests  that Dr. Jones M accept him as a Vendor for AV products, thus further evolving their relationship in the administration system  to add a vendor-customer relationship pair RP-VCust.","In view of the above example, it is recognised that the individual relationship pairs RP-AA, RP-VCust, RP-CC are aggregated to define the corresponding aggregate relationship pair  (an aggregation of the different individual relationship pairs ) between the members M,M. Further, it is recognised that the corresponding aggregate role  is an aggregated combination of the individually defined roles (e.g. role R-A, R-A, R-V, R-Cust, R-C, R-C) of each of the individual relationship pairs RP-AA, RP-VC, RP-CC, and the corresponding aggregate features\/capabilities  is an aggregated combination of the individually defined features\/capabilities  (e.g. features\/capabilities C-A,C-A, C-V,C-Cust, C-C, C-C) of each of the individual relationship roles . In other words, the administration system  provides for defined interactions  between any paired members  based on their aggregate features\/capabilities  as defined via their corresponding aggregate role . For example, Joe M interacts  with Dr. Jones M in their aggregate relationship pair  using any of the aggregate features\/capabilities . In view of the defined interactions  facilitated by the system  via the relationship gate  (see ), either of the members M,M can recognise what individual role (and\/or combined role ) available in the aggregate role  that the member M,M is using during the interactions , as any of the aggregate features\/capabilities  can retain and\/or combine their individual defined characteristic features\/capabilities  characteristics represented in the interactions .","Further, in view of the above, it is recognised that certain feature(s)  can be such as but not limited to: unique (e.g. only provided) by a particular role and therefore become additions\/deletions to\/from the existing\/aggregate features  when the roles are aggregated (i.e. when a new role is added to existing role(s) or aggregate role  and\/or existing role(s) is\/are deleted\/removed from the existing aggregate role  (or existing single role ); can overlap (e.g. be in common) between two or more roles and therefore become redundant aggregate feature(s)  when the roles are aggregated; can be conflicting with other existing features  of the set of aggregate features  and therefore the new and\/or existing features  can be disabled\/deleted from the aggregate features  when the roles are aggregated; can supersede or be superseded (e.g. either the new or existing feature is a preferred feature ) over existing\/new feature(s)  in the aggregate features  and therefore the non-preferred features new and\/or existing features  can be disabled\/deleted from the aggregate features ; or a combination thereof.","Further, it is recognised that the process of aggregation performed by the administration system  for example, to result in the aggregate relationship pair  and associated optional aggregate role  and assigned aggregate features , can be defined by such as but not limited to: the combining of a selected (e.g. by the member  and\/or requested  by another member ) new optional role to an existing relationship role or to two or more existing roles (e.g. to an existing aggregate role ) of a relationship pair ,; the deleting of a selected role from two or more existing roles (e.g. to an existing aggregate role ) of a relationship pair ; and\/or the amendment of an existing relationship role or of at least one of two or more existing roles (e.g. to an existing aggregate role ) of a relationship pair , through the combining with selected new role(s) and\/or an existing aggregated role .","It is recognised that the content (e.g. text, image, video, enclosures, message type (email, telephone, text message, etc.), message enclosures, content size\/amount\/length) and\/or format (e.g. form of the content such as colour, font style, message priority, etc.) of the interactions  can be defined by and their generation facilitated by the associated features\/capabilities (e.g. of the optional role or as shared by the members  of the pair ) that the member  is using\/operating under in the administration system  with selected (active and\/or passive) other members . It is also recognised that the content and\/or form of the interactions  can be defined using a combination of different roles and their associated features in view of aggregation of relationship pairs . Therefore, the aggregate features  of the aggregate role  can cooperate together and\/or separately, as selected by the respective member  to generate  and\/or to respond\/reply  to communications over the network  between member(s)  that are part of the member aggregate relationship pair  governed by the aggregate roles assigned to the members  of the aggregate relationship pair .","For example, when Joe M asks  Dr. Jones M to dinner, the characteristics (e.g. text, image content and\/or format) of the interaction  can be defined by the particular features\/capabilities  Joe M is using from his aggregate role  of the aggregate relationship pair  with Dr. Jones M. For instance, Joe M can send an email  to Dr. Jones M requesting a meeting at a corresponding time and place. Based on the use of certain individual role(s) in the aggregate role , by Joe M, when generating the email , Joe M can affect the perceived tone (e.g. business, personal, or a combination thereof) of the email  by selecting certain features\/capabilities associated with selected roles of his aggregated role  with Dr. Jones M. For example, Joe M can select in communication with interaction  building capabilities of the administration system  (e.g. via browser as a thin client of the administration system  as a Web service), and\/or via an administration system module\/application  installed on his device , see , (e.g. as a thick client of the administration system ), the particular roles R-V,R-C and therefore have available all of the content\/format features C-V,C-C to generate the email . In this case, Joe M can include in the email  vendor details (via the selected individual capabilities C-V of the selected individual role R-V) of his products with marketing and\/or order materials (as email enclosures) and can also have the email  type formatted (via the selected individual capabilities C-C of the selected individual role R-C in the role ) to be perceived as a colleague meeting invitation. This would provide for Dr. Jones M to understand that the proposed meeting will be a combination of business and personal interaction between them, e.g. a soft sell environment with potential for extended interaction in the colleague context. On the contrary, Joe M can include in the email  only vendor details (via the selected individual capabilities C-V of the selected individual role R-V in the role ) of his products with marketing and\/or order materials (as email enclosures) with corresponding formatting (via the selected individual capabilities C-C of the selected individual role R-C in the role ). This would provide for Dr. Jones M to understand that the proposed meeting will be a strictly business interaction between them, e.g. a harder sell environment with little\/no time for extended interaction in other role contexts of the aggregate role  of the aggregate relationship . It is recognised that both Dr. Jones M and Joe M are cognizant of the extents (i.e. list of possible individual roles and associated individual features ) of their aggregate relationship pair .","As well, further to the above example, Dr. Jones M can also include in his response communication  (e.g. email and\/or telephone call) the appropriate type of response as dictated by the individual role(s) used to generate the original email . For example, in the strict business sense, the relationship gate  may disallow return communication  (to the email ) in the form of a telephone call, as this would not be available as a feature\/capability  in a customer role R-Cust in response to received product solicitation emails  (i.e. Joe M only used his role R-V to generate the email ). On the other hand, in the event where Joe M used his role R-V to generate the email  along with his role R-C as part of his aggregate role , the relationship gate  could allow Dr. Jones M to informally reply  to the original email  using a telephone call  as part of the features C-C afforded by Dr. Jones M role R-C of his respective aggregate role .","In view of and the above evolution example, it is recognised that aggregation of relationship pair  types (i.e. any member  assuming the roles and associated features\/capabilities of a plurality of relationship pair types ) can be used to represent electronically the definition of the Aggregate relationship role  for a member , representing the composite\/aggregation of individually defined roles that a member  has between two or more other members  of the administration system . Accordingly, the Aggregate relationship role  provides for any member  to evolve their aggregated relationship pairs  over time as an assembly\/combination of separate parts\/portions of features\/capabilities defined for a number of respective different defined relationship roles of a number of different relationship pair  types. It is recognised that the roles as part of the aggregate relationship role  can affect the growth and\/or shrinkage in size and\/or effect of the capabilities, features, and restrictions  associated with each overall aggregate relationship  (i.e. a combination\/aggregation of different relationship pairs ) between pairs of members . Therefore, the provision and coordination of aggregate relationship pairs  by the administration system  between pairs of members  can provide for incremental increase\/decrease in the size and\/or effect of the associated roles , and corresponding features\/capabilities as a collection from separate\/individual defined roles and corresponding features\/capabilities aggregated within the aggregate relationship pair .","As an alternative embodiment, it is also recognised that the defined online existing relationship  between a first member  and a second member  can be defined by a plurality of existing relationship features  for use in managing network interaction  on the communications network  between the first member  and the second member . The relationship features  are characteristic of the relationship , such that at least one of the corresponding relationship features  of the relationship  is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction  type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format. It is recognised that the relationship features  can be between the first member  and the second member  (i.e. each of the members  do not have a defined relationship role , in the relationship ). Or, as further discussed above, it is recognised that a first portion of the relationship features characterizes the first relationship role and a second portion of the relationship features characterizes the second relationship role , such that the first relationship role and the second relationship role are part of the relationship defined as the relationship pair  between the first and second members . In other words, the aggregate relationship pair , described above by example only, can be administered by the administration system  as a role less relationship , such that the relationship features  are shared between the members  for managing their inter-member  interactions .","Relationship Engine of the Administration System ","Referring to , shown is a relationship network environment  for facilitating communications  between members and nonmembers , (e.g. using a computing device \u2014see ) via the relationship administration system . Relationship data  is maintained by a relationship engine  of the system  for one or more pairs  defined for a pair of the members\/nonmembers ,. The mode, format, and\/or information content of the communications  between the members\/nonmembers , may be monitored or otherwise structured by the relationship administration system  in view of the particular features\/capabilities defined in the relationship data  of the pair(s)  defined for the member pair. The relationship engine  provides for initializing, maintaining, and modifying the defined pair(s)  associated with a selected pair of the members , as well as managing the interactions  based on the data .","For example, evolving a defined online existing relationship  between a first member  and a second member  is performed by the engine , such that the online existing relationship  is defined by a plurality of existing relationship features  for use in managing network interaction  on a communications network II between the first member  and the second member . The engine  facilitates receiving by a selection module  a new online relationship  (for example submitted by one of the members ) having new relationship features , such that the new features  are different from the existing relationship features . The new relationship features  are characteristic of the new relationship . The engine  aggregates the existing relationship features  (and optionally for the aggregate role  by aggregating the new and existing roles ) and the new relationship features  by an aggregation module  as aggregate relationship features , which are a combination of the existing relationship features  and the new relationship features , in order to define the aggregate relationship . The engine  stores the aggregate relationship features  in a storage  of the administration system  as relationship data  representing the aggregate relationship  defined by the relationship features  for example by the aggregator module .","A further optional operation is by clone a banding module  for defining a minimum number (e.g. sets ,) of aggregate features  of the aggregate relationship  that must be maintained, as discussed above. A further optional operation is by a role module  for defining the aggregate role for each of the members  of the aggregate relationship  that is confirmed by the member (s) . It is also recognised that the role module  can be used to define any directional and inherent\/passive nature of the roles ","Further, the engine  has the relationship gate module  configured for accessing the relationship data  in order to determine whether a selected network interaction  from one of the members  is permitted in view of at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features  of the aggregate relationship . The relationship gate module  also facilitates the selected network interaction  between the members  when determined as permitted, such that the at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features  of the aggregate relationship  is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction  type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","It is also recognized that multimember pairings  could be implemented by the system , for example where each of a plurality of members is paired to a respective member (e.g. a many to one pairing) or a respective member is paired to a plurality of members (e.g. a one to many pairing). This type of pairing provides for the setup of group settings, such as a plurality of customers that are serviced by a vendor, a plurality of vendors that are selected to service a particular customer, a manager that has a number of employees, etc. In this manner, communications  between the members in group settings can be performed in parallel, such that an offer from one vendor can be communicated  simultaneously to the each of the plurality of customers associated with the vendor, via the respective defined vendor customer role pairs  between the vendor and each of the customers of the plurality of customers of the system . Also, in the case of multiple vendors for a particular customer, each of the vendors could be made aware (via the system ) of an offer proposed by one of the vendors to the customer (e.g. in a open bid process in a Request for Proposal situation). Further, it is also recognized that a many to many member group can be set up, such as in the case of a group of friends, a group of colleagues, etc. In this manner, communications  sent to one of the members of the group would be communicated to each of the other members of the group.","However, in each of the above multimember pairing examples, there can exists defined role between any two member pair of the plurality of members , i.e. in the colleague group example, each of the members of the group would have a colleague-colleague defined role with each of the other members of the group. A further embodiment is where there is a relationship defined as a three (or more) person \u201cpairing\u201d such that there are three or more roles , with associated features\/capabilities to define the complete set of interactions  between the multi-person \u201cpairing\u201d . In this manner, each of the members of the multi-person pairing (also know as a member set) has a subset of the total features\/capabilities (some features\/capabilities can be overlapping between the members of the member set. For example, a relationship member set of a teacher, a tutor, and a student can be implemented in the system , such that each member of the member set is connected to each other as defined by the individual relationship roles defined in their relationship data . For example, the teacher, tutor, student combination could contain the individual pairings  of student-teacher, teacher-student, student-tutor, tutor-student, teacher-tutor, and tutor-teacher, such that each of the roles of the member set pairing  would have the associated features\/capabilities . For example, the tutor and the teacher could share  exam results and other evaluation criteria\/comments of the student (which are blocked  from view from the student), the tutor could receive and respond  to laboratory questions from the student, however these questions would not be communicated  to the teacher until first reviewed\/commented on by the tutor, etc.","In the manner as discussed above by example, the format, content, mode, and other features\/capabilities of the communications  (including information visible on the Web page\/profile page  of the member account) between members is monitored and\/or otherwise maintained\/structured by the system .","The following is a list, for example only, of the configuration of the relationship data  between any pair of members of the system :\n\n","Referring to , , , and , a method  for evolving a defined online existing relationship  between a first member  and a second member  is provided, such that the online existing relationship  is defined by a plurality of existing relationship features  for use in managing network interaction  on a communications network  between the first member  and the second member . The method  comprises the steps of: step  receiving by the selection module  a new online relationship  having new relationship features  such that the new features  are different from the existing relationship features , the new relationship features  being characteristic of the new relationship ; step  aggregating the existing relationship features  (and optionally for the aggregate role ) and the new relationship features  by the aggregation module  as aggregate relationship features  as a combination of the existing relationship features  and the new relationship features  in order to define an aggregate relationship ; step  storing the aggregate relationship features  in a storage  of the administration system  as relationship data  representing the aggregate relationship  defined by the relationship features ; and step  of accessing the relationship data  by the relationship gate  in order to determine whether a selected network interaction  from one of the members  is permitted in view of at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features  of the aggregate relationship  and facilitating the selected network interaction  between the members  when determined as permitted, such that the at least one of the corresponding aggregate relationship features  of the aggregate relationship  is used to define as permitted at least one of the network interaction  type, the network interaction content, or the network interaction format.","A further optional step  is by a banding module  for defining a minimum number of features  of the relationship  that must be maintained. A further optional step  is by a role module  for defining the aggregate role for each of the members  of the relationship  that must be confirmed by the member (s) . It is also recognised that the role module  can be used to define any directional and inherent\/passive nature of the roles ","Computing Devices ","Referring to , each of the above-described members  and administration systems  can be implemented on one or more respective computing device(s) . The devices  in general can include a network connection interface , such as a network interface card or a modem, coupled via connection  to a device infrastructure . The connection interface  is connectable during operation of the devices  to the network  (e.g. an intranet and\/or an extranet such as the Internet), which enables the devices  to communicate with each other as appropriate. The network  supports the communication  of the data between the administration system  and members , and also supports the communication  of the data between the members .","Referring again to , the devices  can also have a user interface , coupled to the device infrastructure  by connection , to interact with a user (e.g. vendor , customer , nonmember , etc.). The user interface  can include one or more user input devices such as but not limited to a QWERTY keyboard, a keypad, a track wheel, a stylus, a mouse, a microphone and the user output device such as an LCD screen display and\/or a speaker. If the screen is touch sensitive, then the display can also be used as the user input device as controlled by the device infrastructure . For example, the user interface  for the devices  used by the members  can be configured to interact with the members  web browsers (applications ) to access  the member information  available on the websites\/accounts  of the members . For the devices  used by the members ,e user interfaces  can be used to access the administration system  (e.g. via a website) to register with the system  (i.e. set up\/modify their account) as well as to provide information for display on their account . For the devices  used by the administration system  (e.g. using the relationship engine ), the user interfaces  can be used to the administration to configure the relationship data  of member pairing(s)  based on information and\/or registration data of the members .","Referring again to , operation or the device  is facilitated by the device infrastructure . The device infrastructure  includes one or more computer processors  and can include an associated memory  (e.g. a random access memory) for storing of relationship data  and for processing communications  communicated between the members  and between the administration system  and the members . The computer processor  facilitates performance of the device  configured for the intended task (e.g. members , administration system ) through operation of the network interface , the user interface  and other application programs\/hardware  of the device  by executing task related instructions. These task related instructions can be provided by an operating system, and\/or software applications  located in the memory , and\/or by operability that is configured into the electronic\/digital circuitry of the processor(s)  designed to perform the specific task(s). Further, it is recognized that the device infrastructure  can include a computer readable storage medium  coupled to the processor  for providing instructions to the processor  and\/or to load\/update client applications . The computer readable medium  can include hardware and\/or software such as, by way of example only, magnetic disks, magnetic tape, optically readable medium such as CD\/DVD ROMS, and memory cards. In each case, the computer readable medium  may take the form of a small disk, floppy diskette, cassette, hard disk drive, solid state memory card, or RAM provided in the memory module . It should be noted that the above listed example computer readable mediums  can be used either alone or in combination. For example, the applications  can include browsers used by the members  to access the Web site of the administration system  and\/or to communicate  information between members  of the system ","Further, it is recognized that the computing devices  can include the executable applications  comprising code or machine readable instructions for implementing predetermined functions\/operations including those of an operating system, relationship configuration system(s), for example, in response to user command or input. The processor  as used herein is a configured device and\/or set of machine-readable instructions for performing operations as described by example above. As used herein, the processor  may comprise any one or combination of, hardware, firmware, and\/or software. The processor  acts upon information by manipulating, analyzing, modifying, converting or transmitting information for use by an executable procedure or an information device, and\/or by routing the information with respect to an output device. The processor  may use or comprise the capabilities of a controller or microprocessor, for example. Accordingly, any of the functionality (e.g. engine ) provided by the systems and process of FIGS. ,, may be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both. Accordingly, the use of a processor  as a device and\/or as a set of machine readable instructions is hereafter referred to generically as a processor\/module for sake of simplicity. Further, it is recognized that the administration system  can include one or more of the computing devices  (comprising hardware and\/or software) for implementing the engine , as desired.","It will be understood that the member  client computing devices  may be, for example, personal computers, personal digital assistants, mobile phones, and content players. Server computing devices  (e.g. for the administration system  and\/or the member ) may additionally include a secondary storage element such as the memory (e.g. database). Each server, although depicted as a single computer system, may be implemented as a network of computer processors, as desired."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S)"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described in conjunction with the following drawings, by way of example only, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":["a","b","c "],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 1"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"i":["b ","a; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
