title: Techniques for high fidelity quantum teleportation and computing
abstract: Techniques for high fidelity quantum teleportation include receiving an input photon representing a qubit. Ancilla photons are generated in a particular ancilla quantum state chosen to reduce a rate of error below a threshold error rate. The ancilla and the input photon are combined to populate output channels. A number of photons representing logical value 1 are measured in a subset of the output channels. A particular output channel is determined based on the measured number of photons. A teleported photon is obtained at the particular output channel with an error rate below the threshold error rate. These techniques allow the ancilla quantum state to be chosen to minimize the error despite the presence of losses and noise. Quantum logic operations are performed by teleporting two input qubits with the quantum state of the ancilla chosen to produce the desired logical result and reduce the error.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to quantum information processing, and, in particular, to techniques for increasing the fidelity of teleportation and logic operations on quantum bits (qubits) represented by quantum states of single photons.","2. Description of the Related Art","Information processing using classical computers relies on physical phenomena, such as magnetic fields, voltages, and optical intensity that can be produced and measured in each of two basis states, one basis state representing a zero and another basis state representing a one. Each physical element that can achieve either of these two states represents one binary digit, called a bit. Quantum information processing uses physical elements that exhibit quantum properties that may include, not only one of the two or more basis states, but also an arbitrary superposition state of the basis states. A superposition state has some non-zero probability of being measured as one of the basis states and some non-zero probability of being measured as another of the basis states. A physical element that exhibits quantum properties for two basis states represents one quantum bit, also called a qubit. Physical elements that are suitable for representing qubits include the spins of single electrons, electron states in atoms or molecules, nuclear spins in molecules and solids, magnetic flux, spatial propagation modes of single photons, and polarizations of single photons, among others.","Logical operations performed on qubits apply not only to the basis states of those qubits but also to the superposition states of those qubits, simultaneously. Quantum computers based on logical operations on systems of qubits offer the promise of massively simultaneous processing (also called massively parallel processing) that can address problems that are considered intractable with classical information processing. Such classically intractable problems that can be addressed with quantum computers include simulation of quantum interactions, combinatorial searches of unsorted data, finding prime factors of large integers, solving for cryptographic keys used in current secure communication algorithms, and truly secure communications (also called \u201cquantum cryptography\u201d).","One approach uses linear interactions between single photons but relies on interferometer techniques, e.g., interference on two spatial modes of propagation for a single photon. For example, logic gates using this approach have been proposed by E. Knill, R. Laflamme, and G. J. Milburn, \u201cA scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics,\u201d , vol. 409, p. 49, 4 Jan. 2001 (hereinafter Knill) and by M. Koashi, T. Yamamoto, and N. Imoto, \u201cProbabilistic manipulation of entangled photons,\u201d A, vol. 63, 030301, 12 Feb. 2001 (hereinafter Koashi), the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. These devices are called \u201cprobabilistic\u201d logical gates because they perform the desired logical operation in response to only a fraction of the input photons. However, it can be determined when an operation is performed successfully, so that, in a separate step often called a \u201cpost selection\u201d step or a \u201cpost-detection selection\u201d step, output photons are blocked unless the operation is successfully performed. It has been shown that the fraction can be increased close to a value of one with sufficient numbers of components and extra photons (called \u201cancilla photons\u201d or \u201cancilla\u201d) in particular states.","Although the occurrence of certain failures in the Knill approach can be identified by measurements on the ancilla, devices based on the Knill approach might still benefit from the use of quantum error correction techniques. The certain failures identified are equivalent to z-measurement errors, which can be corrected using a simple two-bit concatenated code that operates even in the presence of a relatively high error rate (e.g., as described in E. Knill, R. Laflamme, and G. Milbum, quant-ph\/0006120). The devices proposed in Knill also suffer from errors due to thermally induced phase shifts on the two spatial modes. The same two-bit code can be used to correct for phase-shift errors and possibly for photon losses. Other probabilistic, linear devices proposed by Koashi reduce the phase shifts by including a large number of additional components and other resources, such as sources of a large number of qubits in particular states. However, the two-bit code and the approach of Koashi have not been shown to correct for more general errors, e.g., errors that would be introduced by imperfect generation of the entangled ancilla states.","The use of more general quantum error correction approaches require a relatively low error rate, called the \u201cerror threshold\u201d of the correction approach. For the Knill approach to reduce error rates below the error threshold of general quantum error correction, a large number of ancilla photons are needed. Knill shows that the failure probability could decrease as 1\/N, where N is the number of ancilla photons, in the limit of large N. With sufficiently large N, the approach of Knill should be able to be used with general quantum error correction approaches.","However, there are several additional problems if the number N of ancilla becomes too great. One additional problem is that an increase in N involves an increase in the number of resources required in a quantum computing device to generate the increased number of ancilla. Another problem is that an increase in N increases the probability of technical errors (e.g. phase shifts, photon loss, etc.) in the logic operation using the extra ancilla along with the probability that an error will occur in the generation of one or more ancilla. Thus a point of diminishing returns may be reached where it becomes more difficult to reduce the error rate below the error threshold because the increase in the number of ancilla to reduce the intrinsic error (1\/N) in the Knill approach also increases the chances of technical errors in the generation of the ancilla or in the logic device using the extra ancilla.","Based on the foregoing description, there is a clear need for techniques that increase the fidelity of quantum logic operations on qubits represented by single photons that do not suffer the deficiencies of current approaches. In particular, there is a clear need for techniques that decrease the failure rate of quantum logic operations at a rate faster than the reciprocal of the first power of the number of ancilla.","The approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not to be considered prior art to the claims in this application merely due to the presence of these approaches in this background section.","Optical techniques are described for performing quantum teleportation and quantum logic operations with high fidelity (low error probability). These techniques allow such operations to be performed with much lower error probabilities than any other method previously known. The low error probability is beneficial for quantum computing applications, because the average error probability must be below the threshold for quantum error correction in order for such correction methods to apply. These quantum error correction methods allow many more useful calculations to be performed than can be performed without such corrections. In addition, quantum teleportation with low error rates would also enable the development of quantum repeaters, which would extend the maximum range of secure communications systems based on quantum key distribution. No secure communications systems based on quantum key distribution known to the inventors are currently in practical use because the maximum range is too small. Thus, embodiments of the current invention will be of major benefit to the development of quantum computers, quantum key distribution systems, and other forms of quantum information processing.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method for high fidelity quantum teleportation includes receiving an input photon representing a particular quantum superposition state for logical values 0 and 1. Ancilla photons are generated in a particular ancilla quantum state chosen to reduce a rate of error for obtaining a teleported photon below a threshold error rate. The ancilla photons are combined with the input photon using one or more linear optical elements to populate output channels. A number of photons representing logical value 1 are measured in a subset of the output channels. A particular output channel is determined based on the measured number of photons. A teleported photon is obtained at the particular output channel with the desired quantum superposition state of the input photon and an error rate below the threshold error rate.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method for high fidelity quantum logic operations includes receiving multiple input photons representing corresponding quantum superposition states for logical values 0 and 1. Ancilla photons are generated in a particular ancilla quantum state chosen to reduce a rate of error for obtaining a result of a particular logical operation below a threshold error rate. The ancilla are combined with the input photons using one or more linear optical element to populate output channels. A number of photons representing logical value 1 are measured in a first subset of the output channels. A second subset of output channels is determined based on the number of photons measured. A result of the logical operation is obtained with an error rate below the threshold error rate as output photons on the second subset of output channels.","In some embodiments of these aspects, the threshold error rate is a rate of error of a probabilistic method for performing the logical operation. In some embodiments, the threshold error rate is a threshold rate of error for a quantum error correction method.","In some embodiments of these aspects, a phase correction is applied to a photon in an output channel based on the number of photons measured.","In some embodiments of these aspects, generating the ancilla includes producing an electron in an excited state in an array of quantum dots for each ancilla photon to be produced with a logical value of 1. The electron in the excited state is positioned among the quantum dots based on the particular ancilla quantum state. The excited electron is caused to emit a photon into a spatial mode corresponding to an ancilla photon.","In other aspects of the invention, devices are provided that implement these methods.","As a consequence of sufficient error reduction achieved by some embodiments of this invention, all outputs of quantum computations can be used, without post selection, because any errors can be corrected using general quantum error correction algorithms. Therefore these techniques increase the chances of producing non-probabilistic (deterministic) quantum computations.","Methods and apparatuses for high fidelity quantum computing using qubits represented by single photons are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of one or more single qubits that each represent the arbitrary superposition of two basis states; a first basis state representing the logical value \u201cone\u201d and indicated by the presence of a photon in a particular spatial mode, and a second basis state representing the logical value \u201czero\u201d and indicated by the absence of a photon in that spatial mode. As used herein, a spatial mode is a direction of propagation of a single photon along a particular set of locations, such as in an optical fiber, or along straight-line segments between mirrors in free space. As used herein a \u201cphoton\u201d includes a photon in either basis state or in an arbitrary superposition of the basis states. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited to this context. The invention may be applied in any quantum computing context using photons to represent qubits.","For example, embodiments of the invention may be used where qubits are represented by the polarization state of single photons. It is well known that a qubit represented by polarization states of a photon can be converted to a qubit represented by presence or absence in a particular spatial mode by passing the photon through a polarizing beam splitter. Similarly, a qubit represented by presence or absence in a particular spatial mode can be converted to a qubit represented by polarization states by passing the photon in the particular spatial mode through a rotator that rotates the photon to a first polarization representing a first basis state, e.g., a horizontal polarization; and by passing a photon in the complimentary spatial mode through a rotator that rotates the photon to a second, orthogonal polarization representing a second basis state, e.g., a vertical polarization; and then merging the two spatial modes.","In further examples, embodiments of the invention may be used where the qubits of interest are logical qubits made up of one or more layers, each layer made up of one or more single qubits represented by individual photons. In such embodiments, the logical qubits can be operated upon by the proper sequence of operations on the single qubits, as described herein.","1. Structural Overview","The basic operation of the invention can be understood from embodiments depicted in  and  and described in the next few paragraphs. More detailed embodiments of the invention are then described in the following sections. A more succinct account of the invention from a scientific point of view can be found in a recently published paper on the subject by J. D. Franson, M. M. Donegan, M. J. Fitch, B. C. Jacobs, and T. B. Pittman, \u201cHigh-Fidelity Quantum Logic Operations Using Linear Optical Elements,\u201d , vol. 89, 137901, 23 Sep. 2002, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. All of the essential details from that paper are explicitly included herein.","A high-fidelity method for quantum teleportation is shown in . An input channel  (one embodiment of which is an optical fiber) is capable of transporting an input photon to the device. In one embodiment, the presence of a single photon represents the logical value 1 and the absence of a photon represents the logical value 0. In quantum mechanics, there may be some nonzero probability amplitude for the value 0 and some nonzero probability amplitude for the value 1, which is referred to as a superposition state. The intended function of the invention is to transfer an arbitrary quantum state of the input to a distant location with small error probability even in the presence of losses or noise.","As illustrated in , a plurality of additional photons are input to the device using additional channels (one embodiment of which would be to use additional optical fibers). These additional photons are hereinafter referred to as \u201cancilla photons,\u201d or \u201cancilla\u201d and are produced in source device . With all generality, the number of such additional photons is denoted as N. The input photon is then combined with the N ancilla photons using one or more linear optical elements , such as mirrors, lenses, beam splitters, and phase shifters. A set of output channels (one embodiment of which would be N+1 additional optical fibers) provides a means for the photons to leave the device. Measurements are made in device  to determine the number of photons leaving the device in some but not all of the output channels . It is expected that the quantum state of the input qubit will have been teleported to one of the output channels , designated as output channel , which is determined by the results of the measurements, aside from a phase correction that can be applied using devices that are well known to the state of the art (one embodiment of which is a Pockels cell). A feature of an illustrated embodiment is that the quantum state of the ancilla photons produced in source  can be chosen to reduce the probability of an error in this process to be proportional to the inverse of the square of N, which is much smaller than the error in any previous method.","A high-fidelity method for quantum logic operations is illustrated in . This method is a generalization of the quantum teleportation described above, in that two input channels , \u2032 now allow two photons representing two qubits to be input to the device. The intended function of this device is to perform a logic operation on the two input qubits while teleporting the result to two different output channels. Examples of embodiments of these logic operations include a controlled sign gate and a controlled-NOT gate, the intended functions of which are all well known in the art. As in the teleportation described above, additional photons, or ancilla, generated in source  are input to the device along channels and combined with the two inputs using one or more linear optical elements . Once again, a set of output channels provides a means for the photons to leave the device. In device , measurements are once again made to determine the number of photons leaving the device in some but not all of the output channels . It is expected that this device will produce the desired logical output in two of the output channels , designated output channels , \u2032, determined from the measurements made in device , as described in detail below, aside from phase corrections that can be applied using techniques that are well known. Once again, a feature of the illustrated embodiments is that the quantum state of the ancilla photons produced in source  can be chosen to reduce the probability of an error in the outputs to be proportional to the inverse of the square of the number of ancilla photons, which is much smaller than the error in any previous method.","One embodiment of a method for generating the required additional or ancilla photons in the optimal quantum state has been described in the literatureby J. D. Franson, M. M. Donegan, and B. C. Jacobs, \u201cGeneration of Entangled Ancilla States for use in Linear Optics Quantum Computing,\u201d quant-ph\/0303137, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The essential details of that reference are described below. The operation of similar logic devices for the case of N=1 has been experimentally demonstrated by T. B. Pittman, B. C. Jacobs, and J. D. Franson, \u201cDemonstration of Nondeterministic Quantum Logic Operations Using Linear Optical Elements,\u201d Physical Review Letters, vol. 88, 257902, 2002.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["103","102","102","102","102"]},"The device  includes preprocessors , \u2032 connected to corresponding input qubit spatial modes , \u2032, respectively. Each of preprocessors , \u2032 performs a single qubit transformation of an input qubit on the corresponding spatial mode , \u2032, respectively, using linear optics elements. In some embodiments, either or both preprocessors , \u2032 are omitted.","The device  includes sensors component  connected to multiple spatial modes. The sensors component , like measurements devices , , measures one or more properties of groups of photons on the connected spatial modes, as described in more detail below. In the illustrated embodiment, sensors component  includes two sensors ,  connected to spatial modes optically connected to input qubit spatial modes , \u2032, respectively, through preprocessors , \u2032, respectively. In other embodiments, sensors component  includes more or fewer sensors.","Device  also includes a source  of ancilla photons. The source  of ancilla photons outputs at least partially entangled photons into banks of multiple spatial modes called registers , \u2032, , \u2032. Roughly speaking, two or more photons are entangled if their states are correlated in a non-trivial manner, e.g., the chances of one photon being measured in one state is related to the measured state of another photon among the entangled photons. Each register includes multiple instances of single spatial modes . X register  and y register  are associated with the input qubit on input spatial mode ; and x\u2032 register \u2032 and y\u2032 register \u2032 are associated with the input qubit on input spatial mode \u2032. In some embodiments in which input qubit spatial mode  is omitted, associated x register , and associated y register  are also omitted. Several implementations for the source  of ancilla photons are described in more detail in later sections.","The spatial modes  in the primed and unprimed x registers \u2032,  are also connected to sensors component . In the illustrated embodiment, the spatial modes  in x register  are connected to sensor ; and the spatial modes  in x\u2032 register \u2032 are connected to sensor . Sensors component  measures some property of the photons in the connected registers to generate output data that indicates which spatial mode  in the primed and unprimed y registers \u2032,  provides output qubits. In the illustrated embodiment, sensor  measures a property of the photons in x register  and the qubit from input spatial mode  to indicate a single mode in y register . Similarly, sensor  measures a property of the photons in x\u2032 register \u2032 and the qubit from input spatial mode \u2032 to indicate a single mode in y\u2032 register \u2032.","Device  also includes an optical coupler  to output a qubit that represents a result of the quantum operation. Sensors component  is connected to optical coupler  via data line . In the illustrated embodiment, data line  is a classical data line; in other embodiments data line is an optical spatial mode for carrying a qubit or photon in a particular state. Output data from sensors component  is transferred to optical coupler  over data line ; and optical coupler  selects a single spatial mode  from each of the y registers , \u2032 based on that output data. In , the single spatial mode  selected by the optical coupler  from each y register is represented by a dotted arrow connecting the single spatial mode to the coupler . In some embodiments in which input qubit spatial mode  is omitted, optical coupler  outputs only one qubit, based on y\u2032 register \u2032.","In the illustrated embodiment, device  also includes a processor  to modify the photons in either or both y registers , \u2032 using linear optical elements. Operations performed by processor  in some embodiments are described in more detail below. For example, processor  is used to change the phase of a photon propagating in one or more of the spatial modes in either or both the y-registers , \u2032, or to combine the photons in the two registers , \u2032 to effect some logical operation. In some embodiments, processor  is omitted.","The device  includes, connected to optical coupler , post-processors , \u2032 connected to corresponding output qubit spatial modes , \u2032, respectively. Output qubit spatial modes , \u2032 carry outputs that are based, at least in part, on input qubit spatial modes , \u2032, respectively. In some embodiments in which input qubit spatial mode  is omitted, associated output qubit spatial mode  is also omitted.","Each of postprocessors , \u2032 performs a single qubit transformation of an output qubit from the optical coupler  for the corresponding spatial mode , \u2032, respectively, using linear optical elements. In some embodiments, either or both postprocessors , \u2032 are omitted.","Knill describes a quantum teleportation device and a quantum controlled sign flip device based on various embodiments that can be described in the context of device . As described above, the function of quantum teleportation is to output a qubit that has the same superposition state as an input qubit but in a different spatial mode from the input qubit, without measuring the input qubit. The function of a quantum controlled sign flip (CZ) device is to change a sign of a value of a first base component corresponding to the first basis state of an input \u201ctarget\u201d qubit if a second input, \u201ccontrol\u201d qubit would be measured in the |1] state and to do nothing if the control qubit would be measured in the |8] state, without measuring either the target qubit or the control qubit. For example, if the control qubit would be measured in the |1] state, then a CZ device converts a target qubit in the state {\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0]} to the state {\u2212\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0]}. The Knill devices do not employ preprocessors , \u2032 and do not employ post-processors , \u2032.","The devices of Knill use a particular superposition state for the entangled ancilla photons in x registers , \u2032 and y registers , \u2032. The superposition state for the entangled ancilla is such that specific basis states that would be measured for the photons in those registers form a particular sequence of basis states among a limited set of such sequences. Herein, a \u201csequence of basis states\u201d or simply a \u201csequence\u201d denotes a possible combination of values in which a number of photons could be found. For example, in a two-photon system, one such sequence could be 01, indicating that the first photon is found to be 0 and the second is found to be 1. The chance that the x and y registers would be measured in a particular sequence of the set is equal to the chance that the x and y registers would be measured in any other sequence of the set. Thus, if there are M sequences of basis states for the registers, then the chance that the registers would be measured in a specific one is 1\/M. The superposition state of the ancilla is given by a weighted sum of the sequences in the set using a constant weight.","According to some embodiments of the invention, to reduce errors, the chance of the registers being measured in at least one sequence of the set is different from the chance of the register being measured in a different sequence. Thus, if there are M sequences, then, for at least one of those sequences, the chance that the registers would be measured with that sequence is different from 1\/M. The superposition state of the ancilla is given by a weighted sum of the sequences in the set using a non-constant weight. Therefore, according to embodiments of the invention, the source  of ancilla photons for the device is different from a source proposed by Knill. As is shown below, changing the chances of measuring ancilla photons in the different sequences can decrease the probability of error in output qubits from the device, which represent results of quantum logical operations and teleportation, collectively referenced herein as quantum operations.","2. Quantum Operations","The effects of unequal probabilities for different sequences are described in the context of implementations of device  for performing example quantum operations. The quantum operations described are teleportation for a single qubit and for pairs of qubits, a quantum sign flip, and a quantum CNOT. D. Gottesman and I. Chuang, Nature, London, vol. 402, p 390, 1999 (hereinafter Gottesman) have showed that quantum logic operations can be performed using quantum teleportation, where the desired logic operation is applied to an entangled pair of ancilla rather than to the input qubits. Probabilistic techniques can be applied repeatedly until the necessary ancilla entangled state is generated. The desired logic operation is performed by teleporting the qubits of interest.","2.1 Teleportation of Single Qubit","In general, a teleportation device receives a qubit in the arbitrary state {\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0]} in one spatial mode and outputs a qubit in the same state {\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0]} in a different spatial mode. For some embodiments that teleport single qubits, some or all components in device  that are not used are omitted. Omitted components in some embodiments include preprocessors , \u2032, post-processors , \u2032, and one input qubit spatial mode (e.g., ) and the corresponding sensor (e.g., ), x register (e.g., ), y register (e.g., ) and output qubit spatial mode (e.g., ).","According to an approach described in Knill, teleportation can be achieved by selecting an output qubit from a spatial mode in y\u2032 register \u2032 based on particular measurements made by sensor  on the photons in the x\u2032 register \u2032 and the input qubit spatial mode \u2032. In this operation, the ancilla photons in the x\u2032 register \u2032 and the y\u2032 register \u2032 are in a particular superposition state.","The particular superposition state in Knill corresponds to equal chances of being measured in any one of a particular set of sequences of basis states, or simply \u201csequences\u201d forming the superposition state. There are n+1 sequences in the set; and there are n spatial modes in each of the x\u2032 register \u2032 and the y\u2032 register \u2032. Each sequence in the set is identified by the index variable j, where j varies between 0 and n. As shown by Knill, and described in more detail below, these same sequences are used for teleportation of two qubits and sign flip operations. As will also be shown below, these same sequences are used in a quantum CNOT operation.","An example set of sequences for n=5 is shown in Table 1, where, for single qubit teleportation, the term \u201cx-reg\u201d refers to the x\u2032register \u2032 and the term \u201cy-reg\u201d refers to the y\u2032 register \u2032 and index j refers to j\u2032.

As in Knill, this is done to avoid determining the measured state of the input qubit during the measurements by sensors component . Therefore, the initial state of the ancilla photons in the x\u2032 and y\u2032 registers, represented by the symbol |\u03c8], is given by a weighted sum (superposition) of the individual sequences, with a weighting factor represented by the symbol f(j\u2032), as given by Equation 2a.\n\n|\u03c8]=\u03a3(\u2032)|1]|0]|0]|1]\u2003\u2003(2a)\n\nAccording to Knill, f(j\u2032) is a constant related to 1\/(n+1) (e.g., a constant equal to {1\/(n+1)}\/).

This error corresponds to having measured the input qubit, and finding the value 0 if the sum is 0, or the value 1 if the sum is 6. Determination of the input qubit value is generally considered an error because any possible superposition information is lost. For the approach used by Knill, this occurs 1\/(n+1) of the without regard to the distribution of qubit states between states |0] and |1]. This error rate approaches 1\/n for large values of n. Measurements that result in values of k from 1 through 5 are ambiguous about the state of the input qubit, as desired, e.g., sums from 1 through 5 do not indicate which column of Table 2 generated the sum. According to various embodiments, the factors f() or f(n), or both, that control the probability of the sequence with index  and index n, respectively, are reduced to be less than {1\/(n+1)}so that the error rate is less than in Knill.","Knill takes a probabilistic approach to eliminating the errors, by rejecting an output qubit when the value of k is zero or n+1. The failure rate corresponds to a rate of rejecting the output, which is 1\/(n+1).","In order to avoid measuring the value of the input qubit while determining values of k in range from 1 through n, the states of the photons in the c\u2032 register are transformed in sensors module  before the measurement, such that the photons measured in the first basis state can not be associated with a particular spatial mode. For a state |1] that corresponds to the presence of a photon in a spatial mode, the transformation of associations between states and spatial modes can be accomplished with Fourier transform, as shown by Knill. The use of the Fourier transform imposes a constraint that f(k)=f(k\u22121), as described in more detail below. This is consistent with the choice by Knill to make f(j\u2032) constant for all j\u2032.","According to embodiments illustrated here, the constraint imposed by the Fourier transform that f(k)=f(k\u22121) is approximately satisfied by using a large value for n and making f(i) a slowly changing function of i, so that a relationship described by Equation 3a holds:\n\n(1)=()\u2212\u2003\u2003(3a)\n\nwhere f(k) represents the value of f(i) and df\/dk represents the derivative of f(i) at i=k, and the derivative is small compared to the value of f(k).

In other embodiments, using an optimal choice for f(i) found numerically, a probability of error that is significantly smaller is predicted.","According to illustrated embodiments, no output is rejected based on the value measured for the ancilla, such as the value of k. Thus the illustrated embodiments are not probabilistic. If the error rate is sufficiently small, general error correction approaches can be implemented.","2.2 Teleportation of Two Qubits","As indicated by Gottesman, quantum logic operations on two qubits can be performed with a teleportation device that teleports a pair of input qubits in an arbitrary quantum state, including entangled states. Without loss of generality it is sufficient to describe the quantum operation in the context of two arbitrary but independent input qubits. As such, we assume that a two qubit teleportation device receives input qubits in the states {\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0]} and {\u03b1\u2032|1]+\u03b2\u2032|0]} in two input spatial modes and outputs two qubits in the same states {\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0]} and {\u03b1\u2032|1]+\u03b2\u2032|0]} in two different spatial modes, without measuring the input qubits (and therefore without determining the output qubits).","Using unequal probabilities of sequences for the initial ancilla, a teleportation device for two qubits can be implemented using the input modes , \u2032 and x register , x\u2032 register \u2032, y register , and y\u2032 register \u2032, as described here. Preprocessors , \u2032 and post processor , \u2032 are again omitted.","In this approach, the sensor  and the entangled state for ancilla photons in the x\u2032register \u2032 and the y\u2032 register \u2032 are the same as described above. Furthermore, a sensor  that performs functions similar to sensor  is included. Sensor  operates on a c register made up of the input qubit spatial mode  and the x register ","In addition, the set of sequences j for ancilla photons in the x register  and the y register  are the same as the set of sequences j\u2032 for the corresponding primed registers \u2032, \u2032, respectively, with the same unequal weights given by f(j), where f(j)=f(j\u2032) when j=j\u2032. However, in this embodiment the primed (x\u2032,y\u2032) and unprimed (x,y) register pairs are independent. Consequently, the state of the 4n ancilla photons in the four registers , \u2032, , \u2032, represented by the symbol |\u03c8] is given by Equation 4.\n\n|\u03c8]=\u03a3()|1]|0]|0]|1]\u03a3()|1]0]|0]|1]\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nThis corresponds to the tensor product of two sets of ancilla in the initial state of Equation 2a.\n","In some embodiments separate Fourier transforms are performed on the registers c and c\u2032, and the sums of photons measured in state |1] in the two c registers are given by k and k\u2032, respectively.","Some quantum operations can be implemented to output a transformed qubit on output qubit spatial mode \u2032 by performing logical operations on the photons in the y\u2032 register \u2032 based on the states of photons in the y register , for example with processor . The output qubit is selected for spatial mode \u2032 by coupler  from within the y\u2032 register \u2032 based on measurements on the c\u2032 register by sensor . In the notation of quantum operations, the control qubit, q, is the qubit incident on spatial mode  and the target qubit, q\u2032, is the qubit incident on spatial mode \u2032.

In some embodiments, the predicted value of Pis 4\/nfor large n (i.e., for n>>1). In other embodiments, using an optimal choice for f(i) found numerically, a probability of error significantly smaller is predicted.","2.4 Controlled NOT","The function of a controlled not (CNOT) device is to flip values of the two components corresponding to the two basis states of a target qubit (e.g., a pure 0 state is flipped to a pure 1 state, and a pure 1 state is flipped to a pure 0 state) if a second, control qubit would be measured in the 1 state, and to do nothing if the control qubit would be measured in the 0 state, without measuring either the target qubit or the control qubit. In general, if the control qubit would be measured in the 1 state, a CNOT device converts a target qubit in the state {\u03b1\u2032|1]+\u03b2\u2032|0]} to an output qubit in the state {\u03b2\u2032|1]+\u03b1\u2032|0]}. Typically, the basis state that would be measured for the control qubit is unchanged in the process.","According to embodiments of the invention, a CNOT is implemented by applying single qubit transformations to qubits in preprocessors  or \u2032, or both, before the CZ gate, and in postprocessors  or \u2032 or both after the CZ gate.","In a particular embodiment of a high fidelity CNOT, preprocessor  and post-processor  are omitted.

As is well known, a Hadamard transformation can be implemented with linear optics devices, such as a beam splitter.","3. Effects of Unequal Weights for Sequences","The following theoretical descriptions are presented in order to better understand the operation of device  with unequal values for the weighting factor f(i). However, embodiments of the invention are not limited by the theory or theories presented here, or by estimates of error based on these descriptions.","In the case of teleportation of a single qubit, the input qubit q\u2032 is the state |q\u2032]=\u03b1\u2032|1]+\u03b2\u2032|0], which for simplicity will be treated in the following as unprimed quantities, i.e., |q]=\u03b1|1]+\u03b2|0].","The Fourier transform F operating on spatial mode l of register c corresponds to the operator transformation\n\n\u2192\u03a3exp(2\u03c0\/(1)) \u2003\u2003(6a)\n\nwhere a bold character symbolizes a transformation, and spatial modes in the x register correspond to l=1,n and the qubit input spatial mode  corresponds to l=0; and i is the square root of negative 1. The exp( ) function represents raising the natural logarithm base, e, to the power represented by the argument between the parentheses of the exp( ) function.

Similarly, |c1] represents the state of the c register after the Fourier transform if the input qubit would be measured in state |1] and therefore k\u22121 photons were initially in the x register in the |1] state. The weighting factor f(i) is 0 for i outside the interval 0 to n, i.e., unless 0\u2266i\u2266n. Thus if k=0, then |c1] in Equation 7d drops out; and if k=n+1, then |c0] in Equation 7b drops out.\n","As noted in Knill, applying a phase shift of exp(2\u03c0ilr\/(n+1)) to each mode l in register c after applying F is equivalent to shifting modes l=0,n right by one location before applying F. Consequently, the relevant terms in |c0] and |c1] differ only by a phase factor that can be compensated by applying a linear optics correction based on the measured value k to the output. Any method to apply this phase factor may be employed. In one embodiment, a Pockels cell is used.

The state of photons in the remaining modes of the y register, represented by the symbol |y], following mode n+k, are in the same state for both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 terms. The final output state from the teleportation, represented by the symbol |\u03c8] is given by Equation 8b.\n\n|\u03c8(\u03b2()|0]+\u03b1(1)|1])|\u2003\u2003(8b)\n\nThe states |M] and |y] are common to both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 output terms; and do not have an effect on the subsequent computations.\n","It can be seen from Equation 8b that the teleported state corresponds to the correctly teleported state if f(k)=f(k\u22121) as stated above in section 2.1.

Substituting from Equation 3b eliminates f(k) and yields Equation 10b \n\n\nExpanding to second order in \u03b5, which is a good approximation when \u03b5 is small, and using P0 for the probability that the input qubit is in state |0] (i.e., P0=|\u03b2|), and P1 for the probability that the input qubit is in state |1] (i.e., P1=|\u03b1|), yields Equation 10c.\n\n=1\u22120 1 \u03b5\u2003\u2003(10c)\n\nTherefore the probability of an error, P, based on Equation 9b, is given in Equation 10d.\n\n  \u03b5\u2003\u2003(10d)\n","The average value of Pcan be estimated as follows.

An optimal choice for f(i) gives an error that is significantly less.\n","These error analyses show that errors are expected that scale as 1\/nusing unequal weighting factors f(i). Thus, these errors decrease faster than the errors in prior techniques and offer high fidelity quantum operations compared to those techniques. These high fidelity techniques offer a better opportunity to be used with general error correction techniques that depend on base error rates lower than a threshold rate P. For example, if 200 ancilla (n=100) reduces the error Pbelow Pusing embodiments of the present invention for single bit teleportation, then the approach of Knill would need to employ about 20,000 ancilla (n=10,000) and hazard the additional costs and errors associated with producing and using so many ancilla. Thus, a potential advantage of high fidelity quantum computations is the use of all outputs and correction of occasional errors with general error correction algorithms.","4. Method for Performing High Fidelity Quantum Operations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"200"},"In step  a superposition state for the ancilla photons is determined to reduce the error rate below some target error rate. This determination depends on the quantum operation to be performed and the target probability of error P. For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that a high fidelity CNOT is to be performed with an error correction algorithm that has a threshold of P\u224810, and that Pfor the CNOT device, represented by the symbol CNOT, is as described above for the quantum sign flip device, e.g., CNOT<4\/n. To satisfy the relationship for CNOT<P, the value of n should be 200 or greater. (It is noted that, to achieve the same threshold for applying the general error correction algorithm with the approach of Knill, which scales as 1\/n, would require a value of n of 10,000.) In the illustrated example, therefore, it is determined to use the ancilla state in Equation 5, above, with n=200.","In some embodiments, step  includes determining unequal weights, f(i), for each sequence, i, in the set, corresponding to unequal probabilities, f(i), for being measured in each sequence, i, in the set. For example, the weights, f(i), of Equation 13 are applied with n=200 and f=0.12156.","In step , ancilla photons are generated in an entangled superposition state based on the weights f(i) which are related to the probabilities f(i). For example, ancilla photons in 800 spatial modes are generated in the state described in Equation 5 for the entangled registers x, x\u2032, y, y\u2032 used in the quantum sign flip device within the CNOT device. In embodiments using a first basis state |1] to indicate the presence of a photon and the state |0] to indicate an absence, then there are only 400 photons present (i.e., in state |1]) among the 800 modes for ancilla photons. In the illustrated embodiments, the ancilla are generated in the 800 spatial modes using the source  of ancilla photons, and placed in the individual spatial modes  of the registers , \u2032, , \u2032. Details concerning the source  of ancilla photons for several embodiments are described in the next section.","In step , one or more input qubits are received. For example, in a single bit teleportation device one qubit is received on input qubit spatial mode \u2032. In the CNOT device, a target qubit q\u2032 is received on input qubit spatial mode \u2032 and a control qubit q is received on input qubit spatial mode .","In step , a single qubit operation is performed on one or both input qubits. For example, in the CNOT device, a Hadamard transformation is performed on the target qubit q\u2032 using a beam splitter in preprocessor \u2032. In some embodiments, step  is skipped. For example, in teleportation of one or two qubits, step  is skipped.","In step , a measurement operation is performed on the input qubits and the photons in the corresponding x registers to determine a location in the corresponding y registers. The state of the input qubit, such as target q\u2032 and control q for the CNOT device, are not determined in most embodiments. For example, in sensor  of the CNOT device, a Fourier transform, phase shift and measurement of k\u2032 is performed on the photons in the c\u2032 register made up of the target qubit after the transformation in step  and the x\u2032 register \u2032. In sensor  of the CNOT device, step  includes performing a second Fourier transform, phase shift and measurement of k on the photons in the c register made up of the control qubit on input spatial mode  and the x register . The values of k and k\u2032 indicate locations in the corresponding y registers, as explained above.","In some embodiments, logical operations are performed on the y registers corresponding to the input qubits. For example, in the CNOT device, the sign of the photons in the y\u2032 register \u2032 are changed based on the values of k and k\u2032 measured in sensors , , as described above in Equations and . In some embodiments, this change is made using one or more Pockels cells in processor . In some embodiments, this change is made in output optical coupler .","In step , a photon in a y register corresponding to the input qubit is selected for output based on the location determined in step .

In device , step  is performed by output optical coupler  based on values for k and k\u2032 passed from sensors component  over data line .","In step  a single qubit operation is performed on one or both output qubits. For example, in the CNOT device, a Hadamard transformation is performed on the output target qubit q\u2032using a beam splitter in postprocessor \u2032. The qubits output on output qubit spatial modes ,\u2032 are in a state that represents the result of the quantum CNOT operation. In some embodiments, step  is skipped. For example, in teleportation of one or two qubits or in a controlled sign operation, step  is skipped.","In step , the qubit output on spatial mode \u2032 is not blocked based on measurements of the ancilla photons, such as measurements k or k\u2032, as performed in the Knill approach. Instead, the output on spatial mode \u2032 is always used. General error correction algorithms handle errors in the output on spatial mode \u2032. For example, an error in the output on spatial mode \u2032 from the CNOT device occurs at a rate less than 10because n=200 (400 photons in state |1] among 800 ancilla photons spatial modes among registers , \u2032, , \u2032) so the general error correction algorithm with P=10can be employed. To achieve the same low error rate with the Knill approach would require n=10,000 (20,000 photons in state |1] among 40,000 ancilla spatial modes). In some embodiments, step  is skipped.","5.

The PDC source  produces the pair of photons at an uncertain time during the recharge time. When a pair is emitted, one photon of the pair is detected by a detector in a controller such as an electronic controller (e.g., controller  in source ). When the first photon is detected, the controller sets a switch, such as by setting an electric state of an electro-optic switch (e.g., EO switch ), in an optical loop (e.g., optical loop ) to capture the second photon to propagate repeatedly in the optical loop  until demanded. When a demand is received by the controller, the controller resets the switch, such as by setting another electrical state, to release the photon to the output of source . In this way a single photon is known to be in the optical loop  by the controller . The controller can signal a central processor (not shown) in the source  of ancilla photons, so the central processor can determine when all the sources  have stored photons that can be output to the y registers.

The functioning of the illustrated controlled phase shifter can be explained as follows. The following theoretical descriptions are presented in order to better understand the operation of the controlled phase shifter. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited by the theory or theories presented here.","In the illustrated embodiment, the \u03c0 radians phase shifter is a birefringement medium that applies a phase shift of \u03c0 radians to a photon in state |1] but does not affect a photon in state |0]. This is easy to understand because a photon in state |0] does not propagate through the birefringement medium. In the illustrated embodiment, the CNOTs , are probabilistic linear optics devices as described in Pittman I; in other embodiments other CNOTs are used for either or both CNOTs , . The CNOTs of Pittman I succeed with a probability of \u00bc and use polarization states of single photons. As described above, it is well known in the art how to convert qubits based on states |1], |0] representing the presence or absence of a photon in a spatial mode back and forth to qubits based on states |H], |V] representing the directions of polarization. Therefore it is clear to one skilled in the art how to use the CNOT of Pittman I with the qubits in states |1] and |0].","For purposes of illustration, the operation of the controlled phase shift is described for the conditional transfer of the state |1] photon in the 2spatial mode of the y register to the 2spatial mode of the x register. For this process, the control qubit spatial mode is optically connected to the 1spatial mode in the x register, representing the (i-1) spatial mode.","If the 1spatial mode in the x register holds a photon in state |1] then the control qubit on spatial mode causes the CNOT to flip the |0] and |1] states of a photon entering the CNOT on spatial mode . This causes a photon in state |1] to be flipped to state |0]. The photon in state |0] is not affected by the birefringement material in \u03c0 phase shifter , so its phase is not shifted. The control qubit on spatial mode is passed to spatial mode . The control qubit on mode causes the CNOT to flip the |0] and |1] states of a photon entering the CNOT on spatial mode . Thus the photon in state |0] is flipped back to state |1]. This photon continues to beam splitter without having its phase shifted. Thus, Equation 16h above, applies and beam splitter reflects or transmits a photon in state |1] to spatial mode in state |1] according to the desired probabilities. If output onto spatial mode in state |1], then a photon in state |1] is transferred to the 2spatial mode of the x register, as desired.","If the 1spatial mode in the x register holds a photon in state |0] then the control qubit on spatial mode causes the CNOT to not flip the |0] and |1] states of a photon entering the CNOT on spatial mode . This causes a photon in state","to remain in state |1]. The photon in state |1] is phase shifted \u03c0 radians by the birefringement material in \u03c0 phase shifter . The control qubit on spatial mode is passed to spatial mode . The control qubit on mode causes the CNOT to not flip the |0] and |1] states of a photon entering the CNOT on spatial mode . Thus the phase shifted photon in state |1] is output by CNOT . Thus, Equation 16g above, applies and beam splitter transmits an incident photon in state |1] to spatial mode in state |1]. In this case, the photon is never transferred to spatial mode or the 2spatial mode of the x register.

That is, Equation 5 involves multiplying the quantum state of the primed registers by the factor (\u22121).

Similarly, quantum dot is accompanied by B-gate and U-gate ; and quantum dot is accompanied by B-gate and U-gate . Although shown next to the quantum dots in , in other embodiments the U-gates may be disposed above or below the quantum dots. Furthermore, in other embodiments, more or fewer quantum dots populate quantum dot array , e.g., for different values of n.","The source  includes optical spatial modes  connecting a first contiguous portion of the array  of quantum dots to the x register, and optical spatial modes  connecting a second contiguous portion of the array  to the y register. Spatial modes  includes single photon spatial modes , , , , ; and spatial modes  includes single photon modes , , , , . A similar arrangement of modes , connects to the primed registers \u2032, \u2032. In some embodiments, the modes ,  connected to the primed registers originate in one or more additional arrays of quantum dots (not shown) similar to the arrangement of the arrays  or  or both.","The quantum dot array  is configured to generate an entangled state of 2n qubits represented by n excited electrons among the 2n dots, where the presence of an excited electron at a quantum dot represents state |1] and the absence represents state |0]. The U-gates are operated to create a discreet excited state that allows the emission of a single photon of an appropriate wavelength into a single mode optical fiber when the excited electron decays to a lower state. Thus the sequence of 2n entangled states can be transferred to photons in corresponding states |1] and |0] if the optical coupling is sufficiently efficient. In order to avoid the emission of a photon during a time when the electron states are being prepared, in the illustrated embodiment, the array  is not directly coupled to the optical fibers. Instead, after the sequence of entangled states is generated in array , the U-gates and B-gates are operated, in a manner well known in the art, to simultaneously transfer the excited electrons in the array  to the corresponding dots in array .

The quantum dots that correspond to the primed or unprimed y registers are in positions D(n+1) through Dand are called collectively the YD register.","The array of quantum dots work to produce a contiguous line of excited electrons, as is described below, which produces a contiguous portion of the array  in electron state |1] between two portions of arbitrary lengths in electron state |0]. As described above, the desired fundamental sequences defined in Equation 1 have the opposite, i.e., a contiguous portion of n states in the combined x and y registers in photon state |0] between two portions of arbitrary lengths in photon state |1]. The transformation can be done in any manner known in the art. For example, CNOT gates can be used to flip the photon states produced. In the illustrated embodiments, the spatial modes ,  are arranged to flip the order of photons directed to the x register  from the xregister, and to flip the order of photons directed to the y register  from the yregister, as described for an example below. The spatial modes ,  are similarly arranged to flip the order of photons directed to each of the x\u2032 register \u2032 and the y\u2032 register \u2032.","First, all the quantum dots in array  are placed in electron state |0].

If the transfer does not occur, the sequence of states is final, i.e., the sequence j=0 is selected. If the transfer occurrs, then the dots in array  are in states as listed in the row of Table 3 labeled step 2.

If the first transfer occurred, this succession of oscillations moves the other excited electrons to lower positions in the array (left in Table 3) to close the gap between excited electrons. This has the effect of moving the missing electron, electron state |0], to the end (right in Table 3) of the quantum dots in state |1]. If the original transfer did not occur, then the succession of oscillations has no effect in transferring the subsequent excited electrons and the sequence corresponding to step 1 in Table 3 remains unaltered. After this succession of oscillations, the dots in array  are in a superposition of states as listed in the rows of Table 3 labeled step 1 and step 3. When a complete Rabi oscillation is performed between two quantum dots that both have excited electrons, a transfer is prohibited by energy conservation, a condition called the \u201celectron turnstile effect.\u201d Thus the physics of quantum dots precludes a need for performing a separate logical step to determine whether the first transfer occurred, as is done in the optical source  described above.","The process is then repeated with a probability Pof transferring an excited electron to D, a probability of Pof transferring an excited electron to D, and so forth with probability Pgiven by Equation 15b, until all the terms in the superposition state given by Equation 2a have been generated.
