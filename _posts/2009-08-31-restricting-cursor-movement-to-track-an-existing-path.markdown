title: Restricting cursor movement to track an existing path
abstract: Systems and methods are presented for applying visual effects while in a mode that restricts cursor movement to track an existing path. While in cursor path restriction mode, spatial inputs may be received from a pointing device configured to control a cursor on a display, with the spatial inputs signaling positions on the display. The cursor moves on a restricted path that tracks an existing path in response to the spatial signals, with the cursor confined to the restricted path even when spatial signals may indicate a point not on the restricted path. During the cursor movement, in addition to the movement of the cursor, there may be an alteration of what appears on the display, where the alteration depends on movement of the cursor along at least a portion of the restricted path.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Artists, illustrators, cartoonists, photographers, and other creative individuals often use computers rather than traditional media, employing graphic art software to access, create, and edit graphic files. Their work frequently includes operations involving paths or path-like elements displayed on a viewing area. Typical operations may require application of visual effects such as brush strokes and patterns. In addition to creating and applying new visual effects to paths, an artist may need to derive some visual elements from existing ones, or to retouch, blend, mix, augment, replace, patch, remove, or replicate various effects.","An artist or illustrator may want to apply strokes or patterns or other visual effects to an existing path appearing on the viewing area of a display, or relative to a path which tracks such an existing path. Application of certain effects may require guiding a cursor using a pointing device so that the cursor accurately tracks an existing path. Manipulation of a pointing device to make a cursor track an existing path precisely can require concentration coupled with fine motor control. Maintaining such fine control of a pointing device can divert the artist's energies from essential creative aspects of a task. Accuracy can deteriorate over time as the operator of a pointing device tires. Even the most able practitioner may produce errors which require subsequent correction, resulting in lost time and perhaps frustration.","Application of visual effects may depend on tracking all or part of an existing path, or on precisely excising or selecting a portion of an existing path. Application of some visual effects can necessitate disassembling an existing path into various components, operating on each of the components, and then reassembling them in order to achieve a result based upon characteristics of the existing path, including visual features already present on the existing path. Such serial decomposition and assembly by repeated selection, cutting, and pasting, sometimes involving several different modes of operation, can be unnecessarily frustrating, tedious, distracting, fatiguing, time-consuming, laborious, or inefficient.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for operating in a cursor path restriction mode that restricts movement of a cursor are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method may include a computer receiving input to enter a cursor path restriction mode. While in the cursor path restriction mode, spatial inputs from a pointing device configured to control a cursor on a display may be received, where the spatial inputs signal positions on the display. While in cursor path restriction mode, the cursor may be moved in response to the received spatial inputs so that the cursor moves on a restricted path that tracks an existing path displayed on the display, such that whenever the spatial inputs signal a position not on the restricted path, movement of the cursor remains confined to the restricted path. During the moving of the cursor in cursor path restriction mode, in addition to showing movement of the cursor, there may be an altering of what is displayed on the display, where the altering depends on movement of the cursor along at least a portion of the restricted path.","In one embodiment, a memory is coupled to a processor, and the memory stores program instructions executable by the processor to implement a cursor path restriction module configured to receive input to enter a cursor path restriction mode. While in cursor path restriction mode, the cursor path restriction module may receive spatial inputs from a pointing device configured to control a cursor on a display, where the spatial inputs signal positions on the display. While in cursor path restriction mode, the cursor path restriction module may move the cursor in response to the received spatial inputs so that the cursor moves on a restricted path that tracks an existing path displayed on the display, such that whenever the spatial inputs signal a position not on the restricted path, movement of the cursor remains confined to the restricted path. During the moving of the cursor in cursor path restriction mode, the cursor path restriction module may, in addition to showing movement of the cursor, alter what is displayed on the display, where the altering is dependent upon movement of the cursor along at least a portion of the restricted path.","Further embodiments of systems and methods for operating in a cursor path restriction mode that restricts movement of a cursor are disclosed. In one embodiment, the system may include a computer-readable storage medium storing program instructions that are computer-executable to perform receiving input to enter a cursor path restriction mode. The program instructions are further executable to perform, while in cursor path restriction mode, receiving spatial inputs from a pointing device configured to control a cursor on a display, where the spatial inputs signal positions on the display. The program instructions are further executable to perform, while in cursor path restriction mode, moving the cursor in response to the received spatial inputs so that the cursor moves on a restricted path that tracks an existing path displayed on the display, such that whenever the spatial inputs signal a position not on the restricted path, movement of the cursor remains confined to the restricted path. The program instructions are further executable to perform, during the moving of the cursor in cursor path restriction mode, and in addition to showing movement of the cursor, altering what is displayed on the display, wherein said altering is dependent upon movement of the cursor along at least a portion of the restricted path.","While the present disclosure is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described.

In particular, there is a detailed description of operations for a mode in which a cursor is forced to track an existing path, and of producing visual effects in a continuous mode dependent upon signals received during the cursor's traversal of the existing path. There is a discussion of various techniques facilitating easy and convenient application of multiple different visual effects while operating continuously in a mode that forces the cursor to track existing paths. Finally, an exemplary computer system embodiment that may be employed to implement aspects of the cursor path restriction mode is described.","Applying a Mode that Restricts Cursor Movement to Track an Existing Path",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1D","b":["10","10","100","100","110","120","130","140","120","130","130","140","140","130","110","130"]},"Generally speaking, computer system  may correspond to any suitable type of computer system configured to execute applications. For example, computer system  may correspond to a desktop computer system, a laptop, netbook or notebook computer, a handheld computing device such as a personal digital assistant, cellular phone, media player, or combination device, or any other suitable type of device. In various embodiments, computer system  may include a microprocessing system, storage capacity, input and output systems, and\/or networking capability. Storage capacity may be implemented remotely or locally, and may include internal storage or removable media devices. Internal storage may be implemented, for example, using memory, such as random access memory (RAM), mass storage devices such as hard disks, solid-state drives, disk array controllers, or other suitable means. Removable storage media devices may include, for example, compact disc systems, DVD systems, Blu-ray systems, floppy disk drives, Zip drives, USB flash drives, tape drives, or other types of devices. Input systems may include a keyboard, mouse, trackball, joystick, or similar device, and may also include an image scanner or web cam for image or video input. According to various embodiments, a component of an input system may serve as a pointing device. Such a pointing component may be embodied as a mouse, as illustrated in , or as a trackball, touchpad, graphics table stylus, touch screen, joystick, pointing stick, light pen, directional pad, keyboard, eye tracking device, gesture signaling device, or similar input device. Output systems may variously include a video subsystem including a video monitor or other display device, an audio subsystem, or other types of output devices. In some embodiments, computer system  may be configured to execute one or more operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows\u2122, Apple MacOS\u2122, Linux\u2122, or any other suitable operating systems.","In various embodiments, the stream of spatial inputs being received from the pointing device is only one of the factors used in determining how cursor  moves along restricted path . The location of restricted path  on viewing area  and the shape of restricted path  may also be used in determining how cursor  proceeds along restricted path . According to numerous embodiments, various other factors may contribute to a determining how cursor  proceeds along restricted path . For example, cursor acceleration parameters may play a part in establishing the manner in which cursor  traverses restricted path . As another example, operations which occur while cursor  is moving on restricted path  may affect calculations governing movement of cursor  along restricted path . For instance, a user may depress a mouse button to apply a painting stroke while moving cursor  along restricted path . In some such instances, during the time the mouse button remains depressed, the system may constrain cursor  to move at a relatively constant speed, but after the button is released, cursor  may be free to vary its speed as it travels restricted path . Regardless of which collection of factors is involved in controlling the passage of cursor  along restricted path  according to the various embodiments, cursor  does not deviate from restricted path  as long as cursor  is subject to the constraints imposed by operating in cursor path restriction mode.","In each of the embodiments illustrated in , restricted path  tracks existing path . For example, in , restricted path  is shown as a downward translation of existing path . In , restricted path  coincides exactly with existing path .  illustrates an embodiment in which restricted path  represents a rotation and translation of existing path .  shows an instance in which restricted path  is a rotated, translated, and scaled version of existing path . In each of these embodiments, and in various other embodiments, restricted path  tracks existing path .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1D","b":["120","130","120","130","120","120","120","120","120","130","120"]},"Existing path  is shown as a single, continuous curve in . In other embodiments, existing path  may consist of discrete pieces which are not connected to each other, so that the corresponding restricted path  is also a collection of discrete pieces which are not connected to each other. In such embodiments, cursor  may jump from one piece of restricted path  to another piece of restricted path  as it moves along restricted path . In other words, while operating in cursor path restriction mode, cursor  may move along a particular piece of a restricted path  that contains several discrete pieces which are not connected to each other, and cursor  may subsequently move along another particular piece of the same restricted path . When operating in cursor path restriction mode while traversing such a restricted path  containing several discrete pieces which are not connected to each other, cursor  remains confined to the several discrete pieces of restricted path .","In other embodiments, existing path  may consist of discrete pieces which are not connected to each other, and restricted path  may be formed by joining together the discrete pieces of existing path  to form a new continuous path.","In the embodiments illustrated in , a stream of spatial inputs arrives from a pointing device configured to control cursor  as it moves along restricted path . The stream of spatial input signals indicate positions on viewing area  of display . While operating in cursor path restriction mode, the stream of spatial inputs received from the pointing device is used to determine how cursor  moves along restricted path . Such determinations of movement of cursor  vary according to numerous embodiments. By controlling the spatial inputs emitted by the pointing device, cursor  may be moved to various positions on restricted path . For example, in some embodiments, spatial inputs indicating higher locations on viewing area  of display  may cause cursor  to move higher on restricted path , while spatial inputs indicating lower locations on viewing area  of display  may cause cursor  to move lower on restricted path . Similarly, spatial inputs indicating rightward travel on viewing area  of display  may cause cursor  to move rightward on restricted path , while spatial inputs indicating leftward travel on viewing area  of display  may cause cursor  to move leftward on restricted path . As another example, spatial inputs indicating acceleration through locations on viewing area  of display  may force cursor  to accelerate its movement along restricted path , while spatial inputs indicating deceleration through locations on viewing area  of display  may force cursor  to decelerate its movement along restricted path .","While cursor  moves on restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode, in addition to the display on viewing area  of the visible movement of cursor , there may be other visible alteration of the content of viewing area , where the visible alteration depends upon the movement of cursor  along at least a portion of the restricted path. For example, while cursor  proceeds along some portion of restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode, additional signals may arrive from the pointing device, or from another source of input, to initiate a change to the visible content appearing on viewing area , where the change to the visible content derives from the movement of cursor  along the portion of restricted path . For instance, when the pointing device is embodied as a mouse, a user may move the mouse to make cursor  travel along restricted path  while in cursor path restriction mode, and the user may, while moving the mouse, simultaneously depress a mouse button in order to paint a portion of restricted path . Actions that change the visible content appearing on viewing area  while cursor  moves in cursor path restriction mode are described on detail in the following paragraphs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1A-1D","FIGS. 1A-1D"],"b":["20","205","200","205","210","210","20","205","215","210","215","210","140","110","100","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["25","20","25","20","25","25","20","200","210","25","200","210","20"]},"Cursor path restriction module  may be configured to intercept or transmit input to enter or to exit cursor path restriction mode. For embodiments in which a software application fully incorporates cursor path restriction module , interception of a signal to enter or to exit cursor path restriction mode may correspondingly commence or terminate operation of the software application in cursor path restriction mode. For example, a computer graphics application or graphic art software may include cursor path restriction module , and may be configured to begin or end operation in a cursor path restriction mode upon intercepting a signal to enter or to exit cursor path restriction mode.","A variety of methods for signaling the entering or exiting of cursor path restriction mode may be implemented by cursor path restriction module , according to the embodiments. In some embodiments, a keystroke or combination of keystrokes may be used to signal entrance to or exit from a cursor path restriction mode. Such a keystroke or combination of keystrokes may trigger cursor path restriction functionality in a software application, operating system, device driver, or other software component of computer system , or it may toggle cursor path restriction functionality in a hardware portion of a device such as pointing device , display , or computer system . According to other embodiments, entering or exiting cursor path restriction mode may be accomplished by touching a touch screen or tablet with a finger, brush, stylus, or other object. In other embodiments, the means of signaling may be less direct. For example, a user may employ another device or system, such as a laser pointer, a remotely-controlled pointing device, or a separate computer system. In various embodiments, cursor path restriction module  may implement a system for detection of touch, gestures, light patterns, electronic pulses, or other means of signaling.","According to some embodiments, signals from pointing device  may be interpreted as indications to enter or exit cursor path restriction mode. For example, while operating in a normal cursor mode (i.e., a standard mode in which movement of the cursor is defined by spatial inputs received from a pointing device), spatial inputs  received from pointing device  may themselves indicate that cursor path restriction module  should commence operations in cursor path restriction mode. In response, cursor path restriction module  may impose constraints upon the movement of a cursor on the viewing area of display . As illustrated in , while operating in cursor path restriction mode, cursor  adheres to a restricted path  even when spatial inputs received from the pointing device  indicate a position on viewing area  that is not on restricted path . In one embodiment, while operating in a normal cursor mode, a user may cause pointing device  to signal entrance into cursor path restriction mode by placing cursor  within a distance envelope of an existing path , or by placing cursor  on an existing path  and clicking a button on pointing device . According to other embodiments, other pointing device gestures, or pointing device clicks, or combinations of the two may be used to signal entrance into cursor path restriction mode. In some embodiments, a graphical user interface element may be provided to enter cursor path restriction mode.","As another particular example, spatial inputs  issuing from pointing device  while operating in cursor path restriction mode may signal a desire to exit cursor path restriction mode and return to a normal cursor mode (a standard mode in which movement of the cursor is defined by spatial inputs received from a pointing device). Spatial inputs  may signal such a desire by indicating an intention to move cursor  away from restricted path  at a slope larger than a threshold amount. For instance, a threshold angle may be set at, e.g., 60 degrees, so that whenever spatial inputs  emanating from pointing device  indicate a desire to make cursor  move at more than 60 degrees deviation from the direction of a line tangent to restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  may relinquish control over cursor  and return cursor  to a normal cursor mode. In other similar instances, a threshold angle might be set at 80 degrees, or at some other angle.","In general, any of a wide variety of signals input to computer system  may serve to indicate a desire to leave normal cursor mode and enter cursor path restriction mode, or vice versa. According to some embodiments, the operating system itself may commence or terminate operation in cursor path restriction mode based upon interception of a signal to enter or to exit cursor path restriction mode, whereas in other embodiments, a software application or a device driver may commence or terminate operation in cursor path restriction mode based upon interception of a signal to enter or to exit cursor path restriction mode. In some embodiments, a hardware component of a device such as pointing device , display , or computer system  may commence or terminate operation in cursor path restriction mode based upon detecting a signal to enter or to exit cursor path restriction mode.","After entering cursor path restriction mode, cursor path restriction module  may check to see if an existing path  has been selected to serve as a currently selected existing path . If no existing path  has been selected, then cursor path restriction module  may indicate the need to select an existing path  displayed on display . In some embodiments, selection of an existing path  may be left to a user, and cursor path restriction module  may issue a signal to the user that the user should select an existing path . In such embodiments, the user may select from one or more existing paths . User selection of an existing path  may be accomplished by any standard method for selecting an object. For example, the user may select an existing path  by drawing a box around a portion of existing path , or by placing cursor  within a threshold distance of an existing path , or by touching an existing path , or by any other means for selecting an object.","In other embodiments, selection of an existing path  may be made automatically by cursor path restriction module  according to preset criteria, or according to the current state of a collection of system variables. For example, cursor path restriction module  may refer to a data store indicating the most recently selected existing path , and may automatically reselect the most recently selected existing path  as the currently selected existing path . As another example, cursor path restriction module  may refer to a data store indicating a current priority listing of existing paths , and may select the one having the highest priority, or the one having the lowest priority. As yet another example, cursor path restriction module  may ascertain the state of various objects currently shown on display , and may calculate geometric relationships among the various objects as a basis for selecting an existing path . For instance, existing paths  displayed on display  may have different colors, and cursor path restriction module  may locate a, e.g., red existing path  that is nearest to cursor  as the currently selected existing path . In other embodiments, cursor path restriction module  may select the nearest path as the current existing path. In other embodiments, cursor path restriction module  may allow the cursor to operate in normal cursor mode until the cursor is moved within a certain proximity of an existing path, at which time the cursor path restriction module  will apply the cursor path restriction mode and select the existing path. According to various embodiments, selection of an existing path  may be made by any of a wide variety of known selection methods.","Once an existing path  has been selected, then a restricted path  may be variously determined, according to the various embodiments, to track a selected existing path .  illustrate some embodiments of a restricted path  that tracks a selected existing path .","As illustrated in the type of embodiment shown in , a restricted path  that tracks a selected existing path  may be defined as a simple translation of existing path  to a different location on viewing area . Such a translation of a selected existing path  may be manually controlled by an operator using an appliance such as a mouse or a keyboard to define a location to which selected existing path  may be translated. According to other embodiments, a translation of a selected existing path  may be made automatically by cursor path restriction module  based upon preset or current translation parameters. In some embodiments, cursor path restriction module  may decide to automatically define restricted path  as a translation of a selected existing path  based upon the current state of a collection of system variables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["130","120","25","130","120","130","25","130","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["130","120","110","120","130","25","120","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1D","b":["130","120","110","120","130","25","120","130"]},"A restricted path  may be variously defined to track a selected existing path , according to the embodiments. Once a restricted path  has been determined to track a selected existing path , cursor path restriction module  imposes constraints to limit the movement of cursor  to the current restricted path  while operating in cursor path restriction mode. While functioning in cursor path restriction mode, cursor path restriction module  may receive or generate an indication that a different existing path  has been selected as the new currently selected existing path . In response to such an indication, cursor path restriction module  may define a new current restricted path  to track the newly selected current existing path . While operations proceed in cursor path restriction mode, several different existing paths  may be selected over the course of time, so that at one particular time, one existing path  may be currently selected, while at another particular time, a different existing path  may be currently selected. Given a particular existing path  that is currently selected, a corresponding current restricted path  tracks the particular currently selected existing path . Movement of cursor  is confined to the currently selected existing path  while in cursor path restriction mode.","While functioning in cursor path restriction mode, computer system  may receive spatial inputs  issuing from pointing device . Cursor path restriction module  may use received spatial inputs , which signal positions on display , to determine how cursor  moves along current restricted path  on viewing area . The relationship between a received stream of spatial inputs  and responsive movement of cursor  on current restricted path  varies according to various embodiments of cursor path restriction module .","For example, cursor path restriction module  may be configured to move cursor  from a point A of current restricted path  to a point B of current restricted path  whenever received spatial inputs  indicate a current point P on viewing area  of display  such that current point P is closer to point B than to point A, according to a distance metric applied to viewing area . Cursor path restriction module  may, in other embodiments, be configured to optimize another measure taken between current restricted path  and a point or path on viewing area  that is currently indicated by received spatial inputs , where the other measure depends upon a metric applied to viewing area .","In some instances, a change in position, as indicated by received spatial inputs , may be ignored, so that cursor  remains in a fixed position, even though received spatial inputs  signal a change in location on viewing area . For example, if received spatial inputs  indicate movement along a line orthogonal to current restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  may maintain cursor  at its present location.","In some embodiments, if received spatial inputs  signal movement to a location on viewing area  that is outside an envelope surrounding current restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  will exit cursor path restriction mode, and enter normal cursor mode. In other embodiments, cursor path restriction module  will maintain cursor path restriction mode operation no matter what positions or movements on viewing area  are signaled by received spatial inputs .","Speed, acceleration, deceleration, and other dynamic characteristics of the movement of cursor  on restricted path  during operation in cursor path restriction mode may be calculated by cursor path restriction module  according to indications received from spatial inputs . In some embodiments, factors other than spatial inputs  may be incorporated in calculation of dynamic characteristics of cursor  as it moves along restricted path  in response to the received stream of spatial inputs . For example, an operator or a parameter may signal an intention that cursor  to be restrained from rapidly accelerating or decelerating during application of a painting stroke while cursor  moves along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode. In such an instance, cursor path restriction module  may calculate a moving average speed based upon the received stream of spatial inputs , and restrain cursor  from rapidly accelerating or decelerating from the moving average speed. In other instances, cursor path restriction module  may use predictive techniques to anticipate desired movement of cursor  along restricted path , and may cause cursor  to move in the anticipated manner in advance of processing spatial signals  that signal actual desired movement of cursor  along restricted path . If actual desired movement of cursor  deviates beyond a threshold amount from anticipated desired movement of cursor , then cursor path restriction module  may make corrections to the movement of cursor  along restricted path .","According to various embodiments, cursor path restriction module  may interact with pointing device  via device drivers or other system services that may be provided by an operating system such as Microsoft Windows\u2122, Apple MacOS\u2122, Linux\u2122, or any other suitable operating system. For example, when in the cursor path restriction mode, cursor path restriction module  may interact with a cursor control API (application programming interface) provided by an operating system to alter or override the cursor position so that the cursor stays on the restricted path.","A large variety of parameters may be generated, set, or received to configure the operation of cursor path restriction module , according to numerous embodiments. For example, there may be parameters governing exiting cursor path restriction mode. For instance, a threshold angle may be set to a value x, such that whenever spatial inputs  emanating from pointing device  indicate a desire to make cursor  move at more than x degrees deviation from the direction of a line tangent to restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  may relinquish control over cursor  and return control of cursor  to a normal cursor mode. Another such exit parameter may establish the width of an envelope straddling current restricted path , such that if received spatial inputs  signal movement to a location that is outside the envelope surrounding current restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  will exit cursor path restriction mode, and enter normal cursor mode.","Other configuration parameters for cursor path restriction module  may include ones defining a degree of rotation, an amount of translation, and scaling factor to be applied by cursor path restriction module  to currently selected existing path  in determining the current restricted path . Parameters governing such dynamic characteristics as speed, acceleration, and deceleration of movement of cursor  may also be set, according to some embodiments. Parameters imposing a metric for use in calculations made by cursor path restriction module  may also be set for certain embodiments. Parameters governing visible alteration of the content of viewing area  based upon movement of cursor  along restricted path  may also be arranged, according to various embodiments. The parameters described here are given as example parameters for example embodiments, and are not meant to limit the number or type of parameters related to operation of cursor path restriction module .","While operating in cursor path restriction mode, aside from displaying on viewing area  the visible movement of cursor , cursor path restriction module  may also be configured to visibly alter the content of viewing area  dependent upon movement of cursor  along at least a portion of restricted path . For example, cursor path restriction module  may be so configured that, if an operator holds down a button of pointing device  while simultaneously moving cursor  along a portion of restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  may respond by applying a colored stroke or pattern to the traversed portion of restricted path  while the button is held down by the operator. When the operator releases the button, cursor path restriction module  may cease application of the colored stroke or pattern to restricted path . According to a variety of embodiments, the manner in which cursor path restriction module  visibly alters content of the viewing area  dependent upon movement of cursor  along a portion of restricted path  may vary widely. A further discussion of various such alterations is discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","320","25","310","300","25","25","140","110","100","140","130","120","320","25","300","320","140","130","110","140","110","140","130"]},"Operations may continue in cursor path restriction mode until input to exit cursor path restriction mode is detected (A). Many kinds of signals may be used to indicate a desire to exit cursor path restriction mode, and the kinds of signals may vary according to numerous embodiments. In various embodiments, a user or a software entity or a hardware component may issue a signal to leave cursor path restriction mode and restore normal cursor operations. In some embodiments, a user may issue such a signal through a combination of touch, keystrokes, mouse gestures, or other suitable input. For example, a graphic art application may allow a user to actively exit cursor path restriction mode by pressing a particular key on the keyboard. In other instances, a user may exit cursor path restriction mode by attempting to move cursor  sharply away from restricted path . For instance, a user may, in some embodiments, move pointing device  to indicate an intention to move cursor  in a direction that deviates substantially from the direction of a line tangent to restricted path  at or near the point on restricted path  where cursor  is presently positioned. If the direction of a line tangent to restricted path  at or near the point on restricted path  where cursor  is presently positioned differs by more than a threshold amount from the direction signaled by the user, then cursor path restriction module  may relinquish control over cursor  and return cursor  to a normal cursor mode. Such a threshold amount may be set at 60 degrees, or 80 degrees, or at some other angle. In still other embodiments, a signal for exiting cursor path restriction mode may be generated without user intervention by an application running in an automated mode, and responding to state variables indicating geometric relationships among the various objects on viewing area . For example, for an automatic video demonstrating applications of cursor path restriction mode, random spatial inputs  may be generated while cursor  moves along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode. In the event that the random spatial inputs  indicate a direction on viewing area  that differs by more than a threshold amount from the direction of a line tangent to restricted path  at or near the point on restricted path  where cursor  is presently positioned, then cursor path restriction module  may relinquish control over cursor  and return cursor  to a normal cursor mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["25","300","140","140","130","310","25","120","120","320","120","25","210","25","120","120","120","120","120","140","120","120"]},"In other embodiments, selection of an existing path  may be made automatically by cursor path restriction module  according to preset criteria, or according to the current state of a collection of system variables. For example, cursor path restriction module  may refer to a data store indicating the most recently selected existing path , and may automatically reselect the most recently selected existing path  as the currently selected existing path . As another example, cursor path restriction module  may refer to a data store indicating a current priority listing of existing paths , and may select the one having the highest priority, or the one having the lowest priority. As yet another example, cursor path restriction module  may ascertain the state of various objects currently shown on display , and may calculate geometric relationships among the various objects as a basis for selecting an existing path . For instance, existing paths  displayed on display  may have different colors, and cursor path restriction module  may select the red existing path  that is nearest to cursor  to serve as the currently selected existing path . According to various embodiments, selection of an existing path  may be made by any of a wide variety of known methods.","Once an existing path  has been selected, then a restricted path  may be variously determined, according to the various embodiments, to track a selected existing path .  illustrate some embodiments of a restricted path  that tracks a selected existing path , and the previous paragraphs describe various embodiments for determining a restricted path  that tracks a selected existing path . When a restricted path  that tracks a selected existing path  has been determined, operations proceed in a cursor path restriction mode using a currently selected existing path (B). Should a different existing path  be selected (B), then operations in cursor path restriction mode are adjusted so that cursor  moves along a restricted path  that tracks the currently selected different existing path .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["20","205","200","300","205","110","100","205","200","25","140","130","140","205","200","140","130","205","140","110","100","25","140","130","205","140","110","100","25","140","130","205","140","110","100","25","140","130","205","140","110","25","140","130","205","110","100","25","140","130","205","110","100","25","140","130"]},"While operating in cursor path restriction mode, cursor  may move under constraints imposed by cursor path restriction module , adhering to a restricted path  even when spatial inputs  streaming from pointing device  indicate an intent to move cursor  to a position on viewing area  that is not on restricted path  (C). The restricted path  followed by cursor  may track a selected existing path  in various ways, according to numerous embodiments. For example,  illustrate example embodiments of a restricted path  tracking a selected existing path . Restricted path  may be determined, according to some of the embodiments, as a translation, rotation, or scaled version of selected existing path . In some embodiments, restricted path  is obtained by a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling of selected existing path . Restricted path  may be a continuous or a discontinuous path. According to embodiments, cursor path restriction module  derives restricted path  via a transformation of selected existing path , so that restricted path  is said to track selected existing path . A transformation applied by cursor path restriction module  to selected existing path  may, in some embodiments, be the identity transformation, such that restricted path  coincides exactly with selected existing path .","While functioning in cursor path restriction mode, cursor path restriction module  may use received spatial inputs  to determine how cursor  moves along current restricted path  on viewing area  (C). The relationship between a received stream of spatial inputs  and responsive movement of cursor  on current restricted path  varies according to various embodiments of cursor path restriction module . Several embodiments, each illustrating relationships between a received stream of spatial inputs  and responsive movement of cursor  on current restricted path , are discussed above.","In addition to showing movement of the cursor, an alteration to the content displayed on viewing area  of display  may be made visible, where the alteration depends on movement of cursor  along at least a portion of restricted path  (C). For example, cursor path restriction module  may be so configured that, if an operator holds down a button of pointing device  while simultaneously moving cursor  along a portion of restricted path , then cursor path restriction module  may respond by applying a colored stroke or pattern to the traversed portion of restricted path  while the button is held down by the operator. When the operator releases the button, cursor path restriction module  may cease application of the colored stroke or pattern to restricted path . There may be considerable variation, according to differing embodiments, of the manner in which cursor path restriction module  visibly alters content of viewing area  dependent upon movement of cursor  along a portion of restricted path . A further discussion of various types of alterations is given below, and several example embodiments are illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-8","b":["110","100","140","130"]},"In the example embodiment illustrated in , existing path  and restricted path  are exactly coincident. Cursor  moves along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode, in response to spatial inputs  received from pointing device . During time intervals in which cursor  moves along particular portions of restricted path , strokes or patterns may be applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along the particular portions of restricted path . Strokes or patterns are shown in  centered on four non-contiguous portions of restricted path . The strokes or patterns centered on the four non-contiguous portions of restricted path  may be generated in response, for example, to a user holding down a button of pointing device  and simultaneously, by means of manipulating pointing device , causing cursor  to proceed along the four non-contiguous portions of restricted path . A stroke or a pattern is applied to the portions of restricted path  traversed by cursor  while the user holds down the button of pointing device . It is intended that such a user may, according to various embodiments, choose different strokes or patterns or other visible effects to be applied while traversing restricted path . It is noted that such visible effects, applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode, may not necessarily be centered on restricted path , as shown in . In fact, according to some embodiments, such visible effects may be displayed off-center or away from restricted path . According to still other embodiments, such visible effects may curve away from restricted path , subject to deformation by a transforming function.","In the example embodiment illustrated in , restricted path  is a translation of existing path  across viewing area . During time intervals in which cursor  moves along particular portions of restricted path , strokes or patterns may be applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along the particular portions of restricted path . Strokes or patterns are shown in  at three non-contiguous portions of restricted path . The strokes or patterns at the three non-contiguous portions of restricted path  may be generated in response, for example, to a user holding down a button of pointing device  and simultaneously manipulating pointing device  to make cursor  proceed along the three non-contiguous portions of restricted path . A stroke or a pattern is applied at portions of restricted path  traversed by cursor  while the user holds down the button of pointing device . It is intended that such a user may, according to various embodiments, choose different strokes or patterns or other visible effects to be applied while traversing restricted path . It is noted that such visible effects, applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode, may not necessarily be centered on restricted path .  shows two strokes that are approximately centered on restricted path . A third stroke does not fully conform to restricted path . Instead, the third stroke is deformed by a transforming function so that it curves away from the portion of restricted path  traversed by cursor  during generation of the third stroke. In some embodiments, such a deformation of a stroke or a pattern may be requested by a user or by a software component or a hardware component. In other embodiments, a transforming function may be incorporated into a stroke or a pattern so that it is automatically applied when the stroke or pattern is applied.","In the example embodiment illustrated in , restricted path  is a rotation and translation of existing path  across viewing area . During time intervals in which cursor  moves along particular portions of restricted path , strokes or patterns may be applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along the particular portions of restricted path .  shows a single stroke applied to restricted path  and centered on restricted path . Such a stroke may be generated by a user who generates a stroke-painting signal while simultaneously manipulating pointing device  to make cursor  proceed along the entire length of restricted path . According to various embodiments, such a user may choose several strokes or patterns or other visible effects to be applied while traversing restricted path . In the illustrated embodiment, the user has chosen a single stroke for application directly on restricted path . Visible effects applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode may not necessarily be centered on, or even touch, restricted path . For example, the stroke shown in  may be shifted on or away from restricted path  according to a transforming function applied to the stroke, or may otherwise be deformed so that it does not conform to restricted path . In some embodiments, such a deformation of a stroke or a pattern may be requested by a user or by a software component or a hardware component. In other embodiments, a transforming function may be incorporated into a stroke or a pattern so that it is automatically applied when the stroke or pattern is applied.","The example embodiment illustrated in  shows restricted path  as a rotated, translated, and scaled version of existing path  on viewing area . During time intervals in which cursor  moves along particular portions of restricted path , strokes or patterns may be applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along the particular portions of restricted path .  shows strokes or patterns centered along two non-contiguous portions of restricted path , along with three clones of restricted path  and of the strokes or patterns applied to restricted path . Such strokes or patterns or other visual effects may be generated by a user who issues a signal to apply a visual effect while simultaneously manipulating pointing device  to make cursor  proceed along the two non-contiguous portions of restricted path . The three cloned stroke pairings shown in  may be automatically generated to appear simultaneously with the pair of strokes applied to restricted path . Such cloning or copying of visible effects applied dependent upon movement of cursor  along portions of restricted path  may be specified according to various parameters, depending on the embodiments. For example, one parameter may specify the number of clones to be generated, while another parameter may set a distance between individual copies of the visible effects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["830","820","820","110","140","830","140","830","830","200","140","830","830","140","830","140","830","830","830","830"]},"It is noted that in the embodiment illustrated in , existing path  crosses over itself at a point of intersection to form an intersection having four branches, as does restricted path , which tracks existing path . While cursor  is moving along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode, and as cursor  approaches the point of intersection, one of the four branches may be selected as the intended branch for continued movement of cursor  along restricted path . For each of the four branches, the slope of a line tangent to the branch at or near the point of intersection may be calculated. Each of the four calculated slopes may be compared with the slope of a vector representing an intended direction of movement of cursor , as indicated by spatial inputs . Based on the results of the comparison, and the direction of the vector, one of the four branches may be selected for cursor  to track as it continues along restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode. Similar calculations and selections may be made for other embodiments in which the number of branches is not four. For instance, an existing path  may have only three branches extending from a point of intersection, as in the case of a Y-shaped existing path , and similar calculations may be made for the three branches.","The application of strokes or patterns or other visual effects may depend upon movement of cursor  along particular portions of restricted path  while in cursor path restriction mode. For instance, any one of the four strokes shown in  may be removed or partially erased while cursor  traverses a corresponding portion of restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode. Alternatively, any one of the four strokes shown in  may be replaced with some other visual effect, if required, based upon movement of cursor  along a corresponding portion of restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode. According to some embodiments, any one of the four strokes shown in  may be blended or joined or otherwise mixed with another visual effect, based upon movement of cursor  along a corresponding portion of restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode.","According to some other embodiments, new visual effects applied to portions of viewing area  that are not on existing path  may be derived from existing visual effects already present on existing path . For example, existing path  shown in  may already have several visual effects centered upon it (this is not shown in the drawing), and the four strokes exhibited in  may be produced by extracting them from the several existing visual effects centered on existing path . In some embodiments, such an extraction may be accomplished by simply holding down a button while cursor  traverses the four corresponding portions of restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode. In other embodiments, new visual effects applied to portions of viewing area  that are not on existing path  may be generated in other ways. For example, they may be gotten from existing visual effects already present on portions existing path  by blending or otherwise modifying existing visual effects already present on portions of existing path . In such an example embodiment, the derivation and the application of the modified visual effects is based upon movement of cursor  along portions of restricted path  that correspond to the portions of existing path  where the existing visual effects are located, with the derivation and application proceeding while cursor  moves on restricted path  in cursor path restriction mode.","In the embodiment illustrated in , a pair of strokes is shown centered along two non-contiguous portions of existing path . The other four pairs of strokes which are located elsewhere on viewing area  may, according to some embodiments, be viewed as visible copies of the pair of strokes on existing path . They may be generated and applied based upon movement of cursor  along portions of restricted path  that correspond to the portions of existing path  where the original pair of strokes are centered, with the derivation and application proceeding while cursor  moves in cursor path restriction mode. These visible copies are rotated, translated, and scaled on viewing area  of display .","According to some embodiments, an existing path  may be derived from a raster image using edge detection. In such instances, after an existing path  has been obtained from the raster image, cursor  may begin operating in cursor path restriction mode relative to existing path , and thus cursor  may be forced to precisely track existing path . In this manner, a bitmap brush being applied to the raster image may be guided with precision relative to an edge of the raster image. During movement of cursor  along a restricted path  that tracks existing path , the bitmap brush may apply a change to a portion of the raster image that matches restricted path .","Numerous parameters used for cursor path restriction mode are described above. Those parameters, as well as other parameters for cursor path restriction mode operations may be presented, according to some embodiments, in a user interface for viewing, entering, selecting, or changing cursor path restriction mode parameters. Example parameters include ones for: controlling cursor acceleration and deceleration; defining a degree of rotation, an amount of translation, or a scaling factor to apply to a selected existing path in determining a restricted path; exiting and entering cursor path restriction mode; defining a threshold angle or slope used in exiting cursor path restriction mode; defining a threshold distance from an existing path for selection of the existing path; defining a threshold amount used in resolving a difference between anticipated cursor movement and desired cursor movement; establishing the width of an envelope straddling a path; defining a metric for use in calculations made by a cursor path restriction module; specifying a number of clones to be generated, or some other repetition count; setting a distance between individual copies of paths, strokes, patterns, or other visible effects; and configuring and controlling the application of strokes, patterns, and other visual effects.","Conduct of various operations in cursor path restriction mode provides efficiency and ease in performing those operations. For example, operations that may otherwise require many separate steps, numerous switches between modes, or division of paths may be performed easily and quickly in a single pass in cursor path restriction mode, without the necessity for making many separate steps, frequent switching between modes, or dividing of paths into pieces. A user may apply various brush strokes, patterns, or other varied visual effects continually, without ever leaving cursor path restriction mode. Instead of having to separately select a portion of a path, copy the selected portion, apply visual effects to the selected portion, and paste the altered copy, one may combine all these steps using cursor path restriction mode. Rather than having to apply a sequence of operations for each of several non-contiguous portions of a path, one may apply a single operation per non-contiguous portion of a path, and may apply the single operations serially without leaving cursor path restriction mode. Operations may be applied for just a portion of a path, if desired. Resizing and transforming of paths is accomplished with ease, as is varying the visual effects being applied, all while operating continually in cursor path restriction mode.","Cursor path restriction mode also offers complete precision in performing operations that depend on accurately tracking a path. Errors made with the pointing device in attempting to track an existing path may be eliminated by using cursor path restriction mode. Visual effects derived using an existing path may be accurately generated and placed on the display so that important shape or other geometric or visual characteristics or effects inherent on an existing path are faithfully preserved. Visual effects thus derived from an existing path may be correctly applied either to the existing path itself or to other portions of the display, as described above.","Exemplary Computer System","It is contemplated that in some embodiments, any of the methods, techniques or components described above may be implemented as instructions and data capable of being stored or conveyed via a computer-accessible medium.
