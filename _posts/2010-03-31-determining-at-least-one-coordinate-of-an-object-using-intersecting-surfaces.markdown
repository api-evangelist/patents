title: Determining at least one coordinate of an object using intersecting surfaces
abstract: In an embodiment, a coordinate determiner is operable to identify at least first and second surfaces that each approximately intersect an object, and to determine at least two approximate coordinates of the object from the first and second surfaces, where at least one of the surfaces is nonplanar. For example, if the coordinate determiner is disposed on a fighter jet having at least two short-baseline-interferometers (SBIs), then two surfaces may be the surfaces of two cones having two of the SBIs as respective vertices, the object may be a close-in target, and the coordinate determiner may determine the azimuth and elevation of the target from the cone surfaces. Furthermore, the coordinate determiner or another computation unit onboard the jet may determine the slant range of the target from the elevation and the altitude of the jet. The coordinate determiner may at least facilitate ranging of the target quickly enough to allow a pilot sufficient time to evade detection by the target, to destroy the target, or to evade or destroy a projectile fired by the target.

This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In an embodiment, a coordinate determiner is operable to identify first and second surfaces that each approximately intersect an object, and to determine at least two approximate coordinates of the object from the first and second surfaces, where at least one of the surfaces is nonplanar.","For example, if the coordinate determiner is disposed on a fighter jet having at least two short-baseline-interferometers (SBIs), then the two surfaces may be the surfaces of two cones having two of the (SBIs) as respective vertices, the object may be a close-in target, and the coordinate determiner may determine the azimuth and elevation of the target relative to the jet from the cone surfaces. Furthermore, the coordinate determiner or another component of the jet's onboard computer system may determine the slant range of the target from the elevation and the altitude of the jet. The coordinate determiner may facilitate ranging of the target quickly enough to allow the jet pilot sufficient time to evade detection by the target, to destroy the target, or to evade or destroy a projectile fired by the target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","12","10"],"sub":["AZ ","RANGE "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","14","10"],"sub":["EL ","RANGE ","RANGE "]},"Geometrically speaking, the target T lies in an elevation plane which is perpendicular to the jet azimuth plane  and which includes the straight line  along which His measured. For example, in this embodiment, the elevation plane may be coincident with the page of .","Referring to , the fighter jet  typically includes an onboard computer system (not shown in ) for detecting the target T, and for determining one or more of the following targeting quantities: \u03b8, \u03b8, R, H, and V. For example, the computer system may actively detect and range (i.e., determine R for) the target T by transmitting a signal (e.g., a radar signal) that impinges upon, and that is reflected back to the jet  by, the target T, and by receiving the reflected signal with a directional antenna (not shown in ). The computer system may then determine \u03b8and \u03b8by analyzing the phase of the received signal at each of multiple elements of the antenna.","Alternatively, the onboard computer system may passively detect and range the target T by similarly analyzing a signal emitted by the target T to determine \u03b8and \u03b8. Passive detection may be useful, for example, when the pilot of the fighter jet  does not want to alert the personnel manning the target T to the jet's presence, or when the target is difficult or impractical to actively detect.","Unfortunately, a conventional passive-target-detection computer system may be unable to range a target with the level of speed and accuracy that is required for applications such as target evasion or destruction (e.g., by firing a missile). For example, \u201cclose-in\u201d targets (also called \u201cpop-up\u201d targets) may be defined as ground-based targets (e.g., a hand-held rocket launcher) that that are within a slant range of approximately 1-20 nautical miles (NM) of an aircraft such as a fighter jet. But because close-in targets may generate only one or a few targeting pulses before firing, a passive-detection computer system using a conventional technique such as signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis may be unable to range the target quickly enough to allow a pilot sufficient time to evade detection by the target, to destroy the target, or to evade or destroy a projectile (e.g., a missile) fired by the target.","Discussed below, however, are embodiments of techniques that a passive-target-detection computers system may implement to range a target, such as a close-in target, with a level of speed and accuracy sufficient to allow a pilot enough time to evade detection by the target, to destroy the target, or to evade or destroy a projectile fired by the target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"30"},"The SBI  is approximately cylindrical, and has a length L that is much greater (e.g., ten or more times greater) than its diameter D.","The SBI  also has a longitudinal axis , and has a boresight axis , which passes through the center  of the SBI perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.","In response to a signal received from, e.g., a close-in target T, the SBI  generates one or more array signals having respective magnitudes and phases, and a computer system may calculate from these array signals the angle \u03b2 that the received signal makes with the boresight axis .","From the angle \u03b2, the computer system may identify a cone  having a cone angle \u03b1 and a cone surface  that intersects the target T. The cone angle \u03b1 is given by the following equation:\n\n\u03b1=90\u00b0\u2212\u03b2\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nAnd the cone surface  is given by the following equation:\n\ntan\u03b1\n\nwhere the z axis is normal to the plane in which of  lies.\n","Still referring to , because the SBI  may introduce an error into the calculation of the boresight angle \u03b2, the cone surface  may not actually intersect the target T, but may pass relatively close to T; therefore, one may say that the cone surface  approximately intersects T, where \u201capproximately\u201d means that the cone surface  actually intersects T, or comes relatively close to intersecting T.","Furthermore, this SBI error may be proportional to 1\/cos \u03b2, such that the SBI error is a minimum when \u03b2=0\u00b0, and is a maximum (and may approach infinity) when \u03b2 approaches \u00b190\u00b0. For example, the SBI 1-sigma error value \u03c3may be approximately 3\u00b0 when \u03b2=0\u00b0, and may be approximately 34\u00b0 when \u03b2=85\u00b0. One may account for this error when determining one or more coordinates of the target T as discussed below.","Still referring to , although the SBI  may allow a targeting computer system to quickly determine an accurate value for \u03b2\u2014the computer system may be able to determine an accurate value for \u03b2 in 100 milliseconds (ms) or less after the SBI  receives only a single targeting pulse from the target T\u2014\u03b2alone is insufficient to range, or to otherwise identify the location of, the target T.","But as discussed below, by using a signal received simultaneously by multiple SBIs, received sequentially by a single SBI in multiple positions, or received sequentially by multiple SBIs in multiple positions, a targeting computer system may locate a close-in target T with sufficient speed and accuracy to allow a pilot time to evade or destroy the target or a projectile launched by the target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["50","52","54","56","58","60","54","56"]},"Each of the SBIs , , , and  are mounted approximately in the plane of the wings  of the jet  such that when the jet is in level flight, the SBIs are approximately parallel to the ground (not shown in ) and the z-axis components of the SBIs are approximately zero.","The SBIs  and  are mounted at angles +\u03c6 and \u2212\u03c6, respectively, in the x-y plane relative to the nose  of the jet , and the SBIs  and  are mounted at angles +\u03c9 and \u2212\u03c9, respectively, in the x-y plane relative to the nose.","As discussed in more detail below in conjunction with , the SBIs  and  are positioned to locate targets disposed within a three-dimensional region  located on the right side of the jet  and bounded in part by the longitudinal SBI axes  and .

Because the target T is much farther away (e.g., 1-10 nautical miles) than the non zero distance by which the SBI's  and  are separated, this assumption may introduce a manageable or negligible error into the target-coordinate calculation.","It is known from Euclidian geometry that the surfaces of two right cones\u2014a right cone is a cone the cross section of which is a circle in any plane perpendicular to the cone axis\u2014with a common vertex intersect each other along a plane that also intersects the common vertex.","Therefore, a signal emitted from the target T defines two right cones  and  having cone angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 and cone surfaces  and  that intersect in an elevation plane , which is perpendicular to the plane in which  lies and which approximately passes through the target and the common point . Because the target T is much farther away than the distances (e.g., a few meters or less) between the boresights of the SBIs  and  and the common point , one may further simplify the mathematics by assuming that the cones  and  share a common vertex at the common point , and this assumption may introduce only a manageable of negligible error into the coordinate calculation.

For example, the computer system may determine the elevation plane  by solving equation (2) for both cone angles \u03b1 and \u03b2, identifying at least three points that are approximately common to both cone surfaces  and , and then determining from these common points the elevation plane, which is the plane in which these points all approximately lie.","Once the onboard computer system (not shown in ) identifies the elevation plane , it may determine the approximate azimuth angle between the jet heading  and the elevation plane (and thus the approximate azimuth angle \u03b8of the target T relative to the jet  of ) using one of a number of conventional mathematical techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["54","56","90"]},"It is known from Euclidian geometry that two right cones having a common vertex not only intersect along a plane that includes the vertex, but also intersect along a hyperbola that lies within this plane of intersection.

For example, the computer system may identify the target T as a stationary ground-based target such as a portable missile launcher.","Further in response to the signals received from the SBIs  and , the onboard computer system may determine the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 that the signal emitted from the target T makes with the respective SBIs.","Next, using, e.g., equation (2), the onboard computer system effectively identifies the surfaces  and  of the cones  and  that the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 define, and identifies three or more points in three-dimensional space that are approximately common to both of these cone surfaces. As discussed above, these points lie approximately along the hyperbola  in the elevation plane .","Then, from the points approximately common to both cone surfaces  and , the onboard computer determines the hyperbola , the elevation plane  in which the hyperbola lies, and the hyperbola asymptotes  and .","Next, as discussed above, the onboard computer system determines the approximate azimuth angle \u03b8to be equal to the angle between the jet heading  and the elevation plane , and determines the approximate elevation angle \u03b8to be equal to the angle between the azimuth plane  and the lower asymptote  (again assuming that the onboard computer has identified the target T as a ground-based target).","Because in some circumstances the pilot of the jet  does not need to know the slant range R, the target-coordinate-determination procedure may end here. For example, where the target T may be visible from the jet  (), it may be sufficient to provide the direction of the target T so that the pilot knows where to look for the target.","But if the pilot would also like to know, or also needs to know, the slant range R, then the onboard computer system may determine R according to equation (3).","Still referring to , alternate embodiments are contemplated. For example, if the target T emits multiple signals (e.g., multiple weapon-targeting pulses), then the onboard computer system may repeat the above procedure for each of these signals, and iteratively determine \u03b8, \u03b8, and\/or R, using, e.g., one or more conventional Kalman filters, so that \u03b8, \u03b8, and\/or R converge to values that may be more accurate than the values obtainable by performing the above procedure for only one of the signals emitted by the target. Furthermore, the onboard computer system may calculate an indicator of the statistical error (e.g., the 1-sigma value) for \u03b8, \u03b8, and\/or R, and display this indicator\/these indicator to the pilot along with the value\/values of \u03b8, \u03b8, and\/or R (an example of such an errors-indicator calculation and display is discussed below). Moreover, the onboard computer system may determine one or more coordinates of an air-based target (e.g., another jet or a missile) using a similar procedure, but may determine the approximately elevation angle \u03b8as being equal to the angle between the upper asymptote  and the azimuth plane . In addition, the computer system may be onboard a vehicle (e.g., tank, ship, spacecraft) other than a jet. Furthermore if the terrain is not flat, in the region where the target is located, then the computer system may adjust the jet altimeter reading to obtain and adjusted value for the height h.
