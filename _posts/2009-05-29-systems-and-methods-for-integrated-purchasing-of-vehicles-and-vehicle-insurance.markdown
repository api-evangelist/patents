{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In the vehicle purchase process there are three basic steps (financing, purchasing, and insuring). A fundamental problem currently exists in how to seamlessly combine those steps into one basic process. In addition, there has traditionally been a gap in how to address \u201cimpulse shoppers\u201d of a vehicle. Most of the time these \u201cimpulse shoppers\u201d have not thought ahead to obtain financing options, have not researched much, and are unaware of insurance costs associated to a vehicle purchase. Current processes for purchasing an automobile makes it impossible for a financial institution to assist a shopper with financing an impulse buy of an automobile. Also, when a vehicle shopper has decided on the vehicle that they want to purchase, it is often difficult to quickly find automobile dealers closest to the shopper's current location that have the specific vehicle available. This often involves calling all the dealers in a particular area for a particular make of vehicle and\/or searching on the Internet, which does not provide directions from a current location of the customer if they are away from their home searching on their mobile device.","In this regard, there is a need for systems and methods that overcome the shortcomings described above and others.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

The automobile loan funding and dealer instructions may originate from the consumer loan origination system  of , for example.","Alternatively, the vehicle\/dealer database may comprise an inventory management system wherein the financial services company offering the automobile loan may perfect a lien on the selected vehicle electronically. For example, the automobile title transfer documents may be automatically and\/or electronically completed once the electronic signature of the automobile loan is received from the customer . Therefore, a purchase agreement between the customer  and the automobile dealer at which the selected vehicle is located may be prepared and electronically communicated to the customer  or automobile dealer. After electronic lien perfection, funds for purchase of the automobile may be electronically deposited or transferred into an account of the customer  from the consumer loans origination system  of , for example.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for providing automobile dealer location information in conjunction with integrated purchasing of vehicles and vehicle insurance. First a vehicle selection is received  as shown in , for example. Then the distance from the customer to automobile dealers having the selected vehicle may be provided . Also, specific location information of the dealers having the selected vehicle may be provided  as well. The location information regarding the automobile dealers may be retrieved from the automobile dealer network  and associated vehicle\/dealer database of , for example. This information may be cross referenced with global positioning system (GPS) data or cellular triangulation data communicated from the mobile device  of the customer  to provide a distance from a current location of the customer's mobile device  to the various automobile dealers. Also, using the information above alerts may optionally be provided to the customer  on the customer's mobile device  when the mobile device  is within a certain predetermined distance of one or more dealers having the selected vehicle available.","An automobile dealer selection may then be received  from the customer  and then directions to the selected dealer from the current location of the customer  may be provided  to the customer's mobile device , for example. The location information of the selected dealer may be cross referenced with global positioning system (GPS) data or cellular triangulation data communicated from the mobile device  of the customer  to provide directions from a current location of the customer's mobile device  to the various automobile dealers. The direction information may be retrieved from a third party database or service such as Google\u00ae Maps, for example. The customer may also be updated on their status as far as current distance to the selected dealer and a notification or alert may be provided  to the customer when they have arrived at the selected dealer location. Information regarding the specific location of and current distance to the selected vehicle on the automobile dealer sales lot and salesperson information may also be provided on the mobile device  of the customer .","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart illustrating an example process for providing an insurance quote for an automobile in conjunction with integrated purchasing of vehicles and vehicle insurance. First a vehicle selection is received  as shown in , for example. The customer's current insurance policy may then be accessed . The customer's current insurance records regarding their current automobile insurance policy may be in the financial company corporate database  and or in the insurance systems  of , for example. Next, information is accessed  regarding a selected vehicle by using a received vehicle identification information, such as a VIN, for example. This information regarding the selected vehicle may be accessed in the vehicle\/dealer database  or other vehicle databases based on the vehicle identification information. It is then determined  whether the customer  has selected to change coverage amounts or remove a current vehicle from their current insurance policy. For example, the customer  may wish to replace a current vehicle on their current insurance policy with the selected new vehicle. This may often be the case if the customer  is trading in the vehicle currently on their insurance policy at an automobile dealer for a new vehicle or for credit towards a new vehicle. The customer  may communicate this change, for example, via their mobile device .","If the customer  has not selected to change coverage amounts or remove a current vehicle from their current insurance policy, then an insurance quote is automatically generated  based on the customer's current coverage amounts and information regarding the selected new vehicle for purchase without removing any vehicles from current policy.
