title: Controlling access to information over a multiband network
abstract: A method and apparatus for controlling access to information over a network. Information and video/audio streams are transmitted across a network by a head end to a member space manager or set-top box where the information may be utilized or viewed. The frequency that a given stream of information is transmitted on is rotated or switched based on a switching algorithm. For example, a given stream (e.g., a motion picture on a pay-per-view station) may be transmitted on one frequency for a specified time interval, then switched to another frequency for a specified time interval, etc. To enable the member space manager to determine which frequency a given stream of information is transmitted on at a particular point in time, switching software may be provided by the head end server to the member space manager. Switching software may be encrypted prior to transmission to the member space manager. According to one or more embodiments of the invention, the stream-to-frequency mapping is determined, the mapping is transmitted to the member space manager where it is installed and executed, the stream of information is transmitted on varying frequencies to the member space manager, and the member space manager tunes into the appropriate frequency to receive and utilize a continuous stream of information. By transmitting information in this manner, all encryption, frequency/channel switching, configuration issues, etc. are transparent to the end user who merely has to select a virtual channel to view.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of information networks, and more specifically to controlling access to information over a network.","Portions of the disclosure of this patent document contain material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

Products bearing SPARC trademarks are based upon an architecture developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.","2. Background Art","Cable T.V. is a common mechanism used to distribute television channels and programs. Cable companies charge a subscriber for access to the various channels and programs distributed (referred to as \u201cbasic\u201d cable). Such \u201cbasic\u201d cable may be viewed using a cable-ready television. For additional money, a subscriber can pay for premium channels such as HBO, Showtime, and the Movie Channel or specific programs (e.g., movies) using a pay-per-view system. To restrict access to unauthorized viewing of the premium channels (and pay-per-view movies), cable companies scramble the television signals and provide a set-top box (also known as a cable box) which has the ability to descramble the information. However, cable boxes (referred to as \u201cillegal\u201d boxes) that \u201cdescramble\u201d or \u201cclarify\u201d unauthorized television signals are often sold and advertised for sale in the back of technical magazines and on the internet. This results in \u201cdata theft\u201d because data that should be paid for is obtained for free.","Another area that suffers from data theft is the internet. Like television, some of the information accessible via the internet and world wide web may be subscription based. To prevent unauthorized access to the information, a username and password may be required. However, usernames and passwords and other authorization techniques may be bypassed by hackers and other unauthorized users.","Owners of the information, including cable companies and television stations, desire a way to ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to information and broadcast signals without authorization. Additionally, a method that is not easily bypassed or worked around using illegal boxes or by hacking is desirable.","To better understand cable and information\/television signal distribution, a description of how information is transmitted and the transmission mediums will now be discussed. Currently, information may be shared and provided between various devices (including computers and cable systems) linked together in a network (including a world wide network such as the internet). A network can be a small system that is physically connected by cables (a local area network or \u201cLAN\u201d), or several separate networks can be connected together to form a larger network (a wide area network or \u201cWAN\u201d). Other types of networks include the internet, tel-com networks, the World Wide Web, intranets, extranets, wireless networks, and other networks over which electronic, digital, and\/or analog data may be communicated. The World Wide Web (WWW) was developed to provide a simpler, more uniform means for accessing information on the Internet. The WWW is an application of the internet that is commonly used to view (by a mechanism referred to as a web browser) and retrieve information (in the form of web pages).","A network may not be limited to the connection of computers and may include the connection of any type of device such as a television or radio (e.g., a cable area). It is desirable to communicate the information to the various devices on a network based on whether that device has proper authorization (e.g., providing television channels to cable subscribers and restricting access to non-subscribers).","As described above, to prevent unauthorized access, prior art mechanisms merely scramble the information prior to transmission and descramble the information for viewing by a particular user (using a cable box). However, regulations that will take effect in the near future restrict the ability to scramble\/descramble the information using the current mechanisms available.","The devices on a network may be connected using a variety of mediums. For example, television signals and other information may be transmitted by cable, telephone wire, or by satellite. Various entities may transmit the signal or information. For example, the transmitting entity may include but is not limited to a software developer, a local cable company, a local phone company, a television station, or a motel\/hotel operator, etc.","The information transmitted over a network may consist of confidential or copyrighted material for which the owner (or device\/entity transmitting the information) may want to limit access. For example, the owner of computer software (e.g., Sun Microsystems Inc.\u2122) or motion picture rights may want to limit the transmission of the computer software or motion picture to particular authorized persons. Similarly, a cable company may want to transmit certain channels for free and require payment for other channels or programs.","As described above, in some cable networks, a viewer or subscriber pays for the level of service\/transmission desired. For example, a subscriber may pay one amount for several \u201cbasic\u201d channels (a basic subscriber), and may pay additional money for \u201cpremium\u201d channels (a premium subscriber). The subscriber can also elect to pay further money for a particular program referred to as \u201cpay-per-view\u201d or \u201cvideo-on-demand\u201d program. To prevent a subscriber from viewing an unauthorized transmission, numerous schemes have developed.","Information is transmitted across a variety of transmission mediums (e.g., cable, satellite, etc.) in analog form. Most mediums have a spectrum (a given range of transmission frequencies) across which the information may be transmitted. For example, a television signal may be transmitted on an ultra high frequency (UHF) or a very high frequency (VHF) and radio stations may transmit information across a certain frequency range (e.g., 89-108 MHz (megahertz)). A particular channel is transmitted on a particular frequency and remains on that frequency. For example, channel 2 may be assigned to 110 MHz and is always transmitted on the 110 MHz frequency. Thus, the prior art requires the manual assignment of a particular channel (stream of information) to a particular frequency. Thus, channel 2 may be assigned to 110 MHz and channel 4 may be assigned to 145 MHz, etc. With respect to radio, a particular radio station may be assigned to the frequency 106.7 MHz and another station to 98.7 MHz, another to 97.1 MHz, etc. Thus, the prior art provides for manually assigning and setting the transmission for a given stream of information. Manual assignment is necessary because the receiver has no mechanism for determining the transmission frequency of a given channel other than by a passive predetermined arrangement. In addition to transmitting television or other signals in an analog form, digital signals may also be transmitted across similar assigned frequencies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","106","110","100"]},"Descrambler  may be configured to descramble the information in a variety of ways. For example, a key may be utilized by scrambler  to scramble the information and applied to descrambler  to descramble the information. The key may be changed from time to time, transmitted to the set-top box (or a decoder within the set-top box) and applied to the descrambler by the set-top box (or decoder). The key may be transmitted as a data signal within the normal television transmission. Normal television signals have a vertical blanking interval (VBI) in each field and a horizontal blanking interval (HBI) in each line between the chrominance and luminance signals. The key may be transmitted within either the VBI or HBI.","Pay-per-view programs provide the user with the ability to pay for a specific program or channel for a specific period of time. For descrambler  to descramble a specific program, each set-top-box  or descrambler  may have a unique address that permits transmitter  to selectively communicate with it. A program tag may be transmitted with the television signal that identifies a particular location in the memory of descrambler , for example. The memory location of descrambler  stores information regarding whether that particular user is authorized or not authorized to receive the particular program. The set-top-box  or descrambler  may communicate with transmitter  and the memory location may be updated to provide for the reception of the particular program. Thus, programs may be viewed on an individual basis.","Transmitted information may be transmitted in a variety of manners. For example, the information may be transmitted in (1) a straight non-scrambled mode (e.g., scrambler  may not modify the signal); (2) a first scrambled mode where the content of all odd-numbered display lines in each frame are inverted while remaining lines are noninverted; and (3) a second scrambled mode wherein the content of all even-numbered display lines in each frame are inverted while remaining display lines are noninverted. Further, this scrambling may be performed on a program by program, or channel by channel basis. However, using any of these transmission examples, it is easy for someone to examine the odd numbered display lines and even numbered display lines and create an unauthorized descrambling device that will enable viewing of all of the channels. A method for preventing unauthorized access or viewing of information transmitted over a network that is not easily bypassed is desired.","A method and apparatus for controlling access to information over a network. Data streams (that may include media streams such as television signals, and information streams such as web pages) are transmitted across a network by a head end (e.g., a local cable company) and received by a member space manager or set-top box (also referred to as a cable box) that enables the information to be utilized or viewed on a television. Data streams may be transmitted on a variety of frequencies across cable (or other transmission mediums such as satellite). Prior art methods restrict the transmission of a particular channel to a set frequency (e.g., 110 MHz). Thus, channel 2 is always transmitted across a particular frequency, channel four on another particular frequency, channel 7 on another particular frequency, etc. To prevent unauthorized viewing, the prior art scrambles the transmitted signal. However, an illegal cable box merely has to descramble the information on a particular frequency to view a given channel\/program.","One or more embodiments of the invention provide for rotating or switching the frequency that a given data stream is transmitted based on a switching algorithm. For example, a given data stream (e.g., a motion picture on a pay-per-view station) may be transmitted on one frequency for a specified time interval (e.g., 1\/10th of a second, 10 seconds, 25 seconds, 1 minute, etc.), then switched to another frequency for a specified time interval (e.g., 1\/10th of a second, 10 seconds, 25 seconds, 1 minute, etc.), then switched to another frequency for a specified time interval, etc. Additionally, the switching algorithm may be changed arbitrarily. By switching the frequency, an illegal cable box has to know the frequency order (which can be changed at any time) that a channel is being transmitted on, thereby making it more difficult to view a continuous program.","To enable the member space manager to determine which frequency a given stream of information is transmitted on at a particular point in time, switching software may be provided by the head end server to the member space manager (or set-top box). Switching software may be specific to a particular data stream and may specify which frequency will contain the given stream at a particular point in time. In one or more embodiments, the switching software may be encrypted prior to transmission to the member space manager and decrypted upon arrival. Further, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the switching software is an object oriented object that is dynamically generated by the member space manager (with information received from the head end server) and maintains the ability to communicate with the head end, e.g., via a remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism such as the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system.","According to one or more embodiments of the invention, a mapping that defines which frequency a particular stream maps\/corresponds to is determined, the mapping is transmitted to the member space manager where it is installed and executed, the data stream is transmitted on varying frequencies to the member space manager, and the member space manager tunes into the appropriate frequency to receive and utilize a continuous stream of information. By transmitting information in this manner, all encryption, frequency\/channel switching, configuration issues, etc. are transparent to the end user who merely has to select a virtual channel (e.g., NBC, ABC, CBS, etc.) to view. Further, illegal viewing of a particular channel is more difficult because once a frequency is tuned into, 1\/10th of a second or 10 seconds later, the selected channel is transmitted on a different frequency.","The invention is a method and apparatus for controlling access to information over a network. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a more thorough description of embodiments of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known features have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention.","The following description discloses embodiments of a method for controlling access to information over a network. First, however, a description is given below of an embodiment of computer apparatus suitable for providing an execution environment for the software apparatus of the invention.","Embodiment of Computer Execution Environment (Hardware)","An embodiment of the invention can be implemented as computer software in the form of computer readable code executed on a device such as device\/computer  illustrated in , or in the form of bytecode class files executable within a Java\u2122 runtime environment running on such a device\/computer, or in the form of bytecodes running on a processor (or devices enabled to process bytecodes (such as a set-top box or television)) existing in a distributed environment (e.g., one or more processors on a network). A keyboard  and mouse  are coupled to a system bus . The keyboard and mouse are for introducing user input to the computer system and communicating that user input to processor . Other suitable input devices may be used in addition to, or in place of, the mouse  and keyboard . I\/O (input\/output) unit  coupled to system bus  represents such I\/O elements as a printer, A\/V (audio\/video) I\/O, etc.","Device  includes a video memory , main memory  and mass storage , all coupled to system bus  along with keyboard , mouse  and processor . The mass storage  may include both fixed and removable media, such as magnetic, optical or magnetic optical storage systems or any other available mass storage technology. Bus  may contain, for example, thirty-two address lines for addressing video memory  or main memory . The system bus  also includes, for example, a 64-bit data bus for transferring data between and among the components, such as processor , main memory , video memory  and mass storage . Alternatively, multiplex data\/address lines may be used instead of separate data and address lines.","In one embodiment of the invention, the processor  is a microprocessor manufactured by Sun Microsystems, Inc., such as a SPARC\u2122 microprocessor, or a microprocessor manufactured by Motorola, such as the 680\u00d70 processor, or a microprocessor manufactured by Intel, such as the 80\u00d786, or Pentium processor. However, any other suitable microprocessor or microcomputer may be utilized. Main memory  is comprised of dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Video memory  is a dual-ported video random access memory. One port of the video memory  is coupled to video amplifier . The video amplifier  is used to drive the cathode ray tube (CRT) raster monitor . Video amplifier  is well known in the art and may be implemented by any suitable apparatus. This circuitry converts pixel data stored in video memory  to a raster signal suitable for use by monitor . Monitor  is a type of monitor suitable for displaying graphic images. Device  may or may not have all of the constituent parts - displayed and may not be a computer, but a mechanism for transmitting information such as a television station or cable company.","Device  may also include a communication interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling via a network link  to a local network  or to a local cable company . For example, if communication interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem, communication interface  provides a data communication connection to the corresponding type of telephone line, which comprises part of network link . If communication interface  is a local area network (LAN) card, communication interface  provides a data communication connection via network link  to a compatible LAN. Wireless links are also possible. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals which carry digital data streams representing various types of information (e.g., television or video\/audio streams).","Network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to local server computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . ISP  in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d . Local network  and Internet  both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals which carry digital data streams. Alternatively, network link  may provide a connection to local cable company  which transmits information through local network  to subscriber . The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from device , are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.","Device  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link , and communication interface . In the Internet example, remote server computer  might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet , ISP , local network  and communication interface . In the cable television example, local cable company  transmits video\/audio in the form of channels or streams of information through local network  to the end subscriber  who may display the information on a television.","The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, and\/or stored in mass storage , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, device  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","Application code may be embodied in any form of computer program product. A computer program product comprises a medium configured to store or transport computer readable code, or in which computer readable code may be embedded. Some examples of computer program products are CD-ROM disks, ROM cards, floppy disks, magnetic tapes, computer hard drives, servers on a network, and carrier waves.","The systems described above are for purposes of example only. An embodiment of the invention may be implemented in any type of system, computer system, or programming or processing environment.","Embodiment of Software Apparatus for a Controlling Access to Information","An embodiment of the invention includes software apparatus comprising a method for controlling access to information over a network. The access control may be implemented utilizing instances of object classes in accordance with known object-oriented programming practices. An overview of object-oriented programming is provided below.","Object-Oriented Programming","Object-oriented programming is a method of creating computer programs by combining certain fundamental building blocks, and creating relationships among and between the building blocks. The building blocks in object-oriented programming systems are called \u201cobjects.\u201d An object is a programming unit that groups together a data structure (one or more instance variables) and the operations (methods) that can use or affect that data. Thus, an object consists of data and one or more operations or procedures that can be performed on that data. The joining of data and operations into a unitary building block is called \u201cencapsulation.\u201d","An object can be instructed to perform one of its methods when it receives a \u201cmessage.\u201d A message is a command or instruction sent to the object to execute a certain method. A message consists of a method selection (e.g., method name) and a plurality of arguments. A message tells the receiving object what operations to perform.","One advantage of object-oriented programming is the way in which methods are invoked. When a message is sent to an object, it is not necessary for the message to instruct the object how to perform a certain method. It is only necessary to request that the object execute the method. This greatly simplifies program development.","Object-oriented programming languages are predominantly based on a \u201cclass\u201d scheme. The class-based object-oriented programming scheme is generally described in Lieberman, \u201cUsing Prototypical Objects to Implement Shared Behavior in Object-Oriented Systems,\u201d OOPSLA 86 Proceedings, September 1986, pp. 214-223.","A class defines a type of object that typically includes both variables and methods for the class. An object class is used to create a particular instance of an object. An instance of an object class includes the variables and methods defined for the class. Multiple instances of the same class can be created from an object class. Each instance that is created from the object class is said to be of the same type or class.","To illustrate, an employee object class can include \u201cname\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d instance variables and a \u201cset_salary\u201d method. Instances of the employee object class can be created, or instantiated for each employee in an organization. Each object instance is said to be of type \u201cemployee.\u201d Each employee object instance includes \u201cname\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d instance variables and the \u201cset_salary\u201d method. The values associated with the \u201cname\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d variables in each employee object instance contain the name and salary of an employee in the organization. A message can be sent to an employee's employee object instance to invoke the \u201cset_salary\u201d method to modify the employee's salary (i.e., the value associated with the \u201csalary\u201d variable in the employee's employee object).","A hierarchy of classes can be defined such that an object class definition has one or more subclasses. A subclass inherits its parent's (and grandparent's etc.) definition. Each subclass in the hierarchy may add to or modify the behavior specified by its parent class. Some object-oriented programming languages support multiple inheritance where a subclass may inherit a class definition from more than one parent class. Other programming languages support only single inheritance, where a subclass is limited to inheriting the class definition of only one parent class. The Java programming language also provides a mechanism known as an \u201cinterface\u201d which comprises a set of constant and abstract method declarations. An object class can implement the abstract methods defined in an interface. Both single and multiple inheritance are available to an interface. That is, an interface can inherit an interface definition from more than one parent interface.","An object is a generic term that is used in the object-oriented programming environment to refer to a module that contains related code and variables. A software application can be written using an object-oriented programming language whereby the program's functionality is implemented using objects. The encapsulation provided by objects in an object-oriented programming environment may be extended to the notion of channels or video\/audio steams.","Implementation in the Java Programming Language","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented in any type of programming language (object oriented or otherwise) including but not limited programming languages such as Java, FORTRAN, Pascal, Assembly Language, C, C++, Small Talk, ADA, LISP, or Visual Basic. The description, examples, and implementations described below may refer to or utilize the Java programming language or the Java TV\u2122 application programming interface (API), but the invention is not limited to use of the Java programming language or Java TV API and may be implemented in any type of programming language. Embodiments of the invention may be implemented using the Java TV API which enables a set-top box or digital television to receive interactive television content such as enhanced television, video-on demand, electronic programming guides, and interactive multi-camera-angle sporting events. The Java TV API is an extension of the Java platform and the standard options available in the Java programming language.","The Java programming language is an object-oriented programming language with each program comprising one or more object classes. Unlike many programming languages, in which a program is compiled into machine-dependent, executable program code, Java classes are compiled into machine independent bytecode class files. Each class contains code and data in a platform-independent format called the class file format. The computer system acting as the execution vehicle supports the Java runtime environment. The runtime environment contains a program called a virtual machine, which is responsible for executing the code in Java classes.","Applications may be designed as standalone Java applications, or as Java \u201capplets\u201d which are identified by an applet tag in an HTML document, and loaded by a browser application. The class files associated with an application or applet may be stored on the local computing system, or on a server accessible over a network. Each class is loaded into the Java runtime environment, as needed, by the \u201cclass loader.\u201d","Java classes are loaded on demand from the network (stored on a server), or from a local file system, when first referenced during an application or applet's execution. The runtime environment locates and loads each class file, parses the class file format, allocates memory for the class's various components, and links the class with other already loaded classes. This process makes the code in the class readily executable by the virtual machine.","Embodiments of the software apparatus may be implemented using any programming language including standard OOP object classes. For the purposes of the following description, references to software, software objects and channel control software may refer to instances of OOP object classes.","Implementation of Software Apparatus for Controlling Access to Information Over a Network","As described above, the invention may be implemented in any programming language and examples and descriptions that utilize the Java programming language are examples of one or more embodiments of the invention.","Data Stream Switching","A stream of data or information may consist of a particular channel (e.g., CNN, ESPN, NBC, etc.) or a particular program(s) (e.g., a pay-per-view program, weekend access for a channel, etc.). One or more embodiments of the invention provide for alternating or switching the information for a particular stream of data across one or more frequency bands\/communication paths. A communication path includes frequency bands and any other mechanism through which information is transmitted\/communicated.  illustrates a communication mechanism between a head end and a subscriber according to one or more embodiments of the invention. Cable or communication medium  may consist of a variety of frequency bands A-E (-). Head End  transmits information such as a stream of data across communication medium  where it will eventually reach subscriber . The stream may be transmitted on one frequency band such as band B . Alternatively, the stream may be transmitted on alternating bands. For example, a stream may be transmitted on band A  for a specified time period (e.g., one minute, 1\/10th of a second, etc.), then on band E  for a specified time period (e.g., 30 seconds, 2 seconds, etc.), then on band B  for a specified time period (e.g., one minute, 20 seconds, etc.), etc. By alternating the frequency band that the stream is transmitted on, subscriber  cannot view the stream without knowing which band the stream will be transmitted on (thereby preventing unauthorized access). The stream may be transmitted across numerous alternating frequency bands in a variety of manners as long as subscriber  knows which band the stream will be transmitted on. Thus, a stream (piece of media) can reside on various frequencies at various times in accordance with a given sequence\/pattern of frequencies\/communication paths.","Subscriber Processing of Data Streams",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","404","402","404","402","402","404","402","404","402","404","402","402","404"]},"Head end server  and head end  communicate with one or more source space managers  and one or more member space managers . Each source space manager  is connected to and responsible for a single head end optical node  and provides the application server for the service area associated with node . Thus, for a service area (referred to as a member space), with a defined set of subscribers or members, source space manager  is responsible for (1) modem and optical node  (that provides the ability to communicate across a network); and (2) a server that provides for the configuration for all members in the designated member space (e.g., source space manager  determines the hardware and software configuration for each member and may maintain a database of such configuration information). Source space manager  may also ensure that needed updates to any software on or by its member space managers  are performed accurately and timely. The head end server  and source space manager  may be treated as logically distinct functions and may be implemented in separate machines. However, in one or more embodiments, the head end server  and the source space manager  may be implemented within a common code set on a single machine.","Each member space manager  is associated with a set-top platform  that is connected to a member\/subscriber's television, for example. Member space manager  and set-top platform  may be discussed interchangeably with respect to one or more embodiments of the invention. Member space manager  is configured to deliver a stream of information to a subscriber\/member regardless of which frequency band the stream is received on. Consequently, member space manager  maintains the knowledge provided from head end server  and source space manager  regarding the mapping between streams\/channels and frequency bands for a particular point in time. For example, if a subscriber selects ESPN as the desired channel, member space manager  determines which frequency band to read at which point in time in order to receive the entire stream of ESPN. In essence, member space manager  is unswitching the streams of data from the varying frequency bands that head end server  is transmitting the stream on.","The data streams may be transmitted across internet gateway  using an specific internet protocol (IP) communication system. A protocol is a set of standardized rules for exchanging the information between the computers. Protocols generally specify the data format, timing, sequencing, and error checking of data transmissions. In one or more embodiments of the invention, an IP communication system (an IP channel) is combined with a multiplicity of video\/audio channels (e.g., traditional cable system) to create a control channel. A control channel may be utilized to broadcast traditional media and internet information (and files). Consequently, software may be transmitted by the control channel and executed on a computer or device enabled to execute the software. By controlling the transmission of all information across a control channel, a given piece of information\/media can reside on various channels at various times.","In addition to the above components, a plant manager , space manager , and business manager  may be utilized. For example, plant manager  may provide access to services regarding the communication and status of communication such as preventive and situational diagnostics, quality of service monitoring, automatic service alerts, graceful plant degradation strategies, and bandwidth allocation. Space manager  may provide the means to monitor and update any additional applications on the network such as an application where complex sets of digital media and graphics, Java programming language based intelligence and interactivity, and advanced networking are integrated into and distributed in a 3D spatial context (referred to as a \u201cMediaSpaces\u2122 Java framework\u201d). Business manager  may provide access to business and marketing issues relating to application based services such as the gathering of usage statistics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","402","402","502","504","506","418","508"]},"The ability for member space manager  to decipher the switching scheme may be accomplished in a variety of manners.  illustrates a method for enabling member space manager  to decipher a switching algorithm and provide a continuous stream of data to a viewer\/end-user according to one or more embodiments of the invention. At step , head end server  determines how a particular stream will be transmitted across various bandwidths (e.g., which band a particular stream will be transmitted on at a particular time (i.e., the switching algorithm to be used)). At step , the switching algorithm or instructions regarding which channel to tune into at a particular time for a particular stream is placed into software (referred to as \u201cswitching software\u201d). For example, the switching software may be in the form of an object oriented object that can initialize itself and contains methods to instruct set-top platform  which frequency band to tune into to receive the particular stream. In one or more embodiments, a separate and distinct switching software object may be created for each stream (e.g., channel or program). The switching software may be written in any programming language. In one or more embodiments, the switching software may be written in an object-oriented or scripting language including but not limited to the Java programming language, C++, or SmallTalk. In a Java programming language implementation, member space manager  or a television that set-top platform  is connected to, may be enabled to execute programs written in the Java programming language.","At step , the switching software is transmitted to member space manager . In one or more embodiments, the switching software is encrypted prior to transmission. Encryption (also referred to as cryptography) comprises a system for sending information from a sender to a receiver over a medium so that the information is \u201csecure\u201d, that is, so that only the intended receiver can recover the information. During encryption information is converted, from a format wherein the information may be viewed without additional effort, into an encrypted format, wherein the information may only be viewed after decryption. The switching software may be encrypted using any type of encryption algorithm including but not limited to public key cryptography or secret key cryptography wherein a \u201ckey\u201d is utilized to encrypt the software and the same or a different \u201ckey\u201d is used to decrypt the software. Further, in one or more embodiments, the encryption mechanism may be changed if desired.","By encrypting the switching software, only individuals\/entities with the decryption software (and the appropriate \u201ckey\u201d) can utilize the switching software. Consequently, unauthorized users are prevented from installing and utilizing the switching software that provides the frequency-channel mapping and will have extreme difficulty in obtaining a continuous stream of information (by determining which bands contain a channel at a given time). At step , member space manager  decrypts the switching software and installs the switching software to enable viewing\/utilization of a continuous stream. In one or more embodiments, the installation process may include loading a transmitted switching software object at set-top platform . Further, the switching software object may be generated dynamically by member space manager .","In one or more embodiments, member space manager  maintains the ability to communicate with head end server . In such an embodiment, head end server  communicates with member space manager  to properly configure member space manager  to receive and tune in a particular stream continuously. For example, member space manager  may request a particular stream from head end server . In response, head end server  may request member space manager  to identify itself by supplying a hardware identifier for a given set-top platform . After receiving a properly authorized hardware identifier, head end server  may encrypt the switching software and transmit the switching software to member space manager . Member space manager  may decrypt the switching software, install the switching software and tune in the desired stream. Consequently, communication between member space manager  and head end server  prevents unauthorized users from utilizing transmitted information.","In one or more embodiments, member space manager  may tune in a particular stream using dynamic signaling. In dynamic signaling, member space manager  maintains the knowledge regarding which particular stream a communication is related to. Additionally, each communication may use a particular encryption scheme. Thus, member space manager  maintains the knowledge regarding what the encryption\/decryption key is for a particular communication with head end server . For example, in one or more embodiments, head end server  may maintain objects for a given stream and the member space manager's software object maintains the knowledge regarding which object in head end server  the member space manager object is communicating with. The member space manager object may also maintain the knowledge regarding what the encryption\/decryption key is for a particular communication with head end server . In such an embodiment, unauthorized access is more difficult because an unauthorized user would have to determine what object in head end server  the unauthorized user is communicating with and must also determine what the encryption key is for the particular communication.","According to one or more embodiments, switching software may be transmitted at regular or irregular intervals. Consequently, just when an unauthorized user has managed to determine the switching algorithm\/pattern for a given stream, the new switching pattern will force the unauthorized user to attempt to determine the new switching pattern.","As described above, set-top platform  and member space manager  provide the ability to translate or tune into a particular channel or stream of information at a given time. Consequently, there is no specific assigned frequency for a given stream. However, in one or more embodiments of the invention, certain streams or channels may be restricted to a specific frequency with remaining frequencies on the spectrum available for switching. For example, a cable company may want to distribute a certain subset of channels to all users in its area (e.g., NBC, ABC, CBS, and FOX) for free. Consequently, each of those particular channels may be tied to a specific frequency. Any additional channels or programs broadcast by the cable company can then use the switching software as described above by utilizing remaining frequencies available on the broadcast medium. To select a desired channel or stream of information, the end user may select a virtual channel instead of a number that corresponds to a specific frequency. Thus, the end user merely selects NBC, ESPN, or PAY PER VIEW 1 instead of channel 4, 28, or 75. All other transactions, including frequency switching and communication with head end server  are transparent to the user.","In accordance with one or more embodiments as described above, instead of encrypting or scrambling information, a stream of information is transmitted on varying frequency bands. Consequently, information regarding where in the spectrum of transmitted signals a stream will appear are encrypted instead of encrypting the stream itself. Thus, a method and apparatus for controlling access to information over a network transparently to an end user has been described in conjunction with one or more specific embodiments. The invention is defined by the claims and their full scope of equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
