title: Web services layer synchrony in relation to the business layer synchrony
abstract: A web services system provides web services interfaces to applications having native interfaces with different types of synchrony. The web services interfaces can have the same or different type of synchrony than the underlying application. The web services layer translates a web services request from a client to corresponding function calls to applications. Upon receiving a response from an application, the web services layer translates the response back to a web services format and forwards it to the client. A naming convention is used to define the names of the data types and operations in the web services interface corresponding with data types and functions of the application. A function prefix can be used to specify a namespace in the web services interface unique to the application. A web services namespace is assigned to tokens so that requests for asynchronous web services are diverted to a general web services routine.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates to the field of computer software, and specifically to providing interfaces between software applications. Software applications are used by businesses to perform a variety of different tasks. Often, businesses have one or more proprietary software applications to store, process, and retrieve data. Client applications can access these software applications and their data using proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs) and messaging.","Applications typically communicate data with clients using one of two types of synchrony: synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous applications, data is processed in line with client requests. Applications receive data processing requests from client applications and attempt to process them as soon as possible. Any data processing results are typically returned to the clients as soon as they are available. While its data processing requests are pending, the client typically enters a blocked or wait state. In asynchronous applications, data processing requested are queued or otherwise scheduled for processing at a later time. For example, an asynchronous application may queue all of the client requests received during a business day and begin processing these requests at night. A typical asynchronous application returns a token to a client application in response to a client request. The client application can then present this token to the asynchronous application at a later time to retrieve the data processing results.","Web services have evolved to standardize the interfaces for accessing these applications and to integrate their data. Web services applications incorporate a variety of different technologies to achieve these goals, such as XML for describing data; WSDL for describing web services application interfaces; SOAP for communicating with web services applications; and UDDI for locating web services applications. Although web services applications can be standalone applications tailored to use these web services technologies, it is often desirable to integrate older, or legacy, applications into web services systems. One way of accomplishing this is to provide a web services layer that translates an application's proprietary API to a web services interface capable of being used by any web services client application.","One difficulty with integrating applications with a web services layer is that applications may be synchronous or asynchronous. As a result, the web services layer must be able to integrate with either type of application. Furthermore, web services applications must be able to integrate two or more different applications having different types of synchrony. Additionally, web services clients may require a different type of synchrony than that provided by the underlying application. However, to maintain compatibility, a web services system may be required to maintain an application's original API for older client applications. Prior web services layers merely mirrored the underlying application API and thus cannot change the synchrony of an application's interface, cannot readily integrate applications having different types of synchrony, and cannot provide multiple application interfaces with different types of synchrony for applications only having one type of synchrony.","It is therefore desirable for a system and method to enable a web services layer to interface with both synchronous and asynchronous applications. It is further desirable for the web services system to provide either synchronous and\/or asynchronous web services interfaces to client applications regardless of the type of synchrony required of the underlying application. It is also desirable for the web services system to allow synchronous and asynchronous web services interfaces to be easily created or modified for either type of underlying application programming interface. Additionally, it is desirable for the web services layer to efficiently convert client requests between interfaces with different types of synchrony.","An embodiment of the invention includes web services system provides web services interfaces to applications having native interfaces with different types of synchrony. The web services interfaces can have the same or different type of synchrony than the underlying application. The web services layer translates a web services request from a client to corresponding function calls to applications. Upon receiving a response from an application, the web services layer translates the response back to a web services format and forwards it to the appropriate client. A naming convention is used to define the names of the data types and operations in the web services interface corresponding with data types and functions of the application. A function prefix can be used to specify a namespace in the web services interface unique to the application. A web services namespace is assigned to tokens so that requests for asynchronous web services are diverted to a general web services routine.","In an embodiment, a system for interfacing an application with at least one client includes a first interface adapted to receive a web services request from a client for an application. The first interface has a first type of synchrony. A second interface is adapted to invoke one at least one function of the application corresponding with the web services request. The second interface has a second type of synchrony. A translation layer is adapted to match the web services request with the corresponding function of the application using a namespace associated with the web services request to identify the application.","In another embodiment, the translation layer is further adapted to derive the name of the function of the application from a name associated with the web services request using a naming convention. In still another embodiment, the first and second types of synchrony can each be synchronous or asynchronous.","In an embodiment, the first type of synchrony is asynchronous and the second type of synchrony is synchronous, and the translation layer is further adapted to designate a location for a result of the corresponding function, to generate a token indicating the location, to communicate the token to the client, to store the result in the location, and to communicate the result to the client. In a further embodiment, the translation layer is further adapted to communicate the result to the client in response to receiving the token in association with a second web services request from the client. In an embodiment, the token is associated with a system namespace and the system is adapted to divert the web services request to a general processing routine of the translation layer in response to receiving a web services request associated with a token.","Another embodiment of the system includes an interface directory adapted to store a specification of at least one function of the application, wherein the specification includes a synchrony type and a web services interface generator adapted to create a web services description document from the specification. The web services description document defines a web services request corresponding to the function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","120","105","110","120","105","110","120","100"]},"A web services server  is used to process requests for web services applications, web pages or other electronic documents from user computers , , and . In an embodiment, web services applications are operated by the web services server .

In an embodiment, the application server  is one or more general purpose computers capable of executing programs or scripts in response to the user computers ,  and . The data applications and web services applications can be implemented as one or more scripts or programs written in any programming language, such as Java\u2122, C, or C++, or any scripting language, such as Perl, Python, or TCL.","The data applications on application server  and the web services applications on web services server  process input data and user computer requests and can store or retrieve data from database . Database  stores data created and used by the enterprise. In an embodiment, the database  is a relational database, such as Oracle 9i, that is adapted to store, update, and retrieve data in response to SQL format commands.","An electronic communication network  enables communication between computers , , and , web services server , application server , and database . In an embodiment, network  may further include any form of electrical or optical communication devices, including wireless and wired networks. Network  may also incorporate one or more local-area networks, such as an Ethernet network; wide-area networks, such as the Internet; and virtual networks, such as a virtual private network.","The system  is one example for executing data applications according to an embodiment of the invention.

The applications can be adapted to store, retrieve, and\/or process data. Furthermore, each application is adapted to communicate with one or more non-web services clients (omitted for clarity from ) via its own application programming interface (API). An application's API can be a standardized interface or proprietary to the application.","The web services layer  is adapted to receive client requests from the clients , , and  via the web services interface. For each client request, the web services layer  translates the request to one or more corresponding API calls to one or more of the applications , , and . Upon receiving a response from an application, if any is generated, the web services layer  translates the response back to a web services format and forwards it to the appropriate client. In an embodiment, the web services layer is implemented using Java ServiceBeans, which are similar to the Java Beans used by J2EE-compliant systems.","The web services layer  can provide both web services interfaces to clients that are both synchronous and asynchronous. As discussed below, the type of synchrony used in a web services interface provided by the web services layer  is independent of the type of synchrony used by the underlying applications.","In a synchronous web services interface, document processing is performed in line by the web services layer.  is a flowchart illustrating a method  of a web services layer according to an embodiment of the invention. At step , a web services layer receives a web services request. The web services request can include data associated with the request, for example in the form of an XML-formatted document. At step , the web services layer matches the web services request with one or more corresponding API functions of one or more applications. At step , the web services layer invokes the matching API functions, optionally including data from the web services request. In a further embodiment of this step, the web services layer translates data associated with a web services request into one or more data formats required by the matching API functions. The applications perform one or more operations as specified by the invoked API functions and optionally return data results to the web services layer. Upon receiving data results, if any, from one or more applications, in optional step  the web services layer returns these data results to the web services client. In a further embodiment, the web services layer translates data results received from one or more applications into a web services data format, such as an XML-formatted document.","In an asynchronous web services interface, document processing is performed offline by the web services layer.  is a flowchart illustrating a method  of a web services layer according to an embodiment of the invention. At step , the web services layer receives a web services request from a client. The web services request can include data associated with the request, for example in the form of an XML-formatted document. At step , the web services layer enqueues the web services request in a queue, buffer, or other data structure, which may also be used to hold other pending web services requests from one or more clients. In a further embodiment, the web services layer augments the web services request, for example by adding new data fields or formatting data, and enqueues the modified web services request. The web services layer also returns a token to the client in response to the request. The token uniquely identifies the pending web services request. In an embodiment, the token can include information such as a request ID number, a status message, and\/or a time of receipt associated with the web services request.","At some point following the receipt of the web services request, in step  the web services layer matches the web services request with one or more corresponding API functions of one or more applications. In step , the web services layer invokes the matching API functions, optionally including data from the web services request. The web services layer can invoke API functions for each pending web services request separately or can combine two or more web services requests into a batch request. Additionally, application API functions can be invoked by the web services layer according to a previously determined schedule or according to the availability of the associated application.","In a further embodiment, the web services layer translates data associated with a web services request into one or more data formats required by the matching API functions. In another embodiment of step , an application initiates the retrieval of web services requests from the web services layer and invokes the appropriate functions automatically. In this embodiment, the application can invoke API functions for each pending web services request separately or can combine two or more web services requests into a batch request. Additionally, web services requests can be retrieved by the application from the web services layer according to a previously determined schedule or according to the availability of the associated application.","The applications perform one or more operations as specified by the invoked API functions and optionally return data results, if any, to the web services layer. In optional step , the web services layer translates data results received from one or more applications into a web services data format, such as an XML-formatted document. Upon receiving data results from one or more applications, in an embodiment of step  the web services layer returns these data results to the web services client. In another embodiment of step , the web services layer stores the data results in a queue, buffer, or other data structure. The client can then present its token to the web services layer to retrieve the data results.","Upon receiving a token from a client, in an embodiment of step  the web services layer retrieves the data results from the location specified by the token. In a further embodiment, each token issued by the web services layer is associated with a unique location in the queue, buffer, or other data structure. A pending web services request is stored in the location specified by its corresponding token. Upon receiving data results from an application, the web services layer stores the data results in the same or an equivalent location as its associated web services request. An equivalent location can be a different queue, buffer, or other data structure than that used to store its associated web services request; however, the same or an equivalent token may be used in storing the data results.","In the web services system , there are two separate layers of synchrony. First, applications can have synchronous or asynchronous APIs. Second, the web services layer can provide a synchronous or asynchronous web services interface. Thus, in this embodiment, there are four different combinations of synchrony: 1) a synchronous web services interface and a synchronous application; 2) an asynchronous web services interface and a synchronous application; 3) a synchronous web services interface and an asynchronous application; and 4) an asynchronous web services interface and an asynchronous application. It should be noted that the web services system  can simultaneously support different combinations of synchrony. For example, the combination of application  and web services layer  could be a synchronous web services interface and a synchronous application, while the combination of application  and web services layer  could be an asynchronous web services interface and an asynchronous application.","In an embodiment of the invention, a synchronous web services interface and a synchronous application are integrated as follows. An application developer implements and annotates a synchronous application API. An annotation can describe various aspects of the application API, including the type of synchrony (e.g. synchronous or asynchronous) it supports.

The \u201c<portType>\u201d section defines operations corresponding with the \u201cgetPatient\u201d and \u201cputPatient\u201d functions of the application API.

For example, a naming convention can assign the same name to operations and data types in the web services layer as given to the corresponding functions and data types in the application API.

An embodiment of the web services system requires all asynchronous applications to use a generic, rather than application-specific, token data type. As discussed in detail below, this allows for the web services layer to use a different namespace for handling tokens, improving the efficiency of the web services interface when translating between different types of synchrony. The example asynchronous API includes two functions: \u201cgetPatient_Async,\u201d which requires an input of type \u201cPatientRequest\u201d and returns a result of type \u201cToken;\u201d and \u201cget_getPatient_Async,\u201d which requires and input of type \u201cToken\u201d and returns a result of type \u201cPatientInfo.\u201d","In an embodiment, application APIs are published in an interface directory, such as Oracle's Interface Repository (IRep) or a UDDI directory.

In an embodiment, the web services interface is specified using a Web Services Description Layer (WSDL) formatted document. As discussed above, this WSDL formatted document can be generated from the application API description in an IRep, UDDI, or other interface directory.","Combining an asynchronous web services interface with an asynchronous application API is wasteful. If an asynchronous web services interface and an asynchronous application API were combined, the combined interface would be doubly asynchronous. The web services layer would generate a first token in response to a web services request. The application API would forward a second token to the web services API in response to a function invocation. The web services layer would then have to associate the first and second tokens together, so that when the client presents the first token to the web services layer, the web services layer will present the second token to the application API to retrieve data results. To avoid this inefficiency, an embodiment of the web service interface generator will always present synchronous web services interface for applications having an asynchronous API.

This prefix defines a \u201cpatient\u201d namespace that is unique to the example application API. In this embodiment, a web services request includes a reference to the namespace associated with the underlying application providing the requested operations.

The web services layer further uses the naming convention to identify any function arguments and\/or data results for the API functions from the data types in the web services request. Because tokens having the \u201cToken\u201d data type are associated with the \u201cws\u201d namespace, not the \u201cpatient\u201d namespace associated with the application, the web services layer can have one general routine for handling tokens, rather than separate routines for each of a number of different asynchronous application APIs.

In an embodiment, these asynchronous web services operations, though defined in the WSDL document, are not directly implemented by either the application API or the web services layer. Because the asynchronous web services operations depend on a \u201cToken\u201d data type in the \u201cws\u201d namespace, which is associated with the web services layer rather than a specific application; asynchronous web services operations are automatically diverted to a general web services routine to resolve this reference.

When the client application presents the token to web services layer using another asynchronous web services operation request, the use of the \u201cws\u201d namespace for the token enables this request to be intercepted by the general web services routine. The general web services routine retrieves data results from the location indicated by the token and returns them to the client.
