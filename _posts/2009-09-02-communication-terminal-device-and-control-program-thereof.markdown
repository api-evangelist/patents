Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a communication terminal device having at least one housing with a structure that is changeable to a plurality of styles, and a control program thereof.","2. Description of the Related Art","In general, some of communication terminal devices such as mobile phones are usable in a plurality of regions (divided into arbitrary areas, such as continent, country, state, and prefecture). Among such communication terminal devices, some include a plurality of operation modes such as \u201cJapan mode\u201d for use in Japan and \u201coverseas mode\u201d for use in overseas, and the switching operation of these modes are performable. These modes are used, for example, for switching communication systems in accordance with a communication system of the region the communication terminal device is being used, and switching languages displayed in a display section. (refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) Publication No. 2007-189394)","In addition, communication terminal devices of various housing structures, such as a folding-type and a sliding-type, are known. In a communication terminal device such as these, a usage state (style) is changeable to various usage states according to its housing structure, and it is possible to make or receive a call in each of the usage states.","Furthermore, in some regions, in view of protecting the health of communication terminal users, the distance between the antenna and the reception speaker during a call is restricted so that the antenna generating electromagnetic waves does not come close to the ear (brain).","However, in a case where a communication terminal device that is usable in a plurality of regions is used at a travel destination or during a business trip, it is complicated and difficult for the user to research details of regulations implemented in the region (a standard value of the distance between the antenna and the reception speaker, etc.), and make or receive calls using only a style complying with the regulations.","In addition, if a company manufacturing and selling such communication terminal devices adopts a system in which a style not meeting the regulations is used for calls, they will have a problem, that is, they will be unable to sell the devices in that region.","On the other hand, if calls in a certain style are uniformly restricted (prohibited) in compliance with the strictest regulations in the world instead of allowing the user to decide the style used for calls, the number of usable styles for calls decreases (in other words, calls will not be made or received in most styles depending on circumstances), and the usability diminishes significantly.","The present invention has been conceived to solve the above-described problems, and is to appropriately control whether or not to restrict a call in a certain style in a communication terminal device that is changeable to a plurality of styles.","In order to achieve the above-described purpose, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication terminal device having at least one housing with a structure that is changeable to a plurality of styles, comprising: a communication detection means for detecting communication that is at least one of either an incoming call or an originating call; a call connection means for connecting a call in response to communication detected by the communication detection means; a style detection means for detecting a current style; a restriction judgment means for judging whether or not a call in a certain style should be restricted; and a control means for performing control such that a call connected in response to communication detected by the communication detection means is restricted based on a detection result from the style detection means and a judgment result from the restriction judgment means.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a communication terminal device having at least one housing with a structure that is changeable to a plurality of styles, comprising: a communication detection means for detecting communication that is at least one of either an incoming call or an originating call; a call connection means for connecting a call in response to communication detected by the communication detection means; a style detection means for detecting a current style; a restriction judgment means for judging whether or not a call in a certain style should be restricted; and a restriction notification means for giving at least one of either a notification indicating that a call connected in response to communication detected by the communication detection means is restricted or a notification prompting change of the certain style to another style, based on a detection result from the style detection means and a judgment result from the restriction judgment means.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon a program that is executable by a computer, comprising: communication detection process for detecting communication that is at least one of either an incoming call or an originating call; call connection process for connecting a call in response to detected communication; style detection process for detecting a current style; restriction judgment process for judging whether or not a call in a certain style should be restricted; and control process for performing control such that a call connected in response to detected communication is restricted based on a style detection result and a restriction judgment result.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon a program that is executable by a computer, comprising: communication detection process for detecting communication that is at least one of either an incoming call or an originating call;

The management device  transmits country and region identifying information to the mobile phone  in addition to managing the wireless communication network .","When the mobile phone  is connected to the Internet  via the wireless communication network , the transmission and reception of electronic mail, access to web sites, and downloading of contents such as music and movies are possible. In addition, the mobile phone  receives and acquires, for example, global positioning system (GPS) information (positional information) from a GPS satellite . Furthermore, the mobile phone  is connectable to external audio output devices such as a hands-free kit  that enables communication using a reception speaker and a microphone, and an earphone microphone  that enables communication using an earphone and a microphone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"1"},"In , a central control section  includes a central processing unit, memory, etc., and operates using power supplied from a battery section  including a secondary battery. The central processing unit controls the overall operations of the mobile phone  based on various programs stored in a storage section . The storage section  includes a program storage section M, a various information temporary storage section M, a partner information storage section M, a message storage section M, an operation mode information storage section M, etc. The program storage section M stores therein programs, various applications, and the like actualizing the embodiment based on operation procedures shown in  and , as well as various information required for the programs and applications.","The various information temporary storage section M is a work area that temporarily stores therein various information required for the operation of the mobile phone , such as flag information, timer information, and screen information to be displayed in the display section. The partner information storage section  stores therein information related to communication partners such as names, telephone numbers, electronic mail addresses, etc. which constitute an address book. The message storage section M records a message from a partner during a call, and the content of a recorded message is playable whenever necessary. The operation mode information storage section M will be described in detail hereafter.","A wireless communication section  includes a baseband section, a demultiplexing section, a wireless section having an antenna AT, etc., and exchanges data with the nearest base station A during an operation performed to actualize, for example, the call function, the electronic mail function, or the Internet connection function. When the call function is running, the wireless communication section  receives signals from the receiving side of the baseband section, and after demodulating the received baseband signals, outputs the demodulated baseband signals from a reception speaker SP as audio via an audio signal processing section . In addition, the wireless communication section  receives audio data inputted from a transmission microphone MC from the audio signal processing section , and after encoding the audio data into transmission baseband signals, sends the encoded signals to the transmitting side of the baseband section, and transmits the encoded signals from the antenna.","A GPS receiving section  (acquisition means) receives and acquires GPS information (positional information) from the GPS satellite . The central control section , for example, acquires the current location based on this GPS information from the GPS satellite  and positional information from the base station A. A display section  includes a high-definition liquid crystal display, an organic electroluminescent (EL) display, or the like, and displays text information, an image for standby display, etc. An operation section  is used to perform dial input, text input, command input, etc., and the central control section  performs processing based on input operation signals from this operation section .

A notifying section  (incoming call notification means and speaker-phone call connection means) include a sound speaker , a light-emitting diode (LED) , and a vibrating motor . When an incoming call is received, the notifying section  is driven to signal the incoming call. The notifying section  is also driven during alarm notification, etc.","A style detecting section  (style detection means) detects a style indicating the usage state of the housings. For example, magnets and magnetic sensors may be arranged in various areas of the housings, and the style detecting section  may be configured to detect the style based on a detection result from these magnetic sensors. The central control section  identifies the current style based on a detection signal from the style detection section . Here, when conducting a call in response to an originating call or an incoming call, the central control section  judges whether or not a call in a certain style should be restricted, and based on this restriction judgment result and a detection result from the style detection sensor , restricts the call, or notifies the user that the call will be restricted. When this certain style (the current style) is changed to another style, the central control section  releases the restriction on the call according to the style change. \u201cRestriction on a call\u201d refers to the prohibition or discontinuation of a call (the same applies to other embodiments described hereafter).","An external device connecting section  (connection means) is a common connection terminal such as a universal serial bus (USB) terminal, and an external audio output device such as a hands-free kit  or an earphone microphone  is connected thereto. Here, when a connection is established in response to an originating call or an incoming call with an external audio output device such as the hands-free kit  or the earphone microphone  being connected to the external device connecting section, or when a speaker phone call in which audio from a communication partner is outputted from the reception speaker SP at a loud volume is being performed, the central control section  performs control such that the call is not restricted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C"],"b":"1"},"As shown in these diagrams, the mobile phone  is a two-shaft hinge-type mobile phone device, and an operation section housing A having the operation section  and a display section housing B having the display section  are foldably and rotatably connected via a hinge section C.

The \u201coperation mode ID\u201d is, for example, a serial number identifying operation mode information. The \u201coperation mode name\u201d is a name given to an operation mode, such as \u201cJapan mode\u201d or \u201coverseas mode\u201d. The \u201csetting flag\u201d indicates a currently enabled operation mode selectively set by user operation. When a value set in the \u201csetting flag\u201d is \u201c1\u201d, the operation mode is currently enabled. In \u201coverseas mode\u201d, menus and the like are displayed in English. Also, in a case where a different communication system is being used, the communication system is switched. Note that the \u201coverseas mode\u201d may be a mode corresponding to an arbitrary region, such as \u201cUnited States mode\u201d or \u201cEurope mode\u201d.

Therefore, whether or not to restrict a call in a certain style is appropriately controlled, and advantageous practical effects are achieved. For example, the user need not be concerned about the style during a call, thereby significantly reducing the load on the user.
