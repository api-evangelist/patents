Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to wireless communications, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for providing a machine-type communication (MTC) service in a wireless communication system.","2. Related Art","A global system for mobile communication (GSM) is a radio technology which has been developed as a system for standardizing radio communication systems in Europe. A general packet radio service (GPRS) is a technique introduced to provide a packet switched data service in a circuit switched data service provided from the GSM. The GPRS constitutes a GSM\/EDGE radio access network (GERAN). A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a wireless communication system based on wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA). E-UTRAN is a wireless communication system based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).","Machine-type communication (MTC) is one type of data communication including one or more entities not requiring human interactions. That is, the MTC refers to the concept of communication based on a network such as the existing GERAN, UMTS, long-term evolution (LTE), or the like used by a machine device instead of a mobile station (MS) used by a user. The machine device used in the MTC can be called an MTC device. There are various MTC devices such as a vending machine, a machine of measuring a water level at a dam, etc. That is, the MTC is widely applicable in various fields. The MTC device has features different from that of a typical MS. Therefore, a service optimized to the MTC may differ from a service optimized to human-to-human communication. In comparison with a current mobile network communication service, the MTC can be characterized as a different market scenario, data communication, less costs and efforts, a potentially great number of MSs for communication, wide service areas, low traffic per MS, etc.","Meanwhile, the number of MTC devices is expected to be much greater than the number of legacy devices, and a probability of performing operations of the plurality of MTC devices simultaneously is high due to a feature of a typical machine-to-machine (M2M) service. Therefore, there is a possibility that a network resource is not enough, and thus a method of effectively handling a network signaling load for the MTC device is very important. Accordingly, overload control for handling an overload in core network signaling and radio access network (RAN) signaling has been recently emerged as the most important issue in the MTC.","Various methods can be proposed for the overload control. Although a method of limiting access of the MTC device in a case where a network has an unnecessary overload has been proposed up to now, a method of minimizing a signaling load may be proposed. Accordingly, a method of minimizing a signaling load by the use of simultaneous signaling by grouping the MTC devices may be proposed. This can be called MTC group handling.","There is a need to define information for effective operation control of the MTC device when the MTC group handling is performed.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for providing a machine-type communication (MTC) service in a wireless communication system.","In an aspect, a method of providing a machine-type communication (MTC) service in a wireless communication system is provided. The method include transmitting information of an MTC group, to which an MTC device belongs, to the MTC device, wherein the MTC group is a group of MTC devices that share one or more MTC features, and wherein the information of the MTC group includes an identifier (ID) of the MTC group.","The information of the MTC group may be transmitted using a system information (SI) message of a GSM\/EDGE radio access network (GERAN).","The information of the MTC group may be transmitted by being added to a Reset octets information of SI in the SI message.","The information of the MTC group may be transmitted using a paging request message.","The information of the MTC group may be transmitted by being added to 3mobile identify information of a paging request type message in the paging request message.","The information of the MTC group may be transmitted by being added to a paging request type message newly defined in the paging request message.","The information of the MTC group may include MTC access period information indicating a time range in which the MTC device in the MTC group is accessible to a network.","The information of the MTC group may include MTC access priority information indicating a network access right of the MTC group and determined based on a network load.","The information of the MTC group may include MTC offline indication period information indicating a threshold of a time for reporting network inaccessibility to the network when the MTC device in the MTC group is unable to access to the network.","The threshold may be a cycle of a periodic routing area update (RAU).","The method may further include transmitting a general packet radio service (GPRS) attach accept message and an RAU accept message to the MTC device.","The GPRS attach report message and the RAU accept message may include the information of the MTC group.","In another aspect, a network operator in a wireless communication system is provided. The network operator include a radio frequency (RF) unit configured for transmitting information of a MTC group, to which an MTC device belongs, to the MTC device, and a processor coupled to the RF unit, wherein the MTC group is a group of MTC devices that share one or more MTC features, and wherein the information of the MTC group includes an ID of the MTC group.","In another aspect, a MTC device in a wireless communication system is provided. The MTC device include a RF unit configured for receiving information of an MTC group to which an MTC device belongs, and a processor, coupled to the RF unit, configured for processing information of the MTC group, wherein the MTC group is a group of MTC devices that share one or more MTC features, and wherein the information of the MTC group includes an ID of the MTC group.","Machine-type communication (MTC) is one type of data communication including one or more entities not requiring human interactions. An MTC device denotes a mobile station (MS) installed for the MTC. The MTC device may communicate with an MTC server or another MTC device. An MTC feature denotes a network function that optimizes a network used by a machine-to-machine (M2M) device. The MTC server communicates with the network, and is an entity that communicates with the MTC device through the network. The MTC server may have an interface that is accessible by an MTC user. The MTC server provides a service for the MTC user. The MTC user uses the service provided by the MTC server. An MTC subscriber is an entity that has a contractual relation with a network operator to provide a service to one or more MTC devices. An MTC group denotes a group of MTC devices that share one or more MTC features and that belong to the same MTC subscriber. The MTC subscriber and the MTC group may be used without distinction.","Although it is described hereinafter that the network is based on a GSN\/EDGE radio access network (GERAN), the present invention is not limited thereto. Thus, various types of network may be used such as UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), evolved-UTRAN (E-UTRAN), or the like.","A mobile station (MS) denotes a typical wireless apparatus that receives a service based on the GERAN, and can be referred to as other terms such as a user equipment (UE), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a mobile terminal (MT), a wireless device, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","30","20","40","10","30","50","40","30","30","40"]},"Hereinafter, an uplink denotes communication from the MTC device  or the MS  to the GERAN , and a downlink denotes communication from the GERAN  to the MTC device  or the MS .","The aforementioned structure is for exemplary purposes only, and thus may change in various forms. For example, the MTC device  may directly communicate with another MTC without the use of the MTC server .","If the MTC device  is connected to the GERAN , a traffic load of the GERAN  may increase according to a traffic feature of the MTC device . This may cause a problem of deteriorating a service for the legacy MS . Therefore, in order to decrease the traffic load caused by the MTC device , resource allocation of the MTC device  needs to be managed flexibly according to a traffic feature and\/or current network congestion.","In the MTC, MTC devices may communicate with one or more MTC servers, or may communicate with one another.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"Since MTC devices can exist for various fields, the same feature is not required in all MTC devices. That is, system optimization does not have to be suitable to all MTC devices. An MTC feature is defined to provide a structure for optimization of different systems. Such an MTC feature may be provided on a subscription basis. In addition, the MTC feature may be activated individually.","In order for the MTC device to operate in the existing network, a service requirement different from that of the legacy MS is required. The service requirement includes a common service requirement and a specific service requirement. For the service requirement for the MTC feature, 3GPP TS 22.368 V1.1.1 (2009-11) \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Service requirements for machine-type communications; Stage 1 (Release 10)\u201d may be incorporated herein by reference.","The specific service requirement of the MTC feature includes low mobility, time controlled, time tolerant, MTC monitoring, offline indication, jamming indication, priority alarm message (PAM), extra low power consumption, secure connection, etc. Among the various service requirements, the time controlled, the time tolerant, the offline indication, the PAM, etc., will be described hereinafter in detail.","1) Time controlled: According to the time controlled feature, the MTC device can transmit or receive data only at certain pre-defined periods. Therefore, unnecessary signaling outside these pre-defined periods can be avoided. The following conditions may be required to implement the time controlled feature.\n\n","2) Time tolerant: According to the time tolerant feature, the MTC devices can delay their data transfer. The following conditions may be required to implement the time tolerant feature.\n\n","3) Offline indication: The offline indication feature can be supported for the MTC device that requires a timely notification when it is no longer possible to establish signaling between the MTC device and the network. The following conditions may be required to implement the offline indication feature.\n\n","4) PAM: The PAM feature can be supported for the MTC device that preferentially sends a priority alarm in the event of theft, vandalism, or other needs for immediate attention. The following conditions may be required to implement the PAM feature.\n\n","Meanwhile, overload control has recently been emerged as the most important issue in the discussion on the MTC. Among the specific service requirements, the time controlled feature is related to the overload control in particular. When access of the MTC device is allowed only at certain periods by the network operator and the access periods are altered as a communication window is updated by the network operator, the MTC device may initialize non-access stratum (NAS) signaling outside a new communication window. In this case, the network may deny the request of the MTC device and return a new access period in response, or may allow a first access out of the new access period and provide the access period as a new access period in a next access. In addition, when the access period is altered, information on the new access period is given to the MTC device after an NAS signaling connection is established. Therefore, in a situation where the network denies the request of the MTC device and attempts re-access during the new access period, at least first signaling connection attempt is an unnecessary attempt when the access period is altered for each MTC device. In addition, the possibility that the number of MTC devices is much greater than the number of human-to-human (H2H) devices is high, and a one-to-one connection between the network and the MTC device may cause an overload of the network.","Accordingly, instead of handling the MTC devices individually, a plurality of MTC devices may be aggregated to be handled as a group, and in this manner, a network load can be decreased. Each MTC device belongs to the MTC group. Each group is uniquely identified in a GERAN. The MTC devices having the same access period in the MTC group are distributed in a full access period in order to decrease a signaling load. To satisfy this, each MTC device may randomize its access period within the full access period.","Hereinafter, a method of providing an MTC service by using MTC group handling is proposed. More specifically, the method of providing the MTC service by using a system information (SI) message or a paging request message will be proposed. The MTC service that can be provided using the MTC group handling may include the time tolerant feature, the offline indication feature, the PAM feature, and the like, in addition to the aforementioned time controlled feature. The SI of the current GERAN includes only information related to operation control of the legacy MS, and information that satisfies a service requirement in regard to the MTC device is not defined yet. In addition, the paging request message of the current GERAN includes only information related to a circuit, packet, or multimedia broadcast and multicast service (MBMS) of the legacy MS, and does not include information related to the MTC device. Therefore, the present invention proposes a method in which information necessary for MTC group handling is newly defined in the SI or paging request message.","First, a method of providing an MTC service by using the SI message will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In step S, a network operator transmits a general packet radio service (GPRS) attach accept message and a routing area update (RAU) accept message to an MTC device. The GPRS attach accept message is a message received by the MTC device from a network while attempting a GPRS attachment to the network. The RAU accept message is a message received by the MTC device from the network while attempting an RAU to the network. The GPRS attach accept message and the RAU accept message include MTC group information. More particularly, the MTC group information may include an MTC access period field, an MTC access priority field, and an MTC offline indication period of an MTC group to which the MTC device belongs.

If the value of the MTC access priority field is \u2018001\u2019, only an access of PAM transmission is allowed. If the value of the MTC access priority field is \u2018100\u2019, a network access is allowed for all MTC devices within the MTC group. That is, the network can control the overall network load by occasionally monitoring the network traffic. If the network load is great, the value of the MTC access priority field may be decreased to avoid the network access of the MTC device as much as possible. If the network load is small, the value of the MTC access priority field may be increased to dynamically control the network load.","3) MTC offline indication period field (octet 7): This field is used to implement the offline indication feature among the MTC service requirements. The MTC offline indication period field defines a threshold of offline indication to a periodic location registration period for each MTC group. To satisfy the offline indication feature, when it is no longer possible to communicate with the network, the MTC device has to report this to the network within a specific time period. In the present invention, the threshold of the offline indication is set to a periodic RAU cycle to minimize a change of the legacy GERAN system. The periodic RAU cycle is a reference time value when the legacy MS reports to the network that the MS operates normally. By using the reference time value, the network can know that the MS operates normally. Likewise, the threshold value of the offline indication of the MTC device may be set to the periodic RAU cycle. Accordingly, the network can determine whether the MTC device is offline within a time not exceeding the threshold value.","The MTC offline indication period field may consist of a unit field and a timer value field. A threshold of actual offline indication can be calculated by considering a unit defined in the unit field and a time defined in the timer value field.

indicates an ID of an MTC group or an MTC subscriber to which the changed MTC information is applied. Unlike the GPRS attach process or the RAU process in which a corresponding message is directly transferred by using the specific MTC information, the MTC information is applied for each MTC group in the present invention. Thus, a field indicating the ID of the MTC group or the MTC subscriber is newly added. An MTC device belonging to each MTC group receives an MTC group ID by using the paging request message, and thus can know access period information corresponding to the ID of the MTC group, access priority information based on a network load, periodic location registration information, etc.","3) MTC_ACCESS_PERIOD: This field is the same as the MTC access period field described in step S of .","4) MTC_ACCESS_PRIORITY: This field is the same as the MTC access priority field described in step S of .","5) MTC_IND_PERIOD: This field is the same as the MTC offline indication period field described in step S of .","Meanwhile, instead of adding the new field for the MTC device to the paging request type message as described above, the MTC service may be provided by defining a new type of paging request message. Since the existing paging request message is preferentially used for paging of the legacy MS, there is a restriction in that the new field for the MTC device is also added to a field selectively transmitted such as the mobile identify  of the paging request type message. In addition, since only information on one MTC group can be included, there is a need to define a new type of paging request message in order to include information on more MTC groups.
