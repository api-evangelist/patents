{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to machine-to-machine communications and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for providing privacy management for machine-to-machine communications.","Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is gaining popularity and can be supported by various types of networks, e.g., a cellular access network. Traditionally, privacy has not been a concern for M2M communications.","In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for processing a request from a server of a machine-to-machine service provider. For example, the method receives the request from the server of the machine-to-machine service provider to communicate with a machine-to-machine device, determines whether to authorize the request based upon a policy in a privacy database, and enables communications between the server of the machine-to-machine service provider and the machine-to-machine device if the request is authorized based upon the policy.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.","The present disclosure broadly discloses a method, non-transitory computer readable medium and apparatus for providing privacy management for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. In one embodiment, a mechanism based upon privacy policy settings of device users and service providers is provided to protect M2M communications. Examples of M2M communications include an appliance, e.g., a refrigerator, sending a request to a grocery store to buy additional groceries, a grocery store requesting inventory data of a user's refrigerator, a meter (e.g., an energy meter, a gas meter, a water meter and the like) sending data to a utility company, a sensor (e.g., a motion sensor, a temperature sensor, an Infrared sensor, and the like) sending a communication to a security company and the like. Traditionally, privacy has not been a concern for M2M communications","However, the increasing popularity of M2M devices may lead to concerns regarding privacy for M2M communications, especially some communications that may be privileged. For example, as M2M communications become more sophisticated, M2M communications may include privileged or personal information such as account numbers, credit card information, payment information, address information, telephone numbers, user preferences, user behavior patterns, and the like. In addition, M2M communications may be used to monitor user activity without permission from the user. The present disclosure resolves these privacy issues by providing privacy management for M2M communications to control which M2M service providers may access the M2M devices, when they may access the M2M devices, and how they may access the M2M devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"In one embodiment, the network  may comprise a core network , one or more access networks  and , one or more M2M devices ,  and  and one or more M2M service providers  and  (having respective hardware servers (e.g., computer servers) , and  that can effect M2M communications with the M2M devices ,  and ). In one embodiment, the core network  may include an edge\/application programming interface (API) gateway , a M2M privacy gateway , and one or more databases  and . In one embodiment, the one or more databases  and  may include a privacy database for M2M service providers  and a privacy database for M2M devices . Although  illustrates three M2M devices ,  and  and two M2M service providers  and , any number of M2M devices or M2M service providers may be deployed.","In one embodiment, the edge\/API gateway  provides an interface for allowing the M2M service providers  and  to interact with the M2M privacy gateway . In one embodiment, the edge\/API gateway  sits at an edge of the core network . The edge\/API gateway  may have access security functions and control access to the M2M privacy gateway . In other words, the M2M service providers  and  do not have direct access to the M2M privacy gateway . This will provide a greater security for the M2M privacy gateway .","In one embodiment, the M2M privacy gateway  controls the manner as to how the M2M service providers  and  will have access to one of the devices ,  or . For example, requests for communications received from the M2M service provider  to access the M2M device  may be routed to the M2M privacy gateway  via the edge\/API gateway . The M2M privacy gateway  may then check with the privacy database for M2M service providers  and\/or the privacy database for the M2M devices  to determine whether the request should be granted.","In one embodiment, the edge\/API gateway  and the M2M privacy gateway  may be implemented in hardware as a specialized computer server. In one embodiment, the computer server may be similar to the general purpose computer illustrated in  and discussed in further detail below.","In one embodiment, the privacy database for M2M service providers  and\/or the privacy database for the M2M devices  may include respective policies that are referenced by the M2M privacy gateway  to determine whether a request from the M2M service providers  and\/or  should be granted. In one embodiment, a privacy policy stored in the privacy database for M2M service providers  may be defined by a communications network service provider of the core network . In another embodiment, the privacy policy may be defined based upon parameters associated with a service level agreement negotiated between the communications network service provider and a particular M2M service provider.","In one embodiment, the communications network service provider defined privacy policy may define which M2M service providers are authorized to communicate over the communications network  (e.g., via predefined list of approved M2M service providers), when the M2M service provider may communicate with a M2M device, how much bandwidth is allocated to the M2M service provider for communications, what types of communications or actions may be performed by the M2M service provider, and the like.","For example, the communications network service provider may only allow M2M service providers that subscribe to services from the communications network service provider to access the communications network . In another example, only M2M service providers that have a particular security clearance may be authorized to access the communications network . In yet another example, the communications network service provider may simply predefine a list of M2M service providers that are allowed to access the communications network . The above are only examples and should not be considered as limiting of the present disclosure.","The communications network service provider may also set how much bandwidth will be allocated to the M2M service provider at various predetermined times. For example, the communications network service provider may provide more bandwidth during off peak hours and less bandwidth during peak hours. In one embodiment, the communications network service provider may not provide any bandwidth during certain times of the day if there is scheduled maintenance in the communications network . The above are only examples and should not be considered as limiting of the present disclosure.","In one embodiment, the communications network service provider may only allow the M2M service provider to obtain information from the M2M devices, but not allow the M2M service provider to upload any data to the M2M devices for security reasons. For example, the communications network service provider may define what types of communications may be exchanged. For example, the communications network service provider may specify that communications involving personal data may not be exchanged. The above are only examples and should not be considered as limiting of the present disclosure.","In one embodiment, the privacy policy defined by the communications network service provider is dynamically negotiable. In other words, the privacy policy may be modified \u201con the fly\u201d for a brief time period after the privacy policy is initially defined by the communications network service provider to satisfy a temporary need of the M2M service provider. For example, during a peak shopping season, the M2M service provider  may request to have additional bandwidth for communications to the M2M device  for a temporary time frame, e.g., one week, that is outside of the privacy policy defined by the communications network service provider. If additional bandwidth is available, the communications network service provider may adjust the privacy policy to provide additional bandwidth temporarily on a dynamic basis. In one embodiment, the M2M service provider  may have to pay an additional fee for the change.","In one embodiment, a privacy policy stored in the privacy database for M2M devices  may be defined by a user of an M2M device. For example, a user of the M2M device  may define a privacy policy for the M2M device  that is stored in the privacy database for M2M devices .","In one embodiment, the user defined privacy policy may define which M2M service providers are authorized to communicate with the M2M device (e.g., via a predefined list of approved M2M service providers), when the M2M service provider may communicate with the M2M device, how much bandwidth is allocated to the M2M service provider for communications, what types of communications or actions may be performed by the M2M service provider, and the like.","For example, a user may only allow M2M service providers for which they are subscribed to services to access his or her M2M device(s). In other words, the user may not allow unsolicited communications from M2M service providers. In another example, the user may only allow access to his or her M2M device(s) between 6 PM and midnight while they are home so that the user may monitor the activity and communications between the M2M service provider and their M2M device. In another example, the user may limit the number of times for a predefined time period that the M2M service provider may access the M2M device. In another example, the user may only allow a certain percentage of available bandwidth to be used by a particular M2M service provider such that the M2M device may have bandwidth to access other M2M service providers or execute other tasks.","The user may define which M2M devices (e.g., each user may have a plurality of M2M devices) that the M2M service provider may have access to, what types of activities may be performed on each of the M2M devices listed, and a limit as to the allowed activities. For example, the user may specify that the M2M service provider may only request inventory data from a refrigerator, but not initiate any new orders for groceries. In another example, the user may allow the M2M service provider to only initiate new orders for perishable foods, such as milk and eggs, and limit the orders to no more than two per item. The above are only examples and should not be considered as limiting to the present disclosure.","Although two databases  and  are illustrated in , it should be noted that any number of databases may be deployed. In one embodiment, a single database may be deployed to store both the privacy policy defined by the communications network service provider and the privacy policy defined by the user.","In one embodiment, the M2M devices or machines ,  and  may be any type of machine capable of communicating over the communications network . For example, the machines ,  and  may be any type of smart hardware devices or appliances such a refrigerator, a freezer, a set top box, a modem, a terminal adaptor, a sensor, and the like. It should be noted that the present disclosure is not limited to any particular type of machines.","In one embodiment, the M2M service provider  and  may be any type of M2M service provider. For example, the M2M service provider  and  may be a grocery store, a utility company, a repair shop for appliances, a department store, and the like.","In one embodiment, the access networks  and  may be any type of access network such as a cellular network, an LTE network, a wireless network, a Wi-Fi network, a publicly switched telephone network (PSTN), an Internet Protocol (IP) network, and the like. The access networks  and  may be operated by the same operator or by different operators. The access networks  and  and the core network  may include additional network elements that are not disclosed. For example, the access networks  and  and the core network  may also include border elements, gateways, routers, switches, call control elements, firewalls, various application servers, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","108","110","112","114","204"]},"The flow of communications is illustrated by arrows , , , ,  and . For example, arrows  and  illustrate communications related to a request received from the M2M service providers  to the M2M privacy gateway . The arrows  and  illustrate communications related to a response to the request sent from the M2M privacy gateway  back to the M2M service providers . The arrows  and  illustrate communications between the M2M privacy gateway  and the privacy database for M2M service providers  and the privacy database for M2M devices , respectively.","As illustrated by , in one embodiment, the requests to communicate with the M2M devices  flow from the M2M service providers to the edge\/API gateway . The edge\/API gateway  may then parse the request and send a policy request to the M2M privacy gateway  for access permission.","Upon receiving the policy request, the M2M privacy gateway  may reference the privacy database for M2M service providers  and the privacy database for M2M devices  to determine if the particular M2M service provider is an authorized M2M service provider and what manner of access is allowed for that particular M2M service provider.","If the request is granted, the M2M privacy gateway  may then respond to the edge\/API gateway  with detailed instructions including one or more parameters defining what type of access, how much access and when the M2M service provider may access the M2M device. Subsequently, one of the M2M service providers  may establish communications with one of the M2M devices , as represented by the two way arrow  for authorized data flow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 6"],"b":["300","300","110"]},"The method  begins at step . At step , the method  receives a request from an M2M service provider to communicate with an M2M device. For example, the request may be from a utility company to access a meter at a user's home to determine how much electricity the user has consumed.","In one embodiment, the request may be received indirectly from the M2M service provider, for example, via an edge\/API gateway. Using the edge\/API gateway may provide more security by preventing the M2M service provider from having direct access to the M2M privacy gateway .","At step , the method  determines whether to authorize the request based upon a policy in a privacy database. In one embodiment, two separate policies in two different databases may be checked to determine whether or not to authorize the request. For example, one of the privacy policies may be a communications network service provider defined privacy policy stored in a privacy database for M2M service providers. Another one of the privacy policies may be a user defined privacy policy stored in a privacy database for M2M devices.","For example, the M2M service provider may attempt to communicate with a M2M device at 2:00 AM and need a particular amount of bandwidth. The M2M privacy gateway may check the privacy policy in the privacy database for M2M service providers to find that the M2M service provider is an authorized M2M service provider and that the particular amount of bandwidth at 2:00 AM is allowed within the communications network service provider defined privacy policy.","The M2M privacy gateway may also check the privacy policy in the privacy database for M2M devices. The user defined privacy policy may allow the M2M service provider to access the M2M device associated with the user at 2:00 AM.","If the request is not authorized at step , the method  proceeds to step . At step , the method  provides a reason as to why the request was denied back to the requestor. The method  proceeds to step , where the method  determines if the requestor provided additional information. For example, additional information may be requested to rectify the reason the request was denied.","If no additional information is provided, then the method  may proceed back to step  to receive another request. If additional information was provided by the requestor that addressed the reason for the denial, then the method  may proceed to step .","Referring back to step , if the request is authorized, then the method  proceeds to step . At step , the method  provides or enables communications (e.g., establishing a communication session) between the M2M service provider and the M2M device if the request is authorized based upon the policy. Using the above example discussed at step , the request would be authorized as the request does not violate any of the privacy policies. As a result, a communications path between the M2M service provider and the M2M device may be established and the M2M service provider may be permitted to transmit and receive data from the M2M device.","At step , the method  enforces the policy during the communications. In other words, any communication or transaction between the M2M service provider and the M2M device is monitored to ensure that they are in compliance with the policy. The method  ends at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 6"],"b":["400","400","110"]},"The method  begins at step . At step , the method  provides a predefined template to a user for a privacy policy for a M2M device. For example, the network service provider may have an initial privacy policy having default settings that show the user of the M2M device which parameters may be configured or modified. For example, some parameters may be initially populated on behalf of the user, e.g., based on government regulations and\/or suggestions made by a network service provider.","At step , the method  receives one or more initial parameters. For example, the user of the M2M device may provide inputs as to how he or she would like each one of the parameters in the privacy policy to be set.","At step , the method  determines if there are additional parameters that will be received from the user. If there are additional parameters, the method goes back to step  to receive them from the user. If there are no additional parameters, then all of the parameters are received and the method  proceeds to step .","At step , the method  finalizes the privacy policy for the M2M device. For example, the predefined template may be modified in accordance with the received initial parameters.","At step , the method  stores the privacy policy in the privacy database for M2M device. At optional step , the method  may configure the M2M device based upon the stored privacy policy for M2M devices.
