Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry, a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper, insole, spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired. Further, the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly, the article of footwear can be customized by an individual wearer or specially configured for a select target population in order to optimize desired performance criteria. Moreover, the present invention teaches a method of making an article of footwear, and also a way of doing both retail and Internet business.","Conventional athletic footwear typically include an outsole made of a thermoset rubber compound which is affixed by adhesive to a midsole made of ethylene vinyl acetate or polyurethane foam material which is in turn affixed by adhesive to an upper which is constructed with the use of stitching and adhesives. Because of the difficulty, time, and expense associated with renewing any portion of conventional articles of footwear, the vast majority are generally discarded at the end of their service life. This service life can be characterized as having a short duration when a wearer frequently engages in athletic activity such as distance running or tennis. In tennis, portions of the outsole can be substantially abraded within a few hours, and in distance running the foam midsole can become compacted and degrade by taking a compression set within one hundred miles of use. The resulting deformation of the foam midsole can degrade cushioning and footwear stability, thus contribute to the origin of athletic injuries. Accordingly, many competitive distance runners who routinely cover one hundred miles in a week's time will discard their athletic footwear after logging three hundred miles in order to avoid possible injury.","Even though the service life of conventional athletic footwear is relatively short, the price of athletic footwear has steadily increased over the last three decades, and some models now bear retail prices over one hundred and twenty dollars. However, some of this increase in retail prices has been design and fashion driven as opposed to reflecting actual value added. In any case, conventional athletic footwear remain disposable commodities and few are being recycled. The method of manufacture and disposal of conventional athletic footwear is therefore relatively inefficient and not environmentally friendly. In contrast with conventional athletic footwear, the present invention teaches an article of footwear that can include a spring element which does not take a compression set or similarly degrade, thus the physical and mechanical properties afforded by a preferred article of footwear can remain substantially the same over a useful service life which can be several times longer than that of conventional articles of footwear. The present invention teaches an article of footwear which represents an investment, as opposed to a disposable commodity. Like an automobile, the preferred article of footwear includes components which can be easily renewed and replaced, but also components which can be varied and customized, as desired.","Published examples of devices and means for selectively and removably affixing various components of an article of footwear include, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The physical and mechanical properties of conventional athletic footwear are relatively fixed generic qualities. However, the body weight or mass and characteristic running technique of different individuals having the same footwear size can vary greatly. Often, the stiffness in compression of the foam material used in the midsole of athletic shoes can be too soft for individuals who employ more forceful movements, or who have greater body mass than an average wearer. Accordingly, conventional articles of athletic footwear do not provide optimal performance characteristics for individual wearers.","In contrast, the present invention permits a wearer to customize a preferred article of footwear. For example, the length, width, girth, and configuration of the upper, as provided by various last options, or by two or three dimensional modeling and footwear design equipment including computer software and data storage and retrieval systems, or by two or three dimensional measurement devices such as scanners, as well as the type of footwear construction and design of the upper can be selected by the customer or wearer. Further, the physical and mechanical properties of the article of footwear can be selected and changed as desired in order to optimize desired performance characteristics given various performance criteria or environmental conditions. For example, the configuration and geometry of the article of footwear, and the stiffness of the spring elements can be customized, as desired. In addition, the ability to easily remove, renew, and recycle the outsole portions of the preferred article of footwear can render the use of softer materials having enhanced shock and vibration dampening characteristics, but perhaps diminished wear properties, viable from a practical standpoint. Moreover, the outsole portion of the preferred article of footwear can be selected from a variety of options with regards to configuration, materials, and function.","The physical and mechanical properties associated with an article of footwear of the present invention can provide enhanced cushioning, stability, and running economy relative to conventional articles of footwear. The spring to dampening ratio of conventional articles of footwear is commonly in the range between 40-60 percent, whereas the preferred article of footwear can provide a higher spring to dampening ratio, thus greater mechanical efficiency and running economy. In this regard, the article of footwear can include a spring element that underlies the forefoot area which can store energy during the latter portion of the stance phase and early portion of the propulsive phase of the running cycle, and then release this energy during the latter portion of the propulsive phase, thus facilitating improved running economy. It is believed the resulting improvement in running performance can approximate one second over four hundred meters when running at four minutes\/mile pace.","The preferred article of footwear can provide differential stiffness in the rearfoot area so as to reduce both the rate and magnitude of pronation, or alternately, the rate and magnitude of supination experienced by an individual wearer, thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury. Likewise, the preferred article of footwear can provide differential stiffness in the midfoot and forefoot areas so as to reduce both the rate and magnitude of inward and\/or outward rotation of the foot, thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury. The preferred spring elements can also provide a stable platform which can prevent or reduce the amount of deformation caused by point loads, thus avoid conditions which can be associated with injury.","The use of relatively soft outsole materials having improved shock and vibration dampening characteristics can enhance cushioning effects. Further, in conventional articles of footwear, the shock and vibration generated during rearfoot impact is commonly transmitted most rapidly to a wearer through that portion of the outsole and midsole which has greatest stiffness, and this is normally a portion of the sole which is proximate the heel of the wearer that undergoes the greatest deflection and deformation. However, in the present invention a void space can exist beneath the heel of a wearer and the ground engaging portion of the outsole. Some of the shock and vibration generated during the rearfoot impact of an outsole with the ground support surface must then travel a greater distance through the outsole and inferior spring element in order to be transmitted to the superior spring element and a wearer. In addition, in the present invention, a posterior spacer which can serve as a shock and vibration isolator, and also vibration decay time modifiers can be used to decrease the magnitude of the shock and vibration transmitted to the wearer of a preferred article of footwear.","There are many published examples of attempts to introduce functional spring elements into articles of footwear, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Relatively few of these attempts have resulted in functional articles of footwear which have met with commercial success. The limitations of some of the prior art has concerned the difficulty of meeting the potentially competing criteria associated with cushioning and footwear stability. In other cases, the manufacturing costs of making prior art articles of footwear including spring elements have been prohibitive. Articles of footwear including discrete foam cushioning elements which have been commercialized include the Nike \u201cSHOX,\u201d the Adidas \u201ca3\u201d which is believed to be taught in European Patent Application EP 1 240 838 A1, the Avia \u201cECS Cushioning\u201d and Avia \u201cECS Stability,\u201d and also the Dada \u201cSoleSonic Force.\u201d","The spring element and various other novel structures taught in the present invention can be used in a wide assortment of articles of footwear including but not limited to those used for running, walking, basketball, tennis, volleyball, cross-training, baseball, football, golf, soccer, cycling, sandals, hiking boots, and army boots. The present invention teaches an article of footwear which can provide a wearer with improved cushioning and stability, running economy, and an extended service life while reducing the risks of injury normally associated with footwear degradation. The preferred article of footwear provides a wearer with the ability to customize the fit, but also the physical and mechanical properties and performance of the article of footwear. Moreover, the preferred article of footwear is economical and environmentally friendly to both manufacture and recycle.","The present invention also teaches articles of footwear including means for adjusting the provided foot shape, length, width, and girth. For example, spring elements, anterior outsole elements, stability elements, and uppers having different configurations, and also alternate positions for selectively affixing various portions of an upper can be used to adjust and customize the fit of an article of footwear for an individual wearer. The upper can also include elastic or elongation means for adjusting the width, girth, and foot shape. The components of the article of footwear possibly including but not limited to the upper, insole, cushioning means such as a spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired. Further, the relative configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot areas of the article of footwear can be readily modified and adjusted. Accordingly, the article of footwear can be configured and customized for a wearer or a select target population in order to optimize performance criteria, as desired.","Moreover, the present invention teaches a method of making articles of footwear, and way of doing both retail and Internet business. For example, the anatomical features, configuration, and dimensions of a given wearer's foot and any other special needs, requirements, or preferences can be recorded by direct communication, observation, and measurement in a retail or medical setting, or alternately, by a wearer or other individual within their home or other remote site, and this data can be used to generate information and intelligence relating to making a custom article of footwear. Conventional measuring or reproduction means such as rulers, measuring tapes, Brannock devices, two or three dimensional scanners, pressure sensors, infrared thermography; stereolithography, photographs, photocopies, FAX, e-mail, cameras, images, tracings, video, television, computers and computer screens, software, data storage and retrieval systems, templates, molds, models, and patterns can be used to help determine and make selections relating to an individual's foot shape, length, width, girth, and the like.","Teachings which have been published or that otherwise constitute public information regarding the conduct of Internet or retail business include: U.S. Pat.

In fact, it is possible to assemble a custom article of footwear according to the present invention in less than one minute using a single fastener. This can be accomplished at the point of purchase or service center which can be located in a retail store, medical facility, or remote manufacturing environment. Accordingly, similar to the rapid delivery eyewear service centers and retail stores which presently exist, a customer can now also be provided with a custom article of footwear within minutes. Alternately, Wand when an individual's data is received from a remote site at the Website or other address of a company which practices the present invention, and transmitted to a manufacturing or assembly center, a custom article of footwear can be made and possibly delivered to an individual's home or other designated address by same day or overnight service, as desired.","The present invention teaches a method of making a custom article of footwear. The article of footwear taught in the present invention can include a spring element that can provide improved cushioning, stability, and running economy. Unlike the conventional foam materials presently being used by the footwear industry, a preferred spring element is not substantially subject to compression set degradation and can provide a relatively long service life. The components of the article of footwear including the upper, insole, heel counter, spring element, and sole can be selected from a range of options, and can be easily removed and replaced, as desired.","A preferred article of footwear can include an anterior side, a posterior side, a medial side, a lateral side, a superior side, an inferior side, a longitudinal axis, a transverse axis, an upper, a sole, cushioning means such as a spring element comprising a superior spring element and an inferior spring element, and fastening means such as a mechanical fastener including male and female parts or self-adhesive means. The superior spring element can extend substantially between the posterior side and the anterior side of the article of footwear and be substantially positioned within the upper in order to secure the upper to the superior spring element. The inferior spring element and the sole can be substantially positioned inferiorly and externally with respect to the upper, and the superior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the inferior spring element by at least one fastener. The article of footwear can further include an upper having a plurality of openings on the inferior side in the forefoot area. Further, an anterior outsole element including a backing can be at least partially positioned within the upper. However, the substantial portion of the anterior outsole element including the ground engaging portion and a plurality of traction members can project through the openings in the upper, thus the substantial portion of the anterior outsole element can nevertheless be substantially positioned inferiorly and externally relative to the upper. In an alternate embodiment, the article of footwear can further include an upper having a plurality of openings on the inferior side, but also on a portion of the medial side, lateral side, and anterior side in the forefoot area, and the anterior outsole element can then include a backing having an elevated profile and traction members that extend upwards about a portion of the medial side, lateral side, and anterior side of the upper. In an alternate embodiment, the anterior portion of the outsole can be removably affixed to the external side of the upper with the use of other fastening means.","The article of footwear can possibly further include an insole, a stability element, a sole including an anterior outsole element, a middle outsole element, and a posterior outsole element having a backing, and also closure means such as an elastic upper, shoe laces, a strap including VELCRO\u00ae hook and pile, or a strap including openings and eyelets for receiving conventional shoe laces. A strap can encompass the medial side, lateral side, inferior side, and superior side of the upper. An alternate embodiment of a strap can also include a portion that encompasses the posterior side of the upper. In any case, a strap can be selectively removable and replaceable. In an alternate embodiment, the upper can be over-lasted, that is, over-sized in order to accommodate a removable and replaceable midsole cushioning element which can be inserted into the upper between the top portion of the insole and inferior side of upper.","The insole can include an elevated profile about the medial side, lateral side, anterior side, and posterior side for protecting a wearer's foot from contact with an elevated portion of an anterior outsole element, stability element, side support, or heel counter. The insole can include a heel pad, toe pad, bottom, and side portions having different thickness for selectively adjusting the effective length and width of the article of footwear. The inferior side of the upper can include an opening in the rearfoot area for positioning a removable and replaceable cushioning element such as a fluid-filled bladder or a resilient foam material. The superior side of an insole can then include a window in the rearfoot area for viewing a removable and replaceable cushioning element such as a fluid-filled bladder or a resilient foam material. A fluid-filled bladder can be positioned between a superior spring element, posterior spring element, or external heel counter and the inferior spring element.","The inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element and can project rearward and downward therefrom forming a V-shape. The superior spring element can further include an anterior spring element and a posterior spring element affixed together in functional relation, and the inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the posterior spring element. The anterior spring element and posterior spring element can be affixed together in an overlapping relationship. The anterior spring element can further include a projection, and the posterior spring element can include a recess for accommodating the anterior spring element. The superior spring element can have a configuration generally corresponding to the bottom net of the last of an article of footwear and can either be generally planar, or curved. At least a portion of the superior spring element can be curved to mate with the anatomy of a wearer. Further, a superior spring element can possibly also include a side stabilizer or a heel counter. The heel counter can be integral to the superior spring element, or alternately be a separate component. The upper can be trapped and secured in functional relation between an external heel counter and an overlaying superior spring element. An advantageous thickness for an external heel counter for a wearer having a given body weight can be approximately 2.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100-140 pounds; 2.5 mm for a body weight in the range between 140-180 pounds, and 3.0 mm for a body weight in the range between 180-220 pounds.","An anterior spring element can have a curved shape and incorporate toe spring. The amount of toe spring incorporated in an anterior spring element can be in the range between 0-40 mm, and in particular, in the range between 10-30 mm. A substantial portion of the anterior spring element can extend anterior of 50 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side of the upper, whereas a substantial portion of the inferior spring element can extend within 50 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side of the upper.","The inferior spring element can include a longitudinal axis, a transverse axis, and a flexural axis. The flexural axis can be consistent with the transverse axis. An inferior spring element including a flexural axis consistent with the transverse axis can have a symmetrical configuration on both the medial side and lateral side. Alternately, an inferior spring element including a flexural axis consistent with the transverse axis can have an asymmetrical configuration, and can have greater concavity downwards adjacent the transverse axis on the medial side than on the lateral side. Alternately, the inferior spring element can include a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 10-50 degrees. In particular, given an average individual wearer who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker, it can be advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees in footwear intended for walking or running. Accordingly, the length of the effective lever arm on the medial side of the inferior spring element will be shorter than that on the lateral side, that is, as measured between the posterior side of the inferior spring element and the location of the flexural axis on each respective side. One way of expressing the length differential of the effective lever arms of the inferior spring element on the medial side versus the lateral side is with a ratio. In this regard, it can be advantageous for effecting rearfoot stability that the ratio of the length of the effective lever arms on the lateral side relative to those on the medial side be in the range between 1\/1 to 2\/1, and in particular, in the range between 1.25\/1 to 2\/1, and preferably in the range between 1.25\/1 to 1.75\/1.","Further, in a men's size 9 article of footwear, the posteriormost position of the flexural axis on the medial side can be in the range between 1-6 inches from the posterior side of the upper, and in particular, in the range between 2-4 inches from the posterior side of the upper. An inferior spring element including a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis can have a symmetrical configuration on both the medial side and lateral side. Alternately, an inferior spring element including a flexural axis deviated from the transverse axis can have an asymmetrical configuration, and can have greater concavity downwards adjacent the transverse axis on the medial side than on the lateral side. Whether the flexural axis be consistent with the transverse axis or be deviated therefrom, an inferior spring element having a symmetrical configuration on the medial side and lateral side can include an anterior portion extending between its anterior side and an anterior tangent point, a middle portion including an anterior curve extending between the anterior tangent point and a posterior tangent point, and a posterior portion extending between the posterior tangent point and the posterior side of said inferior spring element. It can be advantageous that the anterior curve be configured to have a fitted symmetrical radius of curvature. Moreover, the posterior portion of the inferior spring element can be inclined, or include a posterior curve.","The inferior spring element can attain maximum separation from the superior spring element at a position anterior of the posterior side of the inferior spring element, and can substantially maintain the maximum separation between that position and the posterior side of the inferior spring element. Alternately, the inferior spring element can attain maximum separation from the superior spring element at a position anterior of the posterior side of the inferior spring element, and the separation can then be decreased between that position and the posterior side of the inferior spring element. The inferior spring element can be concave downwards near the anterior side of the inferior spring element, but can be concave upwards or convex near the posterior side of the inferior spring element. The inferior spring element can be made in a laminate configuration or structure. The inferior spring element can be made in a tapered configuration or structure. An inferior spring element can exhibit less stiffness in compression on the lateral side relative to the medial side, and it can be advantageous for walking and running activity that the differential stiffness be in the range between two-to-three to one.","The spring element can be made of a fiber composite material, and an unidirectional carbon fiber composite material including a toughened epoxy can be preferred for use. Alternately, the spring element can be made of a metal material such as spring steel or titanium. The spring element is preferably made of a material having spring characteristics such that the material is capable of storing and returning at least 70 percent of the mechanical energy imparted thereto. In this regard, a preferred fiber composite material, or alternately, a metal material such as spring steel or spring grade titanium is capable of storing and returning at least 90 percent of the energy imparted thereto when their mechanical characteristics are measured using test method ASTM 790.","The superior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 0.5-10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include an anterior spring element or forefoot area having a thickness in the range between 0.5-2.5 mm, and in particular, in the range between 1.0-1.75 mm. The superior spring element can also include a posterior spring element having a thickness in the range between 1-10 mm. When the superior spring element, or posterior spring element has a three dimensional shape in the rearfoot area including an integral heel counter or side counters, the superior spring element or posterior spring element can generally have a thickness in the range between 1-5 mm. Further, a spring element can include areas having different thickness, notches, slits, or openings which can serve to produce differential stiffness characteristics when the spring element is loaded. In this regard, the superior spring element or anterior spring element in the forefoot area can include at least one longitudinal notch or slit, and also a plurality of transverse notches or slits on the medial side and lateral side for influencing the flexural modulus and torsional characteristics in a desired manner. It can sometimes be advantageous for the transverse notches or slits on the lateral side to extend for a greater distance relative to those present on the medial side, and also for a pair of opposing notches or slits on the medial side and lateral side to approximately correspond the position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints, that is, be positioned between 60-70 percent of the length of the upper as measured from the posterior side. The spring element can include different types, orientations, configurations, and numbers of fiber composite layers in different areas in order to achieve differential stiffness when the spring element is loaded. Accordingly, the flexural modulus or stiffness exhibited by a spring element in the rearfoot area, midfoot area, forefoot area, and also that exhibited about any axis can be engineered, as desired. In this regard, it can be advantageous to create a region of reduced stiffness, that is, a forefoot strike zone, on the lateral side in the area approximately corresponding to the location of a wearer's metatarsal-phalangeal joints.","The inferior spring element can provide deflection in the range between 5-50 mm. For example, deflection approximately in the range between 8-15 mm could be selected by some wearers for a training shoe intended for use in running at a relatively fast pace, a racing flat, or a track spike. Alternately, deflection approximately in the rage between 15-50 mm could be selected by some wearers for a training shoe intended for use in running at a relatively slow pace. The inferior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 3-10 mm. The superior spring element can have a thickness in the range between 0.5-10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include a forefoot area or anterior spring element having a thickness in the range between 0.5-2.5 mm, and in particular, in the range between 1.0-1.75 mm. Generally, regarding a men's size 9 article of footwear, an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches, the width in the range between 75-85 mm, the vertical elevation is in the range between 10-18 mm, and the thickness is in the range between 4-5.5 mm at the anterior side  and in the range between approximately 2-3 mm at the posterior side. Generally, an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature for use in a men's size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches, an advantageous radius of curvature with respect to the superior side of the posterior curve is in the range between 7 and 11 inches, and an advantageous radius of curvature regarding the inferior side of the posterior portion is in the range between 4-6 inches. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running, given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown, it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees.","In particular, an inferior spring element for possible use with a men's size 9 article of footwear can have an overall length of 5.25 inches, and the anterior portion can measure 1.125 inches, the middle portion can measure 2.5 inches, and the posterior portion can measure 1.625 inches. Alternately, the overall length can be reduced by 0.25 inch by subtracting 0.125 inches from both the anterior portion and the posterior portion. Further, the inferior spring element can have a maximum width in the range between 75-80 mm, and the flexural axis can be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees. The anterior portion of the inferior spring element can also project downwards at a three degree angle towards the anterior side. This can facilitate attaining an advantageous geometry and fit with respect to a superior spring element and also an external heel counter. The fitted symmetrical radius of curvature of the anterior curve can have a radius of 2.606 inches, whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side of the posterior curve can be 9.0 inches, and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side of the posterior portion can be 5.138 inches. The vertical elevation of the inferior spring element can be 0.6299 inches or 16 mm, and the thickness of an inferior spring element for a wearer having a body weight of approximately 140-160 pounds can be 0.189 inches or 4.8 mm at the anterior side and tapering to only 0.1083 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side. If and when desired, the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10-18 mm, something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature associated with the anterior curve to also change, but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight, running technique, or characteristic running speeds, and also for use in many different activities. Given an inferior spring element having the dimensions recited in this paragraph, the following general guidelines regarding the desired thickness for a wearer could apply: a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100-120 pounds; 4.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 120-140 pounds; 4.5 mm for a wearer in the range between 140-160 pounds; 4.75 mm for a wearer in the range between 160-180 pounds; 5.0 mm for a wearer in the range between 180-200 pounds; and 5.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 200-220 pounds.","The article of footwear can further include a posterior spacer between the superior spring element or posterior spring element and the inferior spring element. Further, an anterior spacer can be used between a superior spring element and an anterior spring element, or alternately between an anterior spring element and an inferior anterior spring element. An anterior spacer or posterior spacer can also possibly be positioned between the anterior spring element and the posterior spring element. An anterior spacer and a posterior spacer can have a wedge or sloped shape. An anterior spacer can have a gently rounded shape near the posterior side. The shape of a posterior spacer and an anterior spacer can be used to modify the configuration and performance of a spring element and that of an associated article of footwear.","In an alternate embodiment of an article of footwear, the superior spring element can extend substantially between the posterior side and anterior side of the upper. Again the superior spring element can consist of a posterior spring element and an anterior spring element configured in an overlapping relationship. The inferior spring element can be affixed in functional relation to the superior spring element or posterior spring element, thus form a spring element having a v-shape in the rearfoot area. Further, an inferior anterior spring element can be positioned and affixed in function relation to an anterior spacer and the superior spring element or anterior spring element, thus forming a spring element having a v-shape in the forefoot area as well. The inferior anterior spring element can include at least one longitudinal notch or slit, and also at least one transverse notch or slit for influencing the flexural and torsional characteristics in a desired manner.

Threaded nuts and bolts, rivets, pop-rivets, push-rivets, snap rivets, snaps, hooks, clips, mating male and female structures, quarter turn fasteners, bayonet style fasteners, quick-release fasteners, and the like, can be used as a fastener. Preferred metals for use in a fastener can include aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, zinc coated steel, and other metals or treatments that are resistant to substantial degradation caused normal oxidation and corrosion. Thermoplastic snap-rivets  and push rivets  made and distributed by Richco, Inc. of Chicago, Ill. are shown in . A large variety of fasteners are made, e.g., by Penn Engineering & Manufacturing Corporation of Danboro, Pa., Avibank Manufacturing, Inc. of Burbank, Calif., Atlas Engineering of Kent, Ohio, Stayfast Products, Inc. of Fort Mill, S.C., DFS International Inc. of Orlando, Fla., and Fairchild, Inc. of Simi Valley, Calif. Shown in  is a standard full hex blind threaded insert  made by Atlas Engineering, Inc., and similar configurations are also available from Stayfast Products, Inc. Armand Savoie of MacNeill Engineering of Marlborough, Mass. is the inventor of so-called \u201cQ-lock\u201d fasteners taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,805, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,332,281, and these patents are hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Fasteners having a threaded portion which further include a portion that can be collapsed or crimped in order to grip a portion of a structure into which they are being fitted are known in the prior art. When a thermoplastic material is used, a fastener can possibly be formed or affixed in position with the use of heat and pressure, welding, adhesive, polymerization, and then later be removed by destructive method or again with the use of heat and pressure. For example, the distal end of a male portion of a fastener can be melted and formed into a rivet like shape with the use of heat and pressure. When a thermoset material is used, a fastener can possibly be formed or affixed in position with the use of heat and pressure, polymerization, vulcanization, and later be removed with the use of heat and pressure, or destructive method. Contact adhesives and light cure adhesives can also be used to create or affix a fastener.","Preferably, a selectively removable and replaceable mechanical fastener  can be used, thus enabling some or all of the components of a spring element  and an article of footwear  to be removed and replaced, as desired. A fastener can include Allen head or star drive mechanical mating configurations for use with a like installation and removal tool. If desired, a fastener can also be torque limited so as to tighten to an appropriate and desired maximum torque value. So-called \u201csmart bolts\u201d developed for NASA which are known by the tradename INTELLIGENT FASTENER\u00ae and made by Ultrafast, Inc. of Malvern, Pa. can be used. Fasteners known in the prior art having a male portion including threads that are coated with a thermoplastic or other locking material, or alternately, a fastener having a female portion including a thermoplastic or other locking material, can also be used in order to prevent loosening during use. Moreover, fasteners including mating male and female parts which can be easily and quickly coupled and released by so-called quarter turn, bayonet, or quick-release structures and methods can be advantageous for use. In this regard, the thickness of a superior spring element , inferior spring element , and upper  can be known, thus standardized or graded for various sizes of an article of footwear. Accordingly, it is possible to design and engineer fasteners  including mating male and female parts that can be easily and quickly coupled and released by so-called quarter turn, bayonet, or quick-release structures and methods. Moreover, alternate inferior spring elements  having different thickness within an engineered and preferred selected range can be accommodated and used, as desired.","Again, it can be readily understood that other conventional means can be used to affix the upper  in functional relation to the spring element  and outsole , such as VELCRO\u00ae hook and pile, or other mechanical engagement means and devices. For example, as shown in , a portion of the posterior outsole element  can slip over and trap a portion of the inferior spring element  and then be secured with fasteners . Further, at least one hook  can extend from the backing  of anterior outsole element  and engage a portion of the upper  or the superior spring element  as a portion of the outsole  is attached to a preferred article of footwear .","Again, published examples of devices and means for selectively and removably affixing various components of an article of footwear include, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The upper  can be made of a plurality of conventional materials known in the footwear art such as leather, natural or synthetic textile materials, paper or cardboard, stitching, adhesive, thermoplastic material, foam material, and natural or synthetic rubber. Since the various components of a preferred article of footwear  can be easily removed and replaced, a wearer can select a custom upper  having a desired size, shape, design, construction and functional capability. The article of footwear  can also include means for customizing the shape, width, and fit of the upper  such as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,729,912, U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,146, U.S. Pat. No. 6,442,874, B1, WO 99\/24498 A2, and the like, the recited patents and patent application hereby being incorporated by reference herein. Further, the present invention teaches novel devices and methods for customizing the width, girth, and last or foot shape of the preferred article of footwear, as discussed in greater detail below. Moreover, the article of footwear  can include a custom insole  using light cure material as taught in the applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,632,057, and also U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,502 entitled \u201cMethod of Making Custom Insoles and Point of Purchase Display, both of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.","The upper  can be made with the use conventional patterns, materials, and means known in the prior art. Accordingly an upper  can include a natural or synthetic textile material  such as a woven or knit fabric, and the like. It can be readily understood that the textile material  can consist of a three dimensional textile material, a multi-layer textile material, water resistant or waterproof materials, shape memory textile materials, or stretchable and elastic textile materials, and the like. The textile material  included in the upper  can also be formed by three dimensional or circular knitting methods known in the prior art such as in the manufacture of socks, and a suitable pattern for use can be derived or cut therefrom.","Alternately, the textile material  forming at least a portion of the upper  can be made in the origami-like patterns taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,997 granted to Dieter, U.S. Pat. No. 5,729,918 granted to Smets, U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,679 B1 granted to Chenevert, patent applications WO 02\/13641 A1 by Long and WO 02\/23641 A1 by Kilgore et al., and the like, all of these patents and patent applications being assigned to Nike, Inc. Further, the upper  can be made in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,251 granted to Litchfield et al., and also those of U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al., and the like, both of these patents being assigned to Reebok International, Ltd. In addition, generally similar to the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,712 granted to Iglesias et al., the upper  can include a textile material that is overmolded with a thermoplastic material. All of the patents and patent applications recited in this paragraph are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","As shown in , the textile material  can be impregnated or overmolded with a plastic material  forming a stability element , e.g., a relatively rigid thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyester, or polyethylene, or alternatively, an elastomeric thermoplastic material such as those made by Advanced Elastomer Systems that are recited elsewhere herein, a foam thermoplastic material, a rubber material, or a polyurethane material. The textile material  can be impregnated or overmolded while positioned in a substantially planar two dimensional orientation as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al., or alternately, while positioned in a relatively complex three dimensional shape on a footwear last , mold, or the like. For example, stability element shown in  can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper .","Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper  as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al., and also U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., and the like, both patents being assigned to Nike, Inc., these recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. The textile material  can possibly be impregnated or overmolded with the use of a spray, dipping, or roller application generally similar to that known in the screen printing prior art. If the plastic material  is of the thermoplastic variety, it can then be caused to cool and take a set.","Alternately, a thermoset material which is used to impregnate or overmold the textile material  can be caused to cross-link by conventional means known in the prior art. As taught in the applicant's U.S. Ser. No. 09\/570,171, filed May 11, 2000, light-cure materials which can be caused to set and cure upon exposure to a specific range of light frequency and wavelength having adequate power can also be used. When the inferior side  of the upper  includes a plurality of openings  for accommodating the passage of a plurality of traction members  associated with the anterior outsole element  therethrough, it can be advantageous that the inferior side  of the upper  in the forefoot area , and possibly also that the midfoot area  and rearfoot area  be impregnated or overmolded by plastic material , or other suitable material. Alternately, the inferior side  of the upper  can be otherwise reinforced in order to enhance its structural integrity.","As shown in , the upper  can be made in general accordance with the so-called Huarache style commercialized by Nike, Inc. The textile material  can have resilient and elastic qualities, or alternatively, a rubber, neoprene foam rubber, polyurethane, or other material can be used in those areas of the vamp  and quarters  in which the location of a textile material  is indicated. In this regard, the textile material , or alternately, a substitute material having substantial elastic characteristics can extend into the collar area  in order to create a so-called fit sleeve and facilitate entry and exit of a wearer's foot. Accordingly, the upper  can in some footwear embodiments solely constitute the required and sufficient closure means for retaining a wearer's foot therein. Further, the upper  can include removable quarters including openings  and eyestays  for accommodating laces , straps , or other conventional closure means.","The upper  can also be made of new thermoplastic materials which have not yet been used to make articles of footwear that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. For example, textile materials made from polylactic acid polymers derived from corn or other vegetation known by the tradename NATUREWORKS\u00ae fibers are presently under development and being commercialized by Cargill Dow Polymers LLC of Minneapolis, Minn. in cooperation with the Kanebo Corporation which is associated with the Itochu Corporation of Osaka, Japan. The physical and mechanical properties of fibers and thermoplastic materials derived from polylactic acid generally compare favorably with many existing fibers and thermoplastic materials, but unlike the vast majority of the synthetic fibers and thermoplastic materials presently being used in the manufacture of articles of footwear, those derived from polylactic acid are capable of substantially biodegrading when buried in the soil over a period of two to three years. Moreover, other biodegradable and environmentally-friendly plastic materials and fibers can also be suitable for use.","As shown in , the anterior outsole element  and posterior outsole element  can include a backing  portion. The outsole  can be firmly secured in function relation to the upper  and spring element  with the use of at least one fastener . In an alternate embodiment, it is possible to configure the posterior outsole portion  such that a portion can slip over and trap the posterior side of the inferior spring element , and the posterior outsole element  can then be secured with at least one fastener  near the anterior side of the posterior outsole element  and inferior spring element . Since the posterior outsole element  consists of a resilient elastomer such as natural or synthetic rubber, during footstrike and the early portion of the braking phase of the gait cycle, the posterior outsole element  can become somewhat elongated and distended along the longitudinal or anterior to posterior axis and to lesser degree the medial to lateral or transverse axis, and this can further contribute to reducing the shock and vibration generated upon impact, as the forces and direction of loading during footstrike and the braking phase have not only vertical or z axis, but also x and y axis components.","The ground engaging portion  of the outsole  can be made of a natural or synthetic rubber material such as nitrile or styrene butadiene rubber, a thermoplastic material, an elastomer such as polyurethane, a hybrid thermoplastic rubber, and the like. Further, these materials can possibly be suitable for use when blown or foamed. Suitable hybrid thermoplastic and rubber combinations include dynamically vulcanized alloys which can be injection molded such as those produced by Advanced Elastomer Systems, 338 Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44311, e.g., SANTOPRENE\u00ae, VYRAM\u00ae, GEOLAST\u00ae, TREFSIN\u00ae, VISTAFLEX\u00ae, GEOLAST\u00ae, DYTROL XL\u00ae, and taught in the following patents, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,631, U.S. Pat. No. 5,779,968, U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,033, U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,029, U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,625, U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,660, U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,962, U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,798, U.S. Pat.

KRATON\u00ae thermoplastic elastomers made by the Shell Oil Corporation, DYNAFLEX\u00ae thermoplastic elastomers, and VERSAFLEX\u00ae thermoplastic elastomer alloys distributed by GLS Corporation of McHenry, Ill. can also be suitable for use. Further, the material compositions taught in both U.S. Pat. No. 6,342,544 B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,367,167 granted to Krstic et al. and assigned to Nike, Inc. can also be suitable for use, and these patents are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The backing  portion of the outsole  can be made of a formulation of a thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyurethane, or SANTOPRENE\u00ae that is relatively firm relative to the ground engaging portion  of the outsole . For example, a polyurethane or SANTOPRENE\u00ae material having a hardness between 35-75 Durometer Asker C could be used on the ground engaging portion  of the outsole , whereas a polyurethane or SANTOPRENE\u00ae material having a hardness between 75-100 Durometer on the Shore A or D scales could be used to make the backing  of outsole . A polyurethane backing  can be bonded to a polyurethane ground engaging portion  of outsole  or other material, or alternately, a SANTOPRENE\u00ae backing can be bonded to a SANTOPRENE\u00ae ground engaging portion  of outsole . This can be accomplished by dual injection molding, or over-molding of the like materials.","One advantage when using homogenous materials for the two portions of the outsole  concerns the affinity of like materials for effectively bonding together. Another advantage in using homogenous materials for the two portions of the outsole  concerns the \u201cgreen\u201d or environmentally friendly and recyclable nature of the component at the end of its service life. It is possible for the spent homogenous outsole  component including the backing  and ground engaging portion  to be recycled by the footwear manufacturer or by a third party, e.g., the outsole  can be re-ground into pieces and be thermoformed to make a portion of a new outsole  component. Further, the relative absence of adhesives in the manufacture of the outsole components and article of footwear taught in the present invention also makes for a \u201cgreen\u201d or environmentally friendly product. In contrast, conventional articles of footwear are commonly manufactured with the extensive use of adhesives for bonding a foam midsole to an upper and outsole. These adhesives are commonly non-environmentally friendly and can pose health hazards, and the resulting article of footwear cannot be so easily disassembled or recycled at the end of its service life. Moreover, the process associated with making conventional foam materials in making a midsole, and the blowing agents used therein, can be non-environmentally friendly and relatively energy inefficient as compared with conventional injection molding of thermoplastic materials, or the use of light cure materials and methods, as taught in the applicant's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/862,598 entitled \u201cMethod of Making a Light Cure Component For Articles of Footwear,\u201d hereby incorporated by reference herein. For example, instead of using large presses imparting both heat and pressure upon compression molds for effecting the cure of a midsole or outsole component over perhaps a seven minute cycle time, injection molding equipment and light cure technology can be used to reduce the cycle times to perhaps fractions of a second with relative energy efficiency and little or no waste product in a relatively environmentally friendly manufacturing environment. Accordingly, manufacturing can be located in the United States, or otherwise closer to the intended market.","It is also possible for heterogeneous materials to be used in making the backing  and ground engaging portion  of the outsole . For example, Advanced Elastomer Systems has developed a formulation of SANTOPRENE\u00ae which is capable of bonding to nylon. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,954, U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,057, U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,268, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,906,872 granted to Lyden et al. and assigned to Nike, Inc. which relate to chemical bonding of rubber to plastic materials in articles of footwear, all of these patents hereby incorporated by reference herein. Further, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the backing  can simultaneously comprise at least a portion of the spring element  of the article of footwear , as shown in . In addition, the outsole  can also include desired lines of flexion . The following patents and some of the prior art recited therein contain teachings with respect to lines of flexion  in articles of footwear such as grooves, and the like: U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,973, U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,184, U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,964, U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,954, U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,057, U.S. Pat. No. 4,562,651, U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,949, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,007, all of these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The use of a relatively soft elastomeric material having good dampening characteristics on the ground engaging portion  of an outsole  can contribute to enhanced attenuation of the shock and vibration generated by impact events. Relatively soft elastomeric materials having good dampening characteristics tend to have inferior abrasion and wear characteristics, and this can pose a practical limitation on their use in conventional articles of footwear constructed with the use of adhesives having non-renewable outsoles. However, the use of relatively soft elastomeric materials having good dampening characteristics does not pose a practical problem with respect to the preferred article of footwear  taught in the present application since the outsole  can be easily renewed and replaced. Accordingly, the preferred article of footwear  can provide a wearer with enhanced cushioning effects relative to many conventional articles of footwear.","The spring element  can be made of a resilient material such as metal, and in particular, spring steel or titanium. Titanium is widely used in the aerospace and automotive industries in part due to its excellent strength to weight ratio and durability. Titanium materials are available in three general categories depending upon their alloy content: alpha, that is, a material having a close packed hexagonal atomic arrangement, alpha\/beta, and beta, that is, a material having a body centered cubic atomic arrangement, The preferred titanium alloys for use in a spring element  are those which can be characterized either as alpha\/beta, or beta. Examples of suitable alpha\/beta, or beta titanium alloys include \u201c15-3\u201d and \u201c6-4\u201d which can be obtained from TIMET\u00ae, Titanium Metals Corporation, of 403 Ryder Avenue, Vallejo, Calif. 94590, and also from President Titanium of Hanson, Mass. 02341.","The spring element  can alternately be made of a thermoplastic material, or alternately, a preferred fiber composite material. Glass fiber, aramid or KEVLAR\u00ae fiber, boron fiber, or carbon fiber composite materials can be used individually, or in partial or complete combination. Glass fiber composite materials are generally available at a cost of about $5.00 per pound, whereas carbon fiber materials are generally available at a cost of about $8.00-$14.00 per pound. Glass fiber composite materials generally exhibit a lower modulus of elasticity or flexural modulus, thus less stiffness in bending as compared with carbon fiber materials, but can generally withstand more severe bending without breaking. However, the higher modulus of elasticity of carbon fiber composite materials can provide greater stiffness in bending, a higher spring rate, and reduced weight relative to glass fiber composite materials exhibiting like flexural modulus. Blends or combinations of glass fiber and carbon fiber materials are commonly known as hybrid composite materials.","Carbon fiber composite materials can be impregnated or coated with thermoplastic materials or thermoset materials. The modulus of elasticity or flexural modulus of some finished thermoplastic carbon fiber composite materials can be lower than that of some thermoset carbon fiber composite materials. For example, a sample of thermoplastic carbon fiber composite material having a relatively broad weave can have a flexural modulus in the range between 10-12 Msi, and in the range between 5-6 Msi in a finished part, whereas a \u201cstandard modulus\u201d grade of thermoset impregnated uni-directional carbon fiber composite material can have a flexural modulus in the range of 33 Msi, and in the range between 18-20 Msi in a finished part. Also available are \u201cintermediate modulus\u201d carbon fiber composite materials at approximately 40 Msi, and \u201chigh modulus\u201d carbon fiber composite materials having a flexural modulus greater than 50 Msi and possibly as high as approximately 100 Msi. Accordingly, in order the achieve a desired flexural modulus or stiffness value, a thicker and heavier part made of a thermoplastic carbon fiber composite material can be required, that is, relative to a thermoset impregnated uni-directional carbon fiber composite material.","Impregnated carbon fiber composite materials are commonly known as \u201cprepreg\u201d materials. Such materials are available in roll and sheet form and in various grades, sizes, types of fibers, and fiber configurations, but also with various resin components. Various known fiber configurations include so-called woven, plain, basket, twill, satin, uni-directional, multi-directional, and hybrids. Prepreg carbon fiber composite materials are available having various flexural modulus, and generally, the higher is the modulus then the more expensive is the material. A standard modulus uni-directional prepreg peel-ply toughened carbon fiber composite material such as C2000, 33550, 150 GSM, having a 35 percent resin content, or alternately, \u201cquick-cure\u201d 2510 made by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. of San Diego, Calif. 97121 can be suitable for use. This prepreg material can have a thickness of 0.025 mm or 0.01 inches including the peel-ply backing and in the range between 0.13-0.15 mm or 0.005 inches without. It is therefore relatively easy to predict the number of layers required in order to made a part having a known target thickness, but one should also allow for a nearly 10 percent reduction in thickness of the part due to shrinkage during the curing process. The cost in bulk of a suitable unidirectional 33 Msi thermoset standard modulus carbon fiber composite material having a weight of approximately 150-300 grams per square meter made and distributed by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. is presently approximately in the range between $8.00 and $9.00 per pound, and one pound yields approximately one square meter of material.","The required thickness of a spring element  and any possible sub-components can vary considerably depending upon, e.g., the materials being used, the construction and processing methods being used, the overall design and configuration of a particular part, the fastener(s) possibly being used, the intended activity or particular application, and also the weight, biomechanical technique, and characteristic running speed or velocity of an individual wearer. Nevertheless, the following information can serve as a broad guideline both when making and selecting a spring element  and any possible sub-components for use in an article of footwear. The superior spring element can have a thickness approximately in the range between 0.5-10.0 mm. The superior spring element can include an anterior spring element having a thickness approximately in the range between 0.5-2.5 mm, and in particular, in the range between 1.0-1.75 mm. It can be advantageous that the anterior spring element  maintain a thickness that is not much less than 1 mm in order to well distribute point loads, enhance robustness of the part, and to provide a noticeable performance enhancement. The superior spring element or posterior spring element can have a thickness in the rearfoot area approximately in the range between 1-10 mm, but when formed in a three dimensional cupped shape including a heel counter; can have a lesser thickness in the range between 1-5 mm. The inferior spring element can have a thickness approximately in the range between 3-10 mm.","The following more specific guidelines relate to an article of footwear including a spring element having relatively short lever arms which can provide approximately 10 mm of deflection generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing . The required thickness of the superior spring element  or anterior spring element  in the forefoot area  of an article of footwear intended for use in running when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni-directional prepreg carbon fiber composite material is then normally approximately in the range between 1.0-1.25 mm for an individual weighing 100-140 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds, approximately in the range between 1.25-1.50 mm for an individual weighing 140-180 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds, and in the range between 1.5-1.75 mm for an individual weighing 180-220 pounds running at slow to moderate speeds. When running at higher speeds, e.g., on a track and field surface, individuals generally prefer a thicker and stiffer plate relative to that selected for use at slow or moderate speeds. The perceived improvement in running economy can be on the order of at least one second over four hundred meters which corresponds to approximately two to three percent improvement in aerobic ability. The superior spring element  or anterior spring element  can store energy when loaded during the latter portion of the stance phase and early portion of the propulsive phase of the running cycle, and then release that energy during the latter portion of the propulsive phase. A spring element can provide not only deflection for attenuating shock and vibration associated with impact events, but can also provide a relatively high level of mechanical efficiency by possibly storing and returning in excess of 70 percent of the energy imparted thereto. Accordingly, the spring to dampening ratio of the material of which the spring element is made can be expressed as being equal to or greater than 70\/30 percent. In fact, a preferred unidirectional carbon fiber composite material or spring titanium material can return in excess of 90 percent of the energy imparted thereto during the materials test associated with test method ASTM 790. In contrast, most conventional prior art athletic footwear soles including foam midsoles and rubber outsoles have a spring to dampening ratio somewhere between 40 and 60 percent. The preferred article of footwear  can then afford a wearer with greater mechanical efficiency and running economy than most conventional prior art athletic footwear.","Further, unlike the conventional foam materials used in prior art articles of footwear such as ethylene vinyl acetate which can become compacted and take a compression set, the spring elements  used in the present invention are not substantially subject to compression set degradation due to repetitive loading. The degradation of conventional foam materials can cause injury to a wearer, as when a broken down midsole results in a wearer's foot being unnaturally placed in a supinated or pronated position as opposed to a more neutral position, or when a compacted foam midsole in the forefoot area  causes a wearer's metatarsals to drop out of normal orientation or to unnaturally converge. Further, the quality of cushioning provided by conventional foam materials such as ethylene vinyl acetate or polyurethane rapidly degrades as the material becomes compacted and takes a compression set. In contrast, the spring elements  taught in the present invention do not substantially suffer from these forms of degradation, rather provide substantially the same performance and geometric integrity after extended use as when new. Given an article of footwear including removable and replaceable components, in the event of a fatigue or catastrophic failure of a spring element, the damaged part can simply be removed and replaced.","Again, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing , the required thickness of a superior spring element , or posterior spring element  for the rearfoot area  of an article of footwear intended for running use when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni-directional prepreg carbon fiber composite material is approximately in the range between 2.0-5.0 mm, and in particular, is approximately in the range between 2.75-3.25 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 100-140 pounds, approximately in the range between 3.25-3.75 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 140-180 pounds, and approximately in the range between 3.75-4.25 for an individual weighing between 180-220 pounds. It can be advantageous for the sake of robustness that the thickness of the inferior spring element  be at least equal to or greater than that of the corresponding superior spring element  or posterior spring element  in the rearfoot area , as the inferior spring element  has a more complex curved shape and is subject to direct repetitive impact events. Accordingly, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing , the required thickness of the inferior spring element  when using standard modulus 33 Msi thermoset uni-directional prepreg carbon fiber material is approximately in the range between 2.0-5.0 mm, and in particular, is approximately in the range between 2.75-3.25 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 100-140 pounds, approximately in the range between 3.25-3.75 mm for an individual weighing in the range between 140-180 pounds, and approximately in the range between 3.75-4.25 for an individual weighing between 180-220 pounds.","Different individuals can have different preferences with respect to the thickness and stiffness of various spring element components regardless of their body weight, and this can be due to their having different running styles or different habitual average running speeds. During normal walking activity the magnitude of the loads generated are commonly in the range between one to two body weights, whereas during normal running activity the magnitude of the loads generated are commonly in the range between two to three body weights. Accordingly, the flexural modulus of a spring element for use in an article of footwear primarily intended for walking can be reduced relative to an article of footwear intended for running, thus the thickness and\/or stiffness of the spring element can be reduced. During a lateral movement and jumping sport such as basketball, the loads generated can be much higher and in the range between 2.5 and 10 body weights. Accordingly, greater stiffness and\/or thickness can be required of a spring element  and any sub-component parts. As result it can sometimes be advantageous to introduce an additional cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a fluid-filled bladder and\/or a foam material between a superior spring element  or posterior spring element  and an inferior spring element , and also between a superior spring element  or anterior spring element ., and an anterior spring element ..","When making spring elements using carbon fiber composite material, it is important to recognize that relatively slight variations in the configuration or design can have both substantial and subtle effects upon the exhibited stiffness, service life, and overall performance of the component. For example, consider the long bow, versus the recurve bow configuration used in archery. These two shapes provide different stiffness characteristics when the bow is being drawn, and also when the arrow is released. For example, when the inferior spring element  is made in a sharper curved shape it can exhibit greater stiffness and a different stress\/strain curve, that is, relative to when it is made in a more gentle curved configuration.","Again, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in drawing , the following constitutes an approximate guideline regarding the required thickness and stiffness of a superior spring element  or anterior spring element  made of standard modulus 33 Msi unidirectional carbon fiber composite material for use in the forefoot area  of a running shoe given a wearer's body weight and common perception. Again, much depends on an individual's body weight, running technique, speed, and the intended application. For example, an individual having a given body weight who happened to be a heavy heel striker would likely select an anterior spring element  having the next highest stiffness value. Likewise, an individual who habitually runs at a faster pace than another individual having a similar body weight and running technique might also select an anterior spring element  having the next highest stiffness value. Nevertheless, Table 1 shown below can provide guidance to runners making selections regarding a suitable spring element .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0756","num":"0755"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Runner's Body Weight (pounds)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thickness (mm)","100","120","140","160","180","200","220"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[".75","S","VS","VS","VS",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["1.0","M","S","S","S","VS","VS"]},{"entry":["1.25","H","M","M","M","S","S","VS"]},{"entry":["1.50","VH","H","H","M","M","M","S"]},{"entry":["1.75",{},"VH","VH","H","H","M","M"]},{"entry":["2.0",{},{},{},"VH","VH","H","H"]},{"entry":["2.25",{},{},{},{},{},"VH","VH"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Key to Abbreviations"},{"entry":"VS = Very Soft = Suitable For Long Slow Distance (LSD) Running Slower than 7:00 minutes\/mile."},{"entry":"S = Soft = Suitable For Running 6:00 minutes\/mile."},{"entry":"M = Medium = Suitable For Running sub-5:00 minutes\/mile."},{"entry":"H = Hard = Suitable For Running sub-60 seconds\/400 meters."},{"entry":"VH = Very Hard = Suitable For Short Sprints, and Jumps."}]}}]}}},"Again, regarding the rearfoot area  of the superior spring element  or posterior spring element , the thickness of the part can vary considerably depending upon whether a relatively flat configuration, or alternately, a cupped shape anatomical configuration which possibly includes a curved midfoot area  including longitudinal and transverse arch support, medial and lateral side stabilizers, or a heel counter  is incorporated therein. Given a three dimensional cupped or anatomical shaped posterior spring element  including a heel counter, and an individual weighing between 100-200 pounds the minimum thickness required to achieve the desired robustness is believed to be approximately in the range between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. However, when a fastener  is used to affix the inferior spring element  to the superior spring element  or posterior spring element , even with the presence of a large washer or flange, a fastener  can still impart a relatively large point load, thus a minimum thickness of 2.5 mm in the area near the position of the fastener  can be required in order to ensure robustness.","Regardless, the upwardly extending portions of a posterior spring element  forming a heel counter  and also the anterior edge of the part can generally be made to have a thickness in the range between 0.5-2.0 mm. It is believed to be advantageous for the purposes of commercialization to over-engineer the part with respect to load tolerance and robustness and to make the inferior side of the posterior portion of a superior spring element  or a posterior spring element , in not more than three or four different thickness: e.g., approximately 2.0 mm for the range between 100-140 pounds body weight; approximately 2.5 mm for the range between 140-180 pounds body weight; and, approximately 3.0 mm for the range between 180-220 pounds body weight.","It can be helpful to provide guidance regarding the stiffness characteristics associated with various portions of a spring element , e.g., S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard), VH (very hard) UH (ultra hard), or to otherwise identify suitable performance criteria by specific event, player position, and the like. One way of expressing the relationship between superior spring elements  or posterior spring elements  having a three dimension cupped shape including a heel counter which are made in one of three different thickness in the rearfoot area , and the possible use of five different alternate thickness in the forefoot area  of the superior spring element  or an anterior spring element  in a running shoe suitable for use in track and field is shown in Table 2 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0760","num":"0759"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Runner's Weight &","Runner's Weight &"]},{"entry":["Posterior Spring","Anterior Spring"]},{"entry":["Thickness in","Thickness in"]},{"entry":["Rearfoot Area","Forefoot Area (mm)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(3D Part) (mm)","1.0","1.25","1.5","1.75","2.0"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["2.0 (100-140 lbs)","LSD","5k-10k","800\/1500","Sprints",{}]},{"entry":["2.5 (140-180 lbs)","LSD","5k-10K","800\/1500","Sprints","Sprints"]},{"entry":["3.0 (180-220 lbs)","LSD","LSD","5k-10k","800\/1500","Sprints"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Regarding the amount of deflection in the rearfoot area  associated with the superior spring element  or posterior spring element , if and when the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  is made in a three dimensional cupped shape possibly including a heel counter , then not much deflection will take place, e.g., normally something in the range between 0-2.0 mm. It is important to recognize that if the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  is made in a three dimensional cupped shape including a heel counter that only permits something in the range between 0-2.0 mm of deflection, then this can place a larger load and requirement for deflection upon the inferior spring element . Accordingly, all things being equal, the inferior spring element  could then have to be made thicker and\/or stiffer. Nevertheless, if and when the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  is substantially flat and planar, and the inferior spring element  is curved, but both parts have about the same thickness, then the inferior spring element  will generally still exhibit the most deflection. However, the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  will also account for a portion of the total deflection. In the abstract, if the parts are engineered so as to permit 10 mm of total deflection, then the inferior spring will normally account for at least half; and perhaps nearer to three quarters of the deflection, before the two parts would meet and \u201cbottom out\u201d the mechanical system. Here, a great deal depends upon the design and manufacture of the parts, the application, and the wearer's body weight and technique.","Given a running shoe used in a typical linear running motion, even 4-6 mm of deflection of the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  in the rearfoot area  will not pose a biomechanical or stability problem provided that the article of footwear is designed properly. It should be noted that the fat pad on the human heel is known to commonly deflect approximately in the range between 8-10 mm, and also the longitudinal arches of many individuals are known to commonly deflect in the range between 2-6 mm. Moreover, in existing conventional articles of footwear including foam midsoles equal to or greater than 4-6 mm of deflection commonly takes place on both the top and bottom sides of the sole during a rearfoot impact event.","A question can be raised concerning the possibility of 4-6 mm of deflection taking place at the lateral rear corner, that is, deflection having a torsional component. If a line 80 mm in length is drawn representing the width of the bottom net of the outsole  of a typical running shoe sole in the rearfoot area , and then a line 6 mm high is drawn perpendicular to and intersecting the line having a length of 80 mm at the end on the lateral side, the resulting angle as measured from the opposite side of the line having a length of 80 mm is only approximately five degrees. This does not degrade stability since the feet of most individuals are normally supinated approximately 7-8 degrees upon footstrike when running barefoot on grass, and substantial rotative movements commonly take place between the rearfoot and forefoot areas of an individual's foot during running activity. Further, the average runner commonly pronates approximately 7-8 degrees when running barefoot on grass, but double that magnitude of pronation can be associated with running in conventional prior art articles of footwear including foam midsoles. However, both the rate and magnitude of pronation can often be reduced by using an article of footwear made according to the present invention, that is, relative to a conventional prior art article of footwear. Moreover, it can possibly be advantageous to engineer an article of footwear including a spring element  intended for running so as to approximate the magnitude of supination upon footstrike, and also the subsequent magnitude and rate of pronation commonly observed when individuals run barefoot on natural grass. Nevertheless, it can be readily understood that the design and engineering of an article of footwear including a spring element  can have different requirements for other sport applications which include lateral and random movements.","Again, the required thickness of the inferior spring element  will depend in part upon whether the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  is contributing to deflection, and by how much, the design and composition of the inferior spring element , but also a wearer's body weight, biomechanical technique, and speed. For example, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in  which provides approximately 10 mm of total deflection, and a generally planar superior spring element  or posterior spring element  making a contribution to deflection of less than or equal to 5 mm, and an individual running at slow to moderate speeds, the approximate required thickness of an inferior spring element  made of standard modulus 33 Msi carbon fiber composite material having a curved configuration and a diagonal flexural axis  is shown in Table 3 provided below.","If and when the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  has a three dimensional shape including a heel counter and therefore makes little or no contribution to deflection, that is, deflection in the range between 0-2.0 mm, then the inferior spring element  will generally need to be approximately at least 0.25-0.5 mm thicker in order to effectively manage the loading associated with greater deflection so as to not exceed approximately 60-66 percent of the inferior spring element's  maximum engineered loading capacity. This percentage represents an approximate threshold regarding the capability of carbon fiber composite materials to withstand cycling loading for hundreds of thousands or millions of cycles.","It is important to note that as the flexural axis  is rotated from the transverse axis  orientated at 90 degrees to the longitudinal axis  and towards a 45 degree angle, the effective length of the flexural axis  and stiffness of the inferior spring element  can be increased. Further, when the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  and the inferior spring element  are being fabricated, it can be advantageous to position some of the layers of the carbon fiber material both consistent with and perpendicular to the orientation of the flexural axis , since this area can function as a fulcrum point and be associated with high local loading.","The length of the effective lever arms  and  of the superior spring element  or posterior spring element , and the inferior spring element  on the medial and lateral sides will also influence the stiffness of the larger spring element . Accordingly, it can be readily understood that scalar effects can be present with respect to widely varying sizes of articles of footwear. Again, given an article of footwear including a spring element generally resembling the embodiment represented in  providing approximately 10 mm of deflection and made of standard modulus 33 Msi carbon fiber composite material, the approximate required thickness of an inferior spring element  as a function of the body weight of a runner, and also the type of superior spring element  or posterior spring element  being used is shown in Table 3 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0768","num":"0767"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Superior\/Posterior","Superior\/Posterior"]},{"entry":[{},"Spring Deflects = 5 mm","Spring Deflects 0-2 mm"]},{"entry":[{},"Thus, Inferior Spring","Thus, Inferior Spring"]},{"entry":["Body Weight (lbs)","Thickness (mm)","Thickness (mm)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["100","2.5-2.75","2.75-3.25"]},{"entry":["120","2.75-3.0\u2003","3.0-3.5"]},{"entry":["140","3.0-3.25","3.25-3.75"]},{"entry":["160","3.25-3.50\u2002","3.5-4.0"]},{"entry":["180","3.5-3.75","3.75-4.25"]},{"entry":["200","3.75-4.0\u2003","4.0-4.5"]},{"entry":["220","4.0-4.25","4.25-4.75"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"When the superior spring element  consists of a single part, the thickness can vary and be tapered from the posterior side  to the anterior side , that is, the part can gradually become thinner moving in the direction of the anterior side . This can be accomplished by reducing the number of layers during the building of the part and\/or with the use of compressive force during the molding or curing process. When the superior spring element  consists of two parts, e.g., an anterior spring element  and a posterior spring element , the parts can be made in different thickness. Alternately, the posterior spring element  can be made of a higher modulus material having a given thickness, and the anterior spring element  can be made of a lower modulus material having the same thickness, thus the two parts can possibly have the same thickness but nevertheless provide different and desired spring and dampening characteristics.","Alternately, the number of fiber composite layers, the type of fiber and resin composition of the layers, the inclusion of a core material, and the geometry and orientation of the layers, can be varied so as to create areas of differential stiffness in a spring element . For example, the inferior spring element  can project from the superior spring element  with the flexural axis  orientated consistent with a transverse axis, that is, at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis  provided that the aforementioned variables concerning the fiber composite layers are suitably engineered so as to render the medial side  of the inferior spring element  approximately 2-3 times stiffer than the lateral side , that is, in an article of footwear intended for walking or running activity.","Further, the configuration of a spring element , and in particular, an inferior spring element  having an flexural axis  orientated at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis , can be configured so as to provide differential stiffness. For example, a portion of a spring element  can include transverse or longitudinal slits, notches, openings, a core material, or reduced thickness so as to exhibit areas of differential stiffness, as shown in . Several configurations and methods for achieving differential stiffness in the midfoot area  or rearfoot area  of an article of footwear are recited in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,567, this patent being hereby incorporated by reference herein. However, the relatively sharp portion of the spring element that is shown projecting beyond the medial side of the sole in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,567 could possibly result in injury to the medial side of a wearer's opposite leg during running. Further, given the common orientation of the foot of a wearer who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker during footstrike, an inferior spring element  having an flexural axis  orientated consistent with transverse axis , that is, at 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis , is generally not so advantageously disposed to receive repetitive loading and exhibit robustness during its service life relative to an inferior spring element  having an flexural axis  deviated from the transverse axis  in the range between 10 and 50 degrees, as shown in . In this regard, the foot of a wearer characterized as a rearfoot striker is normally somewhat dorsiflexed, supinated and abducted during footstrike, as recited and shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,184, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,964, these patents being hereby incorporated by reference herein. Accordingly, given an average individual having normal biomechanics who would be characterized as a rearfoot striker, it can be advantageous for the flexural axis  of the inferior spring element  to be deviated from the transverse axis  in the range between 20-30 degrees in footwear intended for walking or running. However, the flexural axis  of an inferior spring element  can be deviated from the transverse axis  in the range between 30-50 degrees in footwear intended for use by individuals who tend to more substantially pronate during the braking and stance phases of the gait cycle. Other teachings having possible merit relating to differential stiffness in the rearfoot area of an article of footwear include, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,506,462, U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,189, U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,125, U.S. Pat. No. 5,197,206, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,197,207, all of these patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.","In order to make carbon fiber composite spring elements, it can be advantageous to create a form or mold. The form or mold can be made of wood, composite material, metal, and the like. For example, prototype forms or molds can be made of thin sheets of stainless steel which can be cut and bent into the desired configurations. The stainless steel can then be treated with a cleaner and appropriate release agent. For example, the stainless steel can be washed with WATERCLEAN and then dried, then given two coats of SEALPROOF sealer and dried, and finally given two coats of WATERSHIELD release agent and dried, all of these products being made by Zyvax, Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., and distributed by Technology Marketing, Inc. of Vancouver, Wash., and Salt Lake City, Utah. A \u201cprepreg\u201d uni-directional carbon fiber composite material including a peel-off protective layer that exposes a self-adhesive surface can then be cut to the approximate shapes of the desired spring element by a razor blade, scissors, cutting die, water jet cutter, or automatic cutting machine. Suitable carbon fiber composite materials for use include F3(C) 50K made by FORTAFIL, AS4C made by HEXCEL, T300 made by TORAY\/AMOCO, and in particular, ZMG-2000-Z346-150-35-24\u2033 which is a 150 GSM material including a toughened epoxy with a 35 percent resin content made by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc., and the like. The individual layers of carbon fiber composite material can have a thickness in the range between approximately 0.13-0.15 mm or 0.005 inches and be affixed to one another to build the desired thickness of the spring elements, but allowing for a reduction of approximately 10 percent due to shrinkage which commonly takes place during the curing process. The individual layers can be alternated in various orientations, e.g., some can be orientated parallel to the length of the desired spring element, and others inclined at 45 degrees to the left or right, or at 90 degrees. The result can be a quasi-isotropic fiber composite material, that is, one having a relatively homogenous flexural modulus in all directions. However, the flexural modulus or stiffness in bending exhibited by the spring element in various orientations can be specifically engineered by varying the number, type, and orientation of the fiber composite layers.","Once the spring element components have been built by adhering the desired number, type, and orientation of glass or carbon fiber composite layers together, the spring element can be rolled or placed under pressure and applied to the stainless steel prototype form or mold. When making prototype spring elements, the carbon fiber composite lay-up including the stainless steel form or mold can be wrapped in a peel ply or perforated release film such as Vac-Pak E 3760 or A 5000 Teflon\u00ae FEP, then wrapped in a bleeder such as A 3000 Resin Bleeder\/Breather or RC-3000-10A polyester which will absorb excess resin which could leach from the spring elements during curing. This assembly can then be enclosed in a vacuum bagging film, e.g., a VA-Pak\u00ae Co-Extruded Nylon Bagging Film such as Vac-Pak HS 800 and all mating edges can be sealed with the use of a sealant tape such as Schnee Morehead vacuum bag tacky tape, or RAP RS200. A vacuum valve can be installed in functional relation to the vacuum bagging film before the vacuum bag is completely sealed. The vacuum valve can be subsequently connected to an autoclave vacuum hose and a vacuum pump, and the assembly can be checked for leaks before placing it in an oven for curing. The entire assembly, while under constant vacuum pressure, can then be placed into an oven and heated at a temperature of approximately 250 degrees Fahrenheit for one to two hours in order to effect setting and curing of the carbon fiber composite spring elements. Upon removal from the oven and cooling, the vacuum bag can be opened and the cured carbon fiber composite spring elements can be removed from within the bleeder and the peel ply or release film, and separated from the stainless steel form or mold. The spring element parts can then possibly be cut or trimmed with a saw, a grinding wheel, a sander, a CNC machine, or with the use of water jet cutting equipment. The fasteners  can then be affixed and the spring element installed in functional relation to the upper and outsole of a prototype article of footwear.","The method of making fiber composite materials in a production setting differs depending upon whether thermoplastic or thermoset materials are being used. For example, thermoplastic carbon fiber composite materials including their resin coatings are commonly available in flat sheet stock. Parts can then be cut from these sheets using water jet cutting equipment. These parts can then be preheated for a short time in an oven in order to reach a temperature below, but yet relatively close to the melt point of the thermoplastic material, thus rendering the part moldable. Production compression molds are commonly milled from aluminum, then polished and treated with a non-stick coating and release agent. The cost of a single aluminum production compression mold is approximately $2,500. The heated thermoplastic carbon fiber composite parts can then be placed into a relatively cold compression mold and subjected to pressure as the part is simultaneously caused to set and cool. The parts can then be removed and inspected for possible use. One manufacturer of thermoset fiber composite parts is Performance Materials Corporation of 1150 Calle Suerte, Camarillo, Calif. 93012.","The production method and process is different when a thermoset carbon fiber composite uni-directional prepreg material is being used to make a desired part. The uncured layered thermoset part can be placed into an aluminum compression mold which has been preheated to a desired temperature. The mold is closed and the part is then subjected to both heat and pressure. In this regard, the set and cure time of thermoset fiber composite materials is temperature dependent. Generally, the set and cure time for thermoset parts will be about one hour given a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit. However, it is often possible for the same thermoset parts to reach their gel state and take a set, whereupon the shape of the part will be stable, in about one half hour given a temperature of 270 degrees Fahrenheit, in about fifteen minutes given a temperature of 290 degrees Fahrenheit, or in about seven minutes given a temperature of 310 degrees Fahrenheit. Having once reached their gel state and taken a set, the thermoset parts can then be removed from the mold. The parts can later be placed in an oven and subjected to one to two hours of exposure to a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit in order to complete the curing process. Moreover, Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. of San Diego, Calif. makes a \u201cquick cure\u201d thermoset material identified by their product code number 2510 which can completely cure in ten minutes given a mold temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit, and perhaps even faster at higher temperatures.","An alternate method of making thermoset carbon fiber composite spring element components involves making and using a single sided mold having sufficient width to encompass at least one part along the x axis, but the mold can then extend along the y axis for many feet, or vice-versa. For example, the mold can be made of 7075 grade aluminum which can be purchased from Metals USA, Specialty Metals Northwest, Inc. at 3400 S.W. Bond Avenue, in Portland, Oreg. The mold can have a have a width of 16 inches, a length of 30 inches, and maximum thickness of 1\u00bc inches, and be machined to provide a desired configuration using CNC equipment. Accordingly, a relatively long lay-up of carbon fiber material can be placed upon the mold, vacuum bagged, and then cured in an autoclave. For example, ZMG-2000-Z346-150-35-24\u2033 which is a 150 GSM prepreg carbon fiber material including a toughened epoxy with a 35 percent resin content made by Zoltek Materials Group, Inc. can be used. A thicker material such as 300 GSM prepreg carbon fiber material can be used alone, or alternately, in combination with a 150 GSM material in order to more rapidly build up the thickness of the desired part. A large number of individual components can then be cut from the resulting cured sheet of carbon fiber material. For example, approximately seven full-length superior spring element  parts can be obtained from a sheet of carbon fiber composite material formed upon mold having the size recited above. Alternately, approximately fourteen inferior spring elements  can be obtained from a sheet of carbon fiber composite material formed upon a mold having the size recited above. The individual parts can be cut with a saber saw, a CNC machine using a vacuum fixture for holding the cured sheet of carbon fiber composite material, or with a multi-dimensional water jet cutter. A provider of water jet cutting services is Hegar Manufacturing of 15600 S.E. FOR\/MOR, Clackamas, Oreg. A superior spring element or anterior spring element having a planar configuration, or alternately, a curved shape can be made by this method. Moreover, an inferior spring element having more dramatic curved shape can be made by this method.","An alternate method of making carbon fiber composite parts involves using an injection mold. An uncured carbon fiber material which may or may not already be impregnated with a resin can be placed into an injection mold, and resin can then be injected under pressure and subsequently cured to form a finished part. Alternately, a resin containing short or long glass, carbon, or boron fibers can be injected into a mold and caused to set. The compression and injection mold methods of making fiber composite parts can be advantageous for use when attempting to make components having multiple complex curved shapes. Manufacturers of thermoset fiber composite parts include All Composites of 3206 232nd Street, East Spanayay, Wash. 98387, and Quatro Composites of 12544 Kirkham Court, Number 16, Poway, Calif. 92064.","Alternative methods of making fiber composite parts can include the use of light cure technology, other forms of compression or injection molding, reaction injection molding, and also pulltrusion. Compression molding, injection molding, and reaction injection molding have been widely used in the automotive industry, e.g., the body of the Corvette largely consists of fiber composite construction. Thermoplastic materials, or alternately, thermoset materials including polymers, resins, or epoxies which are rubber toughened that further include glass fiber, aramid fiber, carbon fiber, or boron fiber materials, and the like, can possibly be used. For example, Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Mich. makes SPECTRUM\u00ae reaction moldable polymer which has been used to make automobile body parts, and LNP Engineering Plastics of Exton, Pa. makes THERMOCOMP\u00ae and VERTON\u00ae thermoplastic materials which can include long carbon fibers. Further, PPG of Pittsburgh, Pa., Corning, of Corning, N.Y., and Vetrotex of Valley Forge, Pa., are makers of electrical and structural grade fiberglass products.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0779","num":"0778"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["37","22","25","52","55","33","34","35","36","23","22","58","67","68","57"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0780","num":"0779"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["38","22","43","53","44","54","46","67","68","46","46","34","68","63","45","67","63","45","63","45"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0781","num":"0780"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["22","43","44","46","30","23","25","52","24","29","31","31","31","51","31","31","23","23"]},"The spring element  can consist of a plurality of portions, and preferably three portions, an anterior spring element , a posterior spring element , and an inferior spring element  which can be affixed together in functional relation, e.g., with the use of at least one mechanical fastener , and the like. The anterior spring element  can underlay a substantial portion of the forefoot area  and is preferably affixed to the posterior spring element  in the forefoot area  or midfoot area  posterior of a position in the range between approximately 60-70 percent of the length of the upper  of the article of footwear  as measured from the posterior side , that is, a position posterior of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints of a wearer's foot when the article of footwear  is donned. The metatarsal-phalangeal joints are normally located near approximately 70 percent of foot length on the medial side  of the foot, and nearer to approximately 60 percent of foot length on the lateral side  of the foot. Accordingly the anterior spring element  can underlay the metatarsal-phalangeal joints of the foot and energy can temporarily be stored and later released to generate propulsive force when the anterior spring element  undergoes bending during the stance and propulsive phases of the running cycle. The anterior spring element  can be selectively and removably attached and renewed in the event of damage or failure. Further, a wearer can select from anterior spring elements  having different configurations and stiffness, and therefore customize the desired stiffness of the anterior spring element  in an article of footwear . For example, different individuals having different body weight, running styles, or characteristic running speeds could desire anterior spring elements  having different stiffness.","Likewise, the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  can be selectively and removably affixed to the inferior spring element  in the rearfoot area  or midfoot area  of the article of footwear . Accordingly the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  can underlay a substantial portion of the wearer's rearfoot and perhaps a portion of the wearer's midfoot and energy can be stored during the braking and early stance phases of the running cycle and released during the later portion of the stance and propulsive phases of the running cycle to provide propulsive force. The anteriormost portion of wearer's rearfoot on the lateral side of the foot is consistent with the junction between the calcaneus and cuboid bones of the foot which is generally in the range between 25-35 percent of a given foot length and that of a corresponding size upper  of an article of footwear . The superior spring element  or posterior spring element , and inferior spring element  can be selectively and removably attached and renewed in the event of failure. Further, a wearer can select from superior spring elements  or posterior spring elements , and inferior spring elements  having different configurations and stiffness, and therefore customize the desired stiffness of these spring elements in an article of footwear . For example, different individuals having different weight, running styles, or characteristic running speeds could desire to select superior spring elements  or posterior spring elements , and inferior spring elements  having different stiffness.","Accordingly, the spring element  of a preferred article of footwear can consist of three portions, an anterior spring element  which is positioned anterior of at least approximately 70 percent of the length of the upper  of the article of footwear  as measured from the posterior side , a posterior spring element  which extends anteriorly from proximate the posterior side  of the upper  of the article of footwear  and is affixed in functional relation to the anterior spring element , and an inferior spring element  which is affixed in functional relation to the posterior spring element . The inferior spring element  projects rearwards and downwards and can extend beneath a substantial portion of the rearfoot area  of the article of footwear . Alternately, the spring element  can be formed in two portions or a single part.","In the embodiment shown in , the elevation of the wearer's foot in the rearfoot area  measured under the weight bearing center of a wearer's heel  is approximately 26 mm, and the elevation of the wearer's foot in the forefoot area  measured under the ball of the foot proximate the metatarsal-phalangeal joints is approximately 16 mm in a size 9 men's article of footwear. The difference in elevation between the forefoot area  measured under the ball of the foot and the rearfoot area  measured under the weight bearing center of a wearer's heel  in a men's size 9 article of footwear is commonly in the range between 10-12 mm, and is approximately 10 mm in the embodiment shown in .","For some footwear applications, such as competition in track and field or road racing, the maximum amount of deflection that might be desired by some individuals between the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  and the inferior spring element  could be in the range between 8-15 mm. As shown in , the maximum amount of deflection possible as between posterior spring element  and inferior spring element  is approximately 10 mm. However, greater amounts of deflection in the range between 15-50 mm can be desired for use by some individuals in various footwear applications, as shown and discussed herein with respect to other embodiments of the present invention. Nevertheless, it can be advantageous from the standpoint of injury prevention that the elevation of the rearfoot area  minus the maximum amount of deflection permitted between the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  and the inferior spring element  be equal to or greater than the elevation of the forefoot area . It can also be advantageous as concerns the longevity of the working life of the spring element  that the amount of deflection permitted be equal to or less than approximately 75 percent the maximum distance between the proximate opposing sides of the spring element , that is, as between the inferior surface of the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  and the superior surface of the inferior spring element .","The amount of deflection or compression provided under the wearer's foot in the forefoot area  by the embodiment shown in  is commonly approximately in the range between 4-6 mm, and such can be provided by an insole  having a thickness of 3.75 mm in combination with an anterior outsole element  having a total thickness of 6.5 mm including a backing  having a thickness of approximately 1.5 mm and a tread or ground engaging portion  having a thickness of approximately 5 mm, and in particular, when the ground engaging portion  is made of a relatively soft and resilient material having good traction, and shock and vibration dampening characteristics. For example, a foamed natural or synthetic rubber or other elastomeric material can be suitable for use. If hypothetically, an outsole material having advantageous traction, and shock and vibration dampening characteristics only lasts 200 miles during use, that is, as opposed to perhaps 300 miles associated with a harder and longer wearing outsole material, this does not pose a practical problem, as the outsole  portions can be easily renewed in the present invention, whereas a conventional article of footwear would normally be discarded.

In this regard, an anterior spacer  can have uniform height, or alternately an anterior spacer  can have varied height. Further, an anterior spacer  can exhibit uniform compressive, flexural, and torsional stiffness throughout, or alternately an anterior spacer  can exhibit different compressive, flexural, and torsional stiffness in different locations. These varied characteristics of an anterior spacer  can be used to enhance the cushioning, stability and overall performance of an article of footwear  for a unique individual wearer, or for a target population of wearers. For example, an anterior spacer  having an inclined or wedge shape can be used to decrease the rate and magnitude of pronation, supination, and inward or outward rotation of portions of a wearer's foot during portions of the walking or running gait cycle, and can also possibly correct for anatomical conditions such as varus or valgus.

Accordingly, a posterior spacer  can consist of a cushioning medium or cushioning means having desired spring and dampening characteristics. The posterior spacer  can be inserted between the inferior spring element  and posterior spring element , that is, within an area of possible overlap as between the two components. The configuration and stiffness of a posterior spacer  can be used to modify the overall configuration and performance of a spring element  and article of footwear . In this regard, a posterior spacer  can have uniform height, or alternately a posterior spacer  can have varied height. Further, a posterior spacer  can exhibit uniform compressive, flexural, or torsional stiffness throughout, or alternately can exhibit different properties in different locations. These varied characteristics of a posterior spacer  can be used to enhance the cushioning and\/or stability of an article of footwear  for an unique individual wearer, or for a target population of wearers.","For example, a posterior spacer  having an inclined or wedge shape can be used to decrease the rate and magnitude of pronation, supination, inward or outward rotation of portions of a wearer's foot during phases of the walking or running gait cycle, and can also possibly correct for anatomical conditions such as varus or valgus. Again, the relevant methods and techniques for making corrections of this kind are relatively well known to qualified medical doctors, podiatrists, and physical therapists. Normally, a posterior spacer  having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the lateral to the medial side, or a posterior spacer  which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the medial side can be used to reduce the magnitude and rate of rearfoot pronation, whereas a posterior spacer  having an inclined wedge shape that increases in height from the medial to the lateral side, or a posterior spacer  which exhibits greater stiffness in compression on the lateral side can be used to reduce the magnitude and rate of rearfoot supination. An individual having a profound anatomical condition such as varus or valgus, an individual who dramatically pronates or supinates, or an individual who has a history of injury would be prudent to consult with a trained medical doctor when contemplating modification to their articles of footwear.","It can be readily understood that with the use of an anterior spacer  positioned between anterior spring element  and posterior spring element , and a posterior spacer  positioned between the superior spring element  or posterior spring element  and the inferior spring element , that the configuration and functional relationship as between the forefoot area , midfoot area , and rearfoot area  of an article of footwear  can be adjusted and customized as desired by an individual wearer. Further, the use of an anterior spacer  and\/or posterior spacer  having a select configuration can be used to adjust the amount of support provided by a superior spring element  or posterior spring element  which can possibly further include contours for mating with the complex curved shapes of a wearer's foot. For example, it is possible to customize the amount of support that is provided to the medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal and transverse arches, and to the sides of a wearer's foot.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0811","num":"0810"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["22","22","40","41","64","65","41","51","50","65","41","51","64","41","47","49","50","41","42","41"]},"Generally, the efficiency of a vibration decay time modifier will be enhanced the closer it is positioned in functional relation to a negative nodal point. When properly configured and placed proximate the negative nodal point of an object or implement, relatively little mass is required in order to substantially prevent, or alternately, to attenuate resonant vibration within fractions of a second. A negative nodal point is a point at which a substantial portion of the vibration energy in an excited object or implement will pass when it is excited by energy associated with an impact or other vibration producing event. Discussion of modes of vibration and negative nodal points can be found in Arthur H. Benade, 2nd edition, New York: Dover Publications, 1990, Harry F. Olson, 2nd edition, New York: Dover Publications, 1967, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,941,380 granted to Francois Rene Lacoste on Mar. 2, 1976, this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein.","A technology taught by Steven C. Sims in U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,046, granted Nov. 4, 1994, this patent hereby being incorporated by reference herein, has been commercialised by Wilson Sporting Goods, Inc. into the SLEDGEHAMMER\u00ae INTUNE\u00ae tennis rackets, and by Hillerich and Bradsby Company, Inc. in the LOUISVILLE SLUGGER\u00ae SIMS STINGSTOP\u00ae aluminum baseball and softball bats, as well as the POWERBUILT\u00ae SIMS SHOCK RELIEF\u00ae golf club line, and LIMBSAVER\u00ae product for archery. These products substantially eliminate the vibration and stinging associated with impact events experienced by a wielder's hands. Certain aspects of the aforementioned teachings can be applied in the present invention in order to accomplish a similar results with regards to an article of footwear  and the lower extremities of a wearer.","The source of shock and vibration can derive from a relatively controlled and harmonic movement, such as when a wearer repeatedly impacts the pavement while running in an article of footwear . Further, the source of shock and vibration can be random in nature, as when a wearer rides a wheeled vehicle such as a bicycle or motorcycle over rough terrain. Alternately, the source of shock and vibration can be constant and mechanically driven as when a wearer rides a bicycle, or a motor vehicle such as a motorcycle or snowmobile. A shock wave, that is, a shock pulse or discontinuity can travel at the speed of sound in a given medium. In the human body, the speed of sound in bone is approximately 3,200 meters\/second, and in soft tissue approximately 1,600 meters\/second. A shock wave traveling in a relatively dense fluid medium such as water has approximately five times the power that it does in a less dense fluid medium such as air. It is important to recognize that the human body is largely comprised of water and like fluid medium.","When a metal bell is struck, the bell will resonate and continue to ring for an extended time while the vibration energy is gradually dampened out. When a small bell is rung, one can place one's hand upon it and silence it. In that case, the primary dampening means for attenuating the resulting shock and vibration is the anatomy of the human subject. The same thing can happen when an impact event takes place as between an individual's foot and the materials which are used in an athletic shoe, and a running surface. When an individual runs on an asphalt surface in running shoes, the sound of the impact event that one hears is the audible portion of the shock wave that has been generated as result of the impact.","Many individuals know from experience that a vibrating implement or object can numb the hands. This is even more true when the source of the vibration is continuous and driven as when power equipment is being used. Associated with that numbness can be pain, reduced sensation and proprioception, and reduced muscular effort and performance as the body responds to protect itself from a perceived source of trauma and injury. Chronic exposure to high levels of vibration can result in a medical condition known as white finger disease. Generally, the lower extremities of most individuals are not subject to high levels of driven vibration. However, bicycle riders wearing relatively rigid articles of footwear can experience constant driven vibration, thus their feet can become numb or \u201cgo to sleep\u201d over time. Motorcycle riders can also experience the same phenomenon.","The preferred article of footwear includes spring and dampening means for at least partially attenuating shock and vibration, that is, the initial shock pulse, pressure wave, or discontinuity and associated peak g's that are imparted to a wearer due to an impact event. At a cellular or molecular level, such vibration energy is believed to disturb normal functions such as blood flow in tendon tissue. Given appropriate engineering with respect to the characteristic or desired spring stiffness, mass, deflection, frequency, dampening, and percent transmissibility, an article of footwear of the present invention can partially attenuate shock and vibration. Viscous, friction, and mechanical dampening means can be used to attain this end. It is known that the mean power frequency associated with the rearfoot impact event in running generally corresponds to 20 Herz, and that of the forefoot to 5 Herz. The design and configuration, as well as the spring and dampening characteristics of a spring element , posterior spacer , and vibration decay time modifier  can be engineered so as to target these frequencies and provide a specific characteristic tuned mechanical response.","An anterior spacer , posterior spacer , and vibration decay time modifier  can be made of a cushioning medium or cushioning means such as a natural or synthetic rubber material, or a resilient elastomer such as polyurethane. In this regard, thermoset or thermoplastic materials can be used. Thermoplastic materials can be less expensive to produce as they can be readily injection molded. In contrast, thermoset materials are often compression molded using a relatively time and energy consuming vulcanization process. However, some thermoset materials can possess superior dampening properties and durability. Dampening materials which can be cured with the use of ultrasonic energy, microwave, visible or ultraviolet light, radio frequency, or other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used. Room temperature cure elastomers, such as moisture or evaporation cure, or catalytic cure resilient materials can also be used. A suitable dampening material can be made of a butyl, chloroprene, polynorborene, neoprene, or silicone rubber, and the like. Alternately, a dampening material can be made of an elastomeric material such as polyurethane, or SORBOTHANE\u00ae. Suitable hybrid thermoplastic and rubber combinations can also be used, including dynamically vulcanized alloys which can be injection molded such as those produced by Advanced Elastomer Systems, 338 Main Street, Akron, Ohio 44311, e.g., SANTOPRENE\u00ae, VYRAM\u00ae, GEOLAST\u00ae, and TREFSIN\u00ae. SANTOPRENE\u00ae is known to consist of a combination of butyl rubber and ethylene-propylene. Generally, other materials developed for use in the audio industry for dampening vibration such as EAR ISODAMP\u00ae, SINATRA\u00ae, EYDEX\u00ae, and the like, or combinations thereof, can be used. Fillers such as organic or inorganic microspheres, carbon black or other conventional fillers can be used. Plasticizing agents such as fluids or oils can be used to modify the physical and mechanical properties of the dampening material in a desired manner. The preferred dampening material has transition characteristics suitable for the expected operational temperature of an article of footwear , and other physical and mechanical properties well suited to dampen shock and vibration and reduce vibration decay time.","It can be advantageous that the dampening material used to make a solitary vibration decay time modifier  including a stem  and a head  have a hardness in the range of 10-30 durometer, and preferably approximately 20 durometer on the Shore A scale. A relatively soft dampening material is capable a dampening a wide range of exciting vibration frequencies, and also relatively low vibration frequencies. However, a harder dampening material having greater shear and tear strength can sometimes be advantageous for use when making an anterior spacer  or posterior spacer  due to the magnitude of the loads which can be placed upon these components during use. A vibration decay time modifier  can be affixed to spring element  by conventional means such as adhesive, mechanically mating parts, chemical bonding, heat and pressure welding, radio frequency welding, compression molding, injection molding, photocuring, and the like.","In a conventional article of footwear having a foam midsole and rubber outsole, the materials located between the wearer's foot and the inferior ground engaging surface of the outsole normally become compressed during footstrike and subsequent loading of the sole. During compressive loading the stiffness of these materials increases linearly or geometrically and as result the ability of the sole to dampen shock and vibration rapidly diminishes. Further, the area of the sole which transmits most of the shock and vibration can be relatively small and localized. In this regard, the energy associated with a shock pulse or discontinuity passes tends to pass quickly by the shortest route and through the hardest or stiffest material in which it is in communication. Again, the transmission of shock and vibration is extremely fast in the human body and the materials used in conventional articles of footwear. In a conventional article of footwear, the shock and vibration resulting from impact with the support surface is rapidly transmitted through the outsole, midsole, upper and insole and into a wearer's foot.","However, in the present invention the shock and vibration generated proximate the inferior ground engaging surface  of the outsole  must travel anteriorly along the outsole  and inferior spring element  before being transmitted to the superior spring element , upper  and wearer, thus for a greater distance relative to a conventional article of footwear. This affords more time and space in which to attenuate and dampen shock and vibration. Further, in the present invention the outsole  can be made of a softer material having better shock and vibration dampening characteristics than is normally the case in a conventional article of footwear. In addition, a posterior spacer  can serve as a shock and vibration isolator between the inferior spring element  and the superior spring element , upper , and wearer's foot. Moreover, as shown in , at least one vibration decay time modifier  can be positioned in direct communication with inferior spring element  in order to dampen shock and vibration before it can be transmitted to a wearer. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a wearer with enhanced cushioning, shock and vibration isolation, and dampening effects relative to conventional footwear constructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0822","num":"0821"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 18","FIG. 20"],"b":["22","42","42","40","41"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0823","num":"0822"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 1"],"b":["22","23","51","43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0824","num":"0823"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 3"],"b":["22","51","73","22","23"]},"Also shown in  is flexural axis , and with the use of a dashed line, an alternate position of flexural axis . with reference to the longitudinal axis .

The position of the flexural axis  can be selected in order to influence or determine the physical and mechanical properties of a spring element , and the overall conformance and performance of an article of footwear , as desired. Generally, it can be advantageous that the posteriormost portion of the flexural axis on the medial side be located in the range between 1-6 inches from the posterior side of the upper, and in particular, in the range between 2-4 inches from the posterior side of the upper. However, in the footwear embodiment shown in , it can be advantageous both with respect to the stability of the preferred article of footwear , but also the weight and cost of the spring element, that the posteriormost position of the flexural axis  on the medial side  be located approximately in the range between 1-3.5 inches from the posterior side  of the upper  in a men's size 9 article of footwear .

One advantage to using a flexural axis  that is deviated from the transverse axis  in the range between 10-50 degrees is that it permits the use of an inferior spring element  having a relatively homogenous construction and a substantially uniform thickness, and this both serves to reduce manufacturing costs and enhances product reliability.

Accordingly, two sets of alternate openings  spaced apart by a distance corresponding to a full size length can sometimes render a lasting board  or spring element  suitable for use with three or four sizes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0848","num":"0847"},"figref":["FIG. 37","FIG. 37"],"b":["79","51","48","49","48","58","22","78","77","35","36","72","78","77","78","77","35","36","78","77","78","77","22","72","78","77","78","77","78","77","72","79","51","23","32","72","72","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0849","num":"0848"},"figref":["FIG. 38","FIG. 16","FIG. 38","FIG. 43","FIG. 38","FIG. 23"],"b":["38","38","22","79","51","23","31","32","29","85","86","85","32","29","29","38","32","29","85","86","32","23","22","29","32","43","29","32","43","29","22","79","51","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0850","num":"0849"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 16","FIG. 39"],"b":["38","38","22","31","38","35","36","38","79","51","31","84","79","51","31","79","51","31","38","79","51","23","32","79","51"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0851","num":"0850"},"figref":["FIG. 40","FIG. 16"],"b":["38","38","22","32","43","38","35","36","37","79","51","51","51","43","23","79","23","29","30","51","51","79","51","79"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0852","num":"0851"},"figref":["FIG. 41","FIG. 16"],"b":["38","38","22","79","51","23","31","43","22","43","51","51","43","38","51"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0853","num":"0852"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 16"],"b":["38","38","22","32","43","23","79","51","31","23","32","23","32","23","23","80","23","23","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0854","num":"0853"},"figref":["FIG. 43","FIG. 16","FIG. 43","FIG. 24","FIG. 43","FIG. 43"],"b":["38","38","22","32","23","31","79","51","84","84","23","51","30","32","43","79","51","23","32","32","22","79","51","32","32","79","51","32","35","36","32","23","29","29","85","86","32","23","22","32","23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0855","num":"0854"},"figref":["FIG. 44","FIG. 44"],"b":["22","51","51","48","49","50","23","29"]},"The present invention teaches and makes possible not only a novel method of manufacturing articles of footwear, but also, a novel way of doing both retail and Internet business. The configuration and dimensions of a given wearer's foot and any other special needs and requirements or wearer preferences can be recorded by direct observation and measurement in a retail or medical setting, or by a wearer or other individual at their home or other remote site, and this data can be used to generate information and intelligence relating to the manufacture of an appropriate custom article of footwear for the wearer and intended end use. This information and intelligence relating to an individual wearer or target population can include a so-called soft virtual model that is created and maintained in computer software or other data storage and retrieval system for present and future use.","Conventional measuring or reproduction means including but not limited to rulers, measuring tapes, Brannock devices, two or three dimensional scanners, pressure sensors, infrared thermography, stereolithography, paper, photographs, photocopies, cameras, images, tracings, video, verbal communication, telephone, television, FAX, computers and computer screens, software, data storage and retrieval systems, e-mail, lasts, lasting boards, templates, molds, models, and patterns can be used, as well as other tangible mediums of expression, and the like. Some of the data which might be collected could include, but not be limited to an individual's: foot length; foot width at one or more locations; foot girth at one or more locations; arch characteristics such as high arch, normal arch, or low arch; the presence of a varus or valgus condition; bunions; Morton's toe; two dimensional foot shape; three dimensional foot shape; data collected using F-scan equipment and software made by Tekscan, Inc. of Boston, Mass.; strike index, plantar pressure, and center of pressure data collected using Pedar or Emed equipment made by Novel Electronics, Inc. of St. Paul, Minn.; digital photographs or video images showing superior, inferior, anterior, medial, lateral, and perspective views of an individual's foot; video data collected of an individual while in motion using digital cameras; biomechanical analysis of an individual's motion such as rearfoot motion analysis, and possibly including top, bottom, side, frontal, rear, and perspective view using equipment and software made by manufacturers such as Mikromak GmbH, of Erlangen, Germany, Northern Digital of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, Motion Analysis of Santa Rosa, Calif., VICON Motion Systems of Lake Forest, Calif., or Peak Performance Technologies, Inc., of Englewood, Colo.; and, the individuals name; mailing and e-mail address; password, phone number; sex; weight; age; training age; walking or running pace; fit preference such as loose, normal, or tight; activity preference; affiliation; sizing system preference such as inches or metric; place of payment such as zip code or city; method of payment such as cash, check, debit card, credit card, and including the relevant account number and expiration date.","Given this collected raw data, information and intelligence can then be created including an individual record which could include a virtual model of an individual's feet. This information and intelligence can be used to select one or more options with respect to a footwear last, or other footwear configuration including length size, width, and girth measurements. Accordingly, this information and intelligence can be used to identify specific categories and footwear models for consideration. If and when working in a computer environment, the various options can be displayed for consideration and selection. This can be done with the use of a wireless computer or cell phone. Further, an individual can then click on various categories or models in order to receive additional technical information and also pricing information. In addition, an individual can then click on various segments or components of a virtual model or article of footwear being presented, and so access more specific menus relating to selections which can be made according to their preference with respect to the structure, function, material, color, and design of a given component. Accordingly, an individual can make a final and confirmed selection.","Given the collected data, the information and intelligence created, and a ready and adequate stock of the various components anticipated for use in making articles of footwear, an individual customer, or alternately, a worker in a retail, medical, manufacturing, or distribution center which possibly includes an automated system including robotics can gather the required components for assembly. An individual can then purchase the required components and assemble the article of footwear themselves. Alternately, the article of footwear can be manufactured or assembled by a worker in a retail, medical, manufacturing, or distribution center.

Further, given the biomechanical events associated with walking and running, it can be advantageous to reduce the torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side  of the forefoot area  relative to the medial side , as this can reduce the length of the effective lever arm formed by the spring element  and sole  of an article of footwear , thereby reduce the rate and magnitude of inward rotation of the foot and so enhance stability and performance. In addition, reducing the torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side  of the forefoot area  can increase the amount of deflection which takes place during impact and the ground support phase of the gait cycle, thus enhance perceived and actual cushioning effects. Moreover, the transition and work performed by the foot during the ground support phase can then be smoother and more economical, but also more natural or comfortable for a wearer.

The presence, location, shape, length, depth, and number of the notches  can be varied to make the anterior spring element more suitable for a particular activity, or a particular individual. The embodiment shown in  is appropriate for use in a running shoe. The longitudinal notch . near the anterior side  extends to the anteriormost transverse line of flexion . and creates two opposing fingers . and . on the medial side  and lateral side , respectively. Given a spring element intended for use in a men's size 9 article of footwear, notches . and . on the medial side  can extend a relatively short distance such as approximately 15 mm, whereas notches ., ., and . can extend for a greater distance such as approximately 25 mm. The approximate alignment of notches . and . can create a generally transverse line of flexion . anterior of the approximate position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line . The approximate alignment of notches . and . can create a generally transverse line of flexion . generally consistent with the approximate position of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints indicated by line . The orientation of notch . can create a generally diagonal line of flexion . approximately following the anterior side of the posterior spring element . The proximity of notches . and . can create a generally longitudinal line of flexion . therebetween which can reduce both the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness of the medial side  and enhance stability by reducing certain leverage effects which could impact inversion or eversion of a wearer's foot in an undesired manner. Similarly, the proximity of notches . and . and . can create a generally longitudinal line of flexion . therebetween which can reduce both the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness of the lateral side  and enhance stability by reducing certain leverage effects which could impact inversion or eversion of a wearer's foot in an undesired manner.","In particular, on the lateral side  of the forefoot area  of a running shoe, it can be advantageous to create an extended area characterized by reduced stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness, or what can be called a \u201cforefoot strike zone\u201d somewhat analogous to the \u201crearfoot strike zone\u201d which has been previously taught by the inventor in U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,184, U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,964, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,055,746, hereby incorporated by reference herein. Further, it can be advantageous in a running shoe for the stiffness in compression and torsional stiffness exhibited on the lateral side  of the anterior spring element  in the forefoot area  to be less than that exhibited on the medial side , and by a factor generally in the range between 10-50 percent. In this regard, it is generally known by those who study biomechanics that at lower speeds, as when an individual is walking or running slowly, the lateral side of the human foot is used to greater degree than when running at high speeds, thus the human foot can exhibit differential stiffness and utilization as between the lateral side and medial side. In brief, as result of the presence, location, shape, length, depth, and number of the notches  shown in , the anterior spring element  is perceived to provide enhanced cushioning, stability, and performance effects without the flexural or torsional modulus characteristics of the fiber composite material causing dysfunctional leverage effects or other undesired perceived phenomenon. Other configurations are possible and anticipated, e.g., notches . and . could be moved more towards the posterior side  to be placed well behind line  indicating the approximate location of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1167","num":"1166"},"figref":["FIG. 310","FIG.

in the prior art related to the manufacture of socks, and a suitable pattern for use can be cut therefrom. Alternately, the textile material  forming at least a portion of the upper  can be made in the origami-like patterns taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,997 granted to Dieter, and assigned to Nike, Inc. and the like, or the shoe construction taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,251 granted to Litchfield et al. and assigned to Reebok International, Ltd., and the like, or the article of footwear taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al. also assigned to Reebok International, Ltd., and the like, all of these recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein.","As shown in , the textile material  can be impregnated or over-molded with a plastic material  forming a stability element , e.g., a relatively rigid thermoplastic material such as nylon, polyester, or polyethylene, or alternatively, an elastomeric thermoplastic material such as those made by Advanced Elastomer Systems which have been previously recited, a foam thermoplastic material, a rubber material, or a polyurethane material, and the like. The textile material  can be impregnated or over-molded while positioned in a substantially planar two dimensional orientation as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962 granted to Davis et al., or alternately, while positioned in a relatively complex three dimensional shape on a footwear last , mold, or the like. For example, stability element can be made of a thermoplastic material or a polyurethane material that is directly injection molded and bonded to the upper .","Alternately, a foam material can be applied to the upper  as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,909 granted to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,500 granted to Tawney et al., assigned to Nike, Inc., and the like, the recited patents hereby being incorporated by reference herein. The textile material  can possibly be impregnated or over-molded with the use of a spray, dipping, or roller application generally similar to that known in the screen printing prior art. If the plastic material  is of the thermoplastic variety, it can then be caused to cool to take a set. Alternately, a thermoset material which is used to impregnate or over-mold the textile material  can be caused to cross-link by conventional means known in the prior art. It is also possible to use a thermoplastic material that is moldable when heated to a relatively low temperature, and a wearer can then put on the article of footwear  and cause the upper  to be molded to a desired shape before the thermoplastic material cools and sets. Moreover, as taught in the applicant's U.S. Ser. No. 09\/570,171, filed May 11, 2000, light-cure materials which can be caused to set and cure upon exposure to a specific range of light frequency and wavelength having adequate power can also be used. When the inferior side  of the upper  includes a plurality of openings  for accommodating the passage of a plurality of traction members  associated with the anterior outsole element  therethrough, it can be advantageous that the inferior side  of the upper  in the forefoot area , and possibly also that the midfoot area  and rearfoot area  be impregnated or over-molded by plastic material , or a suitable alternate material, or that the inferior side  otherwise be reinforced to enhance its structural integrity.","The upper  can also be made of new thermoplastic materials which have not yet been used to make articles of footwear that are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. For example, textile materials made from polylactic acid polymers derived from corn or other vegetation known by the trade name NATUREWORKS\u00ae fibers are presently under development and being commercialized by Cargill Dow Polymers LLC of Minneapolis, Minn. in corporation with the Kanebo Corporation associated with the Itochu Corporation of Osaka, Japan. The physical and mechanical properties of fibers and thermoplastic materials derived from polylactic acid generally compare favorably with many existing fibers and thermoplastic materials, but unlike the vast majority of the synthetic fibers and thermoplastic materials presently being used in the manufacture of articles of footwear those derived form polylactic acid are capable of substantially biodegrading when buried in the soil for a period of two to three years.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1212","num":"1211"},"figref":["FIG. 350","FIG. 349","FIG.

element , and anterior outsole element  can be selected from a variety of options which can be provided for optimizing performance in a specific activity, task, or in particular environmental conditions. For example, the outsole elements can be specifically designed and engineered for use in running on roads, trails, racing, walking, or cross-training. An outsole element for trail running can include a greater number of traction members having greater height relative to one best suited for running on roads, whereas it can be advantageous for an outsole element intended for use in racing to be especially light-weight. Further, an outsole element intended for use on an artificial track surface can include a plurality of relatively small protrusions or spikes. Outsole elements which are made of non-marking materials can be provided that are especially suitable for use in basketball, whereas outsole elements including natural rubber, and the like, can be provided that are especially suitable for use in volleyball. Material compounds which are especially resistant to wear can be provided for use in tennis. Outsole elements including a plurality of cleats, protrusions, or traction elements can be specifically designed and engineered for use in baseball, football, golf, and soccer, respectively. As shown in , an outsole element can accommodate the use of a bicycle cleat system. Outsole elements made of material compositions which are resistant to oil and other chemicals can be provided that are especially suitable for use in articles of footwear intended for work and

spring element  can be made of \u201c15-3\u201d spring grade titanium having a thickness of approximately 1.6 mm, the posterior spring element  can be made of a carbon fiber composite material formed in an anatomical three dimension shape including an integral heel counter , and the inferior spring element  can be made of \u201c15-3\u201d spring grade titanium having a thickness approximately in the range between 3.5-4.5 mm. Accordingly, substantially the entire plantar side of a wearer's foot can thereby be shielded by a layer of spring grade titanium. The insole  can extend upwards in the area corresponding to a wearer's arches and encompass the rearfoot area  in order to shield a wearer's foot from direct contact with the heel counter  and enhance fit. As shown, the posterior spring element  can overlap a portion of the anterior spring element  that in turn can overlap a substantial portion of the backing  portion of the anterior outsole element . The generally planar web portion  of the sole  can be direct injection molded to the inferior side  of the upper . However, the web portion  can include a plurality of openings  for permitting the traction members  associated with the anterior outsole element  to pass therethrough. Alternately, the traction members  and sole  in forefoot area  can be formed as an integral unit by direct injection molding, that is, in a conventional manner. When the generally planar web portion  of the sole  is made of a resilient and elastomeric material such as a thermoplastic or thermoset natural or synthetic rubber, and the web portion  also has a substantial thickness that perhaps approximates one quarter inch, then it can be advantageous for overall performance to at least partially encapsulate a metal insert  including an opening  for accommodating a fastener  in the sole  during the direction injection molding process. A full-hex blind threaded insert made by Atlas Engineering, Inc. similar to that shown in  can be used as the female part  of the fastener , and the male part  of the fastener  can consist of a bolt having a flat head including an Allen or star drive such as those made by Stayfast Products, Inc., and having its threads coated with nylon to serve as a self-locking mechanism.","The thickness and stiffness of the anterior spring element , posterior spring element , and inferior spring element  can be selected from a variety and range of options in order to provide optimal performance depending upon whether an individual is walking, running, or possibly carrying a heavy pack. Further, the ground engaging portion  of the anterior outsole element  and also the posterior outsole element  can be selected from a variety and range of options with respect to their specific physical and mechanical properties and material composition. For example, a relatively soft material providing superior cushioning characteristic could be selected for use when drilling or running on asphalt, whereas a material having a wettability index of equal to or greater than 90 degrees, that is, hydrophobic properties could be selected for use in muddy conditions. Further, a material that is hydrophilic and porous could be suitable for use in snow or slippery conditions. In brief, the configuration of the traction elements  and their material composition can be selected for the specific anticipated or required task, terrain, and weather conditions. In less than one minute, the article of footwear  can be completely disassembled and re-assembled and any selected components then be replaced. Accordingly, the present invention can provide versatility and superior performance to members of the armed forces.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1354","num":"1353"},"figref":"FIG.

curve  has a radius of 2.606 inches, whereas the radius of curvature of the superior side  of the posterior curve  is 9.0 inches, and the radius of curvature corresponding to the tapering of the inferior side  of the posterior portion  is 5.138 inches. As shown, the vertical elevation is 0.6299 inches or 16 mm, and the thickness of the particular inferior spring element  shown is 0.189 inches or 4.8 mm at the anterior side  and tapering to only 0.1083 inches or 2.75 mm at the posterior side . If and when desired, the vertical elevation can be changed in the range between 10-18 mm, something that would also cause the fitted symmetrical radius of curvature  associated with the anterior curve  to also change, but otherwise merely changing the vertical elevation need not substantially change the other dimensions and configuration. The thickness and tapered configuration of the inferior spring element can be varied for use by individuals having different body weight, running technique, or characteristic running speeds, and also for use in many different activities. Given an inferior spring element  having the dimensions shown in , the following general guidelines regarding the desired thickness for a wearer could apply: a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm for a wearer having a body weight in the range between 100-120 pounds; 4.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 120-140 pounds; 4.5 mm for a wearer in the range between 140-160 pounds; 4.75 mm for a wearer in the range between 160-180 pounds; 5.0 mm for a wearer in the range between 180-200 pounds; and 5.25 mm for a wearer in the range between 200-220 pounds.","Generally, regarding a men's size 9 article of footwear, an advantageous overall length of an inferior spring element for running is in the range between 4.75 and 5.5 inches, the width in the range between 75-85 mm, the vertical elevation is in the range between 10-18 mm, and the thickness is in the range between 4-5.5 mm at the anterior side  and in the range between approximately 2-3 mm at the posterior side . Generally, an advantageous fitted symmetrical radius of curvature  for use in a men's size 9 running shoe with respect to the anterior curve  is in the range between 2.25 and 3.25 inches, an advantageous radius of curvature  with respect to the superior side  of the posterior curve  is in the range between 7 and 11 inches, and an advantageous radius of curvature  regarding the inferior side  of the posterior portion  is in the range between 4-6 inches. When no other means are being used to create differential stiffness between the medial and lateral sides of an article of footwear which is intended for use in running, given an inferior spring element having the configuration shown, it is generally advantageous for the flexural axis to be deviated from the transverse axis in the range between 20-30 degrees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1430","num":"1429"},"figref":"FIG. 565","b":["22","50","46","30","50","43","46","50","43","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1431","num":"1430"},"figref":"FIG. 566","b":["22","46","50","68","67"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1432","num":"1431"},"figref":["FIG. 567","FIGS. 565 and 566"],"b":["22","50","46","67","68","67"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1433","num":"1432"},"figref":["FIG. 568","FIG. 524"],"b":["22","101","101","101","24","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1434","num":"1433"},"figref":["FIG. 569","FIG. 525","FIGS. 566 and 567","FIG. 569"],"b":["22","46","46","63","67"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1435","num":"1434"},"figref":"FIG. 570","b":["22","23"]},"As shown in , various portions of the upper  can thereby be made of different textile materials and knits.

footwear can be substantially made without the need for substantial hand stitching or other labor intensive techniques, and so it can be made economically in the United States, or otherwise near the intended market. Again, the capability of the upper  to possibly serve a range of length sizes further simplifies manufacturing, supply, and inventory. Further, as previously discussed, if desired, a substantial portion of an article of footwear , that is, greater than fifty percent, and preferably greater than seventy-five percent, and most preferably substantially all of the other major components of the article of footwear can be removably assembled and secured in functional relation to the upper  to make a custom article of footwear  within minutes. Again, the upper  can be substantially made of recyclable and\/or biodegradable materials, and substantially all the other various footwear components can also be made of materials that are recyclable.","Given the teachings and substantial disclosure of the present invention in this specification and the associated drawing figures, it can be readily understood that at least some of the following article of footwear component selection options can be provided to a wearer or customer, e.g., via an Internet website, a cell phone, a remote manufacturing or distribution site, a medical facility, or a retail establishment. Moreover, many other selection options are possible. Again, the present invention teaches an article of footwear that can be rapidly assembled and customized in response to an individual's selections. The following is one example of a component selection guide for the method of making a custom article of footwear according to the present invention.","Article of Footwear ","Category\/Activity\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Style\n\n","Type\n\n","Size Length\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Style\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Style","Footshape","Type\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Style","Footshape","Type\n\n","Thickness\/Stiffness For Approximate Body Weight\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Style\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Type\n\n","Total Deflection of Inferior Spring Element\n\n","Curvature\n\n","Thickness\/Stiffness For Approximate Body Weight\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Type\n\n","Style\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Arch Characteristics\n\n","Style\n\n","Thickness\/Stiffness For Approximate Body Weight (Full Heel Counter)\n\n","Thickness\/Stiffness For Approximate Body Weight\n\n","Size Length","Size Width","Type\n\n","Sizes\n\n","Sizes\n\n","Sizes\n\n","While the above detailed description of the invention contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as exemplifications of several preferred embodiments thereof. It can be readily understood that the various teachings, alternate embodiments, methods and processes disclosed herein can be used in various combinations and permutations. For example, a spring element can consist of a heel counter and inferior spring element and be provided as a single integral footwear component. Alternatively, a spring element can consist of a heel counter, superior spring element, and inferior spring element and be provided as a single integral component. Many other variations are possible. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiments discussed or illustrated, but by the appended claims and their legal
