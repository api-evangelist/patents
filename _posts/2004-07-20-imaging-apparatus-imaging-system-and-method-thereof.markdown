Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a selective image data encoding apparatus, a selective image data encoding system and method thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to an apparatus, a system and a method for changing frame rate by which image data from an imaging apparatus is acquired and transmitted or stored in a recording medium according to a setting performed for association of sensor with imaging device. The present invention is also related to a method for setting up the settings for sensor-imaging device association for such apparatus and system.","2. Related Art","Video capture cards and digital video recorders (DVRs) using video capture cards have inherent limitations regarding a maximum frame rate that can be supported over video inputs. Such maximum frame rate denotes the number of frames that can be dealt with (for example, which can be encoded or transmitted) on the card at the same time. An example is a video capture card or DVR with, say, 8 camera inputs that support, for example, a frame rate of 120 frames per second. Such card\/DVR would support a theoretical 15 frames per second per camera input.","In conventional systems, the frame rate to be used for a single camera is preset and defined at the time of system setup or startup. For example, the user may specify the frame rate for each single camera or specify time intervals when recording is required and\/or not required. Other conventional systems may have an intelligent mechanism that gives a higher frame rate to a camera if some movement is detected in the video data from that camera. In addition, the sensibility of movement may be configured or set to specific areas of the captured scene.","Prior arts of record can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,152 for \u201cDigital video recording system\u201d having a video camera directed at a scene of interest to continuously view the scene and generate video images of the scene at a predetermined frame rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,909 for \u201cTelevision camera and recording system for high definition television having imagers of different frame rate\u201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,617,150 for \u201cVideo bit rate control method\u201d for changing bit rate of video images for controlling picture quality.","However, conventional approaches for specifying frame rates for each camera in a system or specifying time intervals for recording result in sub-optimal and frequently inappropriate performance, especially where alarm sequences (more than one alarm is activated, consecutively) are considered in monitoring or surveillance systems. Moreover, as far as limitations in memory capacity, storage space in disks and other media, as well as limitations in bandwidth of communication channels are concerned, continuous recording of some or all cameras at a predetermined frame rate is neither feasible nor practical.","The present invention has been conceived in view of the above-mentioned problems and according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is proposed an apparatus for setting a frame rate under which images are captured by an imaging device in an image capturing system including a plurality of imaging devices and a plurality of sensors, the apparatus including: first reception unit for receiving a first signal from at least one of the sensors; association unit for associating the first signal with information related to the imaging device; calculation unit for calculating a frame rate of each of the plurality of imaging devices based on the association between the first signal and the information related to the imaging device; setting unit for setting the frame rate of the imaging device according to a result of calculation by the calculation unit; and second reception unit for receiving image data from the imaging device at a frame rate set by the setting unit.","Also, it is preferable such apparatus as described above includes a storage unit for storing configuration and setup data related to the association between the first signal and the information related to the imaging device and the frame rate settings; and a controller for controlling the imaging device according to the setup data.","Preferably, the information related to the imaging device includes information used for calculation of frame rate of the imaging device when the first signal is received from the detector.","Still, according to such preferred embodiment of the present invention, the storage unit stores association information between each detector of the plurality of detectors and each imaging device of the plurality of imaging devices in form of a matrix containing information used for calculation of frame rate of each imaging device when the first signal is received from the detector.","According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferable to set the frame rate of several imaging devices based on an input from one or more detectors.","It is also desirable to have frame rates for each camera changeable over time, for example, according to a predetermined function.","Moreover, calculation of frame rate to be set or allocated to each camera in the system is based on input from the detectors, i.e., alarm signals, and configuration of the system, i.e., settings associating imaging device with detectors or sensors, time function of the frame rates for each imaging device.","Furthermore, according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a frame rate changing method for changing frame rate of an imaging device in a surveillance system including a plurality of imaging devices and a plurality of sensors, the method having the steps of: receiving a first signal from one of the plurality of sensors; associating the first signal with information related to at least one of the plurality of imaging devices; calculating a frame rate of each of the plurality of imaging devices based on the association between the first signal and the information related to the imaging device; setting the frame rate of the imaging device according to a result of the calculation; and receiving image data from each of the plurality of imaging devices at a frame rate set by the setting unit.","An optimal surveillance system should be able to record as well as process and communicate image data from related cameras at the best quality as possible, for example, 30 frames per second. However, due to technical limitations and budget restrictions in actual systems, the amount of image data that can be recorded or transmitted at a given time or in the long run is limited. For example, a maximum frame rate supported by a capture card limits the amount of image data, typically video data, which can be recorded or encoded at a given time. Limitations in storage capacity, such as disk space, limit the amount of image data that can be recorded over a longer period of time.","The apparatus, system and method according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention aims at alleviating the above problems as it is proposed to select what camera should be allocated a larger amount of frame rates in response to alarm situations detected by detectors or sensors. In other words, according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, there is proposed an apparatus, a system and a method that permit realize selection of which camera's image data to record within the system and at what frame rate, at what moment and for how long. Given the proper inputs, the apparatus and system according to the present invention are able to calculate the required (for example, the minimum) frame rates for the cameras.","In addition, even with sufficiently capacity, a surveillance system such as a security system should be able to capture image data from the cameras that are most relevant to a given situation. The system, apparatus and method according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention as described above are aimed at allowing the user thereof to obtain a better quality image data of a specific monitored situation. This is achieved by allocating an increased frame rate to cameras that are set up as most crucial to capture relevant images from the alarm scene.","Also, the system, apparatus and method according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention as described above permit the installer of the system or the user to dynamically and flexibly configure and setup the security system so that the specific requirements or restrictions of the environment can be taken into consideration. As a result, it becomes possible to realize an optimum utilization of the available image capturing and or data processing resources.","For example, upon enabling selective allocation of frame rates according to the detector or sensor that has been activated, it becomes possible to obtain an increased amount of information related to the causes or events that caused the alarm, while for non-related images of other imaging devices it suffices not to capture any image at all or to capture images with reduced frame rate.","Such selective allocation of image frame rate according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention permits then to have a image (video) data of higher quality (as a result of images taken at a relatively higher frame rate) only for the relevant events.","By optimizing the utilization of the resources of the system, it is possible to reduce the required storage space and bandwidth for performing the same process.","Also, it is possible to have more reliable pre-alarm video\/image data as the system may be set so as to record such image data previous to the occurrence of the alarm with an allocation of a higher frame rate for the concerning or related imaging devices (cameras).","Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["1 ","M ","1 ","N"]},"The storage medium serves the purpose of storing data related to settings of the system, image data related to images captured by the imaging devices (cameras), data related to signals from the detectors, etc. In addition, the storage medium may include data related to a logical association between the detectors and the imaging devices of the systems. An example of data stored in the storage medium as such association between detectors and imaging devices is the detector-camera matrix containing frame rate values of frame rates as shown in . Also, an algorithm may be stored for calculating the frame rate, and a setup program. Such setup program may be either resident in the storage medium or may be loaded from an external storage medium to the CPU whenever required.","In addition, more than one detector-camera matrices may be stored in the storage medium, as different settings may be required for different possible situations or conditions under which a user may desire the system to be set to. Such situation may include different modes of operation of the household surveillance system, such as monitoring the house while the house is empty, a nighttime surveillance, surveillance when only kids or pets are left, when the user is at home, etc.","As already mentioned above, the matrix of the system according to the example of preferred embodiment of the present invention a matrix of size N\u00d7M, where M is the number of cameras Cto C, associated with N detectors Dto D. For each element E of the matrix, edenotes the number of frames that are used for the calculation of the frame rate that is to be assigned to the camera Cwhen the detector Doriginates a signal that the system detects as an alarm.","The storage medium may still have frame rate functions related to frame rate change according to time. These frame rate functions describe how the frame rate for each camera changes over time. Examples of frame rate functions are shown in  to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},"The type of frame rate function over time selected by the installer of the system, or eventually by the user, depends on parameters to consider, such as available storage space, bandwidth of the communication channels, potential relevance of the image data from a specific camera in association with a specific detector signal, etc. The function to be chosen is also dependent on the actual hardware (like available resources), the actual outline of the premises on what is going to be monitored or surveyed, preferences of the user and\/or installer, etc. Therefore, the possible frame rate functions to be adopted according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention should not be limited to the examples of function described or mentioned in this specification, so that many other forms may be applicable.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a number of predetermined frame rate functions are available to the person who is configuring the system. The functions maybe parameterized as necessary. For example, it is possible to set up a frame rate function for each detector in the system or, alternatively, each of an individual camera-detector combination may be set to its own frame-rate function.","Even through some of these functions may be of analog nature, capture cards might only accept full integer frame rates for camera settings. In such cases, the system would have to map the analog values returned from the functions to a value that will be accepted by the captured card. The procedure of mapping analog values will be omitted here as any such procedure is very well known in the conventional, prior art.","The algorithm for calculating the frame rate of the cameras recalculates the frame rates after (i) an alarm is triggered by a detector or (ii) after a predetermined period of time has elapsed, for example, every second. After an alarm, the frame rates are recalculated based on the values in the detector-camera matrix. It is assumed that two alarms, even if they occurred in parallel, are processed sequentially. After the predetermined period of time is elapsed, the frame rates are recalculated to reflect the specified frame rate functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The example of  shows a system having a group of detectors , a set of imaging devices represented by cameras , a capture card , interfaces  for the detectors, a CPU , a RAM (Random Access Memory) , a storage medium  and a network interface . The network interface is connected to a communication network  such as a local area network, a wide area network, either private or public, such as the Internet, through which the system communicates with a monitoring center , for example.","The CPU may communicate with the capture card  through an API (Application Programming Interface). On the other hand, the CPU  receives encoded image data (video, moving image data, for instance) from the capture card . The CPU also receives signals from the detectors  through the detector interface . The detector interface  can be a wireless receiver or a parallel port or any other interface that can take the detector signals as an input.","The CPU  sends control commands and image data over the network interface  and the communication network  to the monitoring center . The monitoring center  may also send commands to the CPU  through the communication network  and via the network interface  so that a business operator at the monitoring center can change the system settings and camera frame rates remotely. In addition, the monitoring center may include a server (not shown) for storing data related to a plurality of user, i.e., there may be data stored in such server related to a plurality of systems as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["130","130","210","212","214"]},"In addition, the information stored in the storage medium may be information that is transferred thereto from a detachable recording medium such as a disk medium  or an IC or semiconductor memory device  as shown in . The disk medium may include any kind of medium such a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk and the like. Also, for the present invention, there is no restriction of the IC or semiconductor memory  as to type of semiconductor memory and it may include any card or memory device complying with any standard.","Having the proper interface (not shown in the figures) for connection to the system of the present invention, such media may contain at least one of the data required for the system as mentioned above, such as the frame rate calculating algorithm , the setup program , etc.","Conversely, data from the storage medium may be transferred to the disk medium  and\/or the memory device , such as video the data  captured from one of the cameras . Also the setup parameters of the system may be stored in the detachable media for backup purposes, for example.","An example of camera-detector matrices, i.e., association between cameras  and detectors  is shown in , in which a plurality of tables are set according to operation modes Mode  to Mode P. Each matrix has Dto Ddetectors associated with Cto Cand their relationship, i.e., the frame rate eto be assigned to a camera C(where \u201cm\u201d is a positive integer ranging from 1 to M) in an event of activation of a detector D(where \u201cn\u201d is a positive integer ranging from 1 to M). Although not explicitly shown in the matrices of , it is a matter of course that it is preferable that each of the frame rates emay differ depending on the operation mode  to P that is activated.","Now,  shows a schematic view of a relationship between functional blocks corresponding to the process and calculations performed by an image capture apparatus and\/or system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The setup information  for the apparatus and\/or system according to the present invention includes the detector-camera matrices  with respective frame rate values and a frame rate function table  containing information that permit specify frame rate functions as, for example, those functions mentioned above. A frame rate calculating algorithm  utilizes the setup information  for calculating the frame rate under the conditions as mentioned above, i.e., at an activation of a detector, after a predetermined period of time and the like. The calculated frame-rates are then supplied to the capture card , which is part of the system according to the present invention as shown, for example, in .","In order to either set\/change the setup information or perform simulation of the operation of the system according to the present invention, user interfaces may be provided for the system and\/or apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the example shown in , a user interface  is associated to a method  to set and change set up information and a user interface  is associated to a simulation tool . Such interfaces provide means for a user or installer of the system and\/or apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention to inputting data for setup or changing settings of the system as well as for performing simulation of the operation of the system before activating the settings for actual operation.","An example of user interfaces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in  and , where  shows a schematic view of an interface for the system configuration, i.e., the setting and changing of the setting information of the system ( in ); and  shows a schematic view of a simulation tool ( in ) for simulating the results of input and setup. Such interfaces as shown in  and  may be represented in a display of a display terminal available at the monitoring center  as shown in  or at a terminal provided in the residence of the user or the local where the image capture system of the present invention is installed. An example of display is a screen display available in a personal computer on which the settings, image data and other information pertinent to the system according to the present invention, are input to the system through the conventional input unit available to the personal computer such as key boards, ten keys, audio input through microphones, data transfer from other personal computers, etc. The information is stored in a storage unit, available either inside the computer, such as a hard disk drive, or in a detachable recording or storage medium such as optical, magnetic, magneto-optical disks and the like, IC memories, semiconductor memories, etc.","In the display screen as exemplified in , the imaging system according to the present invention includes four detectors Det  to Det  associated to four cameras Cam  to Cam . In the figure, the camera Cam  has (at least) 10 frames per second allocated if detector Det  detects an alarm, while the other cameras are set zero frames per second. That means when detect Det  detects an alarm, priority is given to capture of images from camera Cam , while image from the others are not relevant. Also, according to the settings, Cam  is allocated 5 frames per second, Cam  is allocated 15 frames per second and Cam  is allocated 5 frames per second in the event of detector Det  being activated. Saving of such setting values are performed by striking or selecting an option \u201cSAVE\u201d as shown in the right side of the camera-detector matrix. Likewise, reset of the setting is performed through selection of \u201cRESET\u201d in the figure.","In addition, each detector has a frame rate function designation area, which corresponds to the bottom half of the display screen shown in . For example detector Det  has a function \u201cType C\u201d which corresponds, for example to the frame rate function as illustrated in .","The frame rate function of  has an initial value that remains constant for a first period of time and then is reduced to a smaller value and remains constant for a second period of time. Such first and second periods of time for the constant functions correspond to the parameters to be inputted to the system as shown in . The parameter Param  having value  for the detector Det  means the first higher value of frame rate is kept constant for 20 seconds, for example, and the second lower value, for example one half of the first frame rate is kept constant for 100 seconds, as indicated in parameter Param .","Likewise, the other detectors in  show function type A, which corresponds, for example to the frame rate function illustrated in , i.e., a constant value. Such constant value lasts 20 seconds, as designated through parameter Param , in the figure. Also, in a similar way as already described above, the function type and parameter may be either reset through the selection of \u201cRESET\u201d function or saved through the selection of \u201cSAVE\u201d function as illustrated in .","Now, the example of input interface for the Simulation Tool  of  is illustrated in . Upon settings of the system are performed, for example, through the configuration screen of , a simulation of the operations under the input conditions may be performed corresponding to change in frame rate allocation according to time lapse.","The specific example illustrated in  shows the result of simulation of the system after 21 seconds under the configuration of . In other words, as the parameter for time is set 20 seconds for all detectors as shown in , an alarm at detector Det  gives the frame rates of 15, 15, 0 and 0 for the cameras Cam , Cam, Cam  and Cam , respectively. Then, after the 20th second, i.e., 10 seconds after the previous alarm, another alarm at detector Det  is activated so that at the 21st second, the frame rates for the cameras Cam , Cam , Cam  and Cam  are respectively changed to 0, 10, 10 and 10 frames per second.","The simulation interface as illustrated in  also permits changing and\/or deletion of the alarm sequence. Moreover, a cursor represented by an arrow permits navigating over the timeline, so that the frame rate for each camera at a specific time may be shown. Furthermore, a graphic representation of the frame rates for each camera is shown in the bottom of .","Now a method for calculating individual frame rates will be described in the following with reference to  as an example of preferred embodiment of the present invention to be applied, for example, to the frame rate calculating algorithm  as shown in .","In step , it is verified whether or not an alarm has been detected by a detector in the system. If there is an alarm, the process goes to step , otherwise the process goes to step . In step , the frame rates of the cameras are calculated based on the current frame rate values of each camera and the settings that are stored in the matrix. Then, in step , it is verified whether the newly calculated frame rates differ from the current settings and then proceeds with step  if affirmative. In step , the changed frame rates are adjusted according to the capabilities of the system such as restrictions in storage capability, transmission rate, bandwidth, etc., as well as limitation imposed by switching and the like. The capture card is informed of the actual frame rates that should be allocated.","For example, even if the frame rate calculating algorithm calculates 15 frames per second for a first camera and a second camera in step , if the actual capture card can support only 15-13 frames per second because of switching, for example, then in step  the values calculated by the frame rate calculating algorithm (15-15) are changed to 15-13, which corresponds to frame rate values that the actual hardware can actually support.","Now, the procedure will be described for a case in which the system does not detect an alarm signal from the detectors. In that case, it is verified whether a time unit, i.e., a predetermined period of time, has elapsed. If so, the frame rates are calculated based on the frame rate functions that are set as already described above. If not, the process goes back to the beginning to check for an alarm signal, again.","Although the example of preferred embodiment as described above performs calculation of frame rates by means of the frame rate calculating algorithm  as shown in  and such frame rate calculating algorithm  loaded for example in the CPU  as shown in , it is also possible to perform frame rate calculation at the monitoring center  of  equipped with a central server and the like and located remotely in relation to the location in which the image capture system, for example, a surveillance system of the present invention is installed.","Examples of preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with more details as follows:","A first example of preferred embodiment of the present invention is described as a surveillance system for security purposes, installed in a residence, as shown in . The residence includes a house structure  having detectors , , , , etc. represented by circular shapes in the figure, and cameras , ,  and , represented by small rectangular shapes in the figure, as imaging devices for image capture in the event of alarm signals detected by any of the detectors. The detector may include any kind of detector that is placed in the house according to the desired event to be detected. For instance, movement detectors may be placed at doors, smoke detectors or sensors may be placed in the kitchen, vibration sensors may be placed at windows for detecting more than usual vibration or movement at windows, etc.","In the present example, it is assumed a capture card  as shown in  can support up to 30 frames per second for all cameras and only one matrix is considered for a case in which the security system is in an empty house mode, for example. The system setup for such system for the 4 cameras C (), C (), C () and C () are described in .","According to , if an alarm occurs at detector D (), camera C () is set to a minimum of 15 frames per second and camera C () is set to a minimum of 5 frames per second. On the other hand, if an alarm occurs at detector , camera C is set to a minimum of 5 frames per second, while camera C is set to a minimum of 15 frames per second and camera C is set to at least 5 frames per second.","Furthermore, it is assumed in this first example of preferred embodiment of the present invention that the frame rate function is the same for each detector. Such frame rate function may have a shape as shown in .","Assuming that somebody passes through the main entrance door  of the house schematically shown in , an alarm is triggered at the movement detector , which is, for example, placed outside the house, near the main entrance door. The system may be configured such that images from the camera  behind the door are recorded as soon as somebody triggers an alarm at the detector in front of the door. That leads to \u201cpre-alarm\u201d video and more meaningful information regarding the recording of images related to the event of alarm trigger. In this present example, the system setup is achieved by setting the first line in the matrix as shown in . Specifically, when an alarm is detected by detector , the frame rate for the camera  is set to 5 frames per second, as shown in .","A second example of preferred embodiment of the present will be described as follows.  shows a frame rate matrix for a surveillance system in which there are 4 cameras available, namely camera C, C, C and C associated with a plurality of detectors D, D, etc. The matrix in the figure is simplified to show only the frame rates to be allocated for alarms detected by detectors D and D. It is also assumed that the system has a configuration similar to that shown in , so the system has a capture card  and this capture card has capacity to support 30 frames per second.","The values in the matrix show the specification for minimum frame rates, i.e., after an alarm occurred at a given detector, the frame rates for the cameras have to be set to at least the frame rate specified in the matrix. If an alarm at another detector occurs shortly after a previous alarm, not all frame rate requests might be satisfied due to the overall frame rate limitation of the system. Considering the detector-camera matrix of , an alarm at detector D will set the frame rates at camera C and C to 15 frames per second each. An alarm at detector D will set the frame rate at camera C to 10 frames per second. If an alarm at detector D is followed by an alarm at detector D, it will be required to reduce the frame rates at cameras C and C because the capture card, as already mentioned, supports only up to 30 frames per second. In that case, an alarm at detector D requiring 15 frame rates for cameras C and C, followed by an alarm at detector D requiring 10 frames per second for camera C, results that cameras C and C will have together a maximum of 20 frames per second to share, for example, 10 frames per second each.","The following description clarifies the situation.  shows schematic diagrams of allocated frame rates for each camera in the case an alarm is detected at detector D, according to .  shows allocated frame rates for each camera in the case an alarm is detected at detector D according to .  shows a case in which there are consecutive alarms at detectors D and D, respectively.","More specifically, an alarm at detector D occurs at the tenth second in the timeline as shown in . As a result, according to the matrix of , the frame rate of cameras C and C are set to 15 frames per second. Considering that the frame rate function for the cameras is the same function as shown in  for all cameras, i.e., the frame rate remaining constant for a period of time of 20 seconds and turning to zero thereafter, the frame rates for the cameras C and C remains at 15 frames per second for 20 seconds. In the example of , no other alarm occurs during the 20 seconds subsequent to the alarm at detector D.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1","2","1","1","2","2","1","3","2","1","2","1","2","3"]},"Furthermore, it is possible to provide a simulation tool for system according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, in which the settings and parameters of the system are input as in the actual system and then the signals from the detectors are simulated as data that is manually input by the installer of the system, for example. By simulating the inputs of the system, it is possible to verify the behavior, i.e., how the images from each camera come as a result of activation of the detectors, so as to assure the system will operate with the expected results, and if not, a readjustment may be performed until the outputs are satisfactory.","Although the present invention having been described hereinabove in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularity, other changes, variations, combinations and sub-combinations are possible therein. It is therefore to be understood to those of ordinary skill in the art that any modifications will be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein without departing from the scope the present invention.","For example, the description above has been carried out in part describing a configuration in which the system controls the frame rates of the imaging devices (cameras), it is possible to have a system in which the frame rates are adjusted for the capture card, i.e., although the cameras keep a same frame rate as they are set in the beginning, the changes are made for the way the images are processed and transmitted within the system. As the restrictions of the system lies on storage space, bandwidth and processing capacity, processing speed of the system, etc., adjustments of frame rate may be performed immediately before the unit or section or step that has the limitation.","Moreover, although the examples of preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described for detectors, it is possible to have sensors instead of detectors, so that a switching device sending an ON\/OFF (1\/0) signal should be sufficient to work as a device for providing input for the system.","In addition, the monitoring center  of , which may be typically administrated by a monitoring business provider, has been described as a single apparatus or system. However, it is possible to provide a configuration in which there is two or more similar security servers separated according to criteria like geographical distribution of users, volume of data, time, classification of users, type of event causing alarm (intrusion, accident, telephone call, visits, etc.).","Also, the displays and layouts for the system settings, the interface for the configuration too, the simulation tool, the terminal of the monitoring center, etc. may be of layouts and format different from what has been presented above.","Moreover, functional units described in the block diagrams as been separated may be actually realized as a same physical unit or apparatus. Conversely, functions that have been described above as been included in a same functional block may be separated in different blocks or be incorporated in other blocks.","In addition the network interfaces and data interfaces between the server at the monitoring center  and the system of the present invention transmitting data through the communication network  may include converters available in existing modems, routers, communication hubs or server units, either wireless or not, utilized in combination with purposes and functions other than specifically described for the preferred embodiments of the present invention.","Although the description of the present system having been made focused on an application for surveillance for home or household security against intruders, violation of private property such as robbing or theft, security monitoring and alarm against gas leakage, fire, smoke or the like, it is possible to apply the embodiments of present invention for monitoring activity such as movement in the house when elderly or physically and\/or psychologically challenging people, infants, children or pets are left in the house, so that the activity may be, for example, constantly monitored or alarm may be triggered if a designated object is touched or activated, such as inadvertent activation of electronic appliances, falling objects, broken objects, voice or sound level above a predetermined level (crying, etc.) or the like.","Especially in case of elderly people or disabled people, the application of the present invention may be significant for social welfare purposes other than for simple home security purposes. For example, a switch that is conventionally set in a hot water pot may serve as a sensor for detecting activation of the house appliance. If the time period between one activation of the hot water pot and the next activation exceed a predetermined period of time (for example, 6 hours), an alarm signal may indicate an abnormality, as the person may have stopped normal life activity within the house. Likewise, a sensor may be installed to detect utilization of resources that are presumed essential for life activity within a house, such as utilization of water or light within the house, so that the sensors or the preferred embodiments of the present invention may include switches, sensors, devices or apparatuses already existing for other purposes instead of dedicated apparatuses for the only purpose of monitoring.","It is therefore to be noted that the preferred embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the above-mentioned examples of preferred embodiments, so that examples of preferred embodiments of the present invention and equivalents thereof may be appropriately modified, combined, sub-combined, etc., to be implemented within the scope and the spirit of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects and features of a preferred embodiment of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["1 ","M ","1 ","N"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"130"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 11"],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 11"],"b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
