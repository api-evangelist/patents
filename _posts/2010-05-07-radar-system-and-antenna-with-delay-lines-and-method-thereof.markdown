{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The embodiments herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.","Moving target indicator radars have been used to detect and track targets since World War II. In searching for targets, a narrow beam is typically scanned through a large area of interest. Radar searches in years after WWII were mechanically performed by rotating an antenna on a gimbal. For more recently developed systems, the beam is scanned electronically with a phased array antenna using switches, ferroelectric, or other active devices. Phased array antennas can be expensive and consume large amounts of power. Another less expensive approach for scanning a radar beam is to use a frequency scanning antenna. In systems using frequency scanning antennas, there is a trade-off between generally good angular resolution in exchange for poor range resolution. Frequency scanning antennas, however, do not typically support 2-D scanning and high range resolution system requirements. Consequently, radars using frequency scanning antennas have poor range resolution but good angular resolution.","Numerous techniques have been developed to reduce the cost, size, and power requirements of electronically scanning antennas (ESA). One technique to reduce the cost is to aperiodically place a smaller number of antenna elements across an aperture as described in more detail in J. T. Bernhard, et al, \u201cWideband random phased arrays: theory and design\u201d, Wideband and Multi-band Antennas and Arrays, 2005, hereby incorporated by reference. This technique that has been shown to be feasible based upon performance metrics such as peak sidelobe level as described in Y. T. Lo, \u201cA mathematical theory of antenna arrays with randomly spaced elements,\u201d IEEE Trans. on Antennas and Prot., vol. 12, pp. 257-268, March 1964, hereby incorporated by reference (hereinafter \u201cLo Mathematical Theory Article\u201d). The \u201cLo Mathematical Theory Article,\u201d explores the possibility of a large antenna array with randomly spaced elements and finds the required number of elements is closely related to the desired sidelobe level and is almost independent of the aperture dimension, the resolution (or the beam width) depends mainly on the aperture dimension, and the directive gain is proportional to the number of elements used if the average spacing is large. The \u201cLo Mathematical Theory Article\u201d points to then recent advances in space exploration as having shown a great need for antennas with high resolution, high gain and low sidelobe level. Although the \u201cLo Mathematical Theory Article\u201d touches upon the use of \u201chigh speed computers,\u201d the focus is on a technique for optimizing the design of phased arrays.","In the radar system disclosed in Statutory Invention Registration No. H1773, entitled Ultra-wideband Active Electronically Scanned Antenna, the elements are spaced by \u03bb\/2 and the maximum delay corresponds to 360\u00b0 of phaseshift. The various lines feeding the elements of the array at the aperture have bias delays that make them all equal in length, thereby giving a broadside beam.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a radar system with both good range and angular resolution at low cost and low power while having Electronically Scanning Array (ESA) capability without requiring elaborate phase shifters or other high cost precision active elements. A preferred embodiment is a radar system architecture comprising a plurality of receiving frequency scanning antenna elements operatively connected to delay lines whose lengths are somewhat randomly selected. The inputted (received) signal data is processed using digital signal processing algorithms. This architecture uses temporal diversity rather than spatial diversity to reduce the cost and improve the performance on the system.","Conceptually, substantially orthogonal beam patterns at the receive antenna are generated at each frequency with varying levels of energy spread spatially across the single element antenna pattern. Then, signal processing algorithms, based upon techniques such as least squares and maximum likelihood can be used to detect and track the targets of interest. From information theory, the maximum information content of a signal is obtained when the data has a uniform distribution and minimum information content when the data has a delta-like distribution. See C. E. Shannon, \u201cA Mathematical Theory of Communication,\u201d Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, pp. 379-423, 623-656, July, October, 1948, for a detailed description (hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. Traditionally, antenna patterns are delta-like functions, which are scanned across a field of view. More information about the targets is obtainable using a series of patterns that have distributions more closely resembling a uniform distribution.","A preferred embodiment architecture is based upon a 1-D linear array feed with predetermined fixed length lines (producing phase shifts; preferably selected with uniform distribution). The major advantages of a preferred embodiment architecture are a simple radar RF design, an antenna with no active elements, and a data acquisition system may be comprised of a single analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Previously, disadvantages associated with systems of this nature included the drawbacks of more complicated signal processing, reduction of the effective signal processing gain associated with the antenna system relative to a similar sized antenna, and increased potential ambiguities associated with target localization.","The radar system of a preferred embodiment comprises input and output developed with the goal of having near orthogonal beams as a function of frequency in the receiving antenna subsystem. Orthogonal beam patterns are illustrated in . The inventive concept embodied in a preferred embodiment supports arbitrary waveforms and arbitrary antenna placement. Unlike the electronically scanned antenna disclosed Statutory Registration No. H1773, there is no need make the elements of the array with bias delays all equal in length. Instead, the antenna element placement does not require positioning in an symmetrical, equally spaced array as set forth in Statutory Registration No. H1773, but instead enables irregular, nonplanar, or arbitrary placement of the antenna elements on objects which are irregular or atypical radar supporting positions. The preferred waveform generator  generates a continuous wave (CW) stepped-frequency waveform; as depicted in the block diagram in . In , the radar signal is transmitted through a single antenna and received with an array of antenna elements that are combined with feed lines of somewhat \u201crandom\u201d length (relative to conventional systems). The received signal is amplified, down converted, then smoothed with a band pass filter (BPF). A preferred embodiment can be provided such that only signals from targets moving at a sufficient velocity will pass to the ADC. The element antenna patterns for both transmit and receive antenna elements are substantially identical, with the system processing enough information to track moving targets in stationary clutter.","The velocity of the targets can be determined by performing a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on the time samples collected at each frequency. Conceptually, the range information on moving targets can be obtained by performing a DFT across the Doppler processed results after motion compensation and windowing. Conceptually, the angle of the targets can be determined using techniques such as matched filter processing or least squares estimation. To estimate target parameters, stochastic optimization techniques can be developed. The feasibility of estimating the target parameters is determined by analyzing a cost function based upon the Euclidian norm.","The radar system comprises a receiving antenna array comprising a plurality of receiving antenna elements for receiving previously transmitted electromagnetic waves reflected from targets and a plurality delay lines (the plurality of delay lines and antenna elements may be equal in number and coupled together; each delay line may be of random length), each of the plurality of receiving antenna elements being operatively associated with a predetermined delay line; each delay line having a delay length which produces a different phase delay; the different phase delays producing substantially orthogonal waveform data. Optimally, the waveform data from each delay line is substantially orthogonal to the waveform data from each other delay line. Accordingly, a preferred embodiment set of delay lines provide delays or phase shifts in the range of 20\u03bb; with intervals of delays between the delay lines being substantially uniform. For example, in the case of 40 antenna elements, each delay line would have a delay of at least \u03bb\/2 from each other delay line.","A preferred embodiment radar system may further comprise an amplifier coupled to the plurality of delay lines for amplifying the antenna signal data; a down-converter coupled to the amplifier which down-converts the amplified antenna signal data; a data acquisition system coupled to the down-converter for detecting the targets, and a processing system. The data acquisition system may comprise an analog-to-digital converter which converts the down-converted antenna signal data to digital antenna signal data. The processing system (coupled to the data acquisition system) detects and localizes the targets and estimates a position and velocity of the targets.","The system may include a band pass filter coupled to the amplifier and the down-converter, for filtering, inter alia, the amplified antenna signal data. The down-converter down-converts at least one of filtered antenna signal data and amplified antenna signal data. In addition, the data acquisition system may further comprise a digital signal processor coupled to the analog-to-digital converter, wherein the digital signal processor detects and localizes the targets from the digital antenna signal data.","In a preferred embodiment, at least one processor or processing system may estimate angle, range, and velocity of the targets. The angle of the targets may be estimated by a matched filter and\/or minimizing a weighted square error. Furthermore, at least one processor or processing system may estimate at least one of a velocity and a position of the detected targets. In addition, at least one processor or processing system may calculate a statistical optimization to determine at least one of a velocity and a position of a target, and the statistical optimization may be used to calculate a minimum value to a cost function formulation. Optionally, at least one processor or processing system may comprise a digital signal processor.","Another embodiment comprises an antenna array fed with randomly selected delay lines, comprising a plurality of antenna elements; a plurality of delay lines which may be of random length, each operatively connected to an antenna element; a data acquisition system coupled to the plurality of delay lines comprising an analog-to-digital converter; and a digital signal processor processing the electromagnetic wave data; and a processing system coupled to the data acquisition system, wherein the processing system detects the target and outputs location information of the target. The plurality of antenna elements may comprise a linear array or be positioned in a nonplanar configuration. Moreover, there may be non-linear (or different) spacing between the plurality of antenna elements. Additionally, at least one processor or e processing system may estimate an angle of the target by at least one of a matched filter and minimizing a weighted square error. In addition, at least one processor or processing system may estimate at least one of a velocity and a position of the target. Additionally, the analog-to-digital converter of the data acquisition system may comprise a single slow-speed analog-to-digital converter.","An amplifier may be utilized to amplify the gathered electromagnetic wave data. The processing system may be remotely located from the antenna array.","A preferred methodology comprises determining location information of a target from electromagnetic wave data, comprising receiving the electromagnetic wave data from a antenna array with randomly selected delay lines; amplifying the received electromagnetic wave data; down-converting the received electromagnetic wave data; filtering the received electromagnetic wave data; and processing the received electromagnetic wave data to determine the location information. The processing step may comprise performing a discrete Fourier Transform on time samples of the received electromagnetic wave data.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

Referring now to the drawings, where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.","As noted above, embodiments described herein are cost efficient and have both good range and angular resolution in addition to simultaneously searching for multiple targets. The embodiments described below may utilize RF waveforms and may be constructed with no active elements, and the data acquisition system that may include a single slow-speed analog-to-digital converter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","1","10","20","30","40","50","70","80","90","40","45","45","50","40","50","50","60","1","65","30","60","70","95","80"]},"To facilitate signal processing, a preferred embodiment radar system  may be based upon a CW stepped-frequency waveform (e.g., generated from CW waveform generator ). The generated signal is then transmitted through an antenna (e.g., transmitting antenna ) and received with a plurality of antenna elements (e.g., receiving antenna array ) that are combined with delay lines (e.g., delay lines ) of varying length. The received signal may be amplified (e.g., via receiving amplifier ), down-converted (e.g., via digital down-converter , then smoothed with a band pass filter (e.g., band pass filter ). After the received signal is amplified, down-converted and smoothed, excessive noise is removed and only signals reflected from moving targets will pass to an analog-to-digital converter (e.g., analog-to-digital converter ) and processed to obtain location information. Location information may include, but is not limited to, the latitude, longitude, elevation, velocity and\/or acceleration, etc. of a target or targets.","The performance of radar system  may be improved in a number of different ways which includes increases in the percent bandwidth of the waveform, the length of the time delays attributable delay lines  (as described in further detail below), and the number of antenna elements in antenna array ; for example 64 receiving antenna elements. In addition, performance improvements may be achieved by incorporating multiple subarrays, where each subarray includes its own antenna array  with a dedicated ADC . In addition, processing subsystem  may be remotely located from antenna array . For example, while not shown, Doppler detections (as discussed in further detail below) that exceed an adaptive threshold could be wirelessly transmitted to a central computer (not shown in ) for further processing. Transmitting to a central computer (not shown in ) may reduce the cost, size, and power requirements of radar system  and allow lightweight antenna arrays to be widely distributed without requiring extensive possessing capabilities at each antenna array site. Although the power, size, and cost of the central computer system (not shown in ) are unconventional compared to traditional radar systems and may be larger than traditional radar systems, such a central computer system could serve multiple roles and be located in a secure and remote location with adequate resources.","As described in further detail below, radar system  captures enough information for processing subsystem  to track moving targets in stationary clutter. In addition, as described in further detail below, embodiments of the data acquisition system described herein may also determine the velocity of the targets by performing a discrete Fourier transform (\u201cDFT\u201d) on the time samples collected at each frequency. The range information on moving targets may be obtained by performing a DFT across the Doppler processed results. Various unconventional effects, such as aliasing, quadratic errors, and large amplitude modulations on the Doppler processed data, limit the use of DFT processing techniques in the embodiment shown in . In addition, as described in further detail below, the angle of the targets can be determined using various estimation techniques; for example, matched filter processing and least squares estimation. Moreover, stochastic optimization techniques are described below to simultaneously estimate various target parameters using a cost function based upon the Euclidian norm. Embodiments described herein, however, are not limited to the optimization techniques described below and other optimization techniques are known to those skilled in the art and can be utilized without undue experimentation.","In operation, the continuous waveform generator  that is stepped in frequency transmits a beam pattern through the transmitting antenna . Upon striking a target or the like, the return of the varying frequency beam pattern to array A-D will give antenna patterns at different frequencies. Although 4 antenna elements are shown in , the present invention is not limited to 4 antenna elements and may comprise, for example, 64 antenna elements.  illustrates the transmitted radar beam Rand the beam Rreflected from the pth target. Conceptually, orthogonal beam patterns at the receiver antenna will be generated at each frequency with varying levels of energy spread spatially. When adding up signals from targets at different angles, the data will experience random constructive and destructive interference. In theory, if a target is present and the waveforms are orthogonal, then a maximum will be produced indicating the presence of a target. Conversely, in theory, the orthogonal waveforms will sum to zero when a target is not present. The orthogonal feature is derived from the long delay lines. Each delay line puts a different phase shift on the signal. In a preferred embodiment, the delay lines are structured such that there is a variance from 10\u03bb to 30\u03bb (each \u03bb being 360\u00b0). The delay lines can be varied to produce varying delays, for example, by varying the length of the lines. The delay lines produce a phase shift which changes as a function of frequency. In addition, each antenna element  A-D will receive data at a multiplicity of angles depending on the location of the target(s). The data in essence presents a nonlinear problem to be solved to resolve target presence and\/or location. A preferred embodiment may use a cost function analysis to derive or substantiate the target presence and\/or location.","Elements used to produce the delay may include ferroelectric phase shift elements. For example, a delay may be produced by applying a voltage to a ferroelectric material. As to the number of delay lines and elements A-X, there could be 64 delay lines and antenna elements, uniformly varied from ten to thirty \u03bb.","As used herein, the terminology \u201cnonlinear problem solving\u201d or \u201cnonlinear programming,\u201d in the context of mathematical solutions, is the process of solving a system of equalities and inequalities, collectively termed constraints, over a set of unknown real variables, along with an objective function to be maximized or minimized, where some of the constraints or the objective function are nonlinear.","As used herein the terminology \u201ccost function analysis\u201d or \u201cfunction value analysis\u201d means the derivation of a solution using nonlinear problem solving for the purpose of optimizing a parity between system's functions or properties (also known as value) and \u201ccosts\u201d associated with those functions or properties. In , for example, the X velocity and Y velocity are plotted on the x and y axis. The color range is shown to the right where the target is set to 0 dB (corresponding to red) to over 5.5 dB (corresponding to the color dark blue). The target \u201cappears\u201d in  in red at a location ,  corresponding to a target having and x and y velocity of 15 m\/sec.","Analysis of the 1-D antenna patterns provide insight into more complicated system identification problems. 1-D antenna patterns were simulated and analyzed for a radar system similar to the block diagram shown in . For stationary targets, the bandpass filter  shown in  was removed. The geometry associated with a 1-D array with N antenna elements for the pth target is shown in .","For a step frequency waveform, the returned normalized electric field from P stationary point scatter targets in the x-y plane is given by Equation (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"P"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","p"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03c0","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"f","mn":"0"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":["m","\u0394","f"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},"mi":"c"}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"R","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["T","p"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","p"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}}}}]}}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sup":["th ","th ","th ","th ","th ","th ","th "],"sub":["0 ","Tp ","p","op","p","n","op ","p ","n "],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["r","n","R","+nL ","+d","+K"]},"From measurements of E(m), an estimate is obtained of the angle of arrival, \u03b8p for each target. A standard approach to estimate \u03b8p is to use a bank of matched filters. The matched filter output can be described as an inner product between the measured data and the selected matched filter as shown below\n\n(\u03b8)=(),()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere w(m) is the normalized electric field for a single point target at an angle of \u03b8, range of zero; calculated using Equation (1).

one would like the terms on the left hand side of Equation (5) to add to zero or near zero for \u03b8\u2260\u03b8. This would result in a beam pattern with no or small sidelobes. It is desirable to select optimal lengths for the delay lines to minimize the sidelobes calculated from Equation (5). Obtaining this goal is a complex nonlinear problem. One preferred embodiment approach is to use delay lines with a random statistical distribution, then find solutions that minimize the expected value of a cost function. Using this preferred embodiment approach, it is observed that the first term in Equation (5) is independent of the delay line length, so it's expected value cannot be set to zero by randomly varying the lengths of the delay line. An unbiased solution can be obtained by selecting the probability distributions of the delay lines so that the bias from the remaining terms in Equation (5) cancels the first term. However, the realization is subject to difficulties. Another solution is to ignore the bias created by the first term and then statistically minimize the contributions from the remaining terms, which is examined further herein.","A preferred embodiment way to optimize the length of the delay lines  is to minimize the expected value of the power in the side lobes from the matched filter processing. The expected value of the contributions from all the terms except the first will be zero if the probability distributions of the phase differences caused by the random delays are uniformly distributed from 0 to 2\u03c0 for all combinations. However, this distribution is not realizable in hardware. If the delay lines are very long, the distributions will be approximately uniformly distributed due to the modulation of the phase by 2\u03c0. This occurs when the length of the delay lines  satisfy the equation\n\n()\u03941\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere n=0, . . . N\u22121 and m=0, . . . N\u22121 for all m and n except when m=n. This is not a requirement, but should provide a best case scenario for an approach based upon statistical optimization. This will result in sidelobe levels (SL) proportional

The results indicate that eigenvalues are near zero around the 30eigenvalue. Clearly, the antenna patterns are not orthogonal. The rank of the matrix can be improved by using more elements, longer delay lines, and more bandwidth, but it is never full rank for a realizable system.","1-D antenna patterns were simulated using algorithms based upon matched filter processing and weighted least squares (WSLQ). The matrices required for the WLSQ fit were generated by sampling the array manifold vector in angle every \u03c0\/512 radians and the matrix inverse was computed in Matlab using the pseudo inverse function. The results are shown in .

The localization of the crossrange position will be more sensitive to noise, but the global minimum is centered around the correct value and is slightly wider than the value predicted by the Rayleigh criteria. This result is expected, since the stationary 1-d antenna patterns also had large sidelobes. The sidelobes of the cost function plots can be improved by changing the radar and waveform parameters. Increases in the percent bandwidth of the waveform, the length of the time delays, and the number of elements will reduce the sidelobes in the plots of the cost functions. Also, performance improvements can be achieved by extended this concept from a single array with one ADC to multiple subarrays with a dedicated ADC for each subarray. These results indicate that it is possible to estimate the position and velocity of a point scatter target from 2-D slices of the proposed cost function with resolution close to the Rayleigh criterion.","As described herein, a preferred embodiment radar architecture comprises a single input and single output that supports 3-d electronically scanning of moving targets with high spatial resolution. The architecture is based upon a frequency scanning antenna with random length feed lines. The feasibility of the architecture to perform target localization in position and velocity was confirmed by analyzing 1-D antenna patterns and a cost function based upon an L-norm. As described above, a single realization of the system was selected, simulated, and analyzed. The results indicate that the concept is feasible, but require a high SNR and complex signal processing.","For the selected parameters, the 1-D antenna patterns generated using matched filter and weighted least squares processing had high sidelobe levels. To improve the results, the sidelobes were nulled over all angles except the desired angular region. A final antenna pattern was formed by taking the minimum value of each antenna pattern at every angle. This resulted in antenna patterns with resolution predicted by classical array theory, but it required increased signal processing and it is susceptible to interference by other targets. Although 1-D antenna patterns were described in the foregoing description, 2-D patterns can be generated using the same techniques.","Target localization will require nonlinear optimization of a cost function. 2-D slices of a cost function base upon Lnorm indicate that global minimum exist for localizing simple targets. However, the y-position estimate had a relatively small separation between other competing local minimum. The range and velocity resolution seen in the plots of the cost function are consistent with the range and velocity resolution calculated from the Rayleigh criterion.","Generally, the solution to the localization algorithm may be calculated off the radar platform. Doppler detections that exceed a given threshold could be wirelessly transmitted to a central computer for more processing. This will reduce the cost, size, and power requirements of the radar front end. The power, size, and cost of the central computer system would be larger than traditional radar systems, but it could serve multiple roles and be located in a secure location with adequate resources.","Radar system , shown in , can also detect, and then estimate, the location and velocity of targets in its field of view.
