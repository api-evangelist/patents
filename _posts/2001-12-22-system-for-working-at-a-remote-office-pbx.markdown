title: System for working at a remote office PBX
abstract: An arrangement that includes at least two PBXs interconnected by a network employs CTI ports to control operation of the PBXs. Through such control, a user can set up a telephonic presence in a visited PBX such that, to the user and to all others who interact with the user, it appears that the user is at the user's office, rather than at an office that is served by the visited PBX. This is effected by forwarding calls that are destined to the user at the user's office to the visited PBX, and by translating all dialing commands of the user at the visited PBX, and acting upon the translated commands, so as to provide the user with the features available to the user at the user's office while presenting an appearance to called parties that the user is at the user's office.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention is related to application filed on Jun. 28, 2001, titled \u201cAn Arrangement for Work-at-Home Telecommunication Services,\u201d which bears the Ser. No. 09\/894,173, and which is hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to telephony and, more particularly, to arrangements that offer virtual telephonic presence at a telephone that is coupled to a switch, such as a PBX.","Many employers have more than one location where they have offices. Moreover, many of theses offices are large enough to need a PBX to satisfy the telephonic needs of the employees in those offices. At times, an employee whose office is in location A needs to be at an office in location B for some period of time, and while there, wishes to conduct normal business. It is desirable to have it appear\u2014to all with whom the employee interacts telephonically\u2014that the employee is in the employee's office at location A.","It is noted that call transfer, where an employee at location A conditions the PBX at location A to transfer call that are directed to a particular extension to some other telephone, is known. However, it is not known how to create the general appearance, to both the employee and others with whom the employee interacts, that the employee is at her office in location A.","In an arrangement that includes at least two PBXs and a network that interconnects the PBXs, an advance in the art is achieved through the user of a Computer Telephone Interface (CTI) port of the PBXs that are interconnected through a network. The CTI port of a PBX can provide information about its associated PBX, and can accept signals that control the PBX's operation. Means are provided in this arrangement to specify that the user's telecommunications presence in the user's home PBX is transported to another, visited, one of the PBXs, and to condition the arrangement for the user's telecommunication interactions with the visited PBX. More specifically, a process is established that allows the user to interact with the visited PBX in the same manner as if the user were in the user's home PBX, and achieving precisely the same results. This allows others to reach the user at the visited PBX as if the user were interacting with the user's home PBX. Stated differently, a process is established for the user to have a virtual presence in the user's home office (interacting with the home PBX), while the actual presence of the user is at a visited office (interacting with a visited PBX). This is accomplished by providing the visited PBX with access to means that translates all actions taken by the user in the visited PBX and informs the visited PBX how to response to the user actions. The home PBX is provided with a means for transferring calls that are destined to the user in a manner that hides from calling parties that the user actually interacts with the visited PBX.","In an illustrated embodiment, the CTI ports of the PBXs are interconnected through a digital network, and the translation means is a separate computer that is also connected to the digital network. Separate means are provided in the illustrated embodiment for conditioning the user's home and visited PBX for the virtual telecommunications presence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","200","10","11","12","13","150","100","10","16","19","20","10","20","18","19","10","20"]},"PBX  also includes a CTI port , through which the functionality of the PBX can be controlled pursuant to an established protocol. PBX's with a CTI port are readily available in the prior art; for example, the DEFINITY\u00ae family of PBXs sold by Lucent Technologies, Inc. CTI port  is connected to digital network  through computer , which forms a gateway that allows access to port  only for bona fide communication. More specifically, computer  performs three functions: (1) encryption and decryption of communication messages to insure that communication messages via digital network  are secure, (2) protocol conversions from whatever protocol is employed in messages arriving at computer  to the particular Application Programming Interface (API) that is used by PBX  at port , and (3) authentication, making sure that the party that accesses PBX  via port \u2014in order to obtain information from PBX  or to control operation of PBX \u2014is authorized to get the sought information or to exercise the desired control. The operation of computer  is completely conventional.","For purposes of this disclosure, it is assumed that PBX  offers numerous conventional features to telephone . One such feature is that each time telephone  originates a call over one of the lines by which it is connected to PBX , the PBX a generates a signal (caller ID signal) that transmits Alice's telephone number to the called party. Another feature is that a call that goes unanswered for a certain number of rings is routed to a messaging platform that, effectively, forms an integral part of PBX . The messaging platform offers the calling party the opportunity to leave (record) a message for Alice, or to be transferred to another party, such as Alice's secretary. When a message is stored for Alice, PBX  is adapted to provide an indication at telephone  that a message is waiting, for example by lighting a \u201cmessage waiting\u201d light. Alice can retrieve stored messages from any extension of PBX  by simply dialing an extension number and providing a password. Yet another feature that is available in most PBXs is that any telephone that is connected to PBX  can call any other telephone that is connected to PBX  by simply dialing the extension number (typically, the last four digits of the telephone number) of the called party. Other features are also possible, such as abbreviated dialing, speed dialing, directory-assistance (finding the extension number of a person who has a telephone assigned on PBX ), etc.","In the  embodiment, location A includes one or more computers that are connected to digital network , such as computer , to enable interactions with CTI port  and with the CTI ports of other PBXs, as described more detail below. Computer  may be located, for example, in office A.","Location B is similar to location A in that it includes PBX  to which telephone , located in office B of location B, is connected. PBX  is connected to PSTN  via trunks , , and , and is connected to digital network  via CTI port , through gateway computer . In addition, location B includes computer  that is connected to network , possibly located in the office B.","Lastly, the embodiment shown in  includes computer  that is coupled to digital network . This computer is, effectively, a go-between computer that relieves some of the processing burdens that would otherwise be imposed on PBXs  and  (and potentially many other PBXs that are coupled to the networks  and ). It should be understood, however, that computer  is included in the  embodiment for illustrative purposes, and that embodiments that do not use computer , but rather rely on the processing power of the processors attached to the PBXs, are also viable. It should also be understood that use of digital network  is, likewise, illustrative, and that the same functionality can be achieved exclusively with PSTN  (e.g., with modems interfacing computers , , , and  to PSTN )\u2014provided, however, that the connections between elements , , and  are always \u201con.\u201d In other words, the functionality of network  is served by any means that provides security and requires no action such as dial-up (not counting authentication processes) before communication can proceed. For purposes of this disclosure, such a means is a connection-less network. A network  that is separate from PSTN  can be the Internet, a private network, or a virtual private network. Of course, when network  is inherently secure, encryption and decryption at the gateway computers can be dispensed with.","As indicated above, it is desired to provide a means, and a process, by which Alice can be present in a visiting office, such as office B within location B, where telephone  is connected to PBX , but yet, in her telecommunications interactions, it should appear\u2014to her and to others\u2014as if she is in office A. Effectively, it is desired for Alice to be virtually present in office A while being physically present in office B. Creating this virtual presence is effected with a set-up process that modifies operation of the PBX in Alice's usual office in location A, i.e., PBX , modifies operation of the PBX in the visited office, and installs information in computer . The set-up process can be executed from any computer that is connected to digital network , such as computer  in office A or computer  in office B. It can also be executed from computer  directly. However, only authorized persons can initiate such a process, and the authorized persons have a strictly defined range of controls that they can effect. For example, it may be arranged that only Alice is authorized to condition PBX  and computer  to transfer her virtual presence away from telephone  in office A, but also arranged that Alice can so condition PBX  only with respect to telephone . Advantageously, it is arranged that if a person is found to be authorized to move a virtual presence away from some telephone, that person is also authorized to install a virtual presence in any desired extension of any visited PBX, provided that the visited PBX (e.g., PBX ) is conditioned to allow importing a presence to the desired extension (e.g., the extension of telephone ).","Thus, the virtual-presence operation of the  arrangement begins when Alice decides to leave office A and go to office B and, accordingly, initiates a set-up for her presence in office B. As indicated above, this set-up can be initiated from any computer that is connected to network  but, most conveniently, it is initiated from computer  in office A, or from computer  in office B.  presents one flowchart for a set-up process in accordance with the principles of this disclosure, assuming that Alice initiates the set-up from office B, i.e., from computer .","The process starts with Alice logging into computer  (step ), identifying herself to computer  and requesting a \u201cpresence modification\u201d from her usual office (in location A) telephone (534-123-8888) to a visitor office B in location B that, for example, has the telephone number 456-789-1111. Log-in step  can be a single interaction, where Alice provides an name, her password, her usual office (in location A) telephone number, and the visitor office (office B) telephone number, and computer  verifies in step  that Alice is who she said she is. Step  can also involve a number of interactions; for example, with computer  issuing a challenge, and Alice providing a response. Whatever method is employed, verification step  simply determines whether Alice is who she says she is. Thereafter it is necessary to verify whether Alice is authorized to modify operation of PBX  (vis-\u00e0-vis her extension on PBX ). To perform this verification, computer  sends a query to PBX , providing it with Alice's ID and the telephone number of her usual office in location A (step ). PBX  responds, confirming (or not confirming) that Alice is authorized to modify operation of PBX  vis-\u00e0-vis her extension on PBX ; to wit, 534-123-8888. This step of confirming can also be performed by gateway computer  (with the aid of a prior installation of the appropriate data from PBX . Step  assesses the response of PBX , and if the response is positive, computer  proceeds to contact the PBX of the visited office to query whether the telephone of the office B that Alice provided to computer  (which for purposes of this disclosure is telephone ), is available to be used as a visitor office telephone with an imported presence. This query is made with message  to CTI port  of PBX , informing PBX  that it is desired to have a visitor at telephone 456-789-1111, where that visitor has a usual office (in location A) telephone number of 534-123-8888. If telephone  is permitted to have an imported presence, PBX  installs the provided information and sends an affirmative response to computer  in step . PBX  also conditions itself to access computer  for translations of all commands to telephone  that are other than digit strings that begin with a \u201c9\u201d (when use of a \u201c9\u201d prefix designates conventional outgoing calls).","It should be mentioned that the communication to CTI  must, of course, pass through gateway computer  in the manner described above. Specifically, computer  must employ encryption, and must log-in into computer  to demonstrate its authority to interact with PBX . The same holds true for when computer  wishes to interact with CTI , through gateway computer , or when PBX  wishes to send information to PBX  (or vice versa).","When computer  receives an affirmative response from PBX , computer  then initiates a two-way communication session with PBX , via CTI port , informing PBX  that the porting of Alice's telecommunications presence to PBX  is successful and that, henceforth, Alice can be reached at 456-789-1111. In the course of this communications, all information that may be necessary in order to satisfy Alice's telecommunication needs at office B in the virtual presence manner described above, is transferred to computer . Upon successful completion of this communication session and a receipt of a final acknowledgement from PBX  (step ), computer  sends an acknowledgement message to computer  (step ), informing Alice that the requested presence at 456-789-1111 has been established.","To illustrate the operation of the  arrangement, a number of specific scenarios are presented below for when Alice is present in office B and the above-described set-up process has been executed. These scenarios are illustrative, and do not purport to constitute the entire set of capabilities of the  system.","One of the basic operations relates to calls that are directed to Alice at PBX , which can originate from outside the PBX or from an extension of PBX . In accord with the principles disclosed herein, when a call is directed to Alice's extension in PBX , the PBX recognizes that Alice is elsewhere, and consequently initiates a conventional call transfer to the telephone specified by Alice and stored in PBX  during the above-described set-up process. The call transfer is effected by PBX  dialing out, for example, on trunk , the appropriate number to its central office , and central office  initiates a process that causes central office  to seize an available PBX  trunk and ring telephone .","Concurrently, PBX  acquires the caller ID of the call that is incoming for Alice, and forwards that information to PBX  through a communication message from CTI port  to CTI port . In this manner Alice is provided with a ringing signal and a caller ID, indicating an incoming call, exactly as if she were to be receiving that incoming call in her usual office in location A.","Alternatively, PBX  first captures the caller ID of the incoming call, and then proceeds to transfer the call as described above, but with the captured caller ID being supplied to central office , rather than the caller ID of telephone  (or some other caller ID that PBX  might supply). The connection to central office  is via a \u201cline side\u201d trunk, and CO  simply passes the caller ID information along to central office  to be injected into the ringing signal applied to PBX . This assumes that CO  does not perform a check of the caller ID signal, or is caused to not perform such a check.","While Alice is provided with ringing signal at telephone , central office  provides audible ring-back signal to trunk  and, possibly, supervision signals. Whether through the supervision signals or through a conventional detection of ceasing of the ring-back signal, PBX  is informed when Alice goes off hook at telephone , in which event, PBX  bridges the incoming call to trunk , allowing Alice to converse with the calling party.","While PBX  listens to the ring-back signals on trunk , it counts the number of ringing intervals and, when a preselected number of ringing intervals are detected, PBX  concludes that Alice is not available, and connects the incoming call to an associated messaging platform, concurrently terminating the outgoing call on trunk . Typically, the messaging platform gives the calling party some options, such as being connected to another person (typically, the secretary of the called party), or leaving a message; and in the  arrangement, PBX  proceeds conventionally to carry out the processes responsive to the calling party's selection.","When the calling party leaves a recorded voice message for Alice, PBX  is typically conditioned to inform Alice of the fact that a message is stored for her. In some realizations, PBX  lights a \u201cmessage waiting\u201d light on Alice's telephone. In other realizations, PBX  is adapted to provide an unusual dial tone when telephone  goes off hook. In accord with the principles disclosed herein, PBX  causes CTI port  to send a message to CTI port , informing PBX  of the fact that Alice has a stored message in the messaging platform associated with PBX . PBX , in turn, lights a \u201cmessage waiting\u201d light on telephone , or conditions itself, as appropriate, to communicate to Alice that she has a waiting message.","Relative to incoming call, the only effective exception to the above occurs when a party at some telephone of PBX  dials the actual four-digit extension of telephone . In such a case, PBX  operates conventionally, in the sense that it makes the connection, but it sends a caller ID signal to telephone  that corresponds to the full telephone number of the calling party, rather than merely the extension of the calling party.","While Alice is in office B, she might wish to call Bob, who is in an office in location A and, hence, serviced by PBX . Assuming that when Alice is in office A she can reach Bob by simply dialing a four-digit extension number, then, in accordance with the objective of this invention, it is desired that Alice should be able to connect to Bob from office B by dialing the same four-digit extension. The  arrangement easily provides this capability because PBX  maintains Alice's identifier in its memory (i.e., Alice's telephone number), as well as a directive to consult with computer  in response to all commands from telephone  other than conventional outgoing calls (designed by a \u201c9\u201d initial digit). Thus, when Alice goes off hook and dials Bob's four-digit extension, PBX  recognizes that she is dialing an extension in the PBX that corresponds to Alice's office A, and knows that the area code and the exchange of that PBX is already stored in PBX  with reference to Alice's identifier. Accordingly, PBX  takes that information from its memory (i.e., the number sequence 534-123), appends a \u201c1\u201d if necessary, and proceeds to make a call in a conventional manner, but presents to central office  Alice's identifier as the caller ID signal. Alternatively, Alice goes off hook and dials Bob's four-digit extension, PBX  recognizes a translation is called for, sends a message to computer , via CTI port , identifying Alice and specifying the four-digit extension that she dialed. Based on Alice's identification, and Alice's calling plan that computer  received in the course of the initial set-up (step ), computer  returns Bob's full telephone number. In response, PBX  dials out Bob's telephone number to central office  in a conventional manner, but presents to central office  Alice's identifier as the caller ID signal. The caller ID information presented to central office  is communicated to the called party (in this case, Bob), and when PBX  rings Bob's telephone, it provides Bob with the caller ID that corresponds to Alice's telephone number that PBX  outputted. As in the case of forwarded calls, it is assumed that CO  does not perform a check of the caller ID signal, or is caused to not perform such a check.","In an enhancement, the response from computer  might include a flag that directs PBX  to output only a part of Alice's identifier, i.e., only the extension number, when the called party is a party at PBX . In this manner, a called party at PBX , such as Bob, would receive a four-digit caller ID, whereas called parties at other than PBX  would receive a 10-digit caller ID.","It is noted that communication with computer  that is initiated by CTI gateway computers is, by design, authorized communications and, therefore, the authentication steps described above in connection with the set-up process can be dispensed with.","As indicated above, Alice might have various other features when she operates telephone  in office A, such as dialing *NN (N stands for any digit 0\u20139) to reach members of her work group (abbreviated dialing), #NN to dial out a pre-stored number (speed dialing), and\/or pressing buttons other that the dial-pad buttons to obtain special services, such as connecting to her secretary, initiating a search though the PBX's directory for the extension of a particular individual, reaching the messages platform to retrieve stored messages, etc. In all of these situations, PBX  sends a message to computer  that describes the action taken at telephone . Computer  translates that action, as necessary, and provides instructions to PBX  regarding the responsive actions that PBX  must undertake. In short, PBX  is caused to offer Alice a facsimile of her usual PBX calling plan, where the term \u201ccalling plan\u201d encompasses the features that Alice enjoys at telephone , and the adjective \u201cfacsimile\u201d intents to convey the notion that because of limitations in telephone , Alice might not be able enjoy all her usual PBX calling plan features. For example, telephone  may have a separate button in its upper right hand corner for hailing Alice's secretary. Telephone  might not have such a button, or may have such a button in a different place on the telephone's face.","As for conventional outgoing calls (dial strings that begin with a \u201c9\u201d), PBX  does not need to access computer  but it, nevertheless, employs Alice's telephone number as the caller ID signal for all outgoing calls.","Lastly, it may be advantageous to allow Alice to depart from her virtual presence in office A, for example, in order to reach Tom at some extension of PBX  by dialing merely a four-digit extension. This can be easily accomplished by causing PBX  to temporarily revert to its pre-\u201cset up condition\u201d in response to a selected dialed sequence, such as ##.","The above discloses the principles of this invention by means of an illustrative embodiment. It should be realized, however, that many modifications can be effected to create different embodiments, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. For example, when PBXs  and  have sufficient processing capacity within the processors that are already in the PBXs, or when PBXs  and  are augmented with adjunct processors, the information stored in computer , and the actions performed in computer  can be performed locally. This has the advantage, of course, of eliminating whatever delay is encountered in communicating with computer  across network , and delays in computer  (keeping in mind that computer  may be called upon to handle the work for many PBXs in numerous locations). To give another example, Alice might specify to computer  more than one visitor office when she might be found. The operation of such a system is basically the same as described above, except that the call forwarding is replaced with a broadcast, where all of the visitor offices ring simultaneously. The telephone that goes off-hook first is concluded to be the one to which the call is to be transferred (stopping the ringing in the other visitor offices). To give yet another example, the arrangement depicted in  employs PBXs, but the principles disclosed herein apply to other switching elements as well, for example arrangements where PBX-like services are provided through network switches (e.g., Centrex Service)."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
