{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/634,775, filed Dec. 6, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,086,235, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RESTRICTING MOBILITY IN WIRELESS NETWORKS, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","n\/a","The present invention relates to communication networks, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for controlling mobility of a mobile station in a wireless communication network.","As the demand for high speed broadband networking over wireless communication links increases, so too does the demand for different types of networks that can accommodate high speed wireless networking. For example, the deployment of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 802.11 wireless networks in homes and business to create Internet access \u201chot spots\u201d has become prevalent in today's society. However, these IEEE 802.11-based networks are limited in bandwidth as well as distance. For example, maximum typical throughput from a user device to a wireless access point is 54 MB\/sec. at a range of only a hundred meters or so. In contrast, while wireless range can be extend through other technologies such as cellular technology; data throughput using current cellular technologies is limited to a few MB\/sec. Put simply, as the distance from the base station increases, the need for higher transmission power increases and the maximum data rate typically decreases. As a result, there is a need to support high-speed wireless connectivity beyond a short distance such as within a home or office.","As a result of the demand for longer range wireless networking, the IEEE 802.16 standard was developed. The IEEE 802.16 standards are often referred to as WiMAX or less commonly as WirelessMAN or the Air Interface Standard. These standards provide specifications for fixed broadband wireless metropolitan access networks (\u201cMAN\u201ds) that use a point-to-multipoint architecture (IEEE 802.16d) and combined fixed and mobile broadband wireless access system's (IEEE 802.16e). Such communications can be implemented, for example, using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (\u201cOFDM\u201d) communication. OFDM communication uses a spread spectrum technique distributes the data over a large number of carriers that are spaced apart at precise frequencies. This spacing provides the \u201corthogonality\u201d that prevents the demodulators from seeing frequencies other than their own.","The 802.16 standards support high bit rates in both uploading and downloading from a base station up to a distance of about 30 miles (about 50 km) to handle such services as VoIP, IP connectivity and other voice and data formats, e.g., time division multiplexing (\u201cTDM\u201d). Expected data throughput for a typical WiMAX network is 45 MBits\/sec. per channel. The 802.16e standard defines a media access control (\u201cMAC\u201d) layer that supports multiple physical layer specifications customized for the frequency band of use and their associated regulations. This MAC layer uses protocols to ensure that signals sent from different stations using the same channel do not interfere with each other and \u201ccollide\u201d.","The IEEE 802.16e air interface standard and corresponding WiMAX network architecture standard, as defined by the WiMAX forum, is primarily designed to support user\/device mobility. Some network operators have readily available radio spectrum for deploying an 802.16e network; however, governmental regulations may restrict usage of these radio spectrums for supporting mobile wireless devices. In other words, although a network is fully compliant with the IEEE 802.16e standard and capable of supporting full mobility services for mobile wireless devices, government regulations require that the mobility services be either partially or completely restricted or unavailable to the wireless devices. It is therefore desirable to have methods and systems to prevent full or partial mobility support for IEEE 802.16e compliant wireless devices without requiring any changes to either the IEEE 802.16e standard, the Network Architecture as defined by the WiMAX Forum, the mobile devices themselves or the over the air control messages exchanged between the device and the network.","It is to be understood that both the following summary and the detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. Neither the summary nor the description that follows is intended to define or limit the scope of the invention to the particular features mentioned in the summary or in the description.","This invention provides a method, system and apparatus for controlling mobility on a wireless network, which includes retrieving a network mobility preference, the network mobility preference indicating a level of mobility service for the mobile station, the level of mobility service indicating the extent to which the mobile station can handoff among base stations of the wireless network, and establishing a level of mobility service for the mobile station based on the retrieved network mobility preference.","In accordance with one aspect, the present invention provides a method for controlling mobility on a wireless network, the method includes retrieving a network mobility preference, the network mobility preference indicating a level of mobility service for the mobile station, the level of mobility service indicating the extent to which the mobile station can handoff among base stations of the wireless network, and establishing a level of mobility service for the mobile station based on the retrieved network mobility preference.","In accordance with another aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for controlling mobility on a wireless network, the apparatus includes a mobility disabling control module, the mobility disabling control module configurable to restrict mobility of a mobile station in the wireless network by using a network mobility preference to establish a level of mobility service for a mobile station based on the network mobility preference.","In accordance with yet another aspect, the present invention provides a gateway for controlling mobility on a wireless network, which includes a memory for storing data from corresponding to at least one network mobility preference; and a processor, the processor operates to receive a handoff request message from a network device, to analyze the handoff request message to determine a level of mobility service to assign to a mobile station and to establish a level of mobility service for the mobile station based on the network mobility preference.","This invention provides a method, system and apparatus for controlling mobility in a wireless network that deploys the air interface defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 802.16e standard, and the corresponding worldwide interoperability for microwave access (\u201cWiMAX\u201d) network architecture standard as defined by the WiMAX Forum.","Referring now to the drawing figures in which like reference designators refer to like elements, there is shown in , a system constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention and designated generally as \u201c.\u201d System  includes base stations  (\u201cBS\u201d) and mobile stations  (\u201cMS\u201d). Base stations  engage in wireless communication with mobile stations . Similarly, mobile stations  engage in wireless communication with base stations .","Base station  can be any base station arranged to wirelessly communicate with mobile stations . Base stations  include the hardware and software used to implement the functions described herein to support the MAC control plane functions. Base stations  include a central processing unit, transmitter, receiver, I\/O devices and storage such as volatile and nonvolatile memory as may be needed to implement the functions described herein.","Mobile stations  can be any mobile station including but not limited to a computing device equipped for wireless communication, cell phone, wireless personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) and the like. Mobile stations  also include the hardware and software suitable to support the MAC control plane functions needed to engage in wireless communication with base station . Such hardware can include a receiver, transmitter, central processing unit, storage in the form of volatile and nonvolatile memory, input\/output devices, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","18","12","12","12","12","12","18","18","12","18","12","18","14","18"]},"In another embodiment, it may be desirable to restrict mobility from any base station to any other base station. Other examples of restricting mobility would include but are not limited to restricting mobility to groups of base stations (e.g., paging groups) with no particular geographical significance, or for those base stations within certain geographical boundaries. Additionally, mobility may be restricted based on \u201cno-mobility\u201d being explicitly configured on the mobility disabling control module. Other examples of criteria for no mobility would be time of day constraints, network (or base station) load, users subscription profile, and the like.","As shown in , mobile station  engages in bidirectional communication with base stations , which have overlapping coverage regions A, B respectively. The ASN GW  supports interfaces such as the WiMAX network reference architecture R6 interfaces, which implement a set of control and bearer plane protocols for communication between the base stations  and the ASN GW . The bearer plane includes an intra-ASN data path or inter-ASN tunnel between the base stations  and the ASN GW . The control plane includes protocols for IP tunnel management (establish, modify and release) in accordance with the mobile station  mobility events. The ASN GW  to base stations  interface may also serve as a conduit for exchange of media access control (\u201cMAC\u201d) layer state information between neighboring base stations . The ASN GW  to mobile station  interface may include additional protocols related to the management plane.","In this embodiment, a mobility disabling control module  (\u201cMDC\u201d) is coupled to the ASN GW  and provides the communications network system  with the capability to control the mobility service by implementing employing a MAC layer 2 handoff manager on the ASN GW . For example, when there is a requirement that mobility be fully restricted in communications network system , the layer 2 handoff manager is notified by the MDC module  that mobility is to be disabled, and the handoff manager of ASN GW will reject any handoff requests from mobile station , base stations  and or both mobile station  and base stations . In this way, the MDC module  provides a configurable feature that can control the decision-making process associated with the handoff manager of the ASN GW . In other words, the MDC module  can be seen as providing a way to implement a configurable mobility preference that indicates a level of mobility service a mobile station  is to have in a particular network. The MDC module  can be a software implementation, a hardware implementation or a combination of both.","Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","A module of executable code could be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.","An operational embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to .  illustrates a timing diagram of a mobile station  initiated handoff in an access service network (\u201cASN\u201d) that has had mobility disabled. The source or serving base station A (\u201cSBS\u201d) and the target base station B (\u201cTBS\u201d) are in communication with the ASN GW . The mobile station  initiates the handoff process by sending a handoff request message, such as the IEEE 802.16e defined MOB_MSHO-REQ to its current SBSA, indicating a list of potential base station(s) to which the mobile station  seeks a handoff (Step S). SBSA receives the handoff request from mobile station  and sends a handoff request, such as the WiMAX networking group (\u201cNWG\u201d) defined R6_HO-REQ to the layer 2 handoff manager of ASN GW  (Step S). Because mobility is disabled on ASN GW , the handoff manager on the ASN GW  rejects the handoff request from serving base station A by sending a response message, such as WiMAX NWG defined R6_HO-RSP to the serving base station A. The rejection can be communicated to serving base station A by omitting to include any recommended base station in the response message (e.g., R6_HO-RSP) and\/or by using an explicit reject type-length-value (\u201cTLV\u201d) element in the message (Step S). At Step S, the serving base station A responds to the mobile station  with a message, e.g., an IEEE 802.16e defined MOB_BSHO-RSP message indicating that the handoff to selected base station B is not recommended, e.g., with mode equal to \u201c0b111\u201d. At this point, the mobile station  may reconfigure the base station list and sent another mobility handoff request, such as the IEEE 802.16e defined MOBMSHO-REQ.","Referring to , with respect to serving base station A, the serving base station A initiates a handoff request for mobile station , such as the WiMAX NWG defined R6_HO-REQ to the layer 2 handoff manager of ASN GW  (Step S). Since mobility is disabled on ASN GW , the handoff manager on the ASN GW  rejects the handoff request by sending a corresponding rejection message such as the WiMAX NWG defined R6_HO-RSP response to the serving base station A. The rejection can be communicated to serving base station A by omitting to include any recommended base station data in the rejection message (R6_HO-RSP) and\/or by using an explicit reject TLV element in the message (Step S). Since the handoff response message from the ASN-GW  (e.g., R6_HO-RSP response) signaled a rejection, the serving base station A will not initiate a network handoff by sending an appropriate message, e.g., an IEEE 802.16e defined MOB_BSHO-REQ. Alternatively, the MDC module  can be configured to provide partial disablement of mobility service conditioned upon which network element initiates the handoff request. For example, in the event that the mobile station  initiates a handoff request, then mobility is always disabled, however, if a base station A, B initiates the handoff request, then the layer 2 handoff manager of ASN GW  will permit the handoff to occur.","Referring to , with respect to mobile station , the mobile station  initiates a reactive handoff request by sending a ranging request, e.g., the IEEE 802.16e defined RNG-REQ message, to a target base station B (Step S). In this case, the ranging request is sent to indicate the mobile station's re-entry into the network . The target base station B sends a context request message, e.g., the WiMAX NWG defined Context-REQ, to ASN GW  and requests the mobile station's context information (Step S). Because mobility is disabled on the system , the ASN GW  replies with a context response without including any of the context information (Step S) for mobile station . At Step S, the target base station B sends a context acknowledgement message, e.g., the WiMAX NWG defined Context-ACK, to acknowledge the context-response from ASN GW . When the ASN GW  receives a context acknowledgement message, such as the WiMAX NWG defined Context-ACK, an \u201caccounting stop\u201d can be sent to an AAA accounting server (not shown) to stop additional charges by the previous base station  to the mobile station  account. Upon receiving the context response message without the mobile station  context information, target base station B sends a ranging response message, such as the IEEE 802.16e defined RNG-RSP to the mobile station  (Step S). Since the base station B did not receive any mobile station  context information, it can neither include any connection identifier (\u201cCID\u201d) update message, e.g., CID-UPDATE TLV, in the ranging response nor handoff optimization messages e.g., TLVs to the mobile station . As a result, the mobile station  is unable to conduct a mobile handoff to the target base station B and the call terminates. This means that in order for mobile  to establish network connectivity it must perform a full network reentry. Accordingly, once mobile station  receives the ranging request (RNG-RSP) from the base station B, and that ranging request is without any optimization TLV or a CID-UPDATE TLV, the mobile station  will perform network entry procedures.","In general, the procedures that a mobile station  performs when entering a network includes performing basic capability negotiations via the exchange of subscriber station basic capability (\u201cSBC\u201d) request and SBC response with the network. Next, authentication and authorization of the mobile station  is performed and the exchange of registration request and registration response with the network is completed. A negotiation for security keys occurs and the network can set up the service flows, which are the connections by which information packets are transmitted and received to complete the entry procedures (Step S). At Step S, the re-entry into the system  by mobile station  is complete.","Referring to , with respect to mobile station , the mobile station  is forced to perform a full network re-entry from idle mode if location update (\u201cLU\u201d) is performed via a base station other than the base station through which the mobile station either entered idle mode or performed a successful location update.  illustrates a mobile station  initiating a location update by sending a ranging request, e.g., RNG-REQ to a target base station B (Step S). The target base station B sends a location update request message, e.g., LU-REQ, to the paging controller of the ASN GW  and requests location update (Step S). Because mobility is disabled on the network and the location update request is coming from a new base station B, the ASN GW  paging controller replies with a location update response without any of the context information for mobile station  (Step S). Upon receiving the location update response without mobile station  context information, target base station B sends a ranging response message, e.g., RNG-RSP message to the mobile station  indicating that location update failed, e.g., location update response equal to \u201cfailure\u201d (Step S). At Step S, the target base station B sends a location update confirmation, e.g., LU-Confirm to acknowledge the LU-response from paging controller of ASN GW . Once mobile station  receives the ranging response message, e.g., RNG-RSP without any handoff optimization TLV, the mobile station  will perform all network entry procedures as discussed previously with respect to  and Step S. At Step S, the mobile station  can send a subscriber base station capabilities request, e.g., SBC-REQ to commence the network re-entry process.","Referring to , with respect to mobile station , the mobile station  is forced to perform a full network re-entry from idle mode if the network initiates a network idle mode exit page in order to transmit a downlink packet received on behalf of the idle mobile station , when the mobile station  has moved into a coverage area of a new base station B.  illustrates an ASN GW  initiating a paging announcement to all base stations  in mobile station's  current paging group without any of mobile station's  context information (Step S). The serving and target base stations  receiving the paging announcement will page the mobile station  by sending out a mobile paging advertisement, e.g., MOB_PAG-ADV, to the mobile station  to inform it to re-enter the network (Step S). Mobile station  re-enters the network at one of the base stations  by sending a ranging request, e.g., RNG-REQ with ranging purpose set to re-entry from idle mode (Step S). New serving base station B sends a context request e.g., CONTENT-REQ to obtain mobile station's  context from the paging controller (\u201cPC\u201d) of ASN GW  (Step S). Since mobility is disabled by the ASN GW , the paging controller determines that mobile station  has moved to a different base station B and sends a Context-Response without any of mobile station's context information (Step S).","Upon receiving the location update response without mobile station's  context information, at Step S, new serving base station B sends a ranging response message, e.g., RNG-RSP message without any handoff optimization TLV or CID-UPDATE TLV to the mobile station  informing the mobile station  to perform all network entry procedures as discussed previously with respect to  and Step S. At Step S, the new serving base station B sends a content acknowledgement message, e.g., CONTENT-ACK, to acknowledge the content response from paging controller of ASN GW . At Step S, the mobile station  will perform all network entry procedures as discussed previously with respect to  and Step S. At Step S, the mobile station's  re-entry into the network is complete.","Referring to , with respect to mobile station , the mobile station  is forced to perform a full network re-entry when the mobile station  attempts idle mode exit via a base station B other than the one at which the mobile station  either entered idle mode or performed a successful location update.  illustrates a mobile station  initiating a location update by sending a ranging request, e.g., RNG-REQ, to a target base station B indicating intention to re-enter the network from the idle mode (Step S). The target base station B sends a context request message, e.g., CONTEXT-REQ, to the ASN GW  and requests context information (Step S). Because mobility is disabled on the network and the context request is coming from a new base station B, the ASN GW  paging controller replies with a context response (\u201cCONTEXT-RESPONSE\u201d) without any of the mobile's context information (Step S). Upon receiving the context response without mobile station  context information, target base station B sends a ranging response, e.g., RNG-RSP message to the mobile station  without the handoff optimization TLV and CID-UPDATE TLV (Step S). At Step S, the target base station B sends a context acknowledgement message, e.g., Content-ACK, to acknowledge the Content-response from paging controller of ASN GW . Once mobile station  receives the ranging response, e.g., RNG-RSP without any handoff optimization TLV, the mobile station  will perform all network entry procedures as discussed previously with respect to  and Step S. At Step S, the mobile station  will perform all network entry procedures as discussed previously with respect to  and Step S. At Step S, mobile station's  re-entry into the network is complete.","The present invention advantageously provides a method, system and apparatus for restricting full or partial mobility support for IEEE 802.16e compliant wireless devices without requiring any changes to the IEEE 802.16e standard, the Network Architecture as defined by the WiMAX Forum or the over the air control messages exchanged between the wireless device and the network by employing a mobility disabling control module.
