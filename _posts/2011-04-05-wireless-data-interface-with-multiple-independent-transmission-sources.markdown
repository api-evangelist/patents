title: Wireless data interface with multiple, independent transmission sources
abstract: A plurality of optical transmission sources provide data communication from a transmitting module to a common detector cooperative with a receiving module, the modules being subject to relative rotation about a shared axis. The detector can be located on the shared axis, each of the sources directing a beam onto the detector regardless of relative module orientation, and/or the light can be diffused, so that it is detected regardless of source and detector placement and relative module orientations. Transmissions can be distinguished according to synchronized timing, differing optical frequencies, differing baud rates, and/or differing circular polarizations. The detector can split the light into a plurality of beams which pass through different optical filters and are thereby distinguished. Cut-off circuits can prevent failed sources from transmitting. A diffused second light source and a second plurality of detectors can provide reverse communication from the receiving module to the transmitting module.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a national phase application of international application PCT\/US11\/31184, filed on Apr. 5, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/322,320, filed Apr. 9, 2010. Both of these applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. DAAHOI-03-C-OOIO awarded by the Army. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to the field of data communications, and more particularly to data communication interfaces which provide communication between modules which are subject to rotation relative to each other.","Communication is often desirable between linked modules which are subject to rotation relative to each other. For example, communication may be desired through a linkage that includes a ball-joint or a gimbal, or communication may be desired between two modules that thread together, whereby the process of threading one module into the other during assembly could lead to twisting, kinking, and possibly breaking of conventional wires. In particular, it is sometimes desirable for a plurality of data transmitting sources, such as sensing and monitoring circuits, to communicate with a receiving destination, such as to a system control module. In various circumstances, the plurality of data transmitting sources may not share a common power supply or ground with each other and\/or with the data receiving destination, such that electrical interconnection therebetween could be problematic.","One approach to enabling such communication is to provide lengths of wire or fiber optics which are preconfigured to withstand the mechanical motion required. For example, if two sections are be joined by threading them together, then the connecting wires can be pre-wound in the opposing direction, so that they are unwound as the two sections are joined. However, these approaches are subject to wires or fiber optics being kinked, tangled, and or stretched as the sections are joined.","Another approach to providing such communication is to use mechanically slidable connections such as slip rings, but these are subject to wear and are generally unreliable. And if the data transmitting sources do not share a common ground or power supply with each other and\/or with the data receiving destination, direct electrical connection can lead to ground-loops and to other forms of electrical noise and interference.","Another approach is to transmit signals over a wireless radio link such as a wireless network. However, for many applications this approach is too complex, too expensive, and too unreliable, and can also be prone to electronic interference from outside sources.","Yet another approach is to use an optical data link, whereby optical signals, for example from one or more light-emitting diodes, are transmitted by data transmitting sources in one of the modules and are detected by an optical detector cooperative with the data receiving destination located in the other module. It will be understood that the use of the term \u201coptical\u201d herein is not limited to visible light, but is used herein to refer to all frequencies of light, including light in the visible, infra-red, and near ultra-violet bands. However, maintaining alignment between the sources and the detector can be difficult. One approach is to position the light source and detector along a mutual rotation axis shared by the two modules. However, this is not always convenient, and is problematic when there is a plurality of data transmitting sources.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,506 to Einhorn teaches a-solution wherein a plurality of off-axis LED's fixed to one module transmit signals to a single off-axis detector fixed to the other module, whereby the LED's and detector are arranged such that light from at least one of the LED's will always be detected by the detector regardless of the relative angular orientation between the modules. However, the approach of Einhorn is not easily extended to cases where it is necessary for a plurality of sources to communicate with a single receiver.","What is needed, therefore, is a data communication interface which provides electrically isolated signal communication between a plurality of transmitting sources cooperative with a transmitting module to a common signal receiving destination cooperative with a receiving module, the transmitting module and the receiving module being subject to rotations relative to each other about a shared axis.","The present invention is an optical communication interface which enables electrically isolated optical data transmission from a plurality of data sources cooperative with at least one transmitting module to a common optical signal detector cooperative with a receiving module, the modules being subject to rotations relative to each other about a shared rotation axis.","In some embodiments, the common optical signal detector is located on the shared rotation axis, while at least some of the plurality of optical sources arc offset from the shared rotation axis, all of the optical sources being directed toward the common detector such that the light beams from all of the sources impinge on the detector regardless of the relative orientations of the modules about the shared axis.","In other embodiments, the detector is not necessarily on the shared rotation axis, and the light from the optical sources is diffused, so that some light from each of the sources reaches the detector no matter where the sources and the detector are located, and no matter how their relative positions vary as the transmitting and receiving modules are rotated relative to each other.","The communication interface includes a source-distinguishing mechanism which distinguishes between transmissions of the plurality of optical signal sources by one or more of several methods. In some embodiments, the timings of the transmissions are controlled and synchronized, so that transmissions do not overlap, and so that the detector can distinguish the origin of each signal according to its timing. In other embodiments, the optical sources transmit at different baud rates. In still other embodiments source-identifying data, such as an identifying data header, is encoded into each signal. In yet other embodiments, the optical sources transmit on different optical frequencies and\/or with different circular polarizations. In some of these embodiments, the detector splits the detected light into a plurality of beams which pass through separate optical filters and arc thereby distinguished from one another.","Of course, because the transmissions are optically coupled, the sources and the detector do not need to share a common electrical ground or a common electrical voltage source.","One general aspect of the present invention is an optical communication interface for multi-source communication of data from a transmitting module to a receiving module, the modules being subject to rotation relative to each other about a shared rotation axis. The interface includes an optical detector cooperative with the receiving module, a plurality of optical transmission sources, each of the optical transmission sources being cooperative with one of the transmitting modules, each of the optical transmission sources being able to encode data onto light transmitted by the optical transmission source and detected by the optical detector, and a data-distinguishing mechanism which is able to separate and distinguish the data received by the optical detector from each of the optical transmission sources.","In embodiments, the optical detector is located along the shared rotation axis and at least one of the optical transmission sources is offset from the shared rotation axis. And in some of these embodiments at least one of the optical transmission sources is configured to transmit a directed beam of light onto the optical detector, the directed beam remaining directed onto the optical detector at all relative rotational orientations of the transmitting and receiving modules.","In various embodiments, light transmitted by at least one of the optical transmission sources is diffused, so that the data encoded onto the diffused light is received by the optical detector regardless of the relative rotational orientations of the transmitting and receiving modules.","Certain embodiments further include a light diffuser located between the optical transmission source and the optical detector, so as to diffuse light transmitted by at least one of the optical transmission sources and thereby ensure that the light transmitted by the optical transmission source is received by the optical detector.","In some embodiments the source-distinguishing mechanism includes a beam timing discriminator. In other embodiments, the source-distinguishing mechanism includes a baud rate discriminator. In still other embodiments the source-distinguishing mechanism includes a light frequency detector. And in yet other embodiments the source-distinguishing mechanism includes a light circular polarization state detector.","In various embodiments at least one of the optical transmission sources includes a light emitting diode (LED). And in certain embodiments the light transmitted by at least one of the optical transmission sources is infra-red light.","In some embodiments at least one of the optical transmission sources includes a time-out mechanism which is configured to prevent emission of light from the optical transmission source after a specific time period if the optical transmission source fails in a transmitting mode. And in some of these embodiments the time-out mechanism includes a multivibrator which is triggered by data pulses received from the optical transmission source.","In certain embodiments the optical transmission sources do not share a common ground.","Various embodiments further include a second plurality of optical detectors cooperative with the transmitting modules, a second optical transmission source cooperative with the receiving module, and a diffusing mechanism configured to diffuse light emitted by the second optical transmission source so as to cause the light emitted by the second optical transmission source to impinge upon all of the second plurality of optical detectors.","Another general aspect of the present invention is a method for multi-source communication of data from at least one transmitting module to a receiving module, the modules being subject to rotation relative to each other about a shared rotation axis. The method includes providing an optical detector cooperative with the receiving module, providing a plurality of optical transmission sources, at each of the optical transmission source being cooperative with one of the transmitting modules, transmitting light from the optical transmission sources, the light having the data encoded thereon, detecting the light transmitted by the optical transmission sources using the optical detector, and distinguishing the data transmitted by each of the light transmission sources.","In various embodiments, providing the optical detector includes locating the optical detector along the shared rotation axis. And in some of these embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting of by at least one of the optical transmission sources of a directed beam of light onto the optical detector, the directed beam of light remaining directed onto the optical detector at all relative rotational orientations of the transmitting and receiving modules.","In certain embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting diffused light, so that the data encoded onto the diffused light is received by the optical detector regardless of the relative rotational orientations of the transmitting and receiving modules. In some of these embodiments transmitting diffused light includes transmitting by the optical transmission source of diffused light. And in other of these embodiments transmitting of diffused light includes directing of light through a light diffuser located between the optical transmission source and the optical detector.","In embodiments, transmitting light includes transmitting light at a first frequency from a first optical transmission source of the plurality of optical transmission sources and transmitting light at a second frequency from a second optical transmission source of the plurality of optical transmission sources, and distinguishing the data includes distinguishing between the frequencies of the light transmitted from the first and second optical transmission sources.","In various embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting light at two distinct circular polarization states by two of the optical transmission sources, and distinguishing the data includes distinguishing data transmitted by the two optical transmission sources by distinguishing the circular polarization state of the light from each source.","In certain embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting data at two distinct baud rates by two of the optical transmission sources, and distinguishing the data includes distinguishing the baud rates of the data.","In some embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting light in separated timing intervals, at least two of the optical transmission sources being synchronized so as to ensure that the two sources do not transmit light at the same time, and distinguishing the data includes distinguishing data transmitted by the two optical transmission sources according to the timing intervals of the transmitted light.","In other embodiments transmitting light includes encoding source-identifying data in the transmitted light from at least two of the optical transmission sources, and distinguishing the data includes distinguishing data transmitted by the two optical transmission sources according to the source-identifying data encoded in the transmitted light.","In various embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting light from at least one light emitting diode (LED). And in certain embodiments transmitting light includes transmitting infra-red light.","Certain embodiments further include providing a time-out mechanism configured to prevent emission of light from at least one of the optical transmission sources after a specified time period if the optical transmission source fails in a transmitting mode. And in some of these embodiments the time-out mechanism includes a multivibrator which is triggered by data pulses received from the optical transmission source.","Various embodiments further include providing a second plurality of optical detectors cooperative with the transmitting modules, providing a second optical transmission source cooperative with the receiving module, transmitting light from the second optical transmission source, diffusing the light transmitted by the second optical transmission source so as to cause the light transmitted by the second optical transmission source to impinge upon all of the second plurality of optical detectors, and detecting the light transmitted by the second optical transmission source using the second plurality of optical detectors.","The features and advantages described herein arc not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims.
