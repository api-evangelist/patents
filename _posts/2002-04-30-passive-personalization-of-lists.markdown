title: Passive personalization of lists
abstract: Personalizing communications typically includes accessing status information for instant messaging sessions involving an instant messaging identity and passively configuring a buddy group associated with the instant messaging identity to persistently reflect a list of participant identities from instant messaging sessions in which the instant messaging identity recently participated. The buddy group may be configured without action from the instant messaging identity. The list of participant identities may be maintained persistently beyond logout of the instant messaging identity. The list of participant identities may be maintained independent of a device used for the instant messaging sessions during which the list was created such that the buddy group is accessible from one or more different devices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/325,084, filed Sep. 28, 2001, and titled \u201cPassive Personalization of Buddy List,\u201d which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to passively personalizing a user interface, in particular, an instant messaging user interface.","Online service providers offer new services and upgrade existing services to enhance their subscribers' online experience. Subscribers have on-demand access to news, weather, financial, sports, and entertainment services, and have the ability to transmit electronic messages and to participate in online discussion groups. For example, subscribers of online service providers such as America Online or CompuServe may view and retrieve proprietary or third party content on a wide variety of topics from servers located throughout the world.","One such service is instant messaging. Members of an instant messaging service can communicate virtually in real time with other instant messaging members. Members may manually create a list of screen names for other members, and may establish instant messaging sessions with those other members using the buddy list.","In one general aspect, personalizing communications typically includes accessing status information for instant messaging sessions involving an instant messaging identity and passively configuring a buddy group associated with the instant messaging identity to persistently reflect a list of participant identities from instant messaging sessions in which the instant messaging identity recently participated.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the buddy group may be configured without action from the instant messaging identity. The list of participant identities from instant messaging sessions in which the instant messaging identity recently participated may be maintained persistently beyond logout of the instant messaging identity. The participant identities may be maintained on the list after an instant messaging session with the instant messaging identity is terminated.","In one implementation, the participant identities may be maintained on the list independent of a device used for the instant messaging sessions during which the list was created such that the buddy group is accessible from one or more different devices.","In one implementation, a screen name of a participant identity may be added to the list of participant identities only when an instant messaging session with the participant identity is closed. Additionally or alternatively, a screen name of a participant identity may be added to the list of participant identities only when an instant messaging session with the participant identity is closed and the screen name of the participant identity is not already included in the buddy group.","In another implementation, a screen name of a participant identity may be added to the list of participant identities when an instant messaging session with the participant identity is established. Additionally or alternatively, a screen name of a participant identity may be added to the list of participant identities when an instant messaging session with the participant identity is established and the screen name of the participant identity is not already included in the buddy group.","The list of participant identities from instant messaging sessions in which the instant messaging identity recently participated may be limited to participant identities not otherwise included on any other list for the instant messaging identity. The buddy group may be configured to limit the list of participant identities to exclude participant identities from which an instant message is received but not accepted. Additionally or alternatively, a screen name of a participant identity may be added to the list of participant identities from which an instant message is received but not accepted.","The buddy group may be configured such that the list of participant identities from instant messaging sessions in which the instant messaging identity recently participated includes participant identities that are included on at least one other list for the instant messaging identity.","The buddy group may be configured such that a size of the buddy group is limited. A size of the buddy group may be established based on a selection by the instant messaging identity. A size of the buddy group may be initially established based on a default value. The list of participant identities may be sequenced using a least recently used methodology. Additionally or alternatively, the list of participant identities may be sequenced using a first-in first-out methodology.","Screen names of participant identities may be arranged on the list of participant identities such that a most recent screen name is listed first. Screen names of participant identities may be arranged on the list of participant identities such that a least recently used screen name is omitted whether or not the least recently used screen name was first-in on the list of participant identities.","The passively configured buddy group may be displayed. An online status may be displayed for each participant identity in the buddy group.","A log associated with the instant messaging identity may be updated where the log includes a chronological record of instant messaging activity. In one implementation, the buddy group may be based on the updated log. Updating the log may include recording a screen name of a participant identity from an instant messaging session. Updating the log also may include recording a time when an instant messaging session is established.","These general and specific aspects may be implemented using a system, a method, or a computer program, or any combination of systems, methods, and computer programs.","Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","For illustrative purposes,  show an example of a communications system for implementing techniques for transferring electronic data. For brevity, several elements in the figures described below are represented as monolithic entities. However, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, these elements each may include numerous interconnected computers and components designed to perform a set of specified operations and\/or may be dedicated to a particular geographical region.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging data between a client system  and a host system  through a communications link . The client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and\/or client controllers , and the host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and\/or host controllers . For example, the client system  or the host system  may include one or more general-purpose computers (e.g., personal computers), one or more special-purpose computers (e.g., devices specifically programmed to communicate with each other and\/or the client system  or the host system ), or a combination of one or more general-purpose computers and one or more special-purpose computers. The client system  and the host system  may be arranged to operate within or in concert with one or more other systems, such as, for example, one or more LANs (\u201cLocal Area Networks\u201d) and\/or one or more WANs (\u201cWide Area Networks\u201d).","The client device  (or the host device ) is generally capable of executing instructions under the command of a client controller  (or a host controller ). The client device  (or the host device ) is connected to the client controller  (or the host controller ) by a wired or wireless data pathway  or  capable of delivering data.","The client device , the client controller , the host device , and the host controller  each typically include one or more hardware components and\/or software components. An example of a client device  or a host device  is a general-purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer) capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner. Other examples include a special-purpose computer, a workstation, a server, a device, a component, other physical or virtual equipment or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions. The client device  and the host device  may include devices that are capable of peer-to-peer communications.","An example of a client controller  or a host controller  is a software application loaded on the client device  or the host device  for commanding and directing communications enabled by the client device  or the host device . Other examples include a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the client device  or the host device  to interact and operate as described. The client controller  and the host controller  may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to the client device  or the host device .","The communications link  typically includes a delivery network  making a direct or indirect communication between the client system  and the host system , irrespective of physical separation. Examples of a delivery network  include the Internet, the World Wide Web, WANs, LANs, analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, and xDSL), radio, television, cable, satellite, and\/or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. The communications link  may include communication pathways  and  that enable communications through the one or more delivery networks  described above. Each of the communication pathways  and  may include, for example, a wired, wireless, cable or satellite communication pathway.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","210","215","205","220","225","220","210","235","240","235","215","250","255","260"]},"Examples of each element within the communications system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the host system  and communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to the host system  and the communications link  of . Likewise, the client system  of  typically has attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible implementation of the client system  of .","The client device  typically includes a general-purpose computer  having an internal or external storage  for storing data and programs such as an operating system  (e.g., DOS, Windows\u2122, Windows 95\u2122, Windows 98\u2122, Windows 2000\u2122, Windows Me\u2122, Windows XP\u2122, Windows NT\u2122, OS\/2, or Linux) and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications  (e.g., word processing programs, database programs, spreadsheet programs, or graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications  (e.g., AOL client, CompuServe client, AIM client, AOL TV client, or ISP client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications  (e.g., Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content.","The general-purpose computer  also includes a central processing unit  (CPU) for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation, the client controller  includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage  of the general-purpose computer . In another implementation, the client controller  includes application programs externally stored in and performed by one or more device(s) external to the general-purpose computer .","The general-purpose computer typically will include a communication device  for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device  is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver, a set-top box, a communication card, a satellite dish, an antenna, or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link  through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general-purpose computer  also may include a TV tuner  for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast, satellite, and\/or cable TV signals. As a result, the client device  can selectively and\/or simultaneously display network content received by communications device  and television programming content received by the TV tuner .","The general-purpose computer  typically will include an input\/output interface  for wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices  include, but are not limited to, a mouse , a mobile phone , a personal digital assistant  (PDA), an MP3 player (not shown), a keyboard , a display monitor  with or without a touch screen input, a TV remote control  for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers, and an audiovisual input device .","Although  illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone , a PDA , an MP3 player (not shown), and a TV remote control  as being peripheral with respect to the general-purpose computer , in another implementation, such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general-purpose computer  and operate as the client device . For example, the mobile phone  or the PDA  may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device  by accessing the delivery network  and communicating with the host system . Furthermore, the client system  may include one, some or all of the components and devices described above.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways  and  that enable communications through the one or more delivery networks .","Examples of each element within the communications system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems  and  and communications links  and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible implementation of the host systems  and  shown in .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . In other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  for enabling access by subscribers and for routing communications between the client system  and other elements of the host device . The host device  also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP (\u201cOnline Service Provider\u201d) host complex  and IM (\u201cInstant Messaging\u201d) host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers, the client system  includes communication software, for example, an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber's interactions with the respective services and, in particular, may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.","Typically, the OSP host complex  supports different services, such as email, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols (i.e., standards, formats, conventions, rules, and structures) to transfer data. The OSP host complex  ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex  may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common, underlying proprietary protocol.","The IM host complex  is generally independent of the OSP host complex , and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber's network or Internet access. Thus, the IM host complex  allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages, whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex  may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to instant messaging. The IM host complex  has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data, the IM host complex  employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.","The host device  may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes, such as the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex  with the IM host complex  through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily, when used to facilitate a link between complexes, the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex, which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance, the OSP host complex  and IM host complex  generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway  and\/or the IM host complex gateway .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways  and  that enable communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communications system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , and  and communications links , , and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible implementation of the host systems , , and  shown in .  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex .","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex  using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an IM client application, and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with the IM host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . In other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communications between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","The OSP host complex  supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex  generally may be viewed as existing on the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex  may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example, servers may be arranged in centralized or localized clusters in order to distribute servers and subscribers within the OSP host complex .","In one implementation of , the OSP host complex  includes a routing processor . In general, the routing processor  will examine an address field of a data request, use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request, and direct the data request to the appropriate destination. In a packet-based implementation, the client system  may generate information requests, convert the requests into data packets, sequence the data packets, perform error checking and other packet-switching techniques, and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system , the routing processor  may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . For example, in the event that a data request from the client system  can be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request to a local server . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request externally to the Internet  or the IM host complex  through the gateway .","The OSP host complex  also includes a proxy server  for directing data requests and\/or otherwise facilitating communication between the client system  and the Internet . The proxy server  may include an IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) tunnel for converting data from OSP protocol into standard Internet protocol and transmitting the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel also converts data received from the Internet  in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the converted data to the routing processor  for delivery back to the client system .","The proxy server  also may allow the client system  to use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the OSP host complex  and the Internet . For example, the subscriber may use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system  to generate a request in standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). In a packet-based implementation, data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d) and routed to the proxy server . The proxy server  may include an L2TP (\u201cLayer Two Tunneling Protocol\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (PPP) session with the client system .","The proxy server  also may act as a buffer between the client system  and the Internet , and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example, the proxy server  can check parental controls settings of the client system  and request and transmit content from the Internet  according to the parental control settings. In addition, the proxy server  may include one or more caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches, the proxy server  may send the information to the client system  from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communications system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , , and  and communications links , , , and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible implementation of the host systems , , , and  shown in .  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex .","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  using exclusive IM protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an OSP client application, and\/or an Internet browser application for communicating with the OSP host complex  and the Internet , respectively.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","To access the IM host complex  and begin an IM session, the client system  establishes a connection to the login server . The login server  typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex  by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex , the login server  employs a hashing technique on the subscriber's screen name to identify a particular IM server  for use during the subscriber's session. The login server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular IM server , gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie), and breaks the connection. The client system  then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server  through the communications link , and obtains access to that IM server  using the encrypted key. Typically, the client system  will be equipped with a Winsock API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) that enables the client system  to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .","Once a connection to the IM server  has been established, the client system  may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server  and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server  supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers  may support associated services, such as, for example, administrative matters, directory services, chat and interest groups. In general, the purpose of the domain servers  is to lighten the load placed on the IM server  by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server  and\/or the domain server , a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the World Wide Web.","In the implementation of , the IM server  is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway  facilitates the connection between the IM server  and one or more alert multiplexors , for example, by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers  to several alert multiplexors . In general, an alert multiplexor  maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.","Once the client system  is connected to the alert multiplexor , a subscriber can register for and\/or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system  and the alert multiplexor  is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server  to identify the particular alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session. Once the particular multiplexor  has been identified, the IM server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor  and gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie). The client system  then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor  through the communication link  and obtains access to the alert multiplexor  using the encrypted key.","The alert multiplexor  is connected to an alert gate  that, like the IM host complex gateway , is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate  is the interface between the IM host complex  and the physical servers, such as servers in the OSP host complex , where state changes are occurring. In general, the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However, the alert multiplexor  also may communicate with the OSP host complex  through the IM host complex gateway , for example, to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex  with certain information gathered from the alert gate .","The alert gate  can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate  may include a piece of code (alert receive code) capable of interacting with another piece of code (alert broadcast code) on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general, the alert receive code installed on the alert gate  instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate  upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed, the alert gate  contacts the alert multiplexor , which in turn, informs the client system  of the detected alert feed.","In the implementation of , the IM host complex  also includes a subscriber profile server  connected to a database  for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server  may be used to enter, retrieve, edit, manipulate, or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation, a subscriber's profile data includes, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, designated stocks, identified interests, and geographic location. The subscriber may enter, edit and\/or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system  to interact with the subscriber profile server .","Because the subscriber's data is stored in the IM host complex , the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex  using a new or a different client system . Accordingly, when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex , the IM server  can instruct the subscriber profile server  to retrieve the subscriber's profile data from the database  and to provide, for example, the subscriber's buddy list to the IM server  and the subscriber's alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server  also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex  to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively, user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .","Referring to , a sender , a recipient , and a host  exchange communications according to a procedure . The procedure  may be implemented by any suitable type of hardware (e.g., device, computer, computer system, equipment, component); software (e.g., program, application, instructions, code); storage medium (e.g., disk, external memory, internal memory, propagated signal); or combination thereof.","Examples of each element of  are broadly described with respect to  above. In particular, the sender and the recipient may have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client devices , , , , and  and\/or client controllers , , , , and . The host  may have attributes comparable to those described with respect to host devices , , , , and  and\/or host controllers , , , , and . The sender , the recipient , and\/or the host  may be directly or indirectly interconnected through a known or described delivery network, such as delivery networks , , , , and .","In one implementation, the sender is associated with a first subscriber, the recipient is associated with a second subscriber, and each of the sender and the recipient includes an application for accessing the host . A subscriber's transfer preferences may be maintained locally at the application or remotely at the host . Each subscriber may use the application to set individual preferences for allowing messages and\/or files to be transferred to and from other subscribers. Typically, a graphical user interface (\u201cUI\u201d) is displayed to allow each subscriber to select among various levels of security and\/or to grant (or deny) access to others subscribers. For example, transfer preferences may be set to allow all users or only certain users (e.g., user's included in the subscriber's buddy list) to contact the recipient . If the transfer preferences of the recipient have been set to block a subscriber attempting contact, the sender may display a UI indicating that instant messaging with the recipient is unavailable.","More specifically, the sender is a subscriber and\/or a client (e.g., client system ), and the host  includes one or more host complexes (e.g., OSP host complex  and\/or IM host complex ) for providing instant messaging capability and coordinating the transfer of electronic data between subscribers. The sender may access the host  using any available device and\/or controller.","An example of a device is a general-purpose computer capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner. Other examples include a special-purpose computer, a personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d), a workstation, a server, a laptop, a Web-enabled telephone, a Web-enabled personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), an interactive television set, a settop box, a video tape recorder (\u201cVTR\u201d), a DVD player, an on-board (i.e., vehicle-mounted) computer, or any other component, machine, tool, equipment, or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions.","An example of a controller is a software application (e.g., operating system, browser application, microbrowser application, server application, proxy application, gateway application, tunneling application, e-mail application, IM client, online service provider client application, interactive television client application, and\/or ISP client) loaded on a device to command and direct communications enabled by the device. Other examples include a computer program, a piece of code, an instruction, another device, or some combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the device to interact and operate as desired. The controller may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to a device. In particular, the controller (e.g., software application, computer program) may be stored on a storage media or device (e.g., ROM, magnetic diskette, or propagated signal) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer, such that if the storage media or device is read by a computer system, the functions described herein are performed.","In the following example, it is assumed that the transfer preferences are set to allow messages and files to be transferred between the sender and the recipient . To communicate using instant messaging, the sender and the recipient access the host  concurrently. In order to access the host , the sender and the recipient each separately request authentication or recognition by the host . The request identifies the associated subscriber to the host  for subsequent identification to other subscribers using a unique screen name. The sender and the recipient each may include a Winsock API for opening and establishing a TCP connection to the host .","The host  verifies a subscriber's information (e.g., screen name and password) against data stored in a subscriber database. If the subscriber's information is verified, the host  authorizes access and or acknowledges the subscriber. If the subscriber's information is not verified, the host  denies access and sends an error message.","After being authorized, a direct (i.e., socket) connection may be established through the host  to allow the sender and the recipient to communicate. The sender and the recipient use this connection to communicate with the host  and with each other. This connection remains available during the time that the sender and the recipient are accessing the host , or until either party decides to terminate.","Upon accessing the host , a \u201cbuddy list\u201d is displayed to the subscriber. In general, a subscriber's buddy list is maintained with or accessible as part of a subscriber's user profile and may be made accessible using a user interface (UI) that provides the online status and capabilities of certain screen names, i.e., \u201cbuddies,\u201d identified by the subscriber. In particular, the host  informs the sender whether identified buddies are online, i.e., currently accessing the host . The host  also informs any subscriber who has identified the sender as a buddy that the sender is currently online.","A buddy list may be used to facilitate IM communications between subscribers. For example, a subscriber can activate an IM user interface that is pre-addressed to a buddy simply by selecting the screen name of an online buddy from the buddy list.","Alternatively, by way of example, if a recipient is not a \u201cbuddy,\u201d the first subscriber generally initiates IM communications by activating a blank IM user interface and then addressing that interface to the screen name of the intended recipient. When necessary, a subscriber can look up the screen name of an intended recipient using the intended recipient's e-mail address.","In the implementation of , a sender , a recipient , and a host  interact according to a procedure  that extends the functionality of instant messaging by passively personalizing the buddy list of at least one of the sender and the recipient ","Initially, the sender accesses the host  (step ). The sender designates at least one recipient to receive an instant message (step ). The instant message may be, for example, a text or non-text (e.g., audio, video) instant message created by the sender ","More specifically, in one implementation of this process in which the sender has previously designated a screen name associated with the intended recipient as a \u201cbuddy,\u201d a UI (e.g., buddy list) indicating the online status and capabilities of the recipient is displayed to the sender . Thus, the sender can confirm that the recipient is able to communicate (i.e., is online) and then designate the recipient for receipt of an instant message by selecting (e.g., clicking) the screen name associated with the recipient to open an IM interface (step ).","After an IM recipient is selected (step ), the host  detects the capabilities of the recipient (step ) and reports the capabilities of the recipient to the sender (step ). In one implementation, a network of servers (e.g., IM servers ) on the host  monitors and updates the online status, client version, and device type of connected subscribers and reports or enables access to this information by other subscribers in real time or substantially in real time. Yet, the accuracy and timeliness of information reported using an instant messaging interface may depend on factors such as a subscriber's hardware (e.g., device type), software (e.g., client version), and\/or transfer preferences (e.g., blocked screen names).","Next, the sender receives the report from the host  (step ) and displays a UI corresponding to the capabilities of the sender and\/or the recipient (step ). In general, if the sender (e.g., client system ) is not voice-enabled and\/or video-enabled, the sender displays a standard instant messaging UI. If the sender is voice-enabled and\/or video-enabled, then the sender may be configured to display a voice-enabled and\/or video-enabled UI.","The sender then composes a message in the IM interface (step ) and transmits the instant message to the host  (step ). In general, the sender transmits the message by selecting a send button.","The host  receives the instant message from the sender (step ) and then optionally authenticates the instant message (step ). In one implementation, the instant message includes header information identifying the message type, the screen name and\/or IP address of the sender and the recipient , and a randomly generated security number. A server (e.g., IM server ) on the host  may authenticate the instant message by matching the screen names and\/or IP addresses with those of valid subscribers stored in a reverse look-up table. In the event that either the sender or the recipient is not associated with a valid subscriber, the host  reports an error message. The host  then sends the instant message to the recipient (step ).","The recipient receives the instant message from the host (step ) and then accepts the instant message (step ). Accepting the instant message may occur automatically if the subscriber that sent the instant message has been preauthorized according to the transfer preferences of the recipient ","For example, acceptance may occur automatically if the sender is included on a buddy list maintained by the recipient . Alternatively, accepting the instant message may include displaying a warning UI based on the transfer preferences of the recipient . For example, the preferences of the recipient may be set to present an \u201caccept message\u201d dialog before displaying messages from any users or certain users (e.g., users not included in the subscriber's buddy list).","After the instant message is accepted (step ), the host establishes an IM session (step ) that enables the sender and the recipient to communicate substantially in real time. Establishing an IM session generally involves connecting one or more communication channels for transferring data between the sender and the recipient . The communication channels may allow the sender and the recipient to transfer data directly with each other (e.g., over a peer-to-peer connection) or may require the data to pass through an intermediary (e.g., host ).","An active IM session may use one or more communication channels, such as, for example, a generic signaling interface (GSI) channel, a control channel, and a data channel. The GSI channel may be used to establish the initial connection. During this connection, the local IP addresses are exchanged. After the initial connection phase is done, the GSI channel is no longer used. By using the GSI channel, the exchange of local IP addresses is done only when both subscribers authorize such an exchange. Thus, using the GSI channel protects subscribers from having their local IP addresses automatically obtained without their consent.","The control channel is typically a TCP\/IP socket for which the IP address and port number of the remote side are obtained through the GSI channel. The control channel may be used to send\/receive control attributes of an active session. For example, because some firewalls will not allow a connection to be initiated by an external device with a socket on the inside of the firewall, a connection is attempted from both sides of the session.","The data channel also is typically a TCP\/IP socket, and is used to transport data packets using various protocols such as UDP and TCP. In general, UDP is used since it minimizes latency. However, because some firewalls will not allow UDP packets to pass through, the data channel may use a different protocol, such as TCP. The client may indicate a particular mode (i.e., TCP, UDP) or, alternatively, an auto mode where it attempts a UDP test, and upon failure resorts to a secondary protocol (e.g., TCP).","When an IM session has been established successfully (step ), the sender and the recipient may exchange communications substantially in real time. In one implementation, the recipient displays an instant message received from the sender (step ). Referring to , for example, a UI  that may be displayed by the sender and\/or the recipient includes an IM window  for displaying a running transcript of an IM session and a text message area  for entering the text of an instant message. In this example, the IM session includes a first instant message  from a first subscriber having a first screen name (ProductRep) and second instant message  from a second subscriber having a second screen name (Subscriber). Although the first and second subscribers of this example have each sent and received instant messages, the following description is provided with reference to the first subscriber as being associated with the sender and the second subscriber as being associated with the recipient ","The UI  also includes an IM toolbar  for changing text or background colors, changing text size, emphasizing text (e.g., bold, italic, or underlining), and inserting objects (e.g., emoticons, hyperlinks, images). In addition, the UI  includes IM buttons  for performing IM functions such as notifying the OSP of offending conduct, blocking a subscriber, adding an IM contact (e.g., buddy), initiating an audio (or video) IM session, getting the profile of a sender, and sending instant messages.","When an IM session is closed, the sender and the recipient may not exchange communications until a new IM session is established between the sender and the recipient . An IM session may be closed when the participants close the IM window , when either the sender or the recipient disconnects from the host , or when a configurable period of time has passed during which no communications are exchanged between the sender and the recipient ","During an active IM session, the host  may moderate the IM session. In one implementation, a server (e.g., IM server , domain server ) on the host  is configured to moderate an IM session between at least one sender and at least one recipient . Moderating an IM session may include managing load conditions of the host  by compressing, decompressing, caching, and\/or allocating resources to efficiently store and forward instant messages.","Moderating the IM session also may include updating an IM log (step ). In general, an IM log includes a chronological record of IM activity (e.g., the existence or status of separate and\/or successful IM sessions, the opening or closing of an IM session, the communication of instant messages during each separate and\/or successful IM session, the request or receipt of alerts, or the connection or disconnection with the host). The IM log may be stored and maintained on the host  (e.g., by database  of IM host ), the sender (e.g., by memory  of the client device,), and\/or the recipient (e.g., by memory  of the client device). Entries in the IM log may be ordered, deleted, edited, and\/or otherwise managed by the host , the sender , and\/or the recipient . For example, the host  may queue, order, and arrange entries in the IM log based on time, subscribers (e.g., screen names), topic, relevance, and\/or any other ranking criteria.","Typically, each subscriber will have a corresponding IM log for recording IM activity of the subscriber. However, an IM log may be associated with a group of subscribers, or may simply be used to chronologically log activities of all subscribers communicating over or with the device used to maintain or store the log.","Updating the IM log may include recording the screen names of participants of an IM session. The sender , the recipient , and\/or the host  may be configured to detect at least one identity (e.g., the screen names) associated with an instant message during an IM session, for example, by parsing the header information of an instant message. Typically, the screen names recorded in the IM log of a particular subscriber will be supplemented with information including the time the IM session was established and the screen names of other subscribers that participated in the IM session where several subscribers communicate using group IM. Updating the IM log also may include tracking the instant messages sent during an IM session and recording the time that each instant message was sent and received, recording the time the IM session was closed, and\/or recording the time the sender or the recipient disconnected from the host .","A list of screen names for the most recent IM communications may be derived from the IM log automatically (step ). The sender , the recipient , and\/or the host  may be configured to derive such a list. For example, at any time, the last N different screen names with whom a particular subscriber has had an IM session may be determined from an updated IM log. The number N may be any predetermined number set according to preferences of the sender , the recipient , and\/or the host , or it may be user-selectable.","In one implementation, the host  (e.g., profile server  or IM server ) accesses an IM log associated with a particular subscriber that is stored on the host  (e.g., database ). The host  examines the IM log and creates a list of N different screen names based on an associated time or a relative position of each screen name. The associated time may be a time that an IM session was established, a time that an instant message was sent (or received), a time that an IM session was completed, a time that the sender or the recipient connected to or disconnected from the host , or some other time. Typically, the list of N screen names will be ordered with the most recent screen name being listed first.","The IM log (and\/or the list of most recent IM contacts) may be configured to store only the last N different screen names with which a particular subscriber has had an IM session. The IM log may be maintained using a least recently used methodology. For example, when a new IM session is established, the screen name of each participant may be compared to the list of most recent IM contacts. If the screen name does not already appear in the list, the screen name is added and the least recent IM contact (i.e., oldest IM contact) is reduced in order or altogether removed from the list so that the list includes only N different screen names. If the screen name already appears in the list, the list is reordered so that the screen name appears at the top of the list. In either case, the updated list includes N different screen names listed in order of most recently used IM session. In some implementations, the list may be filtered to include only screen names that do not already appear on the subscriber's buddy list.","In another example, when an IM session is completed or when either the sender or the recipient disconnects from the host , the screen name of each participant may be compared to the list of most recent IM contacts. If the screen name does already appear in the list, the screen name is added and the least recent IM contact (i.e., oldest IM contact) is removed from the list if necessary to maintain only N different screen names on the list; otherwise, the least recent IM contact may be merely demoted. If the screen name already appears in the list, the list is reordered so that the screen name appears at the top of the list. In either case, the final list includes N different screen names listed in order of most recent IM session. In one implementation, the screen name of each participant may be compared to the list of most recent IM contacts only when an IM session is completed or only when either the sender or the recipient disconnects from the host  such that the list includes only the most recent IM contacts of the most recent closed IM sessions.","In another example, the IM log may be maintained using other methodologies, such as, for example a first-in first-out (FIFO) methodology. For example, when an new IM session is established, the screen name of each participant may be added to the list and the screen name first added to the list may be reduced in order or altogether removed from the list, whether or not it was the screen name least recently used actively in a conversation, thus maintaining the threshold number of different screen names. In some implementations, the list may be filtered to include only the screen names that do not already appear on the subscriber's list.","After a list of N different screen names is compiled, a user profile is accessed (step ). In general, a user profile corresponds to a particular subscriber and may include, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, identified interests, and geographic location. The user profile of a subscriber may be stored and maintained on the host  (e.g., IM host , database ), the sender (e.g., client device, memory ), and\/or the recipient (e.g., client device, memory ). In one implementation, portions of the user profile may be stored and maintained in several remote locations. Typically, a subscriber actively enters, edits and\/or deletes the content of the user profile, for example, by using an installed IM client application to fill out an electronic form. In this case, however, access of the user profile may occur transparently to the subscriber. That is, the user profile is accessed without requiring any user action (e.g., selection or configuration by the subscriber). In one implementation, the host  (e.g., profile server , IM server ) accesses the user profile. In other implementations, an installed IM client application is configured to transparently access a local user profile.","Then, the user profile is passively configured (step ). That is, configuration occurs transparently to the subscriber and requires no subscriber action (e.g., selection by the subscriber). Configuration of the user profile may include the creating and\/or modifying of a subscriber's user preferences, such as, for example, a buddy list, address book, calendar, notification settings (e.g., alerts), or any other personalized attributes associated with the subscriber.","In one implementation, a buddy list included in a subscriber's user profile is configured based on the updated IM log. In particular, a buddy list associated with at least one of the sender and the recipient may be passively configured to include a list of most recent contacts (step ).","Referring to , a UI  that may be passively configured includes a Buddy List Window  having a List Setup box  (step  of ). The List Setup box  includes one or more IM groups, for example, a Recent Contacts group , a Buddies group , a Co-Workers group , and a Family group . Each IM group includes one or more IM group members identified by screen name, for example, Recent Contacts group members , Buddies group members , Co-Workers group members , and Family group members . The List Setup box  also includes List Setup buttons  for performing IM functions such as adding a screen name, adding a group, deleting a screen name or group, and finding a screen name of a subscriber. The Buddy List Window  further includes Buddy List buttons  for performing IM functions such as linking to an IM-related web page, entering an away message, and setting IM-related user preferences.","In one implementation, the size of the IM groups may be limited to a threshold number of screen names, which may be independent of a size limit established for the entirety of the Buddy List in which it is included. Furthermore, specific IM groups may have different size limitations. For example, the Recent Contacts group  may be subject to the threshold number limitation on screen names and the Buddies group  may be subject to a different threshold number limitation of screen names, each of which may be different from a size limit of the Buddy List.","The IM groups may be actively or passively created, as discussed below. The Buddies group  may be a standard (or default) group provided with every installation of an IM client. In general, when a subscriber opens an IM account, the Buddies group  is created automatically. Initially, the Buddies group  is empty. To populate the Buddies group , a subscriber must actively enter a screen name for each person with whom the subscriber desires to communicate. For example, using the List Setup Buttons , a subscriber actively entered the screen name for each of the Buddies group members  (e.g., Buddy, Friend, Pal). In one implementation, the host  (e.g., IM host ) provides a reverse lookup function that allows subscribers to search for screen names using various criteria of subscribers (e.g., name, location, e-mail address, interests).","The Co-Workers group  and the Family group  may be personalized groups actively created by the subscriber. In general, subscribers may personalize their buddy lists by creating different group and categorizing screen names. For example, using the List Setup Buttons , a subscriber can actively create the Co-Workers group  and the Family group . After the Co-Workers group  and the Family group  are created, the subscriber must actively enter a screen name for each of the Co-Workers group members  (e.g., Boss, Employee, Supervisor) and actively enter a screen name for each of the Family group members  (e.g., Brother, Dad, Mom, Sister). A screen name may occupy more than one personalized group.","Like the Buddies Group , the Recent Contacts group  may be a standard (or default) group provided with every installation of an IM client. In general, when a subscriber opens an IM account, the Recent Contacts group  is created automatically. Initially, the Recent Contacts group  is empty. However, unlike the Buddies group , a subscriber does not have to actively enter screen names to populate the Recent Contacts group . That is, the Recent Contacts group  is created and modified without user action (e.g., clicks, data entry). For example, screen names are added to and removed from the Recent Contacts group  as IM sessions are opened and closed, and\/or as membership limits are imposed on the Recent Contacts group. As such, in one implementation, screen names are added to the Recent Contacts group  passively, as successful IM sessions are established with the subscriber, and these screen names may be removed from that group  as sessions are closed or maximum group size is reached. In another example, the screen name of each of the Recent Contacts group members  (e.g., Boss, ProductRep, Supervisor, SalesRep, Employee) is passively added to the Recent Contacts group  as successful IM session are closed with the subscriber or when either the sender or the recipient disconnects from the host .","In one implementation, the subscriber participates in an IM session with each of the Recent Contacts group members  in the following order: Employee, SalesRep, Supervisor, ProductRep, and Boss. As each IM session is established, a screen name for each of the Recent Contacts group members is added in sequence to the Recent Contacts group  resulting in the most recent contact being listed first. In this example, the order is implied from the visual hierarchy; however, numeric or other explicit visual indicators also may be used to make clear the relative order of recent IM sessions. Furthermore, in this example, it does not matter which subscriber initiates the IM session (i.e., who sent the initial instant message) or whether a response to the initial instant message is sent. However, the screen names may be ordered, separated into different groups, or otherwise differentiated to reflect this information. A screen name of a particular person is added whenever a successful IM session is established between the subscriber and the particular person. Screen names included in the Recent Contacts group  also may occupy other groups (e.g., Co-Workers group ), or, alternatively, the Recent Contacts group  may include only the screen name of a particular person that is not included in select or all other groups.","In another implementation, as each IM session is completed or when either the sender or the recipient disconnects from the host , a screen name for each of the Recent Contacts group members is added in sequence to the Recent Contacts group  resulting in the most recent contact being listed first. A screen name of a particular person is added whenever a successful IM session is closed between the subscriber and the particular person or when either subscriber disconnects from the host. In this example, it does not matter which subscriber closed the IM session (e.g., who closed the IM window, who disconnected from the host) or which subscriber disconnected from the host. However, the screen names may be ordered, separated into different groups, or otherwise so differentiated to reflect this information.","Referring to , a UI  that may be passively configured includes a Buddy List Window  having an Online box  (step  of ). In general, the Online box  displays the online status and capabilities of certain screen names identified by the subscriber in the List Setup box, for example, List Setup box  of . In one implementation, the host  (e.g., IM host , IM server ) informs the sender (e.g., client device, IM client application) whether the subscribers associated with the screen names are online, i.e., currently accessing the host .","The Online box  includes one or more online lists, with each list corresponding to an IM group. For example, the Online box  includes a Recent Contacts list , a Buddies list , a Co-Workers list , and a Family list . Each online list includes one or more screen names corresponding to IM group members that currently are online. In the implementation of , the Recent Contacts list  identifies certain online Recent Contacts members , the Buddies list  identifies a certain online Buddies member , the Co-Workers list  identifies certain online Co-Workers members , and the Family list  identifies a certain online Family member . The Online box  also includes an Offline list  identifying offline members  from one or more of the IM groups separately (not shown) or collectively. The Online box  further includes Online buttons  for performing IM functions such as displaying an IM window, sending an invitation to enter a chat room, and finding profile information associated with a screen name.","The Online box  facilitates IM communication between subscribers. For example, a subscriber can activate a pre-addressed IM window simply by clicking the screen name of an online group member. Referring to , a UI  that may be invoked using the buddy list and displayed to the sender and\/or the recipient includes an IM window  including a running transcript of an IM session and a text message area  for entering the text of an instant message, an IM toolbar , and IM buttons . In this example, the IM session includes a first instant message  from a first subscriber having a first screen name (Subscriber) and second instant message  from a second subscriber having a second screen name (ProductRep). The first subscriber may be associated with the sender and the second subscriber may be associated with the recipient ","Referring to , in one implementation, the UI  is displayed to a first subscriber associated with a sender as follows (step ). First, the first subscriber participates in an IM session with each of the Recent Contacts group members  in the following order: Employee, SalesRep, Supervisor, ProductRep, and Boss (step ). As each IM session is established, a screen name for each of the Recent Contacts group members is added in sequence to the Recent Contacts group  resulting in the most recent contact being listed first (step ). Additionally and\/or alternatively, as each IM session is closed (step ), or when either the sender or the recipient disconnect from the host (step ), a screen name for each of the Recent Contacts group members is added in sequence to the Recent Contacts group  resulting in the most recent contact being listed first. Screen names included in the Recent Contacts group  also may occupy other groups (e.g., Co-Workers group ). In one implementation, the Recent Contacts group  only may include the screen name of a particular person that is not included in any other group.","Next, the first subscriber views a UI  indicating the online status of an intended recipient of an instant message. In this example, the first subscriber intends to send an instant message to the second subscriber. Here, the screen name of the second subscriber (ProductRep) was not actively added to the UI  by the first subscriber. Rather, the screen name (ProductRep) was added passively to the Recent Contacts group  when the first subscriber and second subscriber established a prior successful IM session. By viewing the UI  and, in particular, the Recent Contacts list , the first subscriber is notified that the second subscriber is online. Namely, the screen name of the second subscriber (ProductRep) appears as one of the online Recent Contact members .","The first subscriber then sends an instant message intended for the second subscriber by interacting with the UI . For example, the first subscriber can display an IM UI  pre-addressed to the second subscriber by clicking the screen name of the second subscriber (ProductRep) in the Recent Contacts list . The first subscriber enters the first instant message  into the text message area  and clicks one of the IM buttons , namely the send button. Finally, the first subscriber displays the second instant message  (i.e., the reply from the second subscriber) in the IM window .","Passively configuring a user profile, and hence a passively configured subscriber buddy list, benefits subscribers by facilitating IM communication. For example, a subscriber can view the online status of and create pre-addressed instant messages to recent IM contacts. This feature is particularly helpful to new IM users who would otherwise have to spend time and effort setting user preferences and entering data. Additionally, it is helpful to subscribers who accidentally or intentionally close sessions with IM contacts for whom they have no other record of their screen name, only to need that screen name for later IM contact. The persistent state of the recent IM contacts list enables the list to persist through log-outs and power downs.","Additionally, a passively configured user profile, and hence a passively configured subscriber buddy list, may be made accessible through any of several different devices independent of the device that was being used at the time of the IM session that resulted in the passive addition of or status change with respect to the IM contact in the Recent Contacts Group. For example, in a client-host model, the profile may be stored at the host or some other location centrally accessible to various client devices operable by the subscriber. As a result, a first subscriber may participate in an instant messaging session with a using a personal computer. At the end of the instant messaging session, the screen name of the second subscriber may be passively added to the first subscriber's Recent Contacts Group. When the first subscriber later uses a PDA and accesses an IM application, the first subscriber's Recent Contacts Group may be presented on the PDA. In this instance, the Recent Contacts Group includes the screen name of the second subscriber that was added to the group based on the IM session that the first subscriber participated in using the personal computer. This enables the first subscriber to initiate another IM session with the second subscriber by selecting the second subscriber's screen name from the Recent Contacts Group presented on the PDA. Thus, the passively configured buddy list, specifically the Recent Contact Group, persists across different devices.","A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. In other implementations, for example, other groups (e.g., Frequent Contacts, Popular Contacts) may be passively created and maintained in a persistent state in order to facilitate instant messaging. In yet other implementations, for example, other groups and lists may be passively created and maintained in a persistent state in order to facilitate instant messaging including: instant messages received; knock-knocks received (i.e., instant messages received from unknown identities), but accepted and\/or declined; instant messages sent without receiving a response; instant messages sent to Buddies; instant messages sent to non-Buddies; instant messaging sessions where at least a threshold number of messages have been exchanged; and instant messages received to the exclusion of knock-knocks.","Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1-5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 7-10","FIGS. 1-5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIGS. 1-5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
