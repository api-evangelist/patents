The method disclosed mitigates the impact of water loading on regeneration by utilizing a conditioner following the steam regeneration process. In an embodiment, the method provides for a water loading following COabsorption substantially equivalent to the moisture loading of the regeneration step. Management of the water loading allows regeneration reactor operation with significant mitigation of losses incurred by the necessary desorption of adsorbed water.","Carbon sequestration is a viable alternative to reduce the emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO) from large point sources. It holds the potential to provide deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon sequestration is a two-step process where the capture of carbon dioxide from a gas stream is followed by permanent storage. The capture step for carbon dioxide represents a major cost in the overall process.","Of particular interest are power generation point sources that use fossil fuels. Since nearly one-third of the anthropogenic COemissions are produced by these facilities, conventional coal-burning power plants and advanced power generation plants\u2014such as integrated gasification combined cycle\u2014present opportunities where carbon can be removed and then permanently stored. At the current time, pulverized coal-fired-base steam cycles have been the predominant electric power generation technology. These will continue to be used predominantly in the near future. Technologies for capturing COwill need to be applied to new more efficient coal-fired facilities and will need to be retrofitted onto existing plants.","For coal-fired power plants, the conventional scrubbing system that is currently the comparative baseline for all other capture technologies is monoethanolamine (MEA) scrubbing. This wet scrubbing process removes the COin an absorber and then regenerates the spent scrubbing liquor in a vessel by indirectly heating the solution with plant steam. Although there have been large scale commercial demonstrations of this technology, the process has several disadvantages, such as a high heat of reaction, low working capacity, corrosiveness of the solution, the susceptibility of being poisoned, and most notably, its need to be in an aqueous solution. This latter disadvantage results in a large energy need to regenerate the spent solution, especially the sensible heating of the water, which is a minimum of 70-wt % of the solution. The water is recognized as an inert carrier between the absorption and regeneration steps. Another energy loss while regenerating the spent MEA solution includes evaporative heat loss of vaporizing liquid water.","One type of novel COcapture technology that can be applied to various gas streams has, as a basis, dry regenerable solid sorbents. Examples of these types of sorbents are zeolites, activated carbon, alkali\/alkaline earth metals, immobilized amines, metal organic framework, etc. A specific sorbent class that shows significant advancement are amine-based solid sorbents, such as Basic Immobilized Amine Sorbents (BIAS). These sorbents consist of amines (primary, secondary, tertiary, or a combination thereof) deposited onto a porous substrate. The manner of deposition is important and can be random or structured deposition of the amine onto the support (silica, polymer, etc.) The sorbent process may act in a similar fashion to the wet scrubbing in that the sorbent would be transported between the absorption step and the regeneration step and in that the sorbent is regenerated by a temperature-swing application.","One of the main benefits in using the solid sorbent is the elimination of the sensible heat for the liquid water as compared to MEA. A secondary benefit lies in the lower heat capacity for the solid versus the liquid solvent, also serving to lower the sensible heat required. More COcan be absorbed on a weight or volume basis with the amine-based solid sorbents, so the sorbent system is capable of a significant decrease in the heat duty for the regeneration step. A lower cost of energy service as compared to amine wet scrubbing may also result. Thus amine-based solid sorbents have the capability to improve the overall energetics of COcapture.","Effective amine-based solid sorbent methodologies are needed for carbon dioxide capture, whether the capture occurs in combustion or gasification power generation systems, or in other applications, such as natural gas cleanup. Because of the high concentration of carbon dioxide in any of these feed streams, a large quantity of the gas will be reacting with the sorbent and thus produce considerable amounts of exothermic heat. This heat must be removed from the sorbent to prevent temperature instability within the reactor, to assure the sorbent will operate at optimum temperature, and to eliminate the potential degradation of the sorbent because of high temperature excursions. Reactor designs are available to eliminate heat problems. However, the presence of moisture in the various process gas streams can have a tremendous impact on the energetics of the system. Indirect\/direct steam regeneration will have a significant advantage in the regeneration step with respect to COregeneration, and adsorption\/desorption as related to water within the process steps will potentially represent an energy loss unless controlled. It would be advantageous to provide a methodology whereby the CO2 absorption and water adsorption of amine-based solid sorbents were effectively compensated for, and regeneration energy losses mitigated.","Methodologies utilizing selected amine-based solid sorbents have discussed steam regeneration and subsequent air drying of the amine-based solid sorbent in a cyclic process. Typically the methodologies have relied on a stationary reactor where the sorbent does not floe between adsorption and regeneration steps. See e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/741,600, filed by Chuang, based on PCT\/US08\/12570 filed Nov. 7, 2008. These methodologies discuss the use of dry air to evacuate steam following regeneration, however they do not address water loading manipulations based on inherent absorption and desorption behavior of the sorbent. Such an approach where subsequent water loading behaviors during the cyclic processes are ignored, and where a dry air flow is specified solely for the evacuation of surrounding steam, can lead to the significant transfer of adsorbed water from an absorber to a regenerator. Such transfer can produce significant regeneration losses and reduction in the COcapacity of a sorbent.","It would be advantageous to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent where regeneration losses and COcapacity reductions could be mitigated through proper adsorbed water management during the process, by considering the manner in which HO and COrespectively are sorbed and desorbed during a cyclic process. Such a process would allow for vessels sized to achieve acceptable COabsorption and regeneration loads to be optimized through the water management. The process should provide for integration with existing power or fuel production facilities, and should be applicable to temperature and pressure ranges which avoid oxidative degradation of the amine-based solid sorbent while minimizing energy and infrastructure requirements.","Accordingly, it is an object of this disclosure to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby regeneration losses and COcapacity reductions are mitigated through proper adsorbed water management during the cyclic process.","Further, it is an object of this disclosure to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby the manner in which HO and COare sorbed and desorbed, so that vessels sized to achieve acceptable COabsorption and regeneration loads can be optimized through the water management.","Further, it is an object of this disclosure to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby substantially equalized absorber and regenerator moisture loadings may result, so that the thermal energy in a steam regeneration process is applied maximally to COdesorption, without the necessity for desorbing HO adsorbed in the COabsorption process.","Further, it is an object of this disclosure to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent where the method can be integrated with existing power or fuel production facilities, in order to provide a relatively pure COstream for subsequent sequestration or utilization.","Further, it is an object of this disclosure to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent where the methodology can be applied to temperature and pressure ranges avoiding oxidative degeneration of the amine-based solid sorbent while minimizing energy and infrastructure impacts.","These and other objects, aspects, and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the accompanying description and claims.","The disclosure describes a COabsorption method using an amine-based solid sorbent for the removal of carbon dioxide from a gas stream, and further describes regeneration of the amine-based solid sorbent to form a pure concentrated stream of CO. The amine-based solid sorbent is a solid substrate supporting an amine functional group on its surface. For example, the amine-based solid sorbent may be comprised of primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or a combination thereof, deposited onto a porous substrate.","A key chemical property of the amine-based sorbent is its affinity to adsorb moisture. The amine-based solid sorbents may adsorb moisture present in a gaseous stream outside of the water vapor that directly reacts with COand amine as part of the COchemical reaction. This particular adsorbed water is retained on the sorbent following COabsorption operations, and the adsorbed water can negatively impact the energetics of a subsequent steam regeneration process.","The amine-based solid sorbent is exposed to a gaseous stream and absorbs COand adsorbs HO outside of the COabsorption reaction. Generally, COabsorption on the amine-based solid sorbent occurs faster than the adsorption of adsorbed water. As a result, in processes intended for the absorption of COand tailored to achieve a given COloading, the amount of water adsorbed during the COabsorption process is less than the equilibrium water loading that might be achieved under the same conditions, were the amine-based solid sorbent allowed sufficient time to equilibrate. In contrast, during the regeneration process, COdesorption on the amine-based solid sorbent can occur more slowly than the desorption of adsorbed water. These tendencies combined with the relative equilibrium water loadings of the amine-based solid sorbent during the respective steps can result in the water loading of the sorbent following COabsorption exceeding the equilibrium water loading of the sorbent during the regeneration process. A substantial portion of the energy supplied by the regeneration reactor is then expended in the removal of some portion of the water loading, rather than COdesorption. Further, upon exit from a steam regeneration process, the regenerated sorbent solids may be substantially surrounded by free steam as a result of particle morphology, entrainment, or some other reason. Condensation of this free steam on the regenerated sorbent will lead to sorbent performance losses.","The method disclosed mitigates the impact of water loading on regeneration by utilizing a conditioner following the steam regeneration step. The conditioner receives a flow of drying gas which contacts the regenerated sorbent and removes the free steam, as well as reducing the water loading of the regenerated sorbent by removing some portion of the adsorbed water present. In an embodiment, the adsorbed water removed by the conditioner is substantially equivalent to the water uptake expected to occur during the subsequent COabsorption process. This provides for a water loadings on the amine-based solid sorbent substantially equivalent to the moisture loading of the regeneration process, allowing the thermal energy transferred to the loaded sorbent to be utilized for COdesorption rather than the desorption of adsorbed water. This assists in optimizing the COremoval capacity of the amine-based solid sorbent for a given absorption and regeneration reactor size. Management of the water loading in this manner allows regeneration reactor operation with significant mitigation of energy losses incurred by the necessary desorption of adsorbed water.","The novel process and principles of operation are further discussed in the following description.","The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the principles of the present invention are defined herein specifically to provide a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby regeneration energy losses and COcapacity reductions are mitigated through proper adsorbed water management during the cyclic process.","The disclosure describes a COabsorption method using an amine-based solid sorbent for the removal of carbon dioxide from a gas stream, and further describes regeneration of the amine-based solid sorbent to form a pure concentrated stream of CO. The amine-based solid sorbent is a solid substrate supporting an amine functional group on its surface. For example, the amine-based solid sorbent may be comprised of primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or a combination thereof, deposited onto a porous substrate. Such amine-based solid sorbents are known in the art. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,288,136 to Gray et al., issued Oct. 30, 2007, among others. The method disclosed is attractive with respect to the overall energetics of the capture system.","A key chemical property of the amine-based sorbent is its affinity to adsorb moisture. The amine-based solid sorbents may adsorb moisture present in a gaseous stream outside of the water vapor that directly reacts with COand amine as part of the COchemical reaction. This particular adsorbed water is retained on the sorbent following COabsorption operations, and the adsorbed water can negatively impact the energetics of a subsequent steam regeneration process, particularly when water loading on the sorbent following COabsorption exceeds the water loading on the sorbent following sorbent regeneration. The manner of water adsorption on the amine-based sorbent and the management of adsorbed water for the improvement of regeneration energetics are particularly addressed in this disclosure.","Within this disclosure, the term \u201camine-based solid sorbent\u201d means a solid substrate supporting an amine functional group on its surface, for example, a sorbent comprised of primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or a combination thereof, deposited onto a porous substrate. Such amine-based solid sorbents are known in the art. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,288,136 to Gray, among others.","Within this disclosure, the term \u201cadsorbed water\u201d means water adsorbed or absorbed on the amine-based solid sorbent, but which does not participate in a reaction with COand amine as part of the COchemical reaction generating COabsorption by the amine-based solid sorbent.","Within this disclosure, the term \u201cfree steam\u201d means vapor comprised of HO and substantially surrounding an amine-based solid sorbent following a steam regeneration of the amine-based solid sorbent, where the HO comprising the vapor is not adsorbed or absorbed on a surface of the amine-based solid sorbent.","Within this disclosure, the term \u201cwater loading\u201d refers to the mass of adsorbed water adsorbed on the amine-based solid sorbent, for example, mol HO per kilogram of amine-based solid sorbent. It is understood that at any given time under a set of thermodynamic conditions, the mass of adsorbed water may contain individual adsorbed water molecules undergoing adsorption or desorption. However, when this disclosure refers to or compares water loading between various points in the method, this refers to a collective mass of adsorbed water rather than the behavior of individual adsorbed water molecules comprising the mass.","Within this disclosure, the term \u201cfirst temperature\u201d may be a mean value around which variation occurs as a result of operational constraints. The acceptable magnitude of variation of the first temperature depends on the specified relationship of the first temperature to subsequent temperatures as specified in the exemplary methods. Thus, when the exemplary methods specify maintaining a first temperature, it is understood that this is intended to indicate maintaining the parameter within the acceptable magnitude of variation about the mean value such that the specified relationship to subsequent temperatures is observed. Similar definition applies to similar terms, such as \u201csecond temperature\u201d and \u201cthird temperature,\u201d when such terms are used in this disclosure.","Within this disclosure, the term \u201cindirect\u201d when applied to heat exchange means a process of heat transfer from a heat containing medium to a heat absorbing medium without direct contact between the two media involved. For example, heat transfer from steam to a sorbent through a heat exchanger tube separating the steam and the sorbent.","The management of adsorbed water disclosed herein stems from a recognition of the manner in which HO and COrespectively sorb and desorb from the amine-based solid sorbent. The disclosure utilizes this recognition in a novel way to mitigate regeneration energy losses that arise from the desorption of the adsorbed water, since such losses raise the regeneration heat duty and increase separation costs. The disclosure recognizes that in a cycling COabsorption operation using the amine-based solid sorbents, COabsorption may generally occur at a faster rate than water adsorption in the COabsorption process, while COdesorption may generally occur at a slower rate than adsorbed water desorption during the amine-based solid sorbent regeneration. Because vessels used in an actual process will typically be sized to achieve acceptable COabsorption and regeneration loads, in the absence of manipulating the adsorbed water loadings between the absorber and regenerator, the amine-based solid sorbent could achieve an adsorbed water loading during the COabsorption process beyond the loading supported by the conditions of the regeneration process, leading to regeneration losses as regeneration thermal energy is necessarily expended to reduce the adsorbed water loading. Such a loss is to be avoided since it will increase regeneration heat duty.","This disclosure utilizes a conditioning step following regeneration of the amine-based solid sorbent in order to mitigate any such moisture loading imbalances. A heated gas such as air is passed through the amine-based solid sorbent to purge any free steam surrounding the sorbent in order to avoid condensation, and additionally reduces the adsorbed water on the amine-based solid sorbent, so that subsequent water uptake experienced during a subsequent absorption process maintains water loading equivalent to or below the level supported by the conditions of the regeneration process. Experimental results indicate that the moisture can be released under an inert gas flow even without a temperature swing, suggesting that the moisture is weakly bonded. In an embodiment, the conditioning step establishes a water loading on the amine-based solid sorbent such that any additional water loading during a subsequent COabsorption process generates an exit water loading generally matching the regenerator water loading. This approach mitigates regeneration losses by avoiding thermal requirements for additional desorption of moisture.","A basic embodiment of the COabsorption\/regeneration method using an amine-based solid sorbent is illustrated with reference to .  depicts an absorption reactor  receiving an amine-based solid sorbent at  and a gaseous stream comprised of CO, HO and other components at . Absorption reactor  is at a first temperature where the amine-based solid sorbent would be expected to absorb gaseous CObased on known properties of the sorbent. Within absorption reactor , the amine-based solid sorbent is exposed to the gaseous stream in absorption reactor , and the amine-based solid sorbent absorbs COin a reaction with CO, amine, and HO, and further adsorbs HO from the gaseous stream as adsorbed water, where the adsorbed water is incidental to the COchemical reaction generating COabsorption, as earlier defined. Concurrently, heat transfer Qfrom absorption reactor  occurs as necessary to substantially maintain absorption reactor  at the first temperature. An exhaust stream comprised of the gaseous stream less the COand HO removed by interaction with the amine-based solid sorbent exits absorption reactor  at .","The amine-based solid sorbent at  enters absorption reactor  with an initial water loading of adsorbed water, and during exposure to the gaseous stream in absorption reactor  further increases its water loading by an adsorption amount. Following the exposure, a loaded sorbent exits absorption reactor  at . The loaded sorbent is comprised of COabsorbed in absorption reactor , the adsorption amount of water adsorbed in absorption reactor , and the initial water loading present when the amine-based solid sorbent entered absorption reactor .","As will be discussed infra, COabsorption on the amine-based solid sorbent occurs faster than the adsorption of adsorbed water. Additionally, it is understood that the amount of COabsorbed and the degree of water loading experienced in absorption reactor  is a function of the both the thermodynamic conditions within adsorption reactor  and a residence time, where the residence time is the elapsed time that the amine-based solid sorbent is exposed to the thermodynamic conditions. Under a typical process operation intended for the absorption of CO, the residence time will be tailored to achieve a given COloading. Because of the relative COand HO sorption rates, the adsorption amount of water adsorbed in absorption reactor  over the residence time is expected to be less than the equilibrium water loading that might be achieved under the same conditions, were the amine-based solid sorbent allowed sufficient time to equilibrate with respect to water in absorption reactor .","At , the loaded sorbent exiting at  is transferred to regeneration reactor . Regeneration reactor  receives the loaded sorbent and further receives a flow of regeneration steam at . The regeneration steam is at a second temperature greater than the first temperature of the loaded sorbent, and is typically slightly superheated. As a result, when the regeneration steam contacts the loaded sorbent in regeneration reactor , the regeneration steam increases the temperature of the loaded sorbent above the first temperature, to a third temperature, which may be substantially equivalent to the second temperature. The third temperature reduces the COcapacity of the amine-based solid sorbent and COdesorbs. The regeneration steam also acts to sweep the desorbed COfrom regeneration reactor  and thereby maintain a relatively low COpartial pressure above the loaded sorbent. A COstream comprised of the desorbed COand HO from the regeneration stream exits at .","An indirect heating mechanism may also be utilized in conjunction with steam regeneration to increase the temperature of the loaded sorbent to the higher second temperature. Further, heat transfer Qto regeneration reactor  may occur as necessary to substantially maintain regeneration reactor  at the second temperature. Additionally, in lieu of direct steam in the regeneration step, an organic or in organic vapor could be used. It would need to be condensable in the cooling step for the regenerator off-gas after the regenerator, be inert with respect to COcapture and the amine, and be available for multiple continuous cycles within the regeneration process. Losses of this sweep vapor would need to be negligible.","As will be discussed, and contrary to the absorption and adsorption rates within absorption reactor , COdesorption of absorbed COfrom the loaded sorbent occurs more slowly than the desorption of adsorbed water within regeneration reactor . However\u2014similar to the sizing rationale for absorption reactor \u2014under a typical process operation intended for the absorption\/desorption of CO, the residence time during the regeneration will be tailored to achieve a given COdesorption. As a result of the typical sizing and the relative desorption rates, the adsorbed water on the amine-based solid sorbent will more closely approach and may achieve the equilibrium water loading value for the thermodynamic conditions present in regeneration reactor .","As will be discussed infra, the equilibrium water loading of the amine-based solid sorbent utilized in the cycle depicted at  is highly sensitive to both the temperature and the partial pressure of water vapor in a given set of thermodynamic conditions. As a result, generally speaking, the lower temperature within absorption reactor  produces a higher equilibrium water loading than the higher temperature within regeneration reactor , even though the partial pressure of water vapor in regeneration reactor  is increased. As a result, in a system consisting of only an absorption reactor and a regeneration reactor with sorbent being continuously transported between them and operating under similar circumstances and after some amount of cycles, the water loading of the sorbent exiting the absorption reactor will exceed the water loading of the sorbent present in the regeneration reactor. A substantial portion of the energy supplied by the regeneration reactor is then expended in the removal of some portion of the water loading, rather than COdesorption. In such a case, either the regeneration reactor must be larger and supply more energy than would otherwise be required if the sorbent entered at substantially the regeneration equilibrium water loading, or the working COcapacity of the sorbent suffers, because some portion of the regeneration thermal energy is repeatedly devoted to the removal of adsorbed water, rather than COdesorption.","Typically condensation within the regenerator reactor is mitigated through the use of slightly superheated direct regeneration steam, as earlier described. When the sorbent exits the regeneration environment, condensation is mitigated through the use of conditioning.","At , regenerated sorbent exits regeneration reactor  at . As discussed, the regenerated sorbent has undergone COdesorption via steam regeneration, and as a result of particle morphology, entrainment, or some other reason, the regenerated sorbent solids may be substantially surrounded by free steam, where the free steam is vapor comprised of HO that is not adsorbed or absorbed on the surface of the regenerated sorbent, as earlier defined. Without removal, the free steam may condense on the regenerated sorbent as the regenerated sorbent temperature is decreased back down to absorption temperatures, potentially degrading the performance of the amine-based solid sorbent. In order to mitigate this condensation, the regenerated sorbent enters conditioner . Conditioner  receives a flow of a drying gas at  which contacts the regenerated sorbent and displaces the free steam, and the drying gas and the free steam exit conditioner  at . In an embodiment, the drying gas is air.","A further and significant function of conditioner  is to reduce the water loading of the regenerated sorbent, by removing some portion of the adsorbed water present on the regenerated sorbent that results from the thermodynamic conditions experienced during the steam regeneration. In an embodiment, the adsorbed water removed by conditioner  is substantially equivalent to the water uptake expected to occur during the subsequent COabsorption process, given the thermodynamic conditions in absorption reactor , the moisture loading within regeneration reactor , and the respective residence times in each reactor. In such a situation, the moisture loading of the loaded sorbent exiting absorption reactor  and entering regeneration reactor  is substantially equivalent to the moisture loading for the conditions within regeneration reactor . This allows the thermal energy transferred for regeneration to the loaded sorbent to be utilized for COdesorption rather than the desorption of adsorbed water, and the COremoval capacity of the sorbent may be optimized for a given regeneration reactor size.","With reference to , and as discussed earlier, when the amine-based solid sorbent undergoes COabsorption in absorption reactor , the amine-based solid sorbent adsorbs CO, and further adsorbs HO, increasing its water loading by an adsorption amount. At , conditioner  both removes free steam surrounding the regenerated sorbent, and further provides drying to remove an amount of adsorbed water substantially equivalent to the adsorption amount, producing a conditioned sorbent having a conditioned water loading. As a result, the water loading of the loaded sorbent exiting absorption reactor  and entering regeneration reactor  is substantially equivalent to the moisture loading for the conditions within regeneration reactor . The conditioned sorbent is then cooled and enters absorption reactor  for subsequent COabsorption in the cyclic process. Management of the water loading in this manner allows regeneration reactor  operation with significant mitigation of energy losses incurred by the necessary desorption of adsorbed water.","In an integrated type of operation, the steam regeneration within regeneration reactor  will typically be a parasitic load on steam generated by a power island for the purpose of power generation. The water management process disclosed here serves to reduce this parasitic loading by substantially alleviating the burden of adsorbed water removal during the steam regeneration process. Further, the operation of the conditioner to reduce water loading by an amount substantially equivalent to the adsorption amount uptaken in the absorption reactor, rather than an essentially complete adsorbed water removal, reduces parasitic loading requirements stemming from conditioner . Additionally, a complete drying operation within conditioner  could result in loaded sorbent entering regeneration reactor  at a water loading below the equilibrium water loading of regeneration reactor , creating an additional steam load as some portion of the regeneration steam goes toward attempting to establish equilibrium moisture conditions.","The novel disclosure herein provides for management of adsorbed water based on a recognition of the manner in which HO and COrespectively sorb and desorb from the amine-based solid sorbent. The disclosure recognizes that in a cycling COabsorption operation using the amine-based solid sorbents, COabsorption may generally occur at a faster rate than water adsorption in the COabsorption process, while COdesorption may generally occur at a slower rate than adsorbed water desorption during the amine-based solid sorbent regeneration. Because vessels used in an actual process will typically be sized to achieve acceptable COabsorption and regeneration loads, the adsorbed water loadings may lead to regeneration energy losses. Such loss increases regeneration heat duty and should be avoided.","Table 1 shows the results of testing conducted in a small packed bed reactor containing a one-gram sample of an amine-based solid sorbent. The amine-based solid sorbents evaluated were comprised of polyethylenimine (PEI) supported on a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrate, and PEI supported on a silica substrate. The testing involved an absorption step in which a stream of COand HO in helium or a stream of COor HO individually in helium flowed over the amine-based solid sorbent until the outlet COand HO concentrations equaled the inlet feed COand HO concentrations. A mass spectrometer on the gas exit detected changes in gas composition with time. The sorbent was regenerated in two steps. The initial step was sweeping the reactor system at the temperature of absorption with helium for a period of time, typically one hour. This was followed by ramping the temperature to 105\u00b0 C. under helium flow until no COor HO was emitted.","From the absorption tests with PEI\/PMMA, Table 1 indicates that the PMMA substrate is relatively inert with respect to COabsorption but will adsorb some moisture. The COcapacity and especially the HO capacity of the PEI\/PMMA sorbent decrease with an increase in temperature. Note that 60\u00b0 C. is near the typical temperature of the saturated flue gas after a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) unit. At a particular temperature, the higher the moisture content of the inlet gas (16.5% is near the 15% expected after a wet scrubber) the more the adsorbed moisture. Hence the equilibrium moisture loading is highly sensitive to both absorption temperature and partial pressure of water vapor. Additionally, it can be further concluded that, unlike CO, most of the moisture was removed in the first step of sweeping with helium, suggesting that the moisture may be adsorbed on the sorbent more weakly than the CO. Material balances between the absorption and regeneration steps were very close with respect to COand HO closure.","Capacity results of the PEI\/silica are somewhat different when compared with the PEI\/PMMA results. At similar inlet gas compositions of COand HO, the COcapacity and the HO capacity of the PEI\/silica are greater than the PEI\/PMMA results. Within the PEI\/silica matrix of testing, as the moisture vapor composition increases (7.7 versus 17.1%) the sorbent capacity for HO also increases (9.6 versus 28.7 mol\/kg sorbent). If the sorbent is run with moisture only in the helium carrier at 16.5%, the HO loading on the sorbent is 34.8, which is similar to the 28.7 mol\/kg sorbent, indicating that a significant amount of moisture can be absorbed onto the PEI\/silica sorbent at water vapor conditions mimicking those found after the FGD unit in a power plant application. Although pure steam was not used in the testing, the one condition of 90% water vapor in helium at 105\u00b0 C. approaches that of steam regeneration in the sorbent process. Even though the partial pressure of HO is great in this case, the loading is still lower than the 16.5% moisture case at 60\u00b0 C. (14.7 versus 34.8 mol\/kg sorbent) most likely due to the temperature effect. As discussed, with steam regeneration, an ideal situation would be that the loaded sorbent after an absorption operation should contain the same moisture loading as the regenerated sorbent after regeneration.","As discussed, the regeneration step is critical with respect to parasitic power requirements. The regeneration of an amine-based solid sorbent is directly related not only to the COworking capacity of the sorbent but also to the moisture content of the surrounding gases. The minimum heat duty of regeneration includes the COheat of reaction as well as the sensible heat to raise the sorbent from absorption to regeneration temperature. If moisture is adsorbed on the sorbent, this also needs to be considered in the heat duty calculation.","In a continuous sorbent flow system where sorbent is transported between an absorber and regenerator, the regenerative heat duty can be broken into several terms: the heat associated with heating the sorbent; the enthalpy change of the COfrom absorption conditions to regeneration conditions; the heat of reaction of COand the amine; the enthalpy change of any moisture on the sorbent; and the heat of reaction between the sorbent and adsorbed moisture. The latter two terms have typically been disregarded, however these two terms may increase the parasitic energy needs for the system. Additionally, with sorbents that will be regenerated under a sweep of steam, moisture considerations must be defined with respect to the energetics (regenerative heat duty).","The flow of gas through the regenerator is also a key factor. Ideally, the sweep of gas across the regenerator should be CO, so that the gas emitted from the regenerator could be pure CO. However, two issues may impact this type of regeneration. One is that if moisture in the absorption step is adsorbed onto the sorbent, it may be emitted during regeneration under COsweep and thus a stream of COand HO would be emitted. The HO could be condensed by cooling the stream, leaving pure COto be further sequestered. However, desorption of HO from the sorbent during regeneration impacts the regenerative heat duty negatively due to the desorption heat of reaction of HO. Second, in the regenerator, the partial pressure of COwill be great and the sorbent will be reluctant to release the CO. Thus a higher temperature is required for the regeneration in the presence of higher COpartial pressure using COas a sweep gas. This higher temperature not only would increase the sensible energy and therefore heat duty of regeneration, but may also have a deleterious impact on the stability of the sorbent resulting in potential vaporization of the amine and\/or decomposition of the sorbent. As a result, regeneration with direct steam by itself or in combination with indirect steam heating may be more appropriate to lower the partial pressure of COover the sorbent during regeneration, thus lowering the lean COloading and therefore raising the COworking capacity.","An example of the regeneration under a sweep of COcan be seen in . This information was obtained from a thermogravimetric unit and shows the weight change of an immobilized amine plotted versus temperature. The sorbent represented is PEI\/silica. Curve  shows the quasi-equilibrium results of flowing a pure COstream over the sorbent; curve  demonstrates a pure nitrogen stream; and curve  represents a stream of air. Under CO(curve ) and at the conditions of absorption (40-60\u00b0 C.), the sorbent absorbs much CO. As the regeneration temperature of 105\u00b0 C. is approached, the sorbent continues to pick up CO. The difference between the absorption and regeneration is the working capacity and this is small in this temperature range. Note that in a real system where the inlet COconcentration is 10-15% rather than pure, the COworking capacity would be even lower than as shown in . In order for the COworking capacity to become reasonable, a higher temperature is required for regeneration. However, this will now increase the sorbent sensible heating in the regenerative heat duty. Additionally, as seen in the air (curve ) and nitrogen (curve ) tests in , as an increase in temperature occurs (>130\u00b0 C.) the amine stability on the sorbent becomes questionable and an oxidative degradation occurs. Because of similar types of experience with other versions of immobilized amine sorbents, the conclusion is that a direct steam regeneration (low partial pressure of CO) would be more amenable than a COsweep regeneration (high partial pressure of COwith no moisture in the sweep gas).","The behavior of this type of sorbent, for example PEI\/silica, can further be exemplified by data for the pressure range that would be found in a typical cyclic operation between absorption and regeneration, if a pure COregeneration is utilized. The inlet partial pressure of COin the flue gas to the absorber would be near 0.14-atm and near 1-atm in the regenerator, if the regenerator has pure COas the sweep gas. If a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. is maintained in the absorber (near the temperature of the flue gas exiting the FGD scrubber) the capacity of the sorbent is approximately 150 mg CO\/mg sorbent. If regeneration occurs at 100\u00b0 C. and under pure surroundings of CO, the capacity of the sorbent is still substantially high, near 150 mg CO\/mg sorbent. Thus the net loading or working capacity is negligible. This further indicates that another technique is needed for regenerating this type of sorbent.","The rationale for attempting to balance or manipulate the water loading on the sorbent as it is transported among the vessels along the sorbent circulation path is based on several considerations. The overall goal is to mitigate any energy losses in the regenerator arising from desorption of water from the sorbent during regeneration, since such losses would raise the regeneration heat duty and increase separation costs. Laboratory experiments have examined the equilibrium loadings on the sorbent for both the absorber and regenerator. Absorption conditions were chosen to simulate those of an actual flue gas exiting a FGD unit in a power plant. Regeneration conditions were chosen to simulate sorbent regeneration using a direct steam sweep gas. Preliminary results have shown that a maximum HO capacity of approximately 30 moles\/kg can be achieved in the absorber. The sorbent in the regenerator can achieve a maximum HO capacity of approximately 15 moles\/kg. However, it must be emphasized that these are equilibrium loadings, i.e., there was no restriction on the elapsed time necessary to achieve steady state. The vessels in an actual process would be sized (i.e., for the sorbent residence time in contact with the gas) and restricted to achieve acceptable COloadings in the absorber. In the packed bed experimental studies, the COequilibrium absorption time is much shorter than the HO equilibrium absorption time. Therefore, a much lower loading of HO exiting the absorber is expected since the residence time will be shorter and tailored to achieve sufficient COloading. A similar logic will be employed for the regenerator, i.e., the vessel's sorbent residence time will be minimized to achieve an acceptable level of COregeneration. However, because the HO loadings are mismatched between the absorber and regenerator, a subsequent pass of the sorbent through the vessel in a continuous flow operation is equivalent to adding additional residence time for the sorbent to contact the gas and therefore raise its loading and thus ultimately approach its equilibrium loading. In the absence of manipulating the HO loading between the absorber and regenerator, the sorbent could potentially reach its equilibrium value of 30 moles\/kg exiting the absorber, providing that the absorber residence time is sufficiently long enough for an additional pickup of 15 moles\/kg. Since the sorbent can only hold 15 moles\/kg in the regenerator (its equilibrium loading), the sorbent could potentially lose the loading difference (i.e., 30\u221215=15), again assuming sufficient residence time to achieve equilibrium. Such a loss is to be avoided since it will increase regeneration heat duty.","The insertion of a moisture conditioning device after the regenerator aims to solve the moisture loading imbalance. Heated air passed through the sorbent purges any \u201cfree steam\u201d surrounding the sorbent and avoids condensation of the moisture upon cooling the sorbent to return it to the absorber. A secondary consideration of the conditioning device is to further lower the moisture loading on the sorbent exiting the regenerator to a pre-determined value entering the absorber such that the absorber exit moisture level will match the regenerator exit value. Experimental results indicate that the moisture can be readily released under an inert gas flow even without a temperature swing, suggesting that the moisture is weakly bonded. As an example based on preliminary data, assume that the sorbent will absorb 2 moles of HO per mole of COabsorbed in the absorber for the given residence time per sorbent pass. Typical COloadings are 3 moles\/kg, so 6 moles of HO\/kg will be sorbed in the absorber. That implies that the sorbent exiting the conditioner should be dried to a level of 9 moles\/kg which then enters the absorber and gains 6 moles\/kg upon contact with the flue gas and exits the absorber with a loading of 15 moles\/kg. This loading matches the regenerator loading and therefore avoids any additional desorption of moisture.","The moisture conditioning device could presumably be moved inside the regenerator by designing the regenerator residence time accordingly to achieve sufficient desorption of HO. However, the heating value (and cost to produce) of the sweep gas used to achieve the drying should be considered. This is the underlying premise of minimizing the regenerator heat duty. Steam sweeping the regenerator at 105\u00b0 C. has a higher enthalpy value than preheated air entering the external conditioning device, so it appears intuitive to favor the use of preheated sweep air in a separate device external to and after the regenerator. Additionally, any water removal from the sorbent in the regenerator will appear in the regenerator off-gas and will be separated from the COin a downstream condenser, further increasing costs.","An embodiment utilizing direct steam regeneration is illustrated at . In the embodiment at , the absorption reactor  is downstream of a coal-fired power plant and receives flue gas at  from an upstream flue gas desulfurization (FGD) unit, for example a wet scrubber or dry scrubber (spray dryer). Similarly, nitric oxides have been removed prior to absorption reactor  by selective catalytic reduction (SCR). In any event, the inlet SOand NOx are held to a minimum to minimize poisoning of the sorbent, when applicable. The stream entering into absorption reactor  is comprised of approximately 15 vol % HO and 10-15% CO, at 14.7 psia and 60\u00b0 C.","When introduced into absorption reactor , COreacts with the amine-based solid sorbent and HO may also adsorb onto the sorbent, as discussed previously. Cooling occurs as necessary via heat exchanger . The decarbonated flue gas then exits from absorption reactor  at  and proceeds to a stack. The loaded sorbent containing the reacted COand adsorbed HO exits from absorption reactor  at  and proceeds through cross-flow heat exchanger  before proceeding to regeneration reactor . Heat exchanger  can be a solid-solid heat exchanger where the loaded sorbent from absorption reactor  is heated by conditioned sorbent exiting conditioner . If direct solid-solid heat exchange is poor, heat exchanger  may also employ a secondary working fluid circulated between the two solids process streams to further enhance the heat transfer.","To react the amine-based solid sorbents described in this disclosure with COin a gas stream, heat management must be considered. Relative to trace gas contaminant removal, such as SO, NOx, and Hg, heat management in a COremoval system is more problematic due to the typical higher concentration of COin a flue gas stream. During COabsorption, an exothermic reaction occurs and this generated heat must be removed to prevent temperature increases, potential sorbent degradation, and reduced loadings. Similarly during the regeneration step, heat must be added effectively at elevated temperature to regenerate the solid sorbent for a temperature swing regeneration. Heat management may occur through various means known in the art such as heat exchangers and cyclic thermal balancing. For example, proper heat management may be obtained whole or in part by the transport of sorbent to the different reactor vessels between the absorption and regeneration steps. Thus, some form of transport reactor may be utilized in this disclosure, for example, fluidized bed, moving bed, dense-phase transport, etc. These transport reactors can contain heat transfer surfaces within the internals of the reactor to remove heat\u2014as in the case of absorption\u2014or add heat\u2014as in the case of regeneration. These types of reactors can be designed in a conventional manner. Actual transport of the sorbent between the vessels can use bucket elevators, pneumatic lock hoppers, screw feeders, or any other technique that can convey solids around a closed circulation loop.","At , the loaded sorbent then enters regeneration reactor  at . Within regeneration reactor , the loaded sorbent is directly contacted with steam regenerant entering regeneration reactor  at . Low pressure steam extracted from before the low pressure steam cycle in a power generation scheme can be used. The temperature of the steam can be as low as 105\u00b0 C., slightly superheated at ambient pressure, or greater. The steam is at the correct temperature so that moisture will not condense on the sorbent within regeneration reactor , and the steam must provide the heat of regeneration for the loaded sorbent. Some degree of superheating the steam may be required to prevent condensation.","Additionally, although the case exists where all of the heat of regeneration may be provided by a direct sweep of steam, in an embodiment only a fraction of the heat of regeneration is provided by a direct sweep of steam, and the remaining heat requirement is provided by indirect steam heating through heat exchanger . Much more heat can be transferred in the indirect steam case by condensing the steam and thereby utilizing the latent heat of vaporization. However, any condensing steam must be contacted indirectly with the sorbent to avoid liquid water depositing on the sorbent and potentially degrading it.","Within regeneration reactor , a temperature swing\/COpressure swing is utilized to regenerate the loaded sorbent. Steam is used as the regenerant. In this thermal swing regeneration, a gas stream comprised of COand moisture exits regeneration reactor  at , and cooler  condenses the moisture from the stream and produces a COstream  and an HO stream . The COstream is relatively pure and may undergo sequestration or further utilization.","The regenerated sorbent exits regeneration reactor  at . The regenerated sorbent leaving regeneration reactor  will have been exposed to steam and precaution may be needed to prevent condensation of moisture onto the regenerated sorbent upon cooling. After exiting regeneration reactor  and preferably immediately following the regeneration, the regenerated sorbent enters conditioner  and is exposed to a small flow of ambient air entering conditioner  at  and exiting at . The small flow of air is motivated by blower  and possibly heated. This will shift the free steam concentration surrounding the sorbent to a lower value to prevent condensation of moisture on the sorbent downstream during the cooling process. The flow of air further generates an HO pressure swing step where the sorbent is exposed to a small stream of air to drive off some of the moisture and partially cool the sorbent.","Calculations reveal that for a small temperature drop (about 8\u00b0 F.) and pressure drop across the unit (5 psi), the parasitic power for compression is less than 1 MW. It is assumed that a 500-MWe power plant is the baseline producing 750,000 lb CO\/hr; the temperature of the sorbent changes from 220\u00b0 F. to 212\u00b0 F.; the COloading capacity of the sorbent is 3 mol\/kg; the HO loading capacity of the sorbent is 15 mol\/kg; ambient air is 77\u00b0 F.; and isothermal compression of air is conducted. An energy balance across the conditioner yields that less gas is required as the temperature of the gas exiting the conditioner approaches the temperature of the sorbent. For a conservative air exit gas temperature of 120\u00b0 F., an isothermal compressor at 90% efficiency and with a 2-psia pressure drop across the bed, a parasitic load of 0.35 MW is calculated. Although this parasitic load is certainly not an advantage of the process, this dehumidification step may be required to maintain the performance of the sorbent. Ideally after this step, the sorbent will be free of any residual CO, and the HO loading will be fashioned to balance the water removed in the conditioner with that adsorbed in the absorber. The COworking capacity of the sorbent will be maximized. The sorbent exiting the conditioner would then flow to the heat exchanger where it is cooled to the temperature of absorption and then sent to the absorber.","Another embodiment utilizing a COand HO regeneration stream is illustrated at .  illustrates the absorption reactor  receiving a stream entering at  and comprised of approximately 15 vol % HO and 10-15% CO, at 14.7 psia and 60\u00b0 C. COreacts with the amine-based solid sorbent and cooling occurs as necessary via heat exchanger . The decarbonated gas then exits at . The loaded sorbent at  and proceeds through cross-flow heat exchanger  before proceeding to regeneration reactor . The loaded sorbent enters regeneration reactor  at .","At , a gas stream comprised of COand moisture exits regeneration reactor  at , and cooler  on the stream condenses the moisture from the stream and produces a COstream  and an HO stream , as before. In this embodiment, however, some products of regeneration are diverted at flow control means . This provides a stream of COand possibly HO which is motivated by blower  and recycled back to regeneration reactor , entering at . The heat for the regeneration may be provided by direct superheated steam injection into the recycle stream at , indirect steam heating of the recycle stream via heat exchanger , or a combination thereof. Additionally, as before, indirect steam heating may be employed in regeneration reactor  via heat exchanger . An advantage of this recycling is that the gaseous moisture content above the sorbent in the regenerator may be tailored to keep the moisture level on the sorbent exiting the regenerator the same as the content on the sorbent within the absorber.","The regenerated sorbent exits regeneration reactor  at  and enters conditioner , where exposure to a small flow of ambient air entering conditioner  at  and exiting at  occurs, motivated by blower . Conditioner  prevents moisture from condensing on the sorbent and removes some degree of adsorbed water, prior to conditioned sorbent exiting conditioner  being cooled in heat exchanger .","The amine-based solid sorbent methodology disclosed here can be applied to utilities, boilers, municipal waste incinerators, and others that combust carbon-based materials. Of these post-combustion COcapture possibilities, the one that is envisioned to be used frequently would be power plants that can burn pulverized coal or natural gas. These point sources produce a flue gas where COcan range from about 10% to 15% by volume.","Gasification processes that change a carbonaceous material into a hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixture (sometimes referred to as synthesis gas or fuel gas) can also use the COcapture technology. A water gas shift reaction in the gasification process can change the carbon monoxide to CO, and COconcentrations as high as 40% may be removed using the amine-based solid sorbent methodology disclosed here.","Additionally, any process or gas stream that contains or produces CO, either as a waste or product could use the technology for concentrating that stream of CO. Natural gas purification is an example of this. Also, the basis for ambient air COcapture systems can be the amine-based solid sorbent methodology disclosed here.","Thus, the disclosure provides a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby regeneration losses and COcapacity reductions are mitigated through proper adsorbed water management during the cyclic process.","Further, the disclosure provides a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby the manner in which HO and COare sorbed and desorbed, so that vessels sized to achieve acceptable COabsorption and regeneration loads can be optimized through the water management.","Further, the disclosure provides a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent whereby substantially equalized absorber and regenerator moisture loadings may result, so that the thermal energy in a steam regeneration process is applied maximally to COdesorption, without the necessity for desorbing HO adsorbed in the COabsorption process.","Further, the disclosure provides a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent where the method can be integrated with existing power or fuel production facilities, in order to provide a relatively pure COstream for subsequent sequestration or utilization.","Further, the disclosure provides a method of adsorbing COusing an amine-based solid sorbent where the methodology can be applied to temperature and pressure ranges avoiding oxidative degeneration of the amine-based solid sorbent while minimizing energy and infrastructure impacts.","It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention and it is not intended to be exhaustive or limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
