title: Hypermedia authoring and publishing system
abstract: The present invention comprises a novel system for authoring and publishing hypermedia works. The present invention includes a scrollable contents map window in which a graphical representation of a hypermedia work is displayed. The contents map window contains graphical lexia symbols representing the lexia of the hypermedia work, empty space, and other graphical and text elements. Links between lexia are not ordinarily displayed. Selecting a lexia symbol causes the corresponding lexia to be displayed in a lexia display window. The lexia symbols representing lexia may be arranged in the window in any configuration. Freely movable text labels and other graphical elements may be placed anywhere in the contents map window. Additional special purpose graphical elements may be placed in the contents map window to create relationships among lexia. In one embodiment, a number of different modes of the contents map window can be displayed. One mode is a caricature mode. In caricature mode, lexia are represented by novel, information rich, dynamic lexia symbols with enhanced mnemonic features and visual cues called “caricatures”. The mnemonic features and visual cues of a caricature, together with its position with respect to other elements in the contents map, provide means for uniquely visually identifying the underlying lexia. One embodiment of the invention includes a search function that allows an author or a reader to search some or all of the lexia of a work for specific words, phrases, or other items such as links. Lexia symbols of each lexia containing the searched for text are highlighted in the contents map window.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of hypermedia authoring and publishing systems.","2. Background Art","Hypertext and hypermedia refer to electronic documents or works for display on electronic media such as computer display screen. Hypermedia works do not have the serial structure of printed documents in which information is presented to a reader in a fixed order. Instead, information is presented to a reader in an order interactively determined by the reader.","In a hypermedia work, information is organized into individual portions called \u201clexia\u201d. Lexia can be viewed as containers of data. Data contained in lexia may include text, graphics, motion video and sound data. A lexia of a hypermedia work may contain one or more embedded links to other lexia. An example of a link is a highlighted word of text. Selecting the highlighted word, for example using a mouse, initiates display of the lexia to which the highlighted word is linked. This lexia may contain additional links, both back to the previous lexia and\/or to other lexia or documents.","One common use of hypermedia is in computer software help files.  is an illustration of an example lexia from a help file such as that used in the Microsoft Windows (\u2122) operating system. As shown in , lexia  includes a title bar , a text window , and a button bar . Title bar  contains the title of the lexia. For lexia , the title is \u201cHow to Use Help.\u201d Text window  contains the data for lexia , which in this case is text data describing the basic operations of Windows Help. Text window  also contains a number of link activation areas that provide links to other lexia. These link activation areas, designated items ,  and  in , are indicated in text window  by bold facing and underlining of the words that constitute the links. Link activation area  consists of the word \u201clinks\u201d. Link activation area  consists of the word \u201cmaximize\u201d. Link activation area  consists of the word \u201cminimize.\u201d Link activation areas ,  and  link particular locations of lexia  to other lexia.","Button bar  contains a number of additional link activation areas in the form of buttons -Button labeled \u201cContents\u201d, provides a link to a table of contents lexia. Button labeled \u201cBack\u201d, provides a link to the previously displayed lexia. Because the previously displayed lexia changes according to the path used to get to lexia , the lexia linked to by button changes over time. The link provided by button is therefore a dynamic link that links to different lexia at different times. Buttons and link lexia  as a whole to other lexia.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["125","100","200","100","200","210","215","220","220","200","225","230"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The complex, dynamic inter-linked nature of a hypermedia work makes it difficult for both authors and readers to form an accurate and meaningful picture of the hypermedia work as a whole. Prior art hypermedia authoring and publishing (or reading) systems have attempted to provide graphical representations of hypermedia works by focusing on ways to show links between lexia.","One prior art graphical depiction of a hypermedia work is illustrated in FIG. . As shown in , this prior art system depicts each lexia as the target of incoming links and the source of outgoing links. In the example of , the hypermedia work consists of ten lexia, represented by boxes labeled \u201cLexia \u201d through \u201cLexia \u201d. The hypermedia work is depicted by three repeated columns of the ten lexia. In the first column, Lexia - are identified by numbers -, in the second column by numbers -, and in the third column by numbers -. A link from one lexia to another is shown as an arrow from the source lexia to the target lexia. The second column shows all incoming and outgoing links for each lexia. For example, Lexia  has incoming links from Lexias , , and . Accordingly, each of Lexias ,  and  contain a link to Lexia . Lexia  is shown as having outgoing links to Lexias ,  and . Accordingly, Lexia  contains links to Lexias ,  and .  is an alternative view of the prior art representation of  showing only the incoming and outgoing links for Lexia .","The hypermedia work illustrated in  consists of only ten lexia. Even with this small number of lexia,  is confusing and complex. As a result, it does not provide a meaningful overview of the structure and content of the underlying hypermedia work. For a typical work containing several times the number of lexia shown in , the graphical representation of  is even less satisfactory.","Another prior art method for graphically representing a hypermedia work is shown in FIG. .  shows the same hypermedia work shown in FIG. . In the representation shown in , Lexia - are located at movable locations in window . Links between lexia are shown as arrows from the source lexia to the target lexia. The position of each lexia can be changed by the user, for example by dragging with a mouse. As a lexia moves, the arrows indicating links remain attached. As is evident from , this representation of a hypermedia work also fails to provide an easily understandable overview of the hypermedia work as a whole.","Authoring a hypermedia work involves creating each lexia to be included in the work and connecting the lexia with appropriate links. A variety of methods for creating and linking lexia are provided in the prior art.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,982,244 discloses a hypertext creation system in which lexia are displayed in the form of cards containing text. A first, blank card is created by activating the appropriate menu command. The blank card is supplied with an \u201cautolink\u201d button. Selecting the autolink button creates a second card automatically linked to the first, and also creates a link activation button on the first card. By choosing an appropriate menu command, the second card may also be provided with an autolink button allowing the creation of further links.","Another prior art hypertext creation system is the \u201cStoryspace\u201d software program from Eastgate Systems, Inc. In Storyspace, lexia called \u201cwriting spaces\u201d are displayed as boxes on a computer display screen. A link from one writing space to another is created by selecting the source writing space, selecting an appropriate menu command, and selecting the target writing space. The link can be changed to a link from or to a particular location in a lexia by selecting either the source or target writing space, choosing an edit link menu command, and identifying particular text in the writing space as the beginning or end of the link, as appropriate.","Prior art hypermedia authoring and publishing systems, though providing basic mechanisms for creating and displaying links between lexia, fail to provide an easy to use authoring and reading environment that allows authors to easily create and organize and readers to easily navigate and comprehend a hypermedia work.","The present invention comprises a novel system for authoring and publishing hypermedia works, including hypertext documents. One feature of one embodiment of the present invention is a scrollable contents map window in which a graphical representation of a hypermedia work is displayed. In one embodiment, the contents map window is displayed across the top portion of a display screen, while a lexia display window is displayed on the display screen below the contents map window. The contents map window contains graphical lexia symbols representing the lexia of the hypermedia work, empty space, and other graphical and text elements. Links between lexia are not ordinarily displayed. Selecting the lexia symbol causes the corresponding lexia to be displayed in the lexia display window. The lexia symbols representing lexia may be arranged in the window in any configuration desired by the author, unconstrained by the actual structure of the underlying hypermedia work, and may be moved around at will by the author and\/or a reader. The lexia symbols may be arranged in any manner that aids the author, and\/or a reader in organizing and understanding the structure and content of the hypermedia work. Freely movable text labels and other graphical entities may be placed anywhere in the contents map window to aid in creating and\/or reading the hypermedia work. In one embodiment, the present invention uses the method for navigating multiple independent windowed images disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/298,215, attached hereto as Appendix 1.","In one embodiment of the invention, additional graphical entities may be placed in the window to create relationships among lexia corresponding to lexia symbols that are placed on these additional entities. For example, one relation-creating graphical entity is a bar. This bar may be placed anywhere in the window at any orientation. By itself, it performs no function. However, if lexia symbols representing lexia are placed on the bar, links are created between the lexia represented by the lexia symbols according to the relative position of the lexia symbols on the bar. In one embodiment, one end of the bar represents a \u201cprevious\u201d direction and the other end a \u201cnext\u201d direction. For any two lexia symbols placed adjacent to each other on the bar, \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cprevious\u201d links will be created between the underlying lexia. The lexia corresponding to the lexia symbol placed doser to the \u201cprevious\u201d end of the bar will be automatically supplied by the invention with a \u201cnext\u201d button. Activating the \u201cnext\u201d button from the lexia will bring up the lexia represented by the lexia symbol placed nearer the \u201cnext\u201d end of the bar. Similarly, the lexia represented by the lexia symbol placed closer to the \u201cnext\u201d end will be given a \u201cprevious\u201d button that links to the lexia represented by the lexia symbol closer to the \u201cprevious\u201d end. Lexia symbols may be moved around on the bar, inserted between other lexia symbols on the bar, added or removed from the bar, with all the links between the underlying lexia automatically updated to correspond to the new arrangement. More complex configurations for the graphical relation-creating entity, for example a grid, may be used, creating more complex relationships between lexia.","In one embodiment of the invention, graphical elements displayed in the contents map window provide \u201cinheritance\u201d characteristics and properties for lexia symbols that are disposed on the graphical elements.","In one embodiment of the invention, a number of different modes of the contents map window can be displayed. Different types of lexia symbols are displayed in each mode. Each type of lexia symbol provides a different package of information about the underlying lexia. One mode is a basic mode that provides a fundamental view of the hypermedia work. In this mode, the type of lexia symbol used to represent a lexia is a simple symbol such as a bitmap. In one embodiment, the symbol used is a colored dot. This type of symbol provides little information about the underlying lexia other than its relationship to the structure of the work as a whole. A second mode is a caricature mode. This mode provides more detailed information about the lexia in the underlying work than provided by the basic mode. In this mode, the type of lexia symbol used to represent a lexia is a novel, information rich, dynamic lexia symbol with enhanced mnemonic features and visual cues called a \u201ccaricature\u201d. The mnemonic features and visual cues of a caricature, together with its position with respect to other elements in the contents map, provide means for uniquely visually identifying the underlying lexia.","A caricature is not simply a scaled down image of the underlying lexia, but is derived algorithmically from the content of the underlying lexia. As such, the caricature becomes both a distinctive symbol for the lexia and a representation that aids an author and\/or a reader in associating lexia content with a particular caricature, and helps an author and\/or reader remember this association during subsequent navigation through a hypermedia work.","For a lexia that is in the form of a page of text, one embodiment of the invention represents the lexia as a caricature of the paragraph structure of the underlying page. The caricature uses groups of horizontal lines to represent paragraphs of text. Although the paragraph configuration displayed by the caricature corresponds to the paragraph configuration on the underlying page, there is no direct one-to-one correspondence between the lines displayed by the caricature and the lines of text in the lexia. The lines displayed on the caricature change dynamically in response to changes made to the structure of the underlying lexia.","In one embodiment, a caricature contains features that provide information about the access history of a lexia.","In one embodiment, a caricature for a lexia is originally displayed as a symbol such as a rectangle with sharply defined corners. As the lexia corresponding to the caricature is repeatedly accessed, either by an author while creating a work or by a reader reading the work, the sharp corners of the caricatures are smoothed. The more the underlying lexia is selected, the more the corners get rounded.","In one embodiment, the color of the caricature also provides information about the underlying lexia. The color of a caricature starts off a bright color such as white or yellow. The longer the underlying lexia is not selected, the darker the color of its caricature becomes. Thus it is easy at a glance to recognize the most used and least used lexia.","Caricatures may include additional visual cues, such as a v-shaped notch along an edge. In one embodiment, the position of the notch indicates the relative time, compared to other lexia, when the lexia was created.","Caricatures may also be provided with random or pseudo random features that are not based on any feature of the underlying lexia but that are added to a caricature to help distinguish the caricature from other caricatures. In one embodiment, a v-shaped notch is generated at a randomized position along the top edge of the caricature to give the caricature a unique appearance.","In one embodiment of the invention, a new lexia is created by moving a pointer to an empty location in the contents map window and activating a mouse button. A lexia symbol representing a new lexia is displayed at the indicated location, and an initially empty lexia is displayed in the lexia display window. If the caricature mode of the contents map window is active, the lexia symbol for the new lexia displayed in the contents map window is a caricature. An editing mode may be activated for the lexia display window. In the editing mode, editing tools are provided that allow text and graphics and hypermedia links to be added to the lexia. As the content of the lexia is edited, the caricature displayed in the contents map window changes to reflect the changed content of the lexia.","One embodiment of the present invention includes a search function that allows an author or a reader to search some or all of the lexia of a work for specific words or phrases. In one embodiment of the invention, all lexia containing the searched for text are highlighted in the contents map window. A reader thus can easily locate and access the lexia containing the desired text.","In one embodiment of the invention, an author may elect to provide a viewer of the author's hypermedia work a contents map having a different configuration than the contents map used by the author to create the work. In one embodiment, the author may designate that certain graphical elements contained in the contents map be visible only to the author, and not to a viewer.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","610","620","610","620","610","600","620","600","610","620"]},"In the embodiment of , contents map window  shows a portion of a contents map that graphically displays the lexia of a hypermedia work. Contents map window  is scrolled using scrolling frame  of navigation window  using the method disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/298,215 for \u201cMethod for Navigating Multiple Independent Windowed Images\u201d, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix 1.

The mnemonic features and visual cues of a caricature, together with its position with respect to other elements in the contents map, provide means for uniquely visually identifying the underlying lexia.","The visual cues of a caricature identify distinguishing features of the underlying lexia. A caricature is not a static, predefined symbol, but is constructed dynamically based on the content and history of the underlying lexia. A caricature, as its name implies, is not generally an exact, miniature replica of the underlying lexia. Instead, it is a separate graphical image that is constructed so as to exaggerate certain distinguishing aspects as, for example, distinctive features of the visual appearance of the underlying lexia. As such, the caricature becomes both a distinctive symbol for the lexia and a representation that aids an author and\/or a reader in associating lexia content with a particular caricature, and helps an author and\/or reader remember this association during subsequent navigation through a hypermedia work. In one embodiment, the appearance of a caricature is periodically refreshed to reflect changes that may have occurred in the underlying lexia. In one embodiment, the appearance of a caricature is refreshed after each change that is made to an underlying lexia. In one embodiment, the appearance of a caricature for a lexia is frozen upon expiration of a predetermined time limit or upon user command.","In caricature  represents \u201cOverview\u201d lexia  displayed in lexia display window .

Paragraph  contains two full lines and one partial line approximately two-thirds of a full line in length. Paragraph  contains three full lines of text and a partial fourth line containing a single word. Visual distinguishing features of Overview lexia  are a short heading, a relatively short first paragraph whose last line is two-thirds of a full line in length, and a second paragraph somewhat longer than the first paragraph whose last line is a single word.","In the embodiment of , caricature  consists of a stylized image of a page of text, reflecting the fact that the underlying lexia is a text lexia. As shown in greater detail in , caricature  consists of a rectangle  inside of which are lines representing paragraphs of text. Specifically, caricature  includes a short bold line ; a first paragraph  consisting of two lines, one of which full length and the other approximately two-thirds of a full length; and a second paragraph  consisting of three lines, two of which are full length and one of which is a short stub. Short bold line  of caricature  represents underlined heading  of Overview lexia . First paragraph  of caricature  represents first paragraph  of Overview lexia . Second paragraph  of caricature  represents second paragraph  of Overview lexia . Although paragraphs  and  of caricature  contain two and three horizontal straight lines, respectively, while paragraphs  and  of underlying Overview lexia  contain three and four actual lines of text, respectively, the relative shapes and sizes of paragraphs  and  of caricature  are visually generally the same as the relative shapes and sizes of paragraphs  and  of Overview lexia .

Also, it is not necessary to have the same number of paragraph representations in a caricature as there are paragraphs in the underlying lexia. If the lexia contains a table, it is not necessary for a table representation used in the corresponding caricature to contain the same number of columns and\/or rows as the original table.","The caricatures of the present invention can be used to improve recognition of the underlying lexia by exaggerating visual features that a person typically uses to distinguish one item from another and by minimizing those features that a person tends to ignore. For purposes of distinguishing one caricature from another and for associating a caricature with the content of the underlying lexia, the existence of a table, or the fact that a paragraph or heading is centered, may be more important than the configuration of the table or the length of the paragraph or heading. Similarly, for a very long lexia, the appearance of the first portion of the lexia may be sufficient to distinguish the lexia from other lexia. Accordingly, only a representation for the first portion of the lexia need be displayed in the caricature. For example, for a lexia containing ten paragraphs, it may be sufficient to display representations of only the first four paragraphs in the corresponding caricature. Thus, by appropriately choosing the criteria used for creating caricatures, the vertical dimension of a caricature, if desired, can be compressed significantly compared to the vertical dimension of the underlying lexia.
