No. 10\/097,989, filed Mar. 13, 2002, and entitled \u201cHIGH AVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENT FOR SERVERS USING STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL)\u201d.","Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to communication networks. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus and method for creating a new facility in cluster nodes.","Web collaboration and e-business solutions may be provided by use of an application known as the eRoom server application (\u201ceRoom\u201d) from eROOM TECHNOLOGIES, INCORPORATED. eRoom can run on the MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000 server family of products from MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Redmond, Wa. One version of eRoom can be deployed using either a built-in database engine which utilizes SQLAnywhere or deployed using the Microsoft SQL 2000 server or SQL Server 7 database. Both deployment methods are stand-alone installations, meaning that the eRoom and SQLAnywhere run on the same machine with no redundancy. When used with Microsoft SQL, the database engine can reside locally on the eRoom server or on a different server.","Both deployment methods do not provide for redundancy or high availability features. For example, the eRoom server application does not support the Microsoft Clustering Service as a native feature. Instead, methods, such as fault tolerant hardware and disk configurations combined with full system backups, are the current and non-robust techniques to protect an eRoom instance.","Therefore, current technologies, such as eRoom, are unable to support a clustered highly available instance which would be useful in, for example, critical applications or in an environment with many users. For example, the eRoom application does not support clustering as a native feature and is advertised as a stand-alone application.","Furthermore, novel solutions would be required for creating a new facility if more robust-techniques are used to protect an eRoom instance.","Therefore, current technologies are limited in their capabilities and suffer from at least the above constraints.","In one embodiment of the invention, a method of creating a facility in a clustered server configuration, includes:","creating a facility on a first cluster node;","adding facility registry keys to a resource in the cluster group, the registry keys comprising a facility key, a full text key, open database connectivity format keys, and a connectivity information key;","performing a fail-over operation of the cluster group from the first cluster node to the second cluster node;","resetting a password for the open database connectivity for the added facility; and","removing the added facility registry keys to prevent replication back to the first cluster node.","Testing of the new added facility may also be performed. A fail-over operation of the cluster group to the first cluster node may also then be performed.","In another embodiment of the invention, an apparatus for providing a facility in a cluster server configuration, includes: a first cluster node; a second cluster node; a shared disk system coupled to the first cluster node and second cluster node; where a facility can be created on the first cluster node, where facility registry keys are added to a resource in the cluster group, the registry keys comprising a facility key, a full text key, open database connectivity format keys, and a connectivity information key, and where a fail-over operation of the cluster group can be performed from the first cluster node to the second cluster node.","These and other features of an embodiment of the present invention will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the entirety of this disclosure, which includes the accompanying drawings and claims.","In the description herein, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of components and\/or methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that an embodiment of the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other apparatus, systems, methods, components, materials, parts, and\/or the like. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of embodiments the invention.","Embodiments of the invention are applicable in the cluster application environment. Embodiments of the invention provide a process to allow the creation of new facilities on both nodes in a cluster configuration. In one embodiment, a method for creating new facilities includes, creating a new facility, configuring for registry replication, and resetting of security settings on the receiving cluster node.","Embodiments of the invention may provide the advantages of requiring no modification to an eRoom application code and\/or allowing for multiple facilities to be replicated in a robust manner. In particular, embodiments of the invention advantageously solve the problem of creating new facilities on a second cluster node in a cluster configuration.","An overview discussion is first presented on a method for creating a cluster configuration with servers using structured query language (SQL). This method is discussed below with reference to  and  and is discussed in further detail in the above-referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/097,989, by Troy C. Whitlow, filed Mar. 13, 2002, and entitled \u201cHIGH AVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENT FOR SERVERS USING STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL)\u201d, which is hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"In an embodiment, the apparatus  includes a first server (server ) connected to a second server (server ) via a public network  such as, for example, a local area network (LAN). Both servers and can access a shared storage system . The node cluster configuration (hereinafter \u201ccluster\u201d) in  is defined by the servers and , shared storage system , and private network  for transmitting heartbeat traffic.","In one embodiment, the servers and are of the same type so that the similar hardware between the two servers and improves performance from a standard-standpoint. However, it is not a requirement that both servers and are of the same type of hardware.","In one embodiment, the server may include eRoom resources, while the server may include SQL resources. As known to those skilled in the art, SQL is a standardized query language for requesting information from a database. The servers and can be any type of machine that use SQL and are not necessarily limited to a requirement of using eRoom resources.","As described below, in an embodiment, an eRoom instance is created in the appropriate cluster resources. Additionally, an SQL instance is configured to provide database protection. Each server (or node) in the cluster has a specific function. The first server is, for example, the primary owner of the eRoom virtual server, while the second server is, for example, the primary owner of the SQL virtual server. This permits optimal performance for each instance, with system resources available for virtual servers to fail-over. Each virtual server includes the needed resources necessary for eRoom and SQL to function in the cluster. For example, the resource group for eRoom to function in the cluster may include the elements shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"eRoom resource group"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"physical disk"]},{"entry":[{},"Internet Protocol (IP) address"]},{"entry":[{},"network name"]},{"entry":[{},"IIS Admin service"]},{"entry":[{},"World Wide Web Services service"]},{"entry":[{},"Simple Mail Transport Protocol Service"]},{"entry":[{},"FTP Publishing service"]},{"entry":[{},"Internet Information Server (IIS)"]},{"entry":[{},"virtual root default File Transfer"]},{"entry":[{},"Protocol (FTP)"]},{"entry":[{},"IIS virtual root - default web"]},{"entry":[{},"eRoom scheduler service"]},{"entry":[{},"eRoom extension manager service"]},{"entry":[{},"ERoom Diagnostics service"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As another example, the resource group for SQL to function in the cluster may include the elements shown in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SQL resource group"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"physical disk"]},{"entry":[{},"SQL IP address"]},{"entry":[{},"SQL network name"]},{"entry":[{},"SQL server"]},{"entry":[{},"SQL agent"]},{"entry":[{},"SQL full text"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Both servers and in the cluster are typically designed with enough system resources to handle the load of resources that are failed over to the surviving server (node).

The same is true for the SQL instance, where during a failure of a server (node) that owns the SQL resources, the resources would move automatically to the surviving server (node). The operation of an embodiment of an apparatus  is described in conjunction with the flowchart shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","120"]},"An embodiment of the process  for enhancing the eRoom application to provide for high availability, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, is now discussed. It is noted that the names used to identify the elements or actions in the drawings (e.g., \u201cC:\\\u201d disk, \u201cD:\u201d disk, \u201cE:\u201d disk, \u201cM:\u201d disk, \u201cQ:\\\u201d disk, and\/or the like) are only provided as some possible examples to identify the elements or actions, and other names may be used as well to identify the elements and actions shown in the drawings and discussed in the text.","Hardware Configuration (Action )","In action (), all necessary hardware for clustering (or cluster configuration) is installed in the servers and . The hardware to be installed includes, for example, a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) controller that is cluster-capable and additional network interface cards (NICs) for the networking functions. All hardware devices are typically installed in the same slots for each of the servers and . Additionally, in one embodiment, the hardware is check for compliance with the Microsoft Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).","Operating System and Application Installation (Action )","In action (), an operating system is first installed in one of the servers (e.g., first server ). For example, the operating system is the Windows 2000 Advanced Server Application which may be installed in a (C:\\) disk (memory ). By use of the operating system, a temporary (D:) disk and temporary (E:) disk are created in a non-shared disk subset (or memory ). The temporary (D:) disk and temporary (E:) disk are partitioned in the memory ","Also, in action (), a standard SQL installation is performed. SQL program files may be installed in the (C:\\) disk, and SQL data files may be installed in the (E:) drive. The server  is restarted after completing the SQL installation.","Also, in action () a standard eRoom application installation is performed. For example, the eRoom 5.x SQL version is installed in the server . Scripts files and eRoom setup files may be installed to a default path (C:\\Inetpub) in the (C:\\) disk, and eRoom program files and eRoom server data may be installed in the (D:) disk.","Thus, the server  is now fully functional as a standalone server with eRoom and SQL functionality.","System Duplication or Cloning (Action )","In action (), an image or snapshot of the server is taken and duplicated in the server . Two different methods may be used to duplicate or clone an image or snapshot of the server . First, standard backup software may be used to clone the image or snapshot of the server . The backup software will perform a full backup of the images in the first server to the second server . The use of a standard backup software for cloning typically requires a minimum operating software image to first be installed in second server and empty (D:) and (E:) disk spaces be present in the second server prior to the cloning action. Additionally, the standard backup software typically requires the name of the second server to be changed to the name of the first server ","Alternatively, a disk imaging product may be used to clone the image or snapshot of the server . An example of a suitable disk imaging product is of type such as NORTON GHOST from SYMANTEC CORPORATION.","Thus, in action (), the (C:\\) disk image or snapshot in memory of server is cloned into a (C:\\) disk (memory ) of second server . The (D:) and (E:) disk images or snapshots in memory of server is cloned into the (D:) disk and (E:) disk (memory ) of second server ","The first server is then taken off-line. An IP address and Network Name is assigned to second server . Additionally, other appropriate networking properties are changed in the second server . The first server is then placed back on-line.","As a result, both servers and can run as stand-alone servers with eRoom and SQL functionality. Both servers and may be tested for correct functionality.","Initial Cluster Configuration (Action )","In action (), the cluster server (shared storage system ) is installed. An initial cluster configuration procedure is performed for eventually permitting both servers and to function in the clustered environment. As shown in , the drive letters of logical disk (D:) in first server is changed to (M:). Similarly, the drive letters of logical disk (D:) in second server is changed to (M:). The drive letters of logical disks (E:) on both servers and are also changed to (N:).","In action (), in an embodiment, logical disks are created in the available disk sets in the shared cluster disk system  () by use of a Disk Administrator in first server . For example, the following separated disks are created in the shared disk system : disk (Q:) (i.e., memory ) for the cluster Quorum disk, disk (D:) (i.e., memory ) for eRoom Server Data, and disk (F:) (i.e., memory ) for SQL installation.","Thus, the first server (or second server ) will have six (6) logical drives (three on the non-shared bus and three on the shared cluster bus).","eRoom Cluster Configuration (Action )","In action (), eRoom is first shut down. eRoom program files and eRoom server data in the (M:) disk of, for example, the first server are then copied to the (D:) disk (memory ) of the shared storage . eRoom is again turned on. Testing is also performed to verify that the eRoom cluster resource in the shared storage  can move to the second server . Thus, both servers and can use the shared storage  to run eRoom. Typically, the eRoom application will run on only one of the nodes (e.g., first server ) that owns the disk (D:) in the shared storage  (i.e., active\/passive state). The shared disk (D:) will move over to the other node (e.g., second server ) as part of the cluster on fail-over.","SQL Cluster Configuration (Action )","In action (), all SQL services in both servers and are stopped, and SQL is uninstalled on both servers and . The disk drive letter on first server is changed from (E:) to (N:), and the shared cluster disk (F:) (i.e., memory ) is changed to (E:). The disk drive letter on the second server is changed from (E:) to (N:).","SQL installation is then performed to install SQL to disk (E:) in the shared storage . User databases in the servers and are copied to the disk (E:) in the shared storage .","On the first server and second server , all Open Database Connectivity Format (ODBC) connections for the eRoom databases are reset to point the servers and to the shared storage . Thus, SQL is now running in a clustered mode, and eRoom is pointing to the databases in the shared storage  disk (D:).","The cluster resources on the servers and are set up, and the virtual IIS instances are also set up so that eRoom can run under a virtual name. This permits the use of a one-entry name no matter where eRoom is running (whether eRoom is running on first server or second server ).","The temporary disks (M:) and (N:) in the servers and are then removed.","Post Installation Testing (Action )","In action (), eRoom functionality is tested using the virtual web address defined in the eRoom cluster resource setup for verification. The eRoom resource group is moved to second server and tested again. The eRoom resource group is then returned to first server . The SQL resource is also tested by moving the resource back and forth between the servers and ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","1","305","2","305","305","305","320","305","305","320","305","305"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b ","a ","b","a ","b. "]},"In an embodiment of the invention, when a new facility in the eRoom application is created in the first server , then a facility creation process permits the facility to also be created in the second server for proper operation in the cluster configuration of . Typically, the eRoom application permits the creation of a particular facility only once, and as a result, the second server will need notification of the new facility created on the other server . In the eRoom application, a facility is simply a group of eRooms that have their own Administrator, licenses, and list of members. Thus, a facility effectively serves as a logical container that contains the \u201crooms\u201d in the eRoom application. The eRoom application supports multiple facilities per eRoom server.","A non-clustered version of the eRoom application includes a configuration for creating a new facility by use of an administrative web page.

In a preferred embodiment, action () involves adding the registry keys to the eRoom NOTIFIER resource because the resource uses an integrated replication scheme in the clustering operation with a checkpoint operation to ensure successful replication between the cluster nodes.","A fail-over is then performed () to the second cluster node, for the cluster group (i.e., the resource group that owns the eRoom application). During the fail-over, the five keys above are replicated in the second cluster node. A cluster administrator application is typically used for performing the fail-over operation from the fist cluster node to the second cluster node.","A reset is then performed () for the ODBC password for the new added facility. The ODBC password is reset because the password is encrypted and is lost during the fail-over operation. An ODBC tool is typically used to reset the password.","The five registry keys are then removed (). The registry keys are removed from the eRoom NOTIFIER resource. In removing the registry keys from the cluster resource, this prevents replication back to the originating cluster node. These five registry keys were previously added in action () above. The cluster administrator is typically used to remove the registry keys.","Tests may then be performed () for the functionality of the new facility. A standard web browser functionality may be used to perform the testing operations.","A fail-over is then performed () to the first cluster node for the eRoom cluster group. This fail-over operation is performed to insure proper operation of the eRoom resource group in the cluster configuration. The cluster administrator is typically used to perform the fail-over operation. The failover in step () is intended to get the application back into the original state prior to adding the facility.","A generic service, such as the eRoom EXTENSION MANAGER application, is used as the cluster resource to permit the replication operation.
