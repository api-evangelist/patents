{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/007,530, filed on Mar. 31, 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This document relates to systems and techniques for sharing information between mobile devices that are proximate to one another.","People are social creatures. We meet, we greet, we network, we socialize. We also like to share information, be it news, gossip, business talk or anything else. When we first meet a new person, for instance, we may exchange contact information so that we can communicate later, such as by writing on the back of a napkin or other scrap paper. With people we already know, we may swap family photos, e-mails, or other similar items. And when we are working with electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones, we may simply beam such information back-and-forth using wireless communication protocols.","However, we don't always want to share such information with everyone in the area, and wireless communications spread out in every direction (absent a dish or other structure to direct them, or the ability of walls to block them, as with infra-red signals). As a result, users may e-mail information to each other when they meet so as to limit the ability of a third party to intercept such information. Other elaborate mechanisms may likewise be used to provide relatively secure communications between two wireless devices that are in proximity to each other (e.g., within feet or yards of each other and within a line of sight of each other).","This document describes systems and techniques that may be used to determine when to share information between mobile devices that are in close proximity to each other. For example, coordinated motion of two devices may be taken as an indication that the owners of the devices want to exchange information with each other, and such transfer may occur in a protected manner so that devices other than the two devices cannot easily eavesdrop. To provide security from accidental transmissions, the systems and techniques may seek manual user approval, such as by providing limited information between the devices, showing such information to the user of a device, and seeking approval from the user to transmit detailed information to the other device. Such requirement of approval may be used as a gateway to the reception of information, in addition to the transmission of information, so as to prevent a user from accidentally transmitting information to someone else, and also to prevent the user from receiving unwanted information from other users.","In certain implementations, such systems and technique may provide one or more advantages. For example, users of mobile devices may be able to communicate information, such as contact information, even where they do not have a data plan, where data transfer of all information is over a short range. Users may also exchange e-mail addresses or telephone numbers at short range and then exchange other information, such as more private information (which could include telephone numbers), using e-mail. Such exchange of information may occur, in certain circumstances, without requiring the users to type in an e-mail address or other extensive information that takes time to enter and brings a risk of data entry errors. In addition, the techniques described here may permit such transmission in a public area without others snooping on the communication. Moreover, in certain cases, the users may control whether their information is shared and whether they will receive information from other users.","In one implementation, a method for sharing information between mobile computing devices is disclosed. The method comprises sensing a physical motion event of a first mobile device, obtaining information reflecting a physical motion event of a second mobile device that is in proximity to the first mobile device, and transmitting data to the second mobile device upon a determination that the physical motion events match each other. Sensing a physical motion event of the first mobile device can comprise obtaining acceleration data from an accelerometer in the first mobile device. Also, the determination that the physical motion events match each other can comprise comparing patterns of the motion events and times at which the motion events occurred. In addition, the physical motion events can be determined to match if the pattern and time of the motion event for the first mobile device are separated from the pattern and time of the second mobile device by less than a predetermined separation distance.","In some aspects, the physical motion event comprises momentary contact between the first mobile device and the second mobile device. The physical motion event can also comprise coordinated hand-held motion of the first mobile device and the second mobile device at a distance. Also, the information reflecting a physical motion event can comprise a key derived from an acceleration measurement of the second mobile device, and further comprise using the key to decode encoded information from the second mobile device. The method can further comprise, upon a determination that the physical motion events match each other, prompting a user of the first device to confirm an intent to transmit data to the second mobile device.","In other aspects, the method can further comprise automatically receiving, from the second mobile device, data of a type that matches the transmitted data. The received and transmitted data can correspond to contact information for users of the second mobile device and the first mobile device, respectively. Moreover, the method can also include receiving, from a user of the first mobile device, confirmation to share private information with the second mobile device, and transmitting the private data to the second mobile device only if the confirmation is received.","In another implementation, a mobile computing device is disclosed. The device comprises an accelerometer to sense motion of the mobile computing device, a wireless interface to communicate with devices in a local proximity of the mobile computing device, and a communications coordination module to compare physical motion data for the mobile computing device to physical motion data of another mobile computing device and to cause the mobile computing device to transmit information to the other mobile computing device reports motion data matching motion data from the accelerometer. The device can further comprise an accelerometer data encoder coordinated with an accelerometer data encoder in the other mobile computing device to generate commonly encoded accelerometer data. Also, the commonly encoded accelerometer data can include a time stamp corresponding to the time of an acceleration event. In addition, the communications coordination module can cause the mobile computing device to transmit information if a pattern of the physical motion data from the mobile computing device matches a pattern of the physical motion data from the other mobile computing device within a predetermined separation distance.","In some aspects, the device further comprises an accelerometer limit detector to permit provision of physical motion data to the communications coordination module only if the accelerometer provides acceleration signals matching a predetermined profile. The predetermined profile can comprise an impulse indicative of physical contact between the devices, and can comprise repeated motion of the devices. The device can also comprise an alert generator to prompt a user of the mobile computing device to confirm an intent by the user to transmit data to the other mobile computing device. The interface can also be configured to receive, from the other mobile device, data of a type that matches data transmitted by the mobile computing device.","In another implementation, a mobile computing device is disclosed that comprises an accelerometer to sense motion of the mobile computing device, a wireless interface to communicate with devices in a local proximity of the mobile computing device, and means for enabling communication from the mobile computing device to the devices in a local proximity of the mobile computing device.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","This document describes systems and techniques for sharing information between users of mobile devices in a way that can prevent eves-dropping by other mobile device users, and can prevent accidental sharing of a first user's personal information, or unwanted receipt of a second user's information by the first user. Eavesdropping may be prevented by having two devices communicate in a manner that is agreed upon based on coordinated motion between the devices, such as tapping the devices together. For example, an encryption key may be generated that is a function of an acceleration sensed by accelerometers in the two devices when a tapping event is identified. Because the motion experienced by the two devices should generally match, their internally generated keys should also match. In some implementations, the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol may be used to generate a key for encrypting subsequent communications between devices. Unwanted sharing and receipt of information may be avoided by providing a confirmation request to the user of a device, so that simple motion of the device (e.g., jiggling in a pocket) or attempts at hidden tapping do not result in sharing of information.","Such security issues may be considered to occur, for example, at three different levels: (1) untrusted people trying to watch an information exchange and steal the data exchanged, (2) an untrusted person trying to pair with another person's device to inject data onto it, and (3) an untrusted person trying to pair with another person's device in order to get that other person's contact information. The generation of keys in the manner discussed here may prevent the first problem by creating a key that is based on coordinated actions of two users that is hard to replicate by a distant onlooker. The second and third problems may be avoided by requiring close contact between users, so that an interloper would be recognized, and may be further avoided by including a manual confirmation by a user before their device will accept information form another user, and before it will share private information with another user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","10","20","12","16","12","16","12","16"]},"In the scenario , the users , , instead indicate an intent to share information by tapping their devices ,  together one or more times. The users may understand, based on documentation provided with their mobile devices, that such an action will trigger their mobile devices ,  to open a communication session with each other for passing of certain information between the devices , . In particular, each of devices ,  may be equipped with a motion sensor such as an accelerometer, and the coordinated motion created by the tapping of the devices , , such as acceleration in one direction followed by sharp acceleration in the opposite direction, may signal to each device ,  to begin an information sharing procedure.","For example, each of devices ,  may recognize particular acceleration events as indicating a likely intent by a user to share information. When such events are recognized, the devices , , may invoke one or more applications to affect the sharing of information. Such applications may open a communication session between devices , , using a key to transmit information. In some implementations, the key may agreed upon by a secure key-exchange procedure. For example, the selected key-exchange technique may be the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.","In scenario , the devices ,  are not placed into contact to indicate an intent to share information. Rather, a different type of coordinated motion between the devices ,  is instituted by the users , . In this particular example, the users , , are handling their devices according to the well-known game of rochambeau, or rock\/paper\/scissors, where each device is lowered quickly and raised slightly slower than it was lowered. The motion is conducted three times in a coordinated manner, typically while the users each say \u201cone, two, three,\u201d to help coordinate the motion and to ensure that both users make the final motion at the same time (so that one user cannot delay selecting their choice until after they see the choice of the other user). In such an example, the timing of the movements may be used to generate a key. Specifically, the time between each downward thrust of the devices ,  may be used to generate the key. If the motion of the users was sufficiently coordinated, each device may gather similar timing information and the two devices may thus use the timing information to generate a key, where the keys generated by the two devices may match each other if the key generation is made \u201cloose\u201d enough to accommodate a limited ability of two users to coordinate their motions perfectly.","Keys as generated in this manner may then be used in further steps for creating a communication between the devices , . In particular, to ensure that the users ,  truly intend to share information, they may be prompted for input to indicate such an intent. For example, an initial passing of information that is public or semi-public may be made between the devices, such as a photo of user  being passed to device . User  may then be prompted by device  for a confirmation, by pressing a control on a display of device , to indicate the user  would like to receive further information from user  that may be private or more private, and is willing to provide information to user  that is private or more private than was the initially transferred information.","Once both users have confirmed an intent to transfer the additional information, that additional information may be transferred between the devices , . The various data transfers between devices ,  may take a variety of formats and follow a variety of protocols, and the particular protocol is not essential here. For example, the transfer may occur using Bluetooth pairing, since many mobile devices include Bluetooth capability as a standard feature. (However, Bluetooth may not be the best mechanism, as it has security built in, can be relatively slow, and may require manual entry of a shared secret that may be equivalent in effort to typing in the contact information.) Other examples of ways in which data may be transferred between devices ,  are shown in the following figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["202","204","202","204","204","202"]},"Typically, the data to be transmitted in this manner is relatively small, such as contact information and the like. Thus, a very low bit rate transmission protocol may be used, so that higher levels of noise can be handled by the process. Various familiar techniques may be used to permit such data transfer across a gap expected to occur with such devices. Error checking in particular may be used to ensure that the data is not corrupted during transfer. The bit rate may, in certain instances, be variable, so that lower transfer rates are used in noisy environments and higher transfer rates are used in better situations.","Instructions may be shown on the devices , , such as by showing a graphic that looks similar to , so that the users know what to do to help created the acoustically coupled data transfer. Feedback may also be used, such as beeping of the devices ,  to indicate to the users that data transmission has been completed or that problems with data transmission have occurred. For example, a low buzzer sound or some other common sound that indicates failure (such as a Raspberry or Bronx Cheer sound) may indicate to the users that they need to hold their devices ,  closer together, or need to move to a quieter area. A \u201cbing\u201d sound (like a cooking timer) may indicate to the users that the transmission is complete. Generally, the feedback may be made audible, since the displays of the devices ,  will typically need to be held near each other, or may otherwise be out of the convenient view of the users. Visual feedback may also be provided, such as by a strength meter showing the relative current speed of the data transmission.","Also, before the data transfer begins, the devices ,  may indicate to their users an expected time to complete the transmission. Such an expected time may be computed using only the size of the data file to be transferred and an expected transfer rate. An initial attempt to communicate may also be made, so that an expected communication rate under prevailing conditions may be computed, and the estimated time to completion may also incorporate that information. In such a circumstance, the users of devices ,  may be given an opportunity to select the level of information to be transferred. For example, transfer of basic contact information may be indicated on a device display to take one estimated time, and the information with an additional image transmitted may be indicated by the devices to take another estimated time. Controls may be provided on the display, so that the user may select which level of information to share, so as to match the amount of time they have to wait for the data transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["212","214","212","216","214","214","216","212","214","212","216","218","216"]},"The particular times and locations for the codes may be coordinated between the devices. For example, a certain icon or icons may be shown near the code and may be used by an application running on device  to account for the size and position of the code (i.e., alignment elements). Likewise, an application running on device  may analyze consecutive frames in a video of display , perhaps after cutting away portions outside the code area, and may capture data each time an image changes (e.g., if the codes were changed every several seconds or portions of a second), and may then append the data to each other to generate the information that was intended to be sent by device .","Both of the transmission techniques shown in  generally are capable only between consenting users, and work only at short ranges. As a result, electronic snooping of the communications using these techniques may be much harder than it would be for wireless communication techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIGS. 2C-2E","b":["230","240","250","230","240","250"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},"In addition, the data sharing may also be made dynamic. In particular, as a user updates their contact and other similar information, it may be updated for users with which they have shared the information. For example, the sharing of information may include a pointer to a social networking site where various users may keep their personal information, such as in public, semi-private, and private sub-groups. An event manager in such a system may generate an event notification for all users shown to have access to the first user's information when the first user changes the information. Thus, for example, when a user logs onto such a system, their device may initially check for recent notifications and may download updated contact information from the first user if the device sees such a notification. As a result, a user's device may be as up to date as their most recent synchronization with the system. Of course, privacy may be protected in such a system by permitting a user to specify the level of access that any other user or group of user may have to their information.","In , the user is being shown an image  of Eric, and a control  where they are being asked if they would like to share their additional (e.g., private) information with Eric, and are being given an opportunity to register assent or dissent. By prior experience, the user may understand what information is to be shared with Eric if he or she assents. Such assent may result in the information being transferred to Eric's device\u2014or may await common assent from Eric.","In , the user was on a telephone call when they made indications that they would like to share information. As a result, indicators for the telephone call, which may have previously filled the whole of the display, have been shrunk to fill only an active application area  at the top of the display. The area  displays the name of the person at the other end of the call, an icon indicating that a call is currently occurring, and an elapsed time for the call in the icon.","A text box  provides instructions to the user, indicating that the user has received a request to share information with Eric, the gentleman who is pictured in the image. And a control  allows the user to indicate that they either do or do not wish to share private or semi-private information with the other user.","In , the user may select a number of options for sharing different levels of information with another user. A text box  serves as a title for the display, and indicates that the user is being asked whether, and to what extent, they want to share information with another user. Various other text boxes that are selectable controls -permit the user to select different levels of access that they wish to grant another user\u2014from sharing only a name and picture (), adding an e-mail address (), also adding business information such as business telephone and fax numbers (), adding personal information like a home address and\/or cellular telephone number (), or declining to share any information at all ().","The particular level of information shared may be, in the end, a lowest common denominator between the two sharing users. For example, if one user chooses to share only business information and the other chooses to share personal information also, the two may simply share business information (under an assumption that such information is the most that both participants feel comfortable sharing, and thus in an effort not to upset either participant). Alternatively, each user may select his or her own level of access. In such a situation, however, a user can prevent his or her own information from being shared and can prevent receipt of the other user's information by indicating no interest in sharing (e.g., box ). In this manner, the user can be kept in the feedback loop so as to prevent other users from spamming his or her contacts list.","Also, any information received in the manners discussed here may be segregated from other information in a user's system. For example, contact information that is obtained through such sharing may initially be tagged as being shared information, and thus not on a par with information from confirmed friends or associates in a user's contact list. As a result, such information may not show up in an ordinary view of the user's contact information, so as to avoid cluttering such information with contacts whom the user does not know well. A user may then \u201cpromote\u201d such contacts at a later time, such as by changing the label associated with their information. Such varying control over access may be generalized further, and may be managed by a system such as the OPENSOCIAL system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","302","302","304","302","304","306","302","308","302"]},"A number of components provided in device  may cooperate to provide such functionality. Display manager  is provided to supervise and coordinate information to be shown on the touchscreen display . The display manager , for example, may be provided with data relating to information to be displayed, and may coordinate data received from various different applications or modules. As one example, display manager  may receive data for overlapping windows on a windowed display and may determine which window is to be on top and where the lower window or windows is to be cut.","A touchscreen controller  may be responsible for receiving information regarding input provided by a user on touchscreen , and forwarding such information to various applications or modules. For example, the touch screen controller  may cooperate with the display manager  so as to understand what onscreen elements a user is selecting when they press on the touchscreen .","An accelerometer  may be provided for use in a variety of manners. For example, the accelerometer may be used to determine the state the machine is currently experiencing, so as to provide a proper display to the user. For example, if the accelerometer  indicates that the device  has not been moved for a substantial period of time, the device may be put into a sleep mode.","An accelerometer controller  receives input from the accelerometer  such as voltages or other signals from the accelerometer . The accelerometer controller  may be used to condition or interpret signals received from the accelerometer  or otherwise prepare such signals for use by other components in the device .","An activity manager  is responsible for managing actions on the device  such as input from a user, messages received through a network, and internal alerts generated by the device . For example, activity manager  may be alerted of activity by the accelerometer  by way of the accelerometer controller . The activity manager  may determine which applications  running on the device  are to be notified about such an activity.","In one example, a list of activities available in a particular operating system running on device  may be made available, and various applications  may register themselves with the operating system, and indicate which activities they would like to be notified about by the activity manager . In this manner, when an activity occurs, the activity manager  may readily determine which applications  or other components should be notified.","A notification manager  may communicate with activity manager  when certain events occur on device . In one example, the notification manager  may recognize the receipt, at mobile device , of a message from a wireless interface . The wireless interface  may take a variety of forms, for example, including the various forms of cellular telephone digital interfaces for transmitting data and or voice. The notification manager  may also receive other notifications and may communicate them appropriately to other modules in the device .","A communication coordination module  is responsible for coordinating sharing of information between users who are proximate to each other. The communication coordination module  may generally operate according to the mechanisms described more fully above and below, including by using a key exchange after a user of device  has subjected the device to coordinated motion with respect to another nearby device.","The communication coordination module  may, for example, use encryption module  to create a key relating to information received from accelerometer controller . The encryption module  may, for example, follow a predetermined algorithm for generating a key that relates in some predetermined manner to the intensity, duration, or other parameter of an acceleration faced by accelerometer .","One or more encryption keys may be stored in key database . For example, when encryption module  generates a key after device  has undergone an acceleration, that key may be stored in keys database . The key may be accessed later, after a nearby device has sent encrypted information to device .","In addition, communication coordination module  may access information in a user data database . The user data may include, for example, contact information for a user of device , files stored on the device , or any other type of appropriate information.","Communication coordination module  may also communicate with applications . For example, where communication coordination module  obtains contact information, it may pass such information to a contacts application running on device . In a like manner, the communication coordination module may obtain information from a contacts application for passing to another device.","In addition, communication coordination module  may communicate with a short range interface . The interface  may receive data communicated from a nearby mobile device and may also communicate data from device  to the nearby communication device. For example, the information communicated may include data representing contact information of users of the two devices.","In operation, in one example, a user of device  may initially shake the device  in some manner that is coordinated with the motion of the other device. The accelerometer  may sense such motion and may provide a signal to accelerometer controller . If the motion is sufficient in intensity or in character, the accelerometer controller  may in turn pass information to an activity manager . The activity manager  may be programmed to recognize acceleration data of a particular type, such as sharp changes in acceleration caused by contact of the device  with another object. The activity manager  may likewise filter out activity that is indicative of a false positive, such as acceleration created when the device  is placed in a user's pocket and the user walks across a room.","If the activity manager  determines that relevant information is being provided by accelerometer , it may provide such information to all components of device  that have registered themselves with that particular activity. Thus, for example, the activity manager  may pass data from the accelerometer  to the communication coordination module . Upon receiving such information, the communication coordination module  may further filter the data to determine whether it is relevant for short-term communication by the device . For example, the communication coordination module  may determine, where the device  is programmed for short range communication only after contact between two devices or a rock\/paper\/scissors routine, whether the accelerometer data indicates such contact or routine. If the data does not indicate such contact or routine, the communication coordination module  may ignore it and wait for additional activities reported by the activity manager .","If the information does indicate relevant activity, the communication coordination module  may provide such information to the encryption module  which may be programmed to generate a key from the data. In one example, the key is a function of an approximate maximum acceleration of the device, and a time at which such maximum acceleration occurred. The maximum acceleration may be rounded off so as to provide a more general key that is more likely to match with a key generated in a similar manner by another device. Also, the time may be blended into the determination because the time of contact is generally the time at which the acceleration of both devices will be equal","The communication coordination module  may also refer to a contacts application  to obtain limited contact information about the user of device . For example, the communication coordination module  may request information that is labeled within the system as being public information, such as a first name of the user and perhaps a photo of the user. The communication coordination module  may then supply such information to the short range interface , after passing it through the encryption module  where it is encrypted using the generated key. Other devices in the vicinity of device , may then receive the encrypted communication. The device  may also be set to monitor for communications by other devices using short range interface . In this manner, the communication sent out by device  may be received readily by other similar devices, and device  may readily receive communications from the device with which it had recent court mated motion.","Upon waiting for several moments, the device , by way of short range interface , may receive an encrypted communication from another device. The short range interface  may provide data from the communication to the communication coordination module , which may apply the generated key to the encryption module  for decrypting the data. Such data may include a name of the other user and an image of the user, among other things.","The communication coordination module  may then cooperate with the display manager  to generate a dialog box or dialog boxes for interaction with the user. For example, the boxes may ask the user whether they would like to pass additional information to the other user. If the user agrees to passing such information, the communication coordination module  may request such information from an application module , may use the generated key and the encryption module  to encrypt the information, and may transmit the information by the short range interface , to the other device. In a similar manner, the device  may receive corresponding information from the other device and may use the encryption module  and the generated key to decode that received information. The decoded information may then be saved in the user data database , for example.","In this manner, a rather simple technique for passing data in a secure manner may be provided between two devices, particularly where the devices are in close proximity to each other. In the example, the user of device  did not need to enter any information about another user to share their own information in a secure way, but rather merely had to confirm by a dialog box that they wished to share information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","400"]},"At box , motion of the first device is sensed. An encoded motion identifier may then be transmitted, at box , to another, second device. The motion identifier may take a number of forms, and may include a welcoming message or other information from the user of the device. The motion identifier may also take a form that depended on the timing, size, or other aspect of sensed motion. At box , an encoded motion identifier from the other device is received. The reception may occur, for example, by the device turning on a short range transceiver, and leaving it on after its own data has been transmitted.","At box , the received identifier is matched to the transmitted identifier. For example, the identifiers may be numbers that approximate the amplitude and\/or duration of a physical contact between the devices, or of other coordinated motion between the devices. At box , a determination is made regarding whether the motion identifiers match or not. If the identifiers do not match, then a refusal to transmit additional information is sent to the other device at box . If the identifiers do match, then additional information is transmitted to the other device at box . For example, where the numbers match and thus indicate that coordinated motion occurred between two devices, additional private information may be transmitted to the other device.","In this manner, information may be transmitted between two devices in a relatively coordinated manner without much effort from the users of the devices. The particular matched information between the devices may or may not take the form of an encryption key or other mechanism for providing secrecy for the communication between the devices. For example, the communication between the devices may be relatively open to other users in the vicinity of the devices. In contrast, and alternatively, the communication may be encrypted or otherwise protected including by the mechanisms discussed above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 3"],"b":["420","420","302"]},"The process  begins when a notification of an acceleration event has been received (box ). Such a notification may come from a notification manager operated by an operating system on a mobile device, or from other appropriate mechanisms. At box , a timestamp is provided for the event. The timestamp may be provided, for example, by an internal clock operating on a mobile device. The clock may be coordinated and reset periodically for accuracy by a central data network in a familiar manner.","At box  a key is generated from the acceleration data and the timestamp. Such generation of a key may occur in a number of different ways, such as by hashing or otherwise processing one or more acceleration data values, and time values. A particular mechanism by which such a key is generated is not critical here.","At box , user information is transmitted. Such user information may be transmitted in an encrypted manner using the generated key. In this manner, only devices that have access to the key may decode the data that is provided by the device. At box , user information from another device is received at the first device. Presumably, such information has been encrypted using a key that was generated in the same manner as was the key for the first device, and using substantially the same data as the generation of the key at box . As a result, at box , the key generated by the first mobile device may be applied to the encrypted data received from the second mobile device so as to decode that data. With the data decoded, it may then be displayed and saved in the form of user information, at box , such as contact data of a person who owns the other mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIGS. 2A to 2E"],"b":["440","442","444","446","448"]},"The received preliminary user information may be displayed to the user of the first device (after it is decoded, of necessary), and the user may be prompted whether to confirm that they would like to share more detailed personal information with the other user.
