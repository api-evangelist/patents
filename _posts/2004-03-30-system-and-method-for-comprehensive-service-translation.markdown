title: System and method for comprehensive service translation
abstract: A service translation proxy provides a variety of translation services during the service discovery and subsequent service consumption phase. The service translation proxy receives a service request in accordance with one particular Service Description Protocol (SDP) and optionally translates the service request into the correct SDP as required using the appropriate service discovery interface. In addition, session description, session media, and session transport translations are implemented by the service translation proxy as required to support the service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to service discovery\/consumption, and more particularly, to translation activities used during the service discovery\/consumption.","The mobile industry has experienced a period of exceptional growth during the last several years. As the next generation of mobile network growth evolves, a multitude of services will be offered, discovered, and consumed whereby rich content as well as voice, will be transported throughout a combination of mobile and internet environments, using an integrated IP network layer.","An All-IP network enables seamless network integration of different access options, e.g., broadband, mobile Internet, fixed Internet, and existing mobile systems, into a single IP layer. As such, all communication services may be carried over a single network infrastructure, thus enabling the integration of voice, data, and multimedia services. Carriers on the All-IP networks will glean a number of important benefits as well, including cost savings, scalability, flexibility, efficient network operations, and new revenue opportunities.","The number of services that will become available as a result of this seamless network integration is expected to grow enormously. Besides the classical services, such as those offered by printers, scanners, and fax machines, other network services such as information access, music on demand, and computational infrastructure services deployed within the network will be offered.","Following this trend, it becomes increasingly important to give users the possibility of finding and making use of the services that are available in the network. Ideally, users would like to obtain access to services automatically, without requiring their system to be reconfigured. With the widespread deployment of network enabled mobile devices, such as: notebooks; Personal Data Assistants (PDAs); and enhanced cellular phones, dynamic discovery of services in a visited foreign network, for example, along with automatic system configuration and content translation, will be useful features.","Service Discovery Protocols (SDP) aim to reshape the way software and network resources are configured, deployed, and advertised. The focus is not only to provide a plug and play solution, but to provide an environment in which a device can automatically discover services, including their properties, in a dynamic fashion. Among the emerging SDPs are: Service Location Protocol (SLP), Salutation, Bluetooth, Jini, and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Some of the goals for most of the SDPs are to: browse for services having certain attributes; choose the service based upon its attributes; and utilize the service.","Even though each SDP essentially has the same goal, all SDPs inherently have different origins, underlying technologies, flavors, and audiences. In other words, since the developers of these SDPs see the service discovery problem at different angles, the resulting solutions are often substantially divergent from one another. Accordingly, the browsing terminal must either: converse with only those Service Discovery Engines (SDE) that employ the browsing terminal's particular SDP; or conversely, bridge across all SDPs, such that proper service queries may take place regardless of the SDP currently executed by the SDE.","Once the services have been discovered, other compatibility issues arise once the service is ready for consumption. For example, two users having differing device capability may want to set up a video session, whereby the consuming user requires, for example, H.263 video format, while the service provider only offers, for example, the Motion Pictures Experts Group MPEG-2 video format. Without a video transcoder placed between the two users, the video session will not be possible, since a common Coder\/Decoder (codec) will not be identified for use between the two users.","Other compatibility issues transparent to the consumer\/service provider pair also exist in relation to the transport layer used to transport messages between the service consumer\/provider applications. Currently, this layer may include the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), as well as the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) used for audio and video streaming services. Thus, as the number of services, content, and transport mechanisms integrated within the All-IP network increases, a universal translation mechanism used to facilitate such integration becomes increasingly advantageous.","Accordingly, there is a need in the communications industry for a system and method that facilitates such a comprehensive translation mechanism. The comprehensive translation mechanism should have the capability to provide a uniform and integrated service discovery experience for the user, while simultaneously allowing seamless content and transport translation as well.","To overcome limitations in the prior art, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a system and method for providing a comprehensive translation mechanism used in support of service discovery protocol translation, media session translation, and translation of transport mechanisms used to provide such services and media sessions.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method for providing comprehensive service translation comprises determining the protocol of a service discovery request received from a client, translating the protocol of the service discovery request into a service discovery protocol used by a service registry. The translated service discovery request is used to discover a service provider of the service requested. The method further comprises detecting incompatibilities between the client and the service provider and translating the service provided to the client by the service provider in response to the detected incompatibilities.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a service translation system comprises a service requestor coupled to the service translation system and adapted to submit a service request using a first protocol, a service translation proxy coupled to the service requestor and adapted to translate the first protocol of the service request into a second protocol, and a service provider coupled to the service translation system and adapted to provide the service requested, wherein the service translation proxy is further adapted to translate the service provided into a format that is compatible with the service requestor.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a service translation proxy comprises means for receiving a service request from a service requestor, means for translating the service request from a first protocol to a second protocol, means for locating a service provider to provide the service requested, and means for translating the service provided into a format that is compatible with capability information associated with the service requestor.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon which are executable by a service translation proxy for facilitating network service translations. The instructions performing steps comprising receiving a service request from a service requester, translating the service request from a first protocol to a second protocol, locating a service provider to provide the service requested, and translating the service provided into a format that is compatible with capability information associated with the service requestor.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a home network comprises a plurality of home devices adapted to exchange media content in a first format, at least one mobile device adapted to exchange media content in a second format, and a service translation proxy coupled to the plurality of home devices and the at least one mobile device. The service translation proxy is adapted to translate the media exchanged between the plurality of home devices and the at least one mobile device in response to their respective capabilities.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of exchanging media between a mobile device and a home device comprises establishing the mobile device and the home device as entities of a wireless home network, evaluating differences in media capabilities between the mobile device and the home device, and translating media exchanged between the mobile device and the home device in response to the media capability differences between the mobile device and the home device.","These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with greater particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of a system and method in accordance with the invention.","In the following description of the exemplary embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, as structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Generally, the present invention is directed to a system and method that provides a comprehensive framework that may be utilized by any network entity, mobile or otherwise, to implement uniform and integrated service translation. In particular, a service translation proxy is provided, such that the vocabularies and behavior of the various SDPs communicating with the service translation proxy may be translated into uniform and user friendly presentations for both the service requestor and the service provider. Accordingly, the service translation proxy allows the integration of multiple service discovery protocols to be deployed within the network, such that the particular SDP being used, for example, by the service requestor is transparent to the particular SDP being used, for example, by the service provider. The service translation proxy additionally provides the capability to: gather multiple replies from multiple SDP requests; compile the results into a uniform format; and transmit the uniform results to a service requesting entity.","Furthermore, the service translation proxy provides a framework for media adaptation, whereby the service translation proxy determines the need for adaptation based upon capabilities of the end terminals. The capabilities may be expressed by a session description within a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) exchange, a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, a profile or presence server acting on behalf of the end terminals, or by any other means related to video\/audio\/messaging session capabilities and preferred communication status of the end terminals. Thus, there are no changes required in the end terminals to facilitate the service consumption session. Rather, translations throughout the service discovery\/consumption process are performed transparently to the end terminals by the service translation proxy.","An exemplary system level diagram of communication system , in which the principles of the present invention may be implemented, is shown in . All-IP core  provides the common, IP based signaling core utilized by communication system  to integrate various fixed, mobile, and Internet networks. All-IP core  allows all communication services to be carried over a single network infrastructure, thus enabling the integration of voice, data, and multimedia services. Further, All-IP core  allows network resources to be used more efficiently, where increased capacity may be deployed as necessary to meet demand.","Communication system  is optimized to support multimedia services, where Call Session Control Function (CSCF)  implementing SIP is a key ingredient in providing the multimedia services to all IP enabled devices. Although SIP's primary objective was meant for multimedia sessions, its scope may be extended to presence, gaming, Instant Messaging (IM), and service discovery\/utilization, as well. Communication system  also supports eXtensible Markup Language (XML) based protocols for exchanging information between computers, such as SOAP. Other frameworks such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), and Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI), provide similar functionality to SOAP, and may also be supported by communication system  in accordance with the present invention.","The wireless terminal  may represent any of a number of mobile communication devices, such as cellular telephone , personal digital assistant (PDA) , notebook or laptop computer , or any other type of wireless terminal represented by device . 3rd Generation (3G) Radio Access Network (RAN)  represents a combination of all mobile radio standards, such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)\/Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA). Each mobile radio standard has its own distinct network architectures and transport mechanisms that are fully integrated using the IP protocol, where Serving General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN)  and Gateway GPRS Support Node  provides the RAN interface to All-IP core .","Communication system  supports Legacy Cellular systems  that offer communication support to legacy terminal , for example. Signaling gateway  performs all necessary Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) and Mobile Application Part (MAP) signaling conversions as necessary to provide SS7 over IP access from PSTN  and MAP over IP access from Legacy Cellular system  to All-IP core . In addition, signaling gateway  provides Short Message Service Center (SMSC) support and Multimedia Message Service Center (MMSC) support for any SMS and MMS operations as required by mobile terminal  and .","Internet  access from All-IP core  is provided through internet gateway  to allow access defined by Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) address definitions. Home Subscriber Server (HSS)  provides All-IP core  with the many database functions that are required in All-IP networks, such as Home Location Register (HLR) and a Domain Name Server (DNS) functionalities.","Service providers  provide consumer applications and services that are not easily provided within the circuit switched or packet core networks by themselves. Service groups having major relevance in 3G All-IP networks include information and entertainment content providers, communication, productivity enhancing services and business solutions. Accordingly, services that are timely, personalized, simple to complete, and location specific are provided to all consumers of communication system .","In the service discovery\/consumption domain depicted in communication system , mobile terminals  and  require fast and precise results that utilize simple search logic. Some of the most important aspects associated with the mobile service discovery scenario are: implementation of an efficient search infrastructure concentrating on the content relative to the user of the mobile terminal; a simple user interface having ready made search templates for keyword searches; and a context based infrastructure. The context based infrastructure should take into account: the user's profile, and preferences, which may include previous search attempts and favorite services; mobility and the user's location; the mobile terminal device capability and profile that the user is presumably using; and the time of the search. As discussed in more detail below, service translation proxy  facilitates these and other context based infrastructure components.","The process whereby a network entity first searches, then discovers, then consumes the required service dynamically is called service discovery\/consumption. A service is a function of many attributes, such as type and value of content, time, location, consumer identification, and consumer categorization. These attributes along with the context of the searching device make the search criteria a complex issue to handle. Moreover, the mobility aspect of the requesting entity and the requested service makes service discovery even more challenging.","Generally speaking, there are three entities involved during the process of service discovery. First, a client entity, e.g., mobile terminal , tries to find or discover a service that it needs. The client entity may be a land based consumer, a mobile device, or specific software executing within the land\/mobile devices. Second, a service entity, e.g., service providers , which is being discovered by the client entity, whereby the service entity is capable of fulfilling the client's service needs. Third, a registry entity, or directory, e.g. service registry\/directory , which maintains a list of available services and their associated attributes that are provided by, for example, service providers .","Service discovery may span many different network components or domains in any given end to end scenario, depending on which device is searching\/discovering and which content type is being discovered. In a first service discovery scenario, for example, service registry\/directory  maintains a list of network resources which the client entity, e.g., mobile terminal , can discover. Basic network resources that are discoverable by the client entity may include, for example, Domain Name Servers (DNS) or Voice over IP (VoIP) gateways. Once the network resources are discovered, the services offered by the network resources, e.g., service providers , may include Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) applications hosted by a content provider, mobile commerce services hosted by a service portal, and\/or customer services hosted by a department store, to name only a few.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","202","214","204","206","214","202","206","214","206","202"]},"Generally speaking, SDPT  offers a number of SDP translation services to any requesting client  as illustrated in SDP translation diagram  of . Canonical Query Transform (CQT)  interacts with client  to allow generic SD queries generated by client  to be translated and subsequently issued via specific SD protocol interfaces - as discussed in more detail below. Other SD interfaces  may be added to the functionality of SDPT , by simply installing the correct \u201cplug-in\u201d as necessary to implement the required SDP translation. Accordingly, as other SDPs become available in the future, their required support functions may easily be added to SDPT . In addition, CQT  has the ability to communicate with other SDEs\/SDPTs that may exist within All-IP core  of  via other SDE interface , such that services visible to the other SDEs\/SDPTs may also be discovered by client .","In one embodiment according to the present invention, SDPT  performs Service Location Protocol (SLP) translation services. SLP is currently being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a vendor independent standard for decentralized, lightweight, and extensible service discovery. SLP uses service Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which define the service type and address for a particular service.","In SLP operation, a Service Agent (SA) (not shown) broadcasts advertisements on behalf of a service via a service registration message (SrvMsg). The SrvMsg contains the URL for the advertised service and a set of descriptive attributes for the service. As a centralized service information repository, registry  caches the service registration messages from the SLP SAs and acknowledges the SrvMsg with a service acknowledgment message (SrvAck). SLP SD interface , on behalf of client , is then able to send a service request message (SrvRqst) to registry  via user agent  to request the service's location. Registry  may then respond with a service reply message that includes the URLs of all services matched against the request. The service reply message is then converted by CQT  to the particular SDP being used by client . Once the service reply message is converted and relayed to client , client  is then free to access\/consume the services\/content provided by content provider  via, for example, Service Consumption (SC) agent  of . Any transport protocol translation and\/or content translation may be achieved via transport translation  and content translation , respectively, as discussed in more detail below.","In another embodiment according to the present invention, SDPT  may instead take on functionality that is consistent with Jini technology, which is an extension of the Java programming language, via Jini SD interface . Each Jini device (not shown) is assumed to have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running on it. The Jini architecture principle is similar to SLP in that devices and applications register with a Jini network using a process called Discovery and Join.","To join a Jini network, a device or application places itself into the lookup table on a lookup server, e.g., registry , which is a database for all services on the network. Besides pointers to services, the lookup table can also store Java based program code for these services, which enables the services to upload device drivers and other programs to enable client  to access the service. When client  wants to use the service, the object code is downloaded from the lookup table to the JVM, e.g., SC agent , executing within client . Whereas a service request in SLP returns a service URL, the Jini object code offers direct access to the service using an interface known to, for example, SC agent  of client . Thus, the code mobility offered by Jini replaces the necessity of pre-installing drivers on client .","In yet another embodiment according to the present invention, SDPT  may interact in accordance with the Salutation architecture via Salutation SD interface  that is being developed by an open industry consortium known as the Salutation Consortium. In Salutation, Salutation Managers (SLMs) behave as service brokers, whereby services register their capabilities with the SLM, e.g., registry . Client  may then query the SLM using a generic SDP, whereby SDPT  then translates the request to the Salutation protocol before submitting the request to SLM . Any responses to the Salutation requests are then translated by SDPT  as required by client .","According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a UPnP approach may be taken, whereby SDPT  operates according to the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). SSDP uses HTTP over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and is thus designed for usage in IP networks, where peer to peer mechanisms are enabled for auto configuration of devices, service discovery, and control of services.","According to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, SDPT  may operate in accordance with the Bluetooth SDP standard. Bluetooth is a low-power, short range, wireless radio system that operates in the 2.4 Gigahertz (GHz) Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band to maximize international acceptance and employs a frequency hopping system to minimize interference. At the bottom of the Bluetooth stack, the radio and base band layers provide the short range, frequency hopping radio platform. The Link Manager Protocol (LMP) handles data link setup and provides authentication and encryption services. The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) supports multiplexed connectionless and connection oriented communication over the LMP layer. Groups of up to eight Bluetooth devices can form ad hoc networks called piconets to communicate, share services, and synchronize data. In each piconet, a master device coordinates other Bluetooth devices, which can be participating in other piconet sessions.","The Bluetooth SDP provides a simple Application Programming Interface (API) for enumerating devices, e.g., mobile terminals , that are in range of service translation proxy . Thus, mobile terminals  may browse for any services advertised in UDDI registry  via their respective Bluetooth SDP stacks. Client applications, e.g., SD agent  of mobile terminal , use the API to search for available services either by service classes, which uniquely identify types of devices, or their corresponding attributes. The Bluetooth SDP does not provide a mechanism for using discovered services, therefore, specific actions required to use the specific services offered by a Bluetooth device must be provided by a higher level protocol, e.g., as provided within SC agent .","As mentioned previously, service translation proxy  also provides a framework for content translation, whereby service translation proxy  determines the need for translation based upon, for example, the capabilities of the end terminals. The capabilities may be expressed by session descriptions within an SIP exchange, a SOAP message, or by any other means related to video\/audio\/messaging session capabilities required during the consumption of any given service. Thus, in the event that the capabilities of the service requester and the service provider are not compatible, not only must the content exchanged between the end terminals be translated by service translation proxy , but so must the session descriptions of the respective end terminals.","In order to discuss an exemplary aspect of the operation of service translation proxy , therefore, media session  of  will now be discussed in relation to the operation of transport translation and content translation modules  and  of service translation proxy . It should be noted, that media session  takes place after a service discovery session has successfully completed. In particular, for example, mobile terminal  has located a video streaming service offered by service provider  that is of interest. However, service provider  offers a video format that is not compatible with mobile terminal , which necessitates content\/transport translation utilities in accordance with the present invention. Thus, while service translation proxy  detects the video format incompatibility between mobile terminal  and service provider , it nevertheless allows the media session to commence. This is possible because service translation proxy  incorporates the translation modules that are required to translate the video stream of the media session into corresponding video formats as required by mobile terminal  and service provider , respectively, while also providing the translation modules required to translate the associated session description parameters exchanged between mobile terminal  and service provider .","Media session diagram  illustrates an exemplary SIP session description flow that illustrates the session description\/content translations that are implemented by service translation proxy  in accordance with the present invention. A portion of the session description for mobile terminal  is illustrated by the session description, e.g., SD1, contained within message  in which the connection data, i.e., c=<network type> <address type> <connection address>, and the media description, i.e., m=<media> <port> <transport> <fmt list>, are listed. It should be noted that the SD1 description contained within message  comprises only a portion of the actual session description used and is presented in its abbreviated form for illustration purposes only.","The connection data, C=IN IP4 0.0.0.1, indicates that: the Internet network type is specified, for example, by the characters, \u201cIN\u201d; IP version 4 is the address type specified by the characters \u201cIP4\u201d; and an IP address of \u201c0.0.0.1\u201d is listed as the connection address for user agent A, e.g., mobile terminal . The media description M=video 49232 RTP\/AVP XX, indicates that: video media is to be used as specified by the characters \u201cvideo\u201d; a port number of \u201c49232\u201d is specified as the port number corresponding to user agent A; the Real-time Transport Protocol using the Audio\/Video Profile (RTP\/AVP) is to be utilized; and a format number specified by the characters \u201cXX\u201d indicating that the video format supported by mobile terminal  is, for example, H.263.","Serving-Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) #1  checks the media capabilities described by SD1 of message  and since the network policy enforced by S-CSCF #1  allows video stream media sessions, SD1 is forwarded onto S-CSCF #2  via message . Message  contains the SD1 description received in message , but also contains the previously registered session description, e.g., SDR2, corresponding to service provider . S-CSCF #2 , for example, has prior knowledge of the media capabilities of service provider  as obtained through the use of a registry (not shown) that advertises the services offered by service provider . The previously registered SDR2 information provides default information about service provider  such as its IP address, e.g., 0.0.0.2, its default port number, e.g., 0000, and its video capability, e.g., YY, which may correspond to an MPEG-2 video format, for example.","Service translation proxy  performs a session description comparison, whereby service translation proxy  compares session descriptions SD1 and SDR2, determines the required translations to be performed, and reserves the necessary resources to implement the required translations. In particular, SDT1 of message  defines in part the resources reserved by service translation proxy  as a result of the comparison of session descriptions SD1 and SDR2 and the determination that the video media exchanged by user agent A  and service provider  requires translation.","SDT1, for example, defines that port number 49262 at IP address 0.0.0.3 is to be used by service provider  when sending video media to user agent A  instead of port number 49232 at IP address 0.0.0.1 as originally defined by SD1. This port number and IP address change is required since all video media received by user agent A  must be translated by service translation proxy  subsequent to transmission by service provider . In addition, the video format originally disclosed by user agent A  in SD1 is changed from XX to YY so that service provider  assumes that video compatibility exists with user agent A . The modified session definition, e.g., SDT1, is then transmitted to service provider  in message .","In response, service provider  transmits its session description, e.g., SD2, via message . The SD2 description defines, for example, that service provider  is assigned port number 49292 at IP address 0.0.0.2, whereby video capability YY is required. Video capability YY may represent, for example, an MPEG-2 video format capability that is supported by service provider . S-CSCF #2  then transmits session description SD2 to service translation proxy  via message , in order for service translation proxy  to determine the need for modification of SD2 as defined in message .","Since video media transmitted by service provider  must first be translated by service translation proxy , SD2 is modified by service translation proxy  to reflect the port number, e.g., 49264, and IP address, e.g., 0.0.0.3, of service translation proxy  that is to be used by user agent A  when receiving video media. Thus, session definition SD2 is changed by service translation proxy  to session definition SDT2 and forwarded to S-CSCF #2  via message . SDT2 is then forwarded onto user agent A  via message .","The end result of the session definition modifications exemplified by  is that the media session previously requested by mobile terminal  during service discovery includes the translation services offered by service translation proxy . In particular, video media transmitted by service provider  to user agent A  must first traverse port number 49262 at IP address 0.0.0.3 of service translation proxy  in order for the YY->XX video translation to take place. User agent A  then receives the YY->XX adapted video at port  from IP address 0.0.0.3 corresponding to service translation proxy . In addition to session definition translations, service translation proxy  also performs any required media translations in accordance with the present invention as discussed in more detail below.","In addition to providing SDP and media translations, service translation proxy  may also open transport sessions using different transport protocols to support the media session. When delivering audio and video for playback, for example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) may be appropriate if sufficiently long buffering and adequate average throughput is used. Thus, referring back to  for example, the transport session opened between service translation proxy  and service provider  may use RTP, while the transport session opened between service translation proxy  and mobile terminal  may use TCP.","In an alternate embodiment, the present invention is useful in ad hoc networks, such as home networks, that conform for example, to the Digital Home Working Group (DHWG). The DHWG has mandated the use of media formats, such as Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) and MPEG-2, however, many categories of mobile devices are unable to support such media formats. LPCM is a format that is a popular choice in music production because it is an audio production technique that, without compressing the sound data, simultaneously samples and captures analog signals and transforms them into digital signals. The uncompressed digital audio results in the same format used for music Compact Disks (CDs), i.e., 16 bit sampling at 44.1 kilohertz (kHz).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["450","452","456","468","472","454","450","470","480","452","456"]},"Prior to establishing media exchange  between mobile device  and home device , service discovery must be performed in order to identify potential Bluetooth enabled devices\/services that are represented by service translation proxy . SDP  performs this task by performing discovery of devices and services within home network . If home device  provides locally generated image data streams using MPEG-2 format, for example, then that service is made visible to mobile device  through service translation proxy , even though mobile device  may only support H.263 format. Service translation proxy  makes the MPEG-2 video services offered by home device  visible to mobile device , since service translation proxy  may have the capability to translate between the MPEG-2 and H.263 video formats as discussed in more detail below.","In order for the service offered by home device  to be advertised by service translation proxy , it must first be represented by a service record and kept within SDP database . A service record is created through SDP database  by managing a collection of service handles and their associated attributes that make up the service record. Within each service record exists a service class and associated profile that are used to help generalize the types of services provided by home device . In general, therefore, the service record contains a collection of attributes that are used by service translation proxy  to identify attributes and their values within the SDP database .","If the services offered by home device  are not compatible with mobile device , then service translation proxy  must first determine the capabilities of mobile device . Once known, service translation proxy  may then determine whether translation facilities are available within service translation proxy  to translate the media format offered by home device  to the media format that is compatible with mobile device . If translation facilities do exist, then the service record is modified by service translation proxy  to match the capabilities of mobile device .","In operation, mobile device  may be an image enabled device having content capture\/receipt capability  that is capable of exchanging media with home device . Content capture\/receipt  may provide both audio and video data, whereby video images may be presented in both still and video mode. In still mode, only a single image is transferred via path  to First-In First-Out (FIFO) buffer , where acknowledgement of the content receipt is generated via path . In video mode, multiple images arranged in back to back frame sequence are transferred to FIFO buffer . FIFO buffer  buffers the content blocks, while content delivery\/receipt  prepares for their subsequent transfer to home device  via path  through service translation proxy . Service translation proxy  first translates the media format transmitted by mobile device  into media format that is compatible with home device  and then subsequently delivers the translated media to content receipt\/delivery .","Buffer and synchronization block  is used to provide the proper frame alignment and playback speed as required by presentation . Presentation  represents any Application Programming Interface (API) that is executing on home device  including audio\/video processing software in support of audio\/video archiving, audio\/video playback, etc. Additionally, audio and video media streams may be received from FIFO buffer  by content capture\/receipt  for subsequent display by mobile terminal . In such an instance, the audio\/video streams are received from content receipt\/delivery  of home device  via path , whereby service translation proxy  first translates the media from the format transmitted by home device  into the media format that is compatible with mobile device  and then transmits the translated content to content delivery\/receipt .","It should be noted that service translation proxies , , and  are each capable of automatic initialization in accordance with the particular network environment in which they are operating. For example, service translation proxy \/ may automatically: query all content providers  that are advertised within ; identify which SDP, transport, and\/or content translations that it is able to perform; and advertise to SD agent  those services that through conversion are compatible with mobile terminal .","Conversely, service translation proxy  may automatically keep track of all home devices  that are operating within home network . Home network  may not only include Bluetooth enabled devices, but may also include other proximity devices that are compatible with, for example, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Infrared (IR), etc. In addition, each attribute associated with each home device is automatically stored and a translation matrix generated, such that itemization of each home device and its associated translation utility may be paired as necessary to conform to the capabilities of mobile device  during the service discovery and consumption phase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","506","502","514","502","514","502","514"]},"In particular, service provider  may, for example, be equipped with a high quality, low data rate video capability such as an MPEG-2 video encoder, while mobile terminal  may only be equipped with high bit rate video encoding capability, such as defined by the H.263 specification. Accordingly, service translation proxy  is required to perform full duplex, video translation of the MPEG-2\/H.263 video stream, as illustrated by transcoding path , that is provided by service provider  to mobile terminal .","The video stream received by service translation proxy  is first decoded into decompressed video frames , processed, and then converted to form video sequence . The video sequences are then re-encoded into a higher or equal rate H.263 bit stream and subsequently forwarded onto mobile terminal  as illustrated by processing path . Due to processing path  as provided by service translation proxy , mobile terminal  and service provider  may conduct media sessions irrespective of their own media capabilities.","In addition, mobile terminal  and service provider  are provided the opportunity to obtain the highest quality media transfer based upon their respective media capabilities. For example, if session description  of  indicated that mobile terminal  was capable of the following video formats: \u201cXX\u201d, \u201cYY\u201d, and \u201cZZ\u201d, where \u201cXX\u201d represents the highest quality format; and session description  indicated that service provider  was capable of the following video formats: \u201cYY\u201d and \u201cZZ\u201d, then service translation proxy  automatically selects the common video format having the highest quality, i.e., \u201cYY.\u201d In such an instance, service translation proxy  eliminates the possibility of using the lowest quality video format, i.e., \u201cZZ\u201d, during the media session, but instead forces the video format to the highest quality format that is in common between mobile terminal  and service provider .","A flow diagram of exemplary service discovery\/translation scenario  is illustrated in  in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In step , service discovery requests are received by service translation proxy  of  from SD agent  of a requesting client, e.g., mobile terminal . The SDP used by the requesting client is determined in step  and translated as in step , if translation is deemed to be required as determined in step . Any of SDP interfaces - may then be used in accordance with step  to submit the service request to the appropriate registry via user agent . Alternately, the service request may be submitted to another SDE\/SDPT via other SDE interface  as required.","If a service matching the request is determined to be available as in step , then the required session parameters to support the service are determined in step . Any number of session parameters may be contemplated for a given service, where session parameters affecting the service requestor and the service provider may include: audio Coder\/Decoder (codec), video codec, speech coding algorithm, display size\/resolution, etc. If the session parameters required to create the session between the service provider and the service requestor are incompatible as determined in step , then any necessary translation facilities are reserved within service translation proxy  as in step  and the session parameters updated accordingly. Translations of the actual service content are then effected using the reserved translation modules to allow the session to commence as in step . Alternately, if no translation services are required, then translation modules are not reserved and the service is commenced between the parties as normal without intervention from service translation proxy . As discussed above, the session description parameters associated with the capabilities of the service requestor and service provider are not necessarily used. Rather, their capabilities may be exchanged via a SIP OPTIONS request, SOAP messaging, via presence subscription, etc.","It should be noted that the functions described herein that are associated with service translation proxy \/\/ may be implemented within a single proxy, or may alternately may be distributed throughout the network and routed as necessary to effect the same result if, for example, IP multicast is used. IP Multicast may be more efficient than a normal Internet transmission because the IP server can broadcast the session parameters to many recipients simultaneously. Unlike traditional Internet traffic that requires separate connections for each source-destination pair, IP Multicasting allows many recipients to share the same information. This means that just one set of packets is transmitted for all the destinations, such that all service translation proxies within the network may obtain the same session descriptions. Thus, the translation of service requests and replies may be effected by a first service translation proxy, while a second service translation proxy effects any media translations that may be required, since both service translation proxies have been updated with the appropriate session parameters via IP multicast.","Using the description provided herein, the invention may be implemented as a machine, process, or article of manufacture by using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce programming software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof.
