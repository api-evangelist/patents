Electronic serial number can be used as a mobile terminal identifier.","\u2018Electronic serial number (abbreviated as \u2018ESN\u2019), which is differentiated from a manufacturing serial number, is a number string designated to each mobile terminal. The mobile terminal manufacturers register the ESN with a mobile service provider of a country where the mobile device will be used. Therefore, through the pre-registered ESN, the mobile terminal is registered with that mobile service provider or a change of mobile terminal is accomplished. Since the ESN is unique to each terminal and difficult to duplicate, preferably the ESN is used as a mobile terminal identifier.","\u2018Configuration Information File (abbreviated as \u2018INF\u2019) contains system information.

The developer who accesses the download server  with the developer mobile terminal  uses the serial method for developing the software. When accessing the download server  by the serial method, the developer can access the download server  through the local computer .

The storage procedure can be divided into error detection, data storage, and an A-key generation. The error detection is to detect the occurrence of error in the software data and the security level information of the received download file. The data storage is to store the software data on the mobile terminal  if no error is detected in the error detection. The A-key generation is to generate A-key by combining the error code and the ESN.

If the data file is compressed, the download server  must generate an error code for the compressed data file.","The security level information  includes information about resources that the software can access when the software is executed on the mobile terminal. The usable resource of the mobile terminal  is determined by the security level information, and the security level information can be designated to each unit of software respectively.

Further, the mobile terminal  that receives the download file can detect the occurrence of error in the software data by use of the error code . The method for detecting the occurrence of error using the error code  is described in more detail.","The error code  can be generated by one of a parity check and Cyclic Redundancy Check(abbreviated as \u2018CRC\u2019). The parity check, the simplest error detection method, adds a parity bit on the end of a data block; however, it cannot detect error when an even number of errors occur. Thus, in one embodiment, it is preferable to use CRC rather than the parity check. The error code  is Frame Check Sequence (hereinafter \u2018FCS\u2019) when using CRC. According to the method for detecting the occurrence of error in the mobile terminal, the mobile terminal  generates FCS for the software data by the same method of the download server , and compares the error code in the download file to the generated FCS to detect the occurrence of error.","When using CRC in one embodiment, CRC  and CRC  can be selectively used according to the type of the mobile terminal .

However, since the software for a developer is transmitted through cable, there is low possibility of error occurrence other than the wireless network. Thus, CRC  can be used as error code. In one embodiment of the invention, it is preferable to correct error as well as detect error.","It is preferable to use the automatic repeat request (abbreviated as \u2018ARQ\u2019) as an error correcting method. The ARQ corrects error by requesting retransmission of the data block having error from the transmitter after detecting error. In addition to ARQ, there is another error correction method, i.e., forward error correction (abbreviated \u2018FEC\u2019). Since FEC can perform error detection and error correction simultaneously, the reverse channel is not needed and the continuous data flow is possible. However, since large overhead occurs for detecting and correcting error simultaneously, FEC is not a suitable correction method for the mobile terminal .
