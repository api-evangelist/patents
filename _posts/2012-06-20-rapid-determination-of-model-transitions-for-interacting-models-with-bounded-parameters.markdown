{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract N00024-03-C-6110 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates generally to state estimation of systems, and more particularly, to state estimation of systems undergoing transitions between multiple state models.","Consistent and accurate methods for performing state estimation in a wide-variety of systems are critical to the function of many processes and operations, both civilian and military. Systems and methods have been developed for state estimation of a system that may transition between different regimes of operation which may be described or defined by a plurality of discrete models. These state estimation methods can be applied to various systems having sensory inputs, by way of non-limiting example only, nuclear, chemical, or manufacturing factories or facilities, control processes subject to external parameter changes, space stations subject to vibrations, automobiles subject to road conditions, and the like. One particularly useful application for state estimation is tracking objects in flight, such as a multistage rocket that is transitioning back and forth between a ballistic model of flight and other thrust models, or an aircraft performing maneuvers mid-flight.","As will be set forth in greater detail below, current state estimation systems and their associated algorithms have difficulty estimating the state of a system transitioning between distinct regimes of operation (i.e. between different, non-interacting models). More recent algorithms may implement \u201cinteracting models\u201d, including Interacting Multiple Models (IMM), which allow for transitioning from one model to another during the estimation process. These interacting model algorithms have the advantage of reducing the filter lag and\/or noise when the system transitions from one model to another. However, they are often burdened by computational challenges. Likewise, existing IMM-based estimators and their associated filtering arrangements also suffer from significant drawbacks, as their designs typically require large amounts of simulation, making their implementation impractical.","Improved systems and methods for state estimation are desired.","A method for estimating the state of an object is provided. The method includes providing a plurality of interacting models, wherein each model represents a potential operating state of said object. The models are defined by at least one parameter constrained to lie within a predetermined range of values. Measurements of the state of the object are made, from which model-conditioned estimates of the object state are generated. A model probability is updated from the model-conditioned estimates and overall estimates of the object state and associated covariance are generated. The states of the models are mixed in response to the model probabilities and the overall estimate of the state and covariance, and an updated estimate of the state and covariance of the object is generated.","A system for estimating the state of an object is also provided. The system includes a sensor for measuring at least one characteristic of the object and a plurality of filters, each associated with one of a plurality of interacting models representing an operating state of the object. Each of the models is defined by at least one parameter having a known bounded value. The system further includes a model probability evaluator configured to determine the likelihood said object is operating within one of said plurality of interacting models, an estimate mixer responsive to said model probability evaluator for mixing estimates generated by each of the plurality of filters, and a combiner for estimating the state of the object by combining the output of said plurality of filters.","It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, many other elements found in state estimation systems, such as IMM-based state estimation systems. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein. The disclosure herein is directed to all such variations and modifications known to those skilled in the art.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that the various embodiments of the invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Furthermore, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described herein in connection with one embodiment may be implemented within other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, it is to be understood that the location or arrangement of individual elements within each disclosed embodiment may be modified without departing from the scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, appropriately interpreted, along with the full range of equivalents to which the claims are entitled. In the drawings, like numerals refer to the same or similar functionality throughout several views.","Referring generally to , a simplified diagram of a target tracking system  is shown. System  may track a target, for example, an aircraft , transitioning back and forth between discrete models of flight (e.g. performing a direction change and continuing on a relatively linear flight path) using one or more sensors, such as a radar systems , . Radar systems ,  include radar antennas , which transmit and subsequently receive radar signals ,  reflected off target  and\/or other background features. Returned signals ,  allow the generation of measurements at output ports , of the radar systems. These measurements include values of at least target position, which may be in the form of range and angles (e.g. elevation and azimuth) from the radar systems. In practice, these measurements may be corrupted by unknown random measurement noises. These noises may be characterized by a covariance and unknown time-varying biases having known bounds. The biases may be the result of, for example, sensor misalignment.","The measurements from radar systems ,  are applied to a processing arrangement  for determining various target parameters, for example, course (i.e. direction of motion), speed, and target type. The estimated position of the target, and possibly other information, is provided to a utilization apparatus, for example, a radar display , for interpretation by an operator. The operator (or possibly automated decision-making equipment) can make decisions as to actions to be taken in response to the displayed information.","As set forth above, existing state-estimation systems and methods have difficulty estimating the state of a system transitioning between distinct modes of operation, such as the maneuvering aircraft . This problem has been addressed by implementing algorithms which allow transitions from one model to another (\u201cinteracting models\u201d). These interacting models have the advantage of reducing the filter lag and\/or noise when the operating regime of the system being modeled switches from one model to another. However, estimation algorithms for such models are often burdened by computational challenges to account for the history of all possible switches, and thus experience undesirable effects, such as lag.","IMM algorithms provide a solution for transitioning between models with reduced computation. In some systems, model transitions are handled by considering interacting models transitioning from one to another according to a Markov transition matrix. The Markov assumption leads to an interaction of the elemental filters representing each model that make up the IMM estimator. As a consequence of the Markov transition process between models, the IMM mixes the state estimates from all the filters, and feeds a different mixture to every filter at the start of each computation cycle. The IMM algorithm makes use of the individual state estimates and error characterization from each elemental state estimator and reports to the external user the overall state estimate and error characterization.","IMM estimators are typically built on a bank elemental Kalman filters. Each Kalman filter is associated with a different model of the IMM (e.g. \u201ctuned\u2019 to a different acceleration, etc.). Because each model's parameters cannot be assumed to have precisely known values, the Kalman filters use empirically-derived white process noise for system modeling. For example, a large value of process noise is used for a large acceleration, and a smaller value for a smaller acceleration. The outputs of the multiple models included in the IMM are weighted and combined according to the likelihood that a measurement fits the assumption of each of the models.","However, Kalman filter-based IMM estimators suffer from numerous drawbacks. For example, the filters must be designed for each type of model, making their implementation impractical. Further, their designs are cumbersome and often non-robust. More specifically, their implementation typically requires large amounts of empirical simulation to design the appropriate white process noise. Further still, these systems generally suffer from an inability to handle data received out-of-sequence and account for biases between multiple sensors, as well as inaccuracies in characterizing estimation errors for maneuvering objects.","Embodiments of the present invention include IMM architectures and algorithms utilizing alternative state estimation processes. More specifically, embodiments may replace existing Kalman filters and their associated processing methods with an \u201coptimal reduced state estimation\u201d (ORSE) IMM algorithm, in combination with elemental ORSE filters. This ORSE IMM architecture may avoid utilizing a specific system model, and instead considers the worst-case bounds for one or more input parameters of the system. These physical bounds replace the empirical white process noise utilized in the Kalman filtering operations of existing IMM state estimators, and offer improved system accuracy, as well as simplified state estimator design.","For a given system that can be represented by a plurality of models, each individual model may include both states, whose dynamics can be modeled, and extrinsic parameters, such as inputs to the system and sensor biases, whose dynamics cannot be modeled, but which extrinsic parameters are constrained to lie within a known range of values. Based on these principles, embodiments of the present invention avoid the need for the specialized filter designs of traditional IMM algorithms by analytic modeling of extrinsic parameters, for example, the physical bounds of target maneuvers as well as the sensor biases.","Exemplary ORSE IMM systems and methods according to embodiments of the present invention may perform an iterative process, wherein for a given time step, a linear combination of object (e.g. target) state estimates are input into each model. Current object measurements (e.g. from one or more sensors) are also input into each model, and residuals computed, along with likelihood functions. Normalized likelihood functions are used as weights in a linear combination of current model outputs to form the desired blended track state and covariance outputs. The residuals and model probabilities are calculated from the outputs of each model and each model's outputs are stored for the next iteration.","As set forth above, elemental ORSE filters may be used for tracking an object. In an exemplary aircraft tracking embodiment, using the physical bounds (i.e. maximum excursions) on various parameters, such as turn rate and tangential acceleration, ORSE filtering can provide for increased estimation consistency. Maximum accelerations produced by these bounded parameters, along the instantaneous normal and tangential airplane axes, bound all physically possible maneuvers. In an exemplary filter model used by an IMM of the present invention, these maximum accelerations are represented in an equivalent statistical model by, for example, a multivariate Gaussian distribution of constant accelerations, whose one-sigma ellipsoid best approximates the maximum accelerations. As a result, among all current estimators (including reduced state Kalman filters) with the same reduced states, ORSE filters utilized by IMM algorithms of embodiments of the present invention have the least covariance. This covariance is the minimal covariance achievable by linearly weighting the predicted states with a new measurement at each successive update of the filter. ORSE minimizes the mean-square and thus, the root-mean-square (RMS) estimation errors for the maximum excursions of the parameters in the truth model. Furthermore, because the bounds are included in the minimized covariance, embodiments of the present invention do not need white plant noise, as is required by Kalman filters, to cope with the reduced state.","Referring generally to , an ORSE IMM system  according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention generally consists of an ORSE filter 1, 2 . . . N for each model of a given system, a model probability evaluator , an estimate mixer  arranged at the input of the filters, and an estimate combiner  at the output of the filters. Each of the models interacts through a mixing process to track, for example, a target maneuvering with an arbitrary trajectory. More specifically, for a given time step, previous state estimates for each model 1, 2 . . . N are combined in mixer , to produce updated mixed state estimates , \u2032, \u2033, and are input into respective filters 1, 2 . . . N. The current system measurements  (e.g. from one or more sensors) are also input into each filter 1, 2 . . . N, and residuals computed, along with likelihood functions in probability evaluator . Normalized likelihood functions are used as weights in a linear combination of current model outputs to form the desired blended track state and covariance outputs in combiner . Each model output is stored for the next iteration, and model probabilities  are updated for the same.","With reference to Tables 1 and 2, and the process illustrated in , an exemplary ORSE IMM algorithm according to an embodiment of the present invention will be set forth in detail herein. Consider tracking a system (i.e. a target) which at any time of observation obeys one of a finite number of models \u03a0, i=1, . . . , N, and has a tendency to transition to another model \u03a0, j=1, . . . , N according to a Markov probability matrix whose components are \u03a0. Each model \u03a0, i=1, . . . , N is a function of a number of arbitrarily time-varying parameters, having known bounds. The models are reduced order models of the true target and include an m-dimensional parameter vector \u03bb composed of the union of all these parameters over all the models.
