{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments presented herein generally relate to insurance claim processing. More particularly, embodiments relate to a system and method for providing input to an insurance claim processing system using a graphical user interface. Additional embodiments relate to a system and method of tuning an insurance claim processing system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Insurance companies have been processing and settling claims associated with bodily injury for a long time. The task of evaluating, analyzing or estimating the amount of damage associated with one or more types of bodily injuries, especially trauma-induced bodily injuries, can be very complex. Complexity in the evaluation process often arises out of the fact that concurrent expertise in legal, medical and insurance fields is often required to arrive at a particular decision involving a bodily injury claim.","Several factors can affect the estimated amount of the claim associated with a bodily injury. Every accident is different and every injury is unique. Arriving at a customized evaluation of a bodily injury claim, which is unique for a specific accident, injury, etc. is desirable. Applying across-the-board standards may tend to result in an inequitable solution for one or more parties involved. External environmental factors, such as the experience level of a claims adjuster, record of accomplishment of the legal professionals, post-injury quality of life for the injured party, etc., all may affect the valuation of a claim.","During the past several years, many insurance companies have been using computer-based and knowledge-based claim-processing systems to process, evaluate, analyze and estimate thousands of claims in what is believed to be a fair and consistent manner. A knowledge-based claim-processing system may include an expert system which utilizes and builds a knowledge base to assist the user in decision making. Such a system may allow the insurance companies to define new business rules and\/or use previously defined rules, in real-time. The business rules are generally written by industry experts to evaluate legal, medical, insurance conditions before arriving at a valuation of a claim.","An insurance claim processing system may determine valuation of a claim by first determining the severity of the claim. Several measures of severity of a claim may include, but are not limited to trauma severity values and bodily impairment values. Claim severity may be associated with a monetary amount. In some instances, different zones or geographic regions (e.g., different states within the United States) may have different monetary values associated with claims of the same severity (e.g., claims having the same bodily impairment, trauma severity values, etc.).","Embodiments presented herein generally relate to insurance claim processing. More specifically embodiments relate to methods of providing input to an insurance claim processing system via a graphical interface. Additionally, methods presented herein relate to methods of specifying a relationship between two or more claim variables in an insurance claim processing system.","In an embodiment, a method of specifying a relationship between insurance claim information (e.g., trauma severity values and\/or bodily impairment amounts) and monetary amounts may include providing a plurality of data points relating trauma severity values and monetary amounts. For example, such data points may be derived from the opinion of one or more expert claim adjusters. In such a case, one or more expert claim adjusters may be provided with a number of real or prepared insurance claims. One or more relationships between trauma severity values and monetary amounts may be determined based on the expert claim adjusters' analysis of the insurance claims. In another example, the data points may be determined based on a number of closed claims. In either case, the monetary amounts may represent monetary amounts related to trauma only, or to monetary amounts associated with the entire insurance claim (e.g., both trauma and bodily impairment).","Two or more of the data points may be used to form a graphical display. The graphical display may include a tuning line. For example, the tuning line may be a function relating trauma severity values and monetary amounts. In an embodiment, the tuning line may be a line fit through two or more of the data points using a line fitting technique. In an embodiment, the tuning line may include one or more substantially straight line segments. Such line segments may join two or more of the data points.","The method may include receiving input via the graphical display which modifies the tuning line. At least one new data point relating at least one trauma severity value and at least one monetary amount may be determined based on modifications to the tuning line in the graphical display. Additionally, the display may include one or more data fields with information describing the relationship between trauma severity values and monetary amounts. The display may also include a baseline tuning line, which is not affected by modifying the tuning line.","In certain embodiments, the method may also include providing a plurality of impairment data points relating bodily impairment amounts to monetary amounts. In such embodiments, a graphical display of an impairment tuning line may be provided. The impairment tuning line may relate bodily impairment amounts and monetary amounts based on at least two of the impairment data points. As with the tuning line graphical display, the bodily impairment tuning line graphical display may be modified. At least one new impairment data point may be determined based on modifications to the impairment tuning line in the graphical display.","After at least one new data point (e.g., at least one new tuning line data point and\/or at least one new impairment tuning line data point) has been determined, a plurality of data points may be sent to an insurance claim processing system. The data points may include at least one new data point. The data points may be usable by the insurance claim processing system to relate one or more trauma severity values to one or more monetary amounts. Alternately, data describing the modified tuning line may be sent to the insurance claim processing system. In such a case, the data describing the tuning line may be usable by the insurance claim processing-system to relate one or more trauma severity values to one or more monetary amounts. If the data sent to the insurance claim processing system includes at least one new impairment data point, the data may be useable by the insurance claim processing system to relate one or more bodily impairment amounts to one or more monetary amounts. The method may further include determining a monetary amount associated with an insurance claim. For example, the method may include estimating a trauma severity value and\/or a bodily impairment amount associated with an insurance claim. The estimated trauma severity value and\/or a bodily impairment amount may then be used in conjunction with the modified tuning line and\/or modified impairment tuning line (as appropriate) to estimate a monetary amount. For example, an interpolation or extrapolation method may be used to determine a monetary amount associated with a trauma severity value or bodily impairment value not explicitly represented by a data point. If extrapolation is used, a user may receive a warning indicating that a value outside the range of data used to determine the relationship between trauma severity or bodily impairment and monetary amounts is being used.","In another embodiment, a method may include providing a graphical display comprising a tuning line, wherein the tuning line represents a plurality of data points relating trauma severity values to monetary amounts. Input modifying at least a portion of the tuning line may be received via the graphical display. A monetary amount associated with a trauma severity value may be determined based on the modified tuning line.","In an embodiment, a method of receiving input in an insurance claim processing system may include providing a graphical display including at least one representation of a human body. A body part may be selected on at least one representation of the human body. Selecting a body part may cause input selection information related to the selected body part to be displayed. An input selection may be received via the displayed input selection information.","The input selection may include an injury code and\/or a selection of a body part. In response to receiving input, information may be displayed in the graphical display identifying at least one selected body part. Information may also be displayed identifying common injuries associated with at least one selected body part.","In various embodiments, a representation of a human body may include, but is not limited to: a representation of a human skeletal system, a representation of human musculature, a representation of a human nervous system, and\/or a representation of a human circulatory system. The representation may include one or more layers. A layer may include an anatomical system of the human body and organs associated with the anatomical system. Additional information may also be displayed in the graphical display. For example, a photograph of a selected body part may be displayed. In another example, a more detailed view of a body part may be displayed. In yet another example, the input selection may include at least one injury code associated with at least one injury type. In such a case, the method may provide a graphical display of a selected injury type. Alternately, the input selection may include at least one injury type and at least one injured area. In such a case, the method may provide a graphical display of an injury of at least one selected injury type to at least one selected injured area. In other examples, the input selection information may include a menu including a selection of subparts of the selected body part and\/or a selection of treatment types associated with the selected body parts. In such cases, the method may further include displaying at least one graphical display associated with the input selection information (e.g., a graphical display depicting a treatment of a selected treatment type to a selected treated area).","In another embodiment, a method of receiving input in an insurance claim processing system may include providing a graphical display including at least one representation of a human body (e.g., as described above) and at least one input field. Input may be received via an input field. For example, the input may be related to one or more body parts, as previously described. The method may include highlighting one or more body parts in the graphical display in response to the input received. For example, the method may include receiving input related to at least one body part and an anatomical system. In such a case, highlighting at least one body part may include displaying a layer comprising the anatomical system.","Additional embodiments may include a computer memory medium or computer system configured to implement methods as described above. Additional embodiments may include implementing methods as described above on two or more computers connected by a network. For example, the network may include the Internet.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail.

In one embodiment, codes for steps and step elements are not given a Soundex equivalent, as a Soundex equivalent of a code is not generally useful.","Columns , , and  may be used during calculation of the relevance of an entry. For each entry in the index table , column  may indicate the position of the term or code in the text section or header in which this occurrence of the term or code appears. Column  may indicate the total count of words in the text section or header. For example, in the first entry of the index table  as illustrated in , the position column  indicates that the term \u201cSystem\u201d appears as the fifth word of the 54 words (from the total words column ) in the text section indicated by the object ID column . Examining the second entry, the term \u201cSystem\u201d appears again as the ninth word of the same text section.","In one embodiment, the word count column  may be used with entries for headers in calculating the relevance value . Different information and methods may be used for calculating the relevance of occurrences of terms and codes appearing in headers than the information and methods used to calculate the relevance for terms and codes appearing in text sections. In calculating the relevance for headers, the percent of the total word count indicated in column  may be used as part of the calculation. The word count  indicates how many words make up the one or more words (or words represented by a code) as represented in column . For example, in the header entry in the seventh row of the index table as illustrated in , the term \u201cAnatomy\u201d is in the third position (as indicated by column ) of three words (as indicated by column ) and includes one word. Thus, when calculating the relevance, \u201cAnatomy\u201d is approximately 33% of the header.","The last column of the index table  illustrated in  may hold a calculated relevance  for the occurrence.

Alternatively, the relevance for occurrences may not be calculated in advance and stored in the index table , but instead may be calculated dynamically as needed. In one embodiment, columns , , and  may not be stored in the index table . Instead, the information may be used to calculate the relevance and then discarded. One embodiment of the index table  may include only an object ID , a term , and a relevance value . Another embodiment of an index table  may only include an object ID  and a term , and the relevance may be calculated dynamically.","In one embodiment, occurrences in headers may be considered of higher relevance than occurrences in text sections. Therefore, different methods may be applied to calculate the relevance of occurrences in headers than are applied to calculate the relevance of occurrences in text sections. In one embodiment, relevance values may be scaled to be between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest relevance. In one embodiment, the relevance may be calculated so that a relevance value of 0.0 does not occur. Note that any scale may be used for the relevance calculation, as it may be the ordering of the relevance values that is useful, and not necessarily the scale on which the relevance values are calculated.","In one embodiment, a maximum relevance value may be provided for occurrences in text sections. This maximum value may be applied as a weight or scaling factor during the relevance calculation. In one embodiment, the maximum relevance value for occurrences in text sections may also serve as the minimum value for occurrences in headers. In this embodiment, header occurrences may always have at least as high a relevance value as the highest relevance text occurrences. In another embodiment, header occurrences may always have a higher relevance value than the highest relevance text occurrences.","The following is an example of using the tables in ,  and  for context-sensitive help in an insurance claims processing system.

If closed claims are used, they may be reviewed for errors and\/or inappropriate results before the tuning line is determined. In an embodiment, suitable data points may be determined based on one or more baseline claims prepared specifically for gathering tuning data points (e.g., specifically selected claims and\/or made up claims). In such an embodiment, one or more claims adjusters may be provided with information regarding the baseline claims and asked to determine tuning information (i.e., information relevant to tuning) based on the claims. In an embodiment, suitable data points may be determined based on one or more existing tuning relationships (e.g., an existing relationship between monetary amount and TSV and\/or impairment amount).","In various embodiments, a tuning line may be determined from one or more data points by a variety of known methods. Examples of methods of determining an initial placement of a tuning line may include, but are not limited to, statistical techniques (e.g., regression analysis), existing relationships between TSV and monetary amounts or between impairment amounts and monetary amounts (e.g., based on old tuning methods), and\/or determining a line to connect two or more data points.","In an embodiment, one or more closed claims may be used in forming an initial tuning line. Closed claims may be provided to give an accurate view of the IC's settlement history. In an embodiment, an established user of the insurance claim processing system may start with the current tuning of the insurance claim processing system. Additional tuning of the insurance claim processing system may be performed based on claims closed while utilizing the insurance claim processing system.

In a third example, the user may re-tune a region previously tuned using a different tuning process. In an embodiment, a tuning application may support tuning in each of these situations. In an embodiment, the tuning application may include functionality to translate tuning from other tuning methods into a baseline tuning.","In an embodiment, a tuning process may include two phases. First, an initial or baseline tuning may be determined. For example, for creating a new tuning region, an insurance company's claims experts may evaluate a set of baseline cases for which injury severity and\/or impairment is predetermined. For re-tuning, a baseline tuning may be established by using values from the existing tuning for the region.","A second phase of the tuning process may include fine-tuning. During fine-tuning, the user may compare the baseline tuning values with actual past settlements. The user may elect to make changes to the tuning of the insurance claim processing program, which may change the relationship of monetary amounts to claim severity used for future claims. Fine-tuning may involve adjusting the baseline tuning. For example, for a user re-tuning a region, the fine-tuning phase is a re-calibration to reflect any changes in a region. The tuning application may allow the user to view settlement history and decide whether to make changes to the monetary amounts associated with future claims.","In an embodiment, fine-tuning may be sub-divided into two categories: trauma fine-tuning and impairment fine-tuning. In such embodiments, trauma fine-tuning may deal with injuries, treatments, duties under duress, loss of enjoyment of life, etc. Trauma tuning may associate monetary amounts to different levels of trauma severity, as described above. Impairment tuning may associate monetary amounts to percentages of whole-person bodily impairment. In an embodiment, whole-person bodily impairment may be determined by a qualified medical professional, for example, using the American Medical Association's ","In an embodiment, tuning a new region may include performing a closed claim study, in which settled claims are pulled and entered into the tuning application (or insurance claim processing system) by one or more claims experts.

The insurance claim processing system may be configured to receive the data describing the tuning line, and to estimate a monetary amount associated with an insurance claim. In an embodiment, the insurance claim processing system may be configured to utilize more than one tuning line. For example, a first tuning line may be used to relate TSV to monetary amounts and a second tuning line may be used to related impairment amounts to monetary amounts. In another example, the insurance claim processing system may utilize different tuning lines for different geographic regions and\/or different types of insurance coverage. Thus, a tuning line may be prepared for each of a number of geographic regions and the insurance claim processing system may select a tuning line to use based on a geographic region associated with the claim.","In an embodiment, an insurance claim processing system may determine a TSV of a claim. The insurance claim processing system may utilize a defined relationship between TSV and monetary amounts (e.g., the data describing the tuning line) to estimate a monetary amount associated with an insurance claim. In an embodiment, the insurance claim processing system may determine whether a data point of the data describing the tuning line matches the determined TSV. If no data point is an exact match, the insurance claim processing system may interpolate between two or more data points of the data describing the tuning line. Alternatively, if the determined TSV lies outside a range of data points covered by the data describing the tuning line, the insurance claim processing system may extrapolate a monetary value based on the data describing the tuning line. If a monetary amount is determined by extrapolation, a message may be sent to the user informing the user that the determined monetary amount was determined by extrapolation. The interpolation or extrapolation, as appropriate, may utilize a linear or nonlinear method.
