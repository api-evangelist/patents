Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a thin film field effect transistor and a display using the same. Particularly, it relates to a thin film field effect transistor in which an amorphous oxide semiconductor is used for an active layer, and a display using the same.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, flat panel displays (FPDs) have been put to practical use, due to the progress made in liquid crystal and electroluminescence (EL) technologies, etc. Especially, an organic electroluminescence element (hereinafter referred to as an \u201corganic EL element\u201d in some cases) formed using a thin film material which emits light by excitation due to application of electric current can provide light emission of high brightness at low voltage, and thus is expected to obtain effects such as reduction in device thickness, weight, and size, and power saving in wide ranging applications including mobile phone displays, personal digital assistants (PDA), computer displays, car information displays, TV monitors, and general illumination.","These FPDs are driven by an active matrix circuit including thin film field effect transistors each using, as an active layer, an amorphous silicon thin film or a polycrystalline silicon thin film provided on a glass substrate. (In the description below, the thin film field effect transistor is sometimes referred to as a \u201cthin film transistor\u201d or \u201cTFT\u201d.)","On the other hand, to make the FPD thinner, lighter, and more resistant to breakage, attempts are being made to use a resin substrate which is light in weight and flexible, instead of the glass substrate.","However, fabrication of the transistors using the silicon thin films described above requires a thermal treatment process at a relatively high temperature, and it is difficult to form the transistors directly on resin substrates, which are generally low in heat resistance.","For example, a MOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor), which reduces a driving voltage of a transistor that uses a silicon thin film, is disclosed, and a configuration in which indium tin oxide (ITO), tin oxide or zinc oxide is used as a semiconductor material of an active layer and a dielectric material having a large dielectric constant is used in a gate insulating layer is disclosed. However, ITO, tin oxide or zinc oxide is a crystalline metal oxide. In order to obtain desired semiconductor characteristics using the crystalline metal oxide in an active layer, it is necessary to conduct a high temperature heat treatment step for regulation of the crystallization, such as post annealing at 300\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, after film formation by sputtering. Accordingly, such an active layer is difficult to form directly on a resin substrate that is poor in heat resistance.","Amorphous oxides, such as In\u2014Ga\u2014Zn\u2014O-based amorphous oxides, can form a film at low temperatures, and have been attracting attention as a material that can form a film on a plastic film at room temperature.","However, a TFT using an amorphous oxide semiconductor has problems of high OFF current and low ON\/OFF ratio.","Further, it is reported that when a TFT in which an amorphous oxide semiconductor is used as an active layer contacts with epoxy resin or acrylic resin, which is a common protective layer material, and repeatedly driven, the TFT exhibits unstable behavior in that the threshold voltage for allowing a current to flow varies each time. In order to prevent this, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2007-299913 discloses a method of covering the active layer with an inorganic insulating layer or a fully fluorinated resin to avoid direct contact of the active layer with a protective layer.","Further, JP-A No. 2007-73705 mentions a problem in that a TFT having an active layer formed of an amorphous oxide semiconductor exhibits changes in characteristics due to the influence of gas components (oxygen gas and nitrogen gas) and moisture in an atmosphere during storage, and discloses covering the channel portion with a protective layer constituted of a silicon resin or the like.","However, when an inorganic insulating layer and the like as a protective layer of the active layer is formed on the active layer in order to avoid the contact of the active layer with a non-fluorinated resin, there is a problem in increase of the number of processes that is caused by inclusion of processes for separately patterning the active layer and the protective layer of the active layer. In addition, the problems of high OFF current and low ON\/OFF ratio are not solved by the protective layer described above, and still remain as issues to be solved.","The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides a thin film field effect transistor (hereinafter referred to as \u201cTFT\u201d in some cases) and a display using the same.","An aspect of the invention provides a thin film field effect transistor including at least: a substrate; and a gate electrode, a gate insulating layer, an active layer, a source electrode and a drain electrode, and a protective layer provided on the substrate in this order from the substrate side, wherein the active layer is a layer containing an amorphous oxide containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of In, Sn, Zn and Cd, and the thin film field effect transistor further includes an electric resistance layer containing an oxide or a nitride containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al, Mg, Ca and Si between the active layer and at least one of the source electrode or the drain electrode.","The thin film field effect transistor of the invention is an active element which includes at least: a substrate; and a gate electrode, a gate insulating layer, an active layer, a source electrode and a drain electrode, and a protective layer provided on the substrate in this order from the substrate side, wherein the active element has a function of switching the current flowing between the source electrode and the drain electrode by regulating the current passing through the active layer by applying a voltage to the gate electrode. The TFT structure may be either a staggered structure or an inverted staggered structure.","The active layer of the TFT of the invention is a layer containing an amorphous oxide containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of In, Sn, Zn and Cd, and the TFT includes, between the active layer and at least one of the source electrode or the drain electrode, an electric resistance layer containing an oxide or nitride containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al, Mg, Ca and Si.","In the channel region of the active layer in the constitution of the invention, the active layer is disposed such that the active layer is separated from the protective layer by the electric resistance layer located therebetween. Accordingly, since a surface of the active layer that is perpendicular to the thickness direction of the active layer does not contact directly with the protective layer, degradation in TFT performance of the active layer is prevented even when the protective layer is constituted of a resin.","Further, there is a problem in that an active layer containing an amorphous oxide is corroded by a chemical etching liquid, which makes it difficult to utilize a chemical etching method for patterning a layer provided thereon. However, the electric resistance layer of the invention has an advantage of excellent chemical resistance, and, therefore, the above layer arrangement makes it possible to pattern the source electrode and the drain electrode by chemical etching, whereby the TFT productivity is increased.","The protective layer in the invention preferably includes a photosensitive resin and is preferably patterned and formed using a lithographic method.","The electric conductivity of the active layer is preferably 10Scmor more but less than 10Scm, more preferably 10Scmor more but less than 10Scm","The ratio of the electric conductivity of the active layer to the electric conductivity of the electric resistance layer (electric conductivity of active layer\/electric conductivity of electric resistance layer) is preferably from 10to 10.","The active layer includes preferably an amorphous oxide which contains at least In; more preferably, the amorphous oxide further contains Zn.","The electric resistance layer contains preferably an oxide or nitride of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al and Mg, and more preferably an oxide of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al and Mg.","Preferably, at least one edge portion of the active layer is covered with the electric resistance layer, and the protective layer does not contact directly with the active layer at the edge portion. More preferably, the entire active layer is covered with the electric resistance layer.","The protective layer is preferably formed by a photosensitive resin. The substrate is preferably a flexible substrate. A heat treatment (annealing) may be performed after formation of the TFT element.","The TFT of the invention is described below in more detail.","1) Amorphous Oxide Layer","Since the amorphous oxide used for the active layer in the invention can form a film at low temperatures, an amorphous oxide layer can be fabricated on a flexible resin substrate such as of plastics. Examples of the amorphous oxide which can form a film at low temperatures include an amorphous oxide containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting In, Sn, Zn and Cd, preferable examples thereof include an amorphous oxide containing at least In, and more preferable examples thereof include an amorphous oxide containing at least In and Zn.","For example, it is known that amorphous oxides having compositional structures represented by InGaO(ZnO)(m is a natural number smaller than 6) are preferable. These amorphous oxides are n-type semiconductors, in which electrons serve as carriers. Of course, p-type oxide semiconductors such as ZnO\/RhO, CuGaO, and SrCuOmay be used for the active layer. Oxide semiconductors disclosed in JP-A No. 2006-165529 may be used.","Specifically, the amorphous oxide in the invention is preferably an amorphous oxide semiconductor which includes In\u2014Ga\u2014Zn\u2014O and a composition represented by InGaO(ZnO)(m is a natural number smaller than 6) in a crystalline state. Particularly, InGaZnOis preferable. The amorphous oxide semiconductor of this composition has a feature that electron mobility tends to increase with an increase in electric conductivity. In addition, the electric conductivity can be regulated by regulating the partial pressure of oxygen during film formation. The active layer may include, beside an oxide semiconductor, one or more other materials such as inorganic semiconductors (such as Si and Ge), compound semiconductors (such as GaAs), organic semiconductor materials (such as pentacene and polythiophene), and carbon nanotube.","<Carrier Concentration>","The carrier concentration of the amorphous oxide layer in the invention can be adjusted to a desired value by various means.","The carrier concentration of the amorphous oxide layer in the invention is not particularly limited, and is preferably in a high carrier concentration range of 1\u00d710cmor more, and more preferably from 1\u00d710cmto 1\u00d710cm.","As the means for adjusting the carrier concentration, the following means may be used.","(1) Adjustment by Oxygen Defect","It is known that when an oxygen vacancy occurs in an oxide semiconductor, the carrier concentration of the active layer is increased, which results in an increase in electric conductivity. Hence, the carrier concentration of an oxide semiconductor can be adjusted by regulating the quantity of oxygen vacancies. Specific methods for regulating the quantity of oxygen vacancies include regulating at least one of the partial pressure of oxygen during film formation and the oxygen concentration and treatment time of a post-treatment performed after the film formation. Examples of the post-treatment include heat treatment at a temperature of 100\u00b0 C. or higher, processing with an oxygen plasma, and UV ozone treatment. Among these, the method of regulating the partial pressure of oxygen during film formation is preferable in view of productivity. The carrier concentration of an oxide semiconductor can be adjusted by regulating the partial pressure of oxygen during film formation.","(2) Adjustment by Composition Ratio","It is known that the carrier concentration of an oxide semiconductor can be changed by changing the metal composition ratio of the oxide semiconductor. For instance, in the case of InGaZnMgO, the carrier concentration decreases with an increase in the proportion of Mg. In addition, in the oxide system represented by (InO)(ZnO), the carrier concentration decreases with an increase in the proportion of Zn if the Zn\/In ratio is 10% or higher. Specific examples of methods for changing the composition ratio, for example in a film formation method using sputtering, include a method using targets having different composition ratios. The composition ratio of the film can be changed alternatively by individually regulating the sputtering rate for each target when multiple targets are co-sputtered.","(3) Adjustment by Impurities","The carrier concentration can be reduced by adding one or more elements as impurities, such as Li, Na, Mn, Ni, Pd, Cu, Cd, C, N, or P, to an oxide semiconductor. Examples of methods for adding the impurities include co-vapor deposition of the oxide semiconductor and the impurity elements, and ion-doping of a pre-formed oxide semiconductor film with ions of the impurity elements.","(4) Adjustment by Oxide Semiconductor Material","While methods of adjusting the carrier concentration within the same oxide semiconductor system are described in the above items (1) to (3), the carrier concentration can be changed by changing the oxide semiconductor material. For example, it is known that the carrier concentration of SnO-based oxide semiconductors is lower than the carrier concentration of InO-based oxide semiconductors. Thus, the carrier concentration can be adjusted by changing the oxide semiconductor material.","As the means for adjusting the carrier concentration, any of the methods stated in the above items (1) to (4) may be used singly, or two or more of the methods stated in the above items (1) to (4) may be used in combination.","<Method of Forming Amorphous Oxide Layer>","As the methods for forming a layer of the amorphous oxide, it is suitable to adopt a vapor-phase film forming method using, as a target, a polycrystalline sintered body of an oxide semiconductor. Among vapor-phase film forming methods, sputtering method and pulsed laser deposition method (PLD method) are suitable. For mass production, sputtering method is preferable.","For instance, a film can be formed using an RF magnetron sputtering method while regulating the degree of vacuum and the flow rate of oxygen. A higher flow rate of oxygen achieves a lower electric conductivity.","It can be verified, using a conventional X-ray diffraction method, that the resultant film is an amorphous film. The composition ratio can be determined by RBS analysis (Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry).","<Thickness of Amorphous Oxide Layer>","The thickness of the amorphous oxide layer used as the active layer in the invention is preferably from 1 nm to 100 nm, and more preferably from 2.5 nm to 50 nm.","The thickness of the amorphous oxide layer in the invention can be determined by HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope) photograph of a section of the prepared TFT element.","2) Electric Resistance Layer","The electric resistance layer in the invention contains an oxide or nitride containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al, Mg, Ca and Si. The electric resistance layer in the invention preferably contains an oxide or nitride of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al and Mg, and more preferably an oxide of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al and Mg.","Specific examples of the oxide (which may be an amorphous oxide) contained in the electric resistance layer according to the invention include InGaZnO, GaO, MgO, AlOand oxides formed by mixing two or more of these oxides.","The nitride for use in the invention is preferably amorphous. The nitride more preferably has an electric conductivity of from 10Scm to 10Scm, and still more preferably has an electric conductivity of from 10Scm to 10Scm. The electric resistance can be adjusted in a manner similar to the adjustment of the carrier concentration in the amorphous oxide layer described above.","The layer containing an amorphous nitride in the invention is preferably arranged so as to be adjacent to at least one of the gate electrode or the source electrode.","The layer containing an amorphous nitride in the invention preferably has a thickness of from 1 nm to 100 nm, and more preferably from 5 nm to 10 nm.","Preferably, the amorphous nitride includes at least one metal selected from the group consisting of In, Al and Ga. The amorphous nitride is more preferably an amorphous nitride containing at least Al, which even more preferably further contains In or Ga.","The amorphous nitride is described in more detail.","The amorphous nitride can be obtained by performing sputtering in argon and nitrogen, or by supplying prescribed raw materials in a prescribed quantity. For example, an amorphous nitride may be obtained by sputtering a target such as AlN, SiN, GaN or InN in argon and nitrogen. A material containing two or more compounds for forming an amorphous nitride may be used as a target.","3) Gate Electrode","According to the invention, preferable examples of a material of the gate electrode include: a metal such as Al, Mo, Cr, Ta, Ti, Au or Ag; an alloy such as Al\u2014Nd or Ag\u2014Pd\u2014Cu (APC); a metal oxide electrically conductive film such as a film of tin oxide, zinc oxide, indium oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO), or indium zinc oxide (IZO); an organic electrically conductive compound such as polyaniline, polythiophene, or polypyrrole; and a mixture thereof.","The thickness of the gate electrode is preferably from 10 nm to 1000 nm, more preferably from 20 nm to 500 nm, and even more preferably from 40 nm to 100 nm.","The method of forming the gate electrode is not particularly limited. The gate electrode can be formed on the substrate according to a method which is appropriately selected, in consideration of the suitability to the material described above, from wet methods such as a printing method and a coating method, physical methods such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method and an ion plating method, chemical methods such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and a plasma CVD method, and the like. For example, when ITO is selected, the gate electrode can be formed according to, for example, a direct current (DC) or high-frequency sputtering method, a vacuum deposition method, or an ion plating method. Further, when an organic electrically conductive compound is selected as the material of the gate electrode, the film formation of the gate electrode can be performed according to a wet film-forming method.","4) Gate Insulating Layer","For the gate insulating layer, an insulator such as SiO, SiN, SiON, AlO, YO, TaO, or HfO, or a mixed crystal compound containing two or more thereof may be used. Alternatively, a polymeric insulator such as polyimide may be used for the gate insulating layer.","The thickness of the gate insulating layer is preferably from 10 nm to 1000 nm, more preferably from 50 nm to 500 nm, and even more preferably from 100 nm to 200 nm. To reduce the leak current and raise the voltage resistance, the gate insulating layer should have at least a certain thickness. However, an increase in the thickness of the gate insulating layer results in a rise in the voltage needed for driving the TFT. Therefore, it is preferable that the thickness of the gate insulating layer is from 50 nm to 1000 nm when the gate insulating layer is formed of an inorganic insulator, and from 0.5 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm when the gate insulating layer is formed of a polymeric insulator.","Especially, use of an insulator having a high dielectric constant, such as HfO, for the gate insulating layer enables driving of the TFT at low voltage even when the gate insulating layer is thick, which is preferable.","5) Source Electrode and Drain Electrode","According to the invention, examples of materials for the source electrode and the drain electrode include: metals such as Al, Mo, Cr, Ta, Ti, Au and Ag; alloys such as Al\u2014Nd and APC; metal oxide electrically conductive films such as films of tin oxide, zinc oxide, indium oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO) or indium zinc oxide (IZO); organic electrically conductive compounds such as polyaniline, polythiophene and polypyrrole; and mixtures thereof. In particular, IZO is preferable.","The thickness of the source electrode and the thickness of the drain electrode are each preferably from 10 nm to 1000 nm, more preferably from 20 nm to 500 nm, and even more preferably from 40 nm to 100 nm.","The method of forming the source electrode and the drain electrode is not particularly limited. The electrodes can be formed on the substrate according to a method which is appropriately selected, in consideration of the suitability to the material described above, from wet methods such as a printing method and a coating method, physical methods such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method and an ion plating method, chemical methods such as a CVD method and a plasma CVD method, and the like. For example, when ITO is selected, the electrodes can be formed according to, for example, a DC or high-frequency sputtering method, a vacuum deposition method, or an ion plating method. Further, when an organic electrically conductive compound is selected as the material of the source electrode and the drain electrode, the film formation of the source electrode and drain electrode can be performed according to a wet film-forming method.","6) Protective Layer","The protective layer of the TFT in the invention is a layer for electrically separating a pixel electrode from a TFT portion.","<Material>","For the protective layer, a resin material is preferably used, such as an acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, a fluorine-containing resin, a silicon-based resin, a rubber-based resin, or an ester-based resin. The resin material is preferably a photosensitive resin or heat-curable resin, which can be patterned using a lithographic method.","<Production Method>","No particular limitation is imposed on the production method of the protective layer, and examples of the method include a method of coating a resin solution, a method of compression bonding or thermo-compression bonding a resin sheet, and a method of dry-polymerization using, for example, vapor deposition or sputtering.","<Film Thickness>","The protective layer preferably has a thickness of from 1 \u03bcm to 1 mm, more preferably from 5 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm, and most preferably from 10 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm.","7) Substrate","The substrate used in the present invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include: inorganic materials such as YSZ (zirconia stabilized yttrium) and glass; and organic materials such as polyesters (such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate) and synthetic resins (such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyether sulfone, polyarylate, allyl diglycol carbonate, polyimide, polycycloolefin, norbornene resin, and poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene)). The organic materials described above are preferably excellent in heat resistance, stability of dimension, resistance to solvents, electric insulating property, workability, low gas permeability, low hygroscopicity, and the like.","According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to use a flexible substrate. As the material used for the flexible substrate, an organic plastic film which has high transmittance is preferable, and examples thereof include: polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene phthalate and polyethylene naphthalate; and plastic films such as of polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyether sulfone, polyarylate, polyimide, polycycloolefin, norbornene resin, or polychlorotrifluoroethylene. Such a film-shaped plastic substrate is preferably provided with one or more additional layers such as an insulating layer (if the insulation is insufficient), a gas-barrier layer for preventing penetration of moisture and oxygen through the substrate, or an undercoat layer for enhancing the planarity of the film-shaped plastic substrate and\/or improving adhesiveness of the film-shaped plastic substrate to the electrodes and the insulating layer.","The thickness of the flexible substrate is preferably from 50 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm. This is because, when the thickness of the flexible substrate is less than 50 \u03bcm, it is hard for the substrate to maintain sufficient planarity itself, whereas when the flexible substrate is thicker than 500 \u03bcm, it is difficult to bend the substrate itself freely, i.e., the flexibility of the substrate is insufficient.","8) Structure","Next, the structure of the TFT of the invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","3","4","7","7","5","1","5","2","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["11","11","12","13","14","17","14","15","1","15","2","17","14","17","14","16","17","15","1","15","2","17","15","1","15","2","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["22","23","24","21","24","25","1","25","2","26","24","24","25","1","25","2","25","1","25","2","24","25","1","25","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","700","200","600","500","400","800"]},"The thin film field effect transistor of the invention is preferably used for an image display with a liquid crystal or EL element incorporated therein, and particularly for a flat panel display (FPD).

At a portion corresponding to a terminal on the source electrode, the resin layer was removed using a photolithography method, whereby an opening for a terminal was provided.","Thereby, TFT elements 1 to 4 according to the invention, which had an inverted staggered structure with a channel length (L) of 200 \u03bcm and a channel width (W) of 1,000 \u03bcm, were prepared.","2) Preparation of Comparative TFT Element A","A comparative TFT element A was prepared in the same manner as the preparation of the TFT element 1, except that the electric resistance layer was not formed and the thickness of the active layer was changed to 50 nm.","3) Preparation of Comparative TFT Element B","A comparative TFT element B was prepared in the same manner as the preparation of the TFT element 1, except that the electric resistance layer was not formed, the thickness of the active layer was changed to 50 nm, and further, the protective layer was not formed.","For each of the obtained TFT elements, TFT transfer characteristics was measured at a drain voltage Vd of +40 V, which is in a saturation region, and a gate voltage Vg changed within a range of \u221220 V\u2266Vg\u2266+40 V, assuming that the voltage of the source electrode was 0 V, and performance of the TFT was evaluated. The measurement of the TFT transfer characteristics was performed using a semiconductor parameter analyzer 4156C (manufactured by Agilent Technologies, Inc.).","The TFT performances based on the measurements described above are shown in Table 1 below. As a result, in the comparative TFT element B, moisture influenced on the active layer, and therefore, the OFF current increased to give a low ON\/OFF ratio.","Concerning the comparative TFT element A, the acrylic resin in the protective layer and the active layer directly contacted with each other, so that the acrylic resin was oxidized to reduce the oxide semiconductor in the active layer, resulting in increase in the number of carriers in the oxide semiconductor, and a phenomenon in which the threshold voltage greatly shifted. In the TFT elements 1 to 4 according to Example 1 of the present invention, the electric resistance layer prevented the redox reaction between the acrylic resin and the active layer, and the threshold voltage did not shift greatly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0297","num":"0296"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE
