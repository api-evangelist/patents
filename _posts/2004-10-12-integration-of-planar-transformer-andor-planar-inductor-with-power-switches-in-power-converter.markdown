Description of the Related Art","Power modules are typically self-contained units that transform and\/or condition power from one or more power sources for supplying power to one or more loads. Power modules commonly referred to as \u201cinverters\u201d transform direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC), for use in supplying power to an AC load. Power modules commonly referred to as \u201crectifiers\u201d transform AC to DC. Power modules commonly referred to as \u201cDC\/DC converters\u201d step up or step down a DC voltage. An appropriately configured and operated power module may perform any one or more of these functions.

The first and second phase legs , of the inverter  are phase shift controlled to generate a three-level square waveform Uapplied to the first side or winding Tof the first transformer T. The second leg and third leg of the inverter  are phase shifted controlled to generate a three-level square wave form Uto the first side or winding Tof the second transformer T. Thus, phase B is shared by the transformers T, T to form the equivalent of two conventional full bridge DC\/DC converters, while advantageously saving one high voltage leg (i.e., at least two power semiconductor switches and associated power semiconductor diodes) and gate driver circuit.","The two outputs Uand Uare phase locked to each other, so that the second phase leg (phase B) can achieve a wide soft-switching range by means of the load current in the transformers T. The soft switching is achieve by the energy stored in the filter inductors L-L, without relying on the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the transformers T. The output voltage Vout is regulated by a phase shift angle \u03c6, and the output voltage Vout is regulated by a phase shift angle \u03c6","The power converter  can be configured as either single output or dual output. In single output configuration, the outputs Vout and Vout are paralleled together to double the output current\/power. If Vout and Vout are paralleled together in a single output voltage configuration, the phase shift angles \u03c6, \u03c6are equal. In the dual output configuration Vout and Vout may be controlled independently.","The interleaved full bridge DC\/DC power converter  described above doubles output power capability while operating at a high coolant temperature (e.g., 105\u00b0 C.) and maintaining current and thermal stress at acceptable levels to provide high reliability. Soft switching is achieved over a wide range of loads, reducing switching losses and providing high efficiency operation by means of the load currents in the transformers T, T and filter inductors L-L. Thus, the described power converter may efficiently provide high power conversion, with high power density and high coolant temperature. The interleaving also advantageously reduces high frequency ripple current to the input and output capacitors CI, CO, CO. Sharing of a phase leg -of the inverter  allows the use of one less inverter phase leg (i.e., at least two power semiconductor switches and associated diodes) than would typically be required, reducing parts count, complexity, and cost while increasing reliability. The power converter  is further easily configurable as either a single or dual output unit.","The integration of planar transformers and\/or planar inductors in the power converter  described above, avoids or reduces the use of conventional air-cooled heavy copper printed circuit board windings and traditional wound wire inductors. The integration of planar transformers and\/or planar inductors may allow a reduction in Ohmic losses and inductance related to contacts, which are particularly problematic at high frequencies, by employing direct wire bonding connections as described above. Leakage inductance and AC loss may be reduced by employing the flat winding structure of the planar transformers T, T and\/or the planar inductors L, L, L, and L. The use of planar transformers and\/or planar inductors in the described power converter  may advantageously allow an increase in the magnetic core window utilization ratio, a reduction in the magnetic core value, and an increase in power density. The power converter  described above may also provide enhanced EMI performance.","Although specific embodiments of and examples for the power converter and method are described herein for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as will be recognized by those skilled in the relevant art. The teachings provided herein can be applied to power converters, not necessarily the DC\/DC interleaved power converter with planar transformers or planar inductors generally described above.","For example, the power converter  may share the first or third phase legs , , rather than the second phase leg . Also for example, the teachings are not limited to a three phase inverter , but may be applied to inverters with an even greater number of phase legs, for example, to provide even high power. For example, the power converter  may comprise a fourth phase leg added to the inverter , and a third transformer electrically coupled between the third phase leg and the added phase leg. The power converter may also comprise two filter inductors, along with adding power semiconductor switches and associated diodes to the rectifier which are supplied from the second side of the third transformer to provide a power increase of 50%. Also for example, synchronized rectification is optional, and may be omitted in some embodiments, for example being replaced by a diode rectifier. As a further example, the integrated planar transforms or planar inductors may be advantageously employed in other power converters such as inverters and\/or rectifiers. As an even further example, the interleaving may be advantageously employed without the integrated planar transformers or planar inductors.","The various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments.
