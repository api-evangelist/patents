title: Airtight canister lid with flexible seal-breaking bulb
abstract: A canister comprises a vessel defining a volume and an opening having a rim and a lid. The lid comprises a flexible bulb and a conformal outer edge configured to create an airtight vacuum seal with the rim to close the opening. The flexible bulb is configured to release pressure from the vessel and break the airtight vacuum seal in response to compression of the bulb. The lid can be configured to be completely contained within the rim.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to Taiwanese Patent Application No. 096216905, entitled Preserved Canister, filed on Oct. 9, 2007, in the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office, Chinese Patent Application No. 200720177216.0, entitled Preserved Canister with Preserved Lid, filed on Oct. 18, 2007, in the Chinese Patent Office, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.","The present inventive concepts relate to the field of storage containers and canisters, and more particularly to storage containers and canisters having re-sealable lids.","Canisters and other storage containers are in widespread use domestically and commercially, collectively referred to herein individually as a \u201ccanister\u201d or \u201ccontainer\u201d or as \u201ccanisters\u201d or \u201ccontainers\u201d when there is more than one. It is typical for a canister to have a lid or cover that makes it re-sealable. For example, in food applications lids and covers can be used to keep foods fresh. In some applications it is desirable or necessary to have a canister with an airtight lid\u2014particularly, but not exclusively, in food applications.","One example of a lid that can be used with a container is described in U.S. Patent Publication 2006\/032852, entitled Airtight Lid For Container And Method Of Use, published Feb. 16, 2006. This publication describes a lid having a membrane made from a flexible material and having an outer perimeter larger than the rim of the container and a metal enforcement ring for establishing an airtight seal between the membrane and rim of the container. The lid may further comprise an air evacuation passageway having an air collection chamber for extracting air from the container and a valve for allowing air to flow out of the container, but preventing air from entering. The lid can be sealed to a container by pushing the membrane into the container and releasing the membrane to generate a vacuum. Without the enforcement ring the membrane would not form an airtight seal. One disadvantage to this type of lid is that it generally requires two hands to remove the lid, since the container must be steadied and held in place with one hand so the lid edge can be pulled up and away from the edge or rim of the container with the other hand.","Another example of a lid that can be used with a container is described in U.S. Patent Publication 2006\/0151511, entitled Suction Cup Lid, published Jul. 13, 2006. This publication describes a lid made from a flexible material, e.g., silicone, forming a convex or other bulged shape. The lid includes a central handle or knob. When place on an opening of a container, the handle can be pressed downward causing the convex shape to be reduced or converted to a concave shape, while evacuating air from the container to form an airtight seal. The lid is made sufficiently wide so that an edge of the lid extends past the rim of the container. This allows the edge of the lid to be lifted up and away from the container to break the seal and remove the lid. Like the lid above, a disadvantage to this type of lid is that it generally requires two hands to remove the lid, since the container must be steadied and held in place with one hand so the lid edge can be pulled up and away from the edge or rim of the container with the other hand.","Another example of a lid that can be used with a container is described in U.S. Patent Publication 2006\/0169693, entitled Silicone Lid For Sealing Any Type Of Open-Ended Container, published Aug. 3, 2006. This publication describes a lid that can be sealed to a container by placing a bottom of the lid on an open-ended side of the container and depressing the top, forcing air out of the container and forming a vacuum seal. The lid is substantially flat and wider than the opening it is sealing. To remove the lid a protrusion that extends outwardly from an edge of the lid is pulled up and toward the center of the lid to break the vacuum seal\u2014i.e., to open the container. Similar to the lids described above, a disadvantage to this type of lid is that it generally requires two hands to remove the lid, since the container must be steadied and held in place with one hand so the lid can be pulled up and away from the edge or rim of the container with the other hand.","In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, provided is a canister comprising: a vessel defining a volume and an opening having a rim; and a lid comprising a flexible bulb and a conformal outer edge configured to create an airtight seal with the rim to close the opening, wherein the flexible bulb is configured to release pressure from the vessel and break the airtight seal in response to compression of the bulb.","The lid can be configured to evacuate air from the vessel and to create the airtight seal between the conformal outer edge and the rim in response to pressure applied to the lid in the direction of the volume.","The lid can further comprises a pliable top member between the conformal outer edge and flexible bulb.","The lid can comprise rubber.","The lid can comprise silicone.","The vessel can be made from a material comprising at least one of ceramic, acrylic, metal, resin, plastic, wood, stone or glass.","The rim and conformal outer edge can have a circular shape.","The rim and conformal outer edge can have an oval shape.","The rim and conformal outer edge can have a rectangular shape.","The rim and conformal outer edge can have a square shape.","The rim can have a flare shape and the conformal edge can have a corresponding flare shape configured to fit within the rim to make the airtight seal.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, provided is a lid for use with a vessel defining a volume and an opening having a rim. The lid comprises a flexible bulb and a conformal outer edge configured to create an airtight seal with the rim to close the opening, wherein the flexible bulb is configured to release pressure from the vessel and break the airtight seal in response to compression of the bulb.","The lid can be configured to evacuate air from the vessel and to create the airtight seal between the conformal outer edge and the rim in response to pressure applied to the lid in the direction of the volume.","The lid can further comprise a pliable top member between the conformal outer edge and flexible bulb.","The lid can comprise rubber.","The lid can comprise silicone.","The conformal outer edge can have a circular shape.","The conformal outer edge can have an oval shape.","The conformal outer edge can have a rectangular shape.","The conformal outer edge can have a square shape.","The conformal edge can have a flare shape configured to fit within the rim to make the airtight seal.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another, but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example, a first element can be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element can be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention.
