{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The invention relates to geometric puzzles and, more particularly, to geometric puzzles utilizing electronic display devices. This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application 61\/415,968 filed Nov. 22, 2010, which is incorporated by reference herein.","The prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae is a well known puzzle within the art. The operation of the prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,378,116 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,471,959. A general description of the prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae follows. This information can be found on the World Wide Web at http:\/\/www.madehow.com\/Volume-7\/Rubik-s-Cube.html and general information regarding the prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae at http:\/\/www.rubiks.com. The prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae has six sides; each side is divided into nine smaller squares, referred to herein as cubelets. It generally appears to the user that all of the smaller cubelets can be moved; however, the center cubelet on each side actually can not be moved. Only the cubelets used to form the corners and edges can move. This is because the center cubelet on each side is in an attached position to an axis and can only be rotated in place about that axis as shown in .","When a prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae is taken apart it can be seen that the center cubelets are connected to an axle like mechanisms to the inner core, refer to . The corner and edges pieces are not in a fixed position to any particular reference allowing them to move around the center cubelets. The cube maintains its shape because the corner and edge cubelets are held together in place and retained by the center cubelets. See .","Each piece has an internal stem that is retained by the center cubelets and trapped by the surrounding pieces. These stems are shaped to fit along a curved track that is created by the backs of the other pieces. Refer to .","The center cubelets are fixed with a spring and rivet and retain all the surrounding pieces. The spring exerts just the right pressure to hold all the pieces in place while giving enough flexibility for a smooth and forgiving function.","Puzzles such as the prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae have created a lasting impression on numerous users. This type of brain teasing device has become a legend in itself. However, the display characteristics are outdated and the functionality of puzzles like the Rubik's Cube\u00ae has not kept up with modern day technology. Therefore, there remains a need within the art for puzzles that present the attributes commonly associated with modern day devices.","The present invention provides a geometric toy having two or more axes originating from a center core element of the toy. The geometric toy includes cubelets that are rotatable about the axes. The cubelets each include at least one display that allows for the display of preprogrammed images. At least one microprocessor is in communication with the display screens to control the display of images on the display screens. An electrical and data connection means allows for the rotation of the cubelets about the axes while still maintaining constant data and power communication between the microprocessor, the display screens and adjacent cubelets to provide for the continual display of images on the display screen.","In a preferred embodiment, cube  () is a cube shaped device that can be twisted and turned and manipulated in a fashion similar to that of the well known prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae discussed above in the Background section.  are illustrations of the internal workings of a cube . However cube  () differs drastically from a prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae for many reasons. For example, one major difference is that cube  is covered by multiple screens . Each screen  is capable of displaying a predetermined programmed image. The image may be a video image, still image or RGB (Red Green Blue) color pattern. These images can be presented so that the overall picture is a combination of the different images presented on each screen . For example, each screen  on the front side of cube  () shows a small portion of baby's face. When combined, screens  function to show the overall image of the baby's face. In another embodiment, different unrelated images are preferably displayed on each screen . In another preferred embodiment, cube  is preferably programmed to display unrelated images on each side of the cube. For example,  shows cube  displaying a newspaper page on one side, a clock on another side and a stock chart on yet another side.","Cube  is programmable and includes microprocessors and batteries for power. In addition to multiple screens  speakers are included as well. A user is able to twist and turn and otherwise manipulate cube  in a fashion similar to the manner in which a prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae is manipulated. However, the user is also able to view a variety of images from screens . He can view cube  for entertainment (i.e., watch a video or look at pictures) or function (i.e., look at a calendar or an alarm clock). He can play with cube  by manipulating it. Images will be displayed as the cube is manipulated in accordance with programming. For example, in this fashion the user can solve a variety of puzzle types.","In a solved state, cube  has six sides, with each side made up of nine small cubelets each of which having a display indicating they are part of that side (see ). For example,  shows an all blue side, an all yellow side and an all red side. The display included with each cubelet is preferably associated in some manner with a puzzle. Embodiments can be created wherein the cube embodiment is highly programmable or embodiments of limited or no programmability can be created. In a preferred embodiment, digital pictures are formed from each side in either still or video form. The center cubelets are attached to an axle that allows rotation of that center cubelets only as allowed by its manner of attachment to the axle (or core). The cubelets are preferably provided with communication and algorithmic logic (sophisticated software) thereby allowing them to communicate with a \u201cmaster cubelet\u201d (one of the four corner pieces) as well as each other. The communication mechanism is preferably either hard wired or wireless or a combination of both. A cube embodiment, having six sides; similar to a prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae, is preferably provided with an interface to a computational element; As used here, a computational element is preferably either a computer, personal digital assistant (PDA) or other programmable type device (such as a smart phone).","The cubelets are connected (directly or indirectly) to each other by a redundant power and data architecture (see ), allowing for the transmission of algorithmic logic and power simultaneously over the same physical connection medium. For example, custom spring connectors (shown as circles in ) provide the physical layer for the data over power bus architecture. As can be seen each cubelet  has four redundant points of connection . This assures that power and data are always present, regardless of the orientation at any given time.","The master (one of the four corner cubelets) cubelet is provided with special system logic for controlling the displays associated with each \u201cslave cubelet\u201d (the other 25 cubelets in a 26 cubelet cube) and making continuous real-time analysis regarding the state of the cube, such as\n\n","The displays are preferably digital pictures with a different picture on each side. Alternatively, the entire geometrically shaped puzzle is preferably programmed to show a continuous image or series of images. For example, the puzzle is preferably shaped as a sphere or a pyramid and having moving video programmed to show a series of images. A sphere could have the cubelets display a globe of the earth.","The puzzle is preferably provided with a \u201ctime out\u201d setting and goes into sleep mode if the timeout period expires. The puzzle is preferably programmed to show a clock if the timeout period expires or show a different clock on each side while awake. The clock can perform the same functionality as a digital desktop clock, showing the time on a side or go into \u201cscreen saver mode\u201d which will cause a preconfigured banner to rotate around the cube.","The puzzle is preferably provided with sufficient programming logic to play slide shows based on images being cycled every X (where X is user configurable via a custom PC based software suite) seconds around the various sides of the puzzle.","Audio is preferably provided that is preferably associated with a given display, slide show or video clips. Audio is preferably played via the internal speakers or if \u201cdocked\u201d can be directed to the external \u201cdock\u201d speakers.","Providing a digitized puzzle allows the puzzle to digitally scramble or unscramble itself. Scrambling and\/or unscrambling is preferably detected by \u201cgesture movements\u2019, such as shaking the cube. Gesture movements are common place in modern day electronics, such as the iPhone\u2122, which uses internal accelerometers and gyroscopes which can measure both direction and force and be made to respond accordingly through software.","The puzzle is preferably made to be wireless and stream digital data to other devices, via various modern-day physical electronics, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, or Wifi.","The puzzle cubelets are preferably constructed with electronics that have Processing device(s) (such as a Central Processing Unit (CPU), Digital Signal Processor (DSP), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or microcontroller) and which are responsible for running sophisticated software algorithms used to control the images to be displayed by the cubelets as well as executing continuous real-time analysis of various \u201csystem events or states\u201d as noted above. Binary images are preferably downloaded to the cubelets of the geometrically shaped puzzle and stored in a local memory. This is done via the \u201csynching\u201d operation previously referenced. Synching is accomplished when docked or is preferably accomplished through wireless means, such as using Bluetooth, Wifi, etc. The images (or sound or any other digital data) will be displayed according to the currently selected \u201cprofile\u201d, which is preferably changed at any time by the user using the \u201cpress and rotate\u201d system feature (detected by accelerometers and\/or gyroscopic electronics). Cube profiles are \u201csynched\u201d (synchronized) to the cube when the user \u201cdocks\u201d the cube and performs as \u201csync\u201d operation with the computational element.","Various algorithms are envisioned in accordance with varying embodiments that can provide for system functionality as shown by the following examples.","An algorithm is preferably used to establish connections (wired or wireless) with a host (such as a computer or PDA).","Another algorithm is preferably used to transfer data to and from the cubelets. Another algorithm can control the display of images on the cubelets.","Various algorithms are preferably derived for scrambling images, de-scrambling images, providing slide show or video functionality, and to provide audio functionality.","A PIN code is preferably provided to lock or unlock the functionalities provided by the puzzle.","A dock  is preferably provided for cube  through which it can charge its internal batteries as well as synchronize itself with the host computing device ().  shows another preferred embodiment of a docking station ","The geometric shape can also be used as display device and not a puzzle. The shape can provide images and\/or independent \u201cwidget\u201d (a small software program designed to implement a single function, such as displaying weather, or displaying stock ticker symbols, etc.) on each side.","These and other aspects, features and advantages of which the invention is capable of, will be apparent and elucidated from the following description of embodiments of the present invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 8","FIG. 8B","FIG. 6"],"b":["15","20","25","15","25","10","10","35","35","15","35","12","12","15","25","20","232","10","15","20"]},"Each cubelet (, , ) preferably includes the following items.

In a preferred embodiment, each cubelet ,  and  includes its own microprocessor (see ). Alternatively, cube  includes just one microprocessor housed inside one of the cubelets ,  or . The one microprocessor is in constant communication with all cubelets ,  and  via connectors  and is able to therefore control the images displayed on all display screens .","Attached to the core  are six center cubelets  (). Each of the armatures  has a longitudinal axis with a core attachment mechanism . The attachment mechanisms , allow the center cubelets  to be held in an attached position at a fixed distance from the core and allow for each of the center cubelets  to be rotated in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the armature . It should be noted that the attachment mechanism can allow for the rotation of the center cubelets  relative to core . In a cube embodiment as shown in , there would be six center cubelets . Only five are shown for the sake of illustration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIG. 12"],"b":["15","16","129","15","20","25","20","25","22","35","15","20","25","10"]},"Connectors  and contact plates  are shown more clearly in .

Each piece can have an internal stem which allows the assembly and proper form retention of the center , corner  and edge  pieces to the core or hub\u2014. These tabs are preferably shaped to fit a curved internal surface track  defined by the backs of the center cubelet , corner cubelet  and edge cubelet  as shown in . The center cubelets  are preferably fixed with a spring force and a retention mechanism to retain surrounding slave corner  and edge  cubelets. The spring force exerts pressure to hold the pieces to cube  in place while allowing sufficient flexibility for rotation of each side  with a smooth and forgiving function while always maintaining redundant electrical connection in the system utilizing connectors  as described above.","Cube  illustrated in  retains the original functionality of the original prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae with the various enhancements that provide a modern puzzle. Cube  contains nine screens  on each of its six sides (). The screens  are connected to core  either directly of indirectly by conductive elements within the armatures  that are used to form an axis bus (). Each of the center cubelets  and slave cubelets  and  have sufficient display electronics to display an image on screens . There are numerous embodiments that can be created. The images displayed on screens  are preferably a series Red, Green, Blue (RGB) light intensities, still images used to form a larger image on each side  of cube  or full motion video. Each screen , forming 1\/9 of the still image or video (). Hence each of the images on a side  can be used to provide the puzzle similar to that of a prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae but instead of a single color on a side being used to form the puzzle to be solved a larger image on each side  is created form a series of smaller images or image fragments.","In preferred embodiments the images that are placed on the screens  are dynamic and configurable. The images are preferably changed through sophisticated electronics, internal gyroscopes and accelerometers, that can sense the X,Y,Z axis movement in which cube  is being held in three-dimensional space. The combination of these sophisticated electronics and equally sophisticated software algorithms can detect motion-sensitive gestures and respond accordingly through sophisticated software algorithms thus configuring itself and changing itself in real-time based on user generated gestures. The images, video, state or function of cube , for example, are preferably made to change dynamically through various hand gestures. One such example is that cube  is in the sate of a traditional prior art Rubik's\u00ae cube, with the traditional six colors on each face of the puzzle (White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Blue Green) and then, by pressing a center cubelet, , (one of the six center pieces) and performing a gesture in three-dimensional space (i.e. three quick clock-wise gestures), the puzzle will change \u201cmodes\u201d from puzzle to \u201cpicture frame mode\u201d. Showing full images on each of the six sides and cycling through a series of images held in the puzzle's internal non-volatile memory at a user or system pre-configured interval. Hence, cube  has the ability to be a 360-degree picture frame, in addition to all the other sophisticated modes of operations that are detailed herewith.","Cube  is preferably enabled to interface with a computer or other processing device that will provide data for the screens . The interface is preferably a port (i.e. USB port) built into cube  or the interface may be a wireless interface built into cube  (i.e. Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). Digital photographs and video images may be displayed on the sides ().","Cube  is preferably provided with a \u201ctime out\u201d setting that will cause the system to go into \u201csleep mode\u201d if the timeout expires wherein either; the screens  turn off, or alternatively, the screens  begin a predetermined display mode, either displaying still images or a predetermined video. Cube  is preferably programmed to go into a \u201cclock mode\u201d if the time out expires wherein the system can perform the same functionality as a digital desktop clock. In a clock mode the sides  can show the same clock image or various clock images may be shown on different sides  (displaying different time zones; California, Paris, New York, Berlin etc., for example). Cube  is preferably provided with a \u201cscreen saver mode\u201d causing a preconfigured banner to rotate around cube . (for example a rotating banner, \u201cAlexia's iToy\u201d . . . ). Cube  can play \u201cslide shows\u201d based on images being cycled within a predetermined amount of time for the sides .","Cube  is preferably provided with audio and particular audio may be provided for a given image display. For example, if the screen saver or banner was a seascape then the audio could be the sound of waves and seagulls. If the screen saver were a photo slide show profile, the audio could be voices associated with the photos. The audio could accompany video clips on the sides  of cube .","Cube  can function as a puzzle similar to a prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae. Each of the sides  presents an image that is preselected either through an automated process or by the user. One of many advantages over the traditional prior art Rubik's Cube\u00ae device is that the number of puzzles (a minimum of 256) is configurable and selectable by the user. Additionally, cube  has the ability to digitally scramble or unscramble itself upon command\u2014through user gestures in three-dimensional space. Thus, the scrambling may be associated with a level of complexity that is preferably readily controlled through scramble algorithms that may be applied to color or image profiles. The exact same level of scrambling is preferably tried by different users\u2014by applying the exact same scramble algorithm (which resides in cube , internal non-volatile memory) to the exact same image profile. The puzzle is preferably \u2018instructed\u2019 to unscramble itself, again through user gestures in three-dimensional space, thereby reprogramming the cubelets , and  to display the image associated with its corresponding side .","Cube  is preferably provided with the ability to wirelessly stream the data to other devices or to wirelessly receive data from other devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["10","15","20","25","20","25","15","20","25","10","10","10"]},"For example,  shows center cubelet .

This interface can serve multiple purposes including: transferring data from a computational element to cube  using \u201csynching\u201d or handshaking techniques. Embodiments can support standard plug-n-play functionality know within the computer arts.

An application programming interface (API) is preferably made available to third party developers. An open architecture allows third party developers to develop software plug-ins for cube  that can provide extended capabilities, such as transition effects for slide show images or different screen savers.","In an embodiment, a process will provide that third party candidates enter into a contractual obligation with parties owning the intellectual property to cube  or responsible for marketing cube . A certification division is preferably created that will certify that plug-in conform to required best practices design and implementation guidelines and in no way makes cube  unstable. Once certification is obtained, the plug-in will be posted on the internet where it is preferably downloaded and installed into cube . This process can include free plug-in modules or various fee arrangements for plug-in modules. A plug-in module is preferably downloaded for a one time fee, a specific number of uses or for a predetermined time period. Various embodiments can provide models that allow third party developers to develop plug-ins.","Another embodiment will have cube  contain software that can load the plug-ins into cube . The software is preferably open source, free software or proprietary software. Cube  software will synchronize with a computational element to enable cube  to download the plug-ins. The software is preferably used to form part of cube  that will be recognizable to the computational element within a plug and play environment or a portion of the proprietary software is preferably installed on the computational element. Data can then be placed within cube  for substantially any digital format including: images; video; audio (mp3, way files etc.) or generally any type of multimedia. This data is preferably stored in cube 's internal non-volatile memory. The data connection transferring data may be wired, for example USB, Ethernet or wireless, for example Bluetooth, ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) or any of the various versions of IEEE 802.xx, for example. The functionality of cube  should remain the same regardless of the type of transfer mechanism that is employed to move data to-from cube  and the computational element.","Another embodiment provides cube  with the capability to organize the digital media. Cube  is preferably provided with a sophisticated Graphical User Interface (GUI) (hosted on the computational element) allowing the user to organize the digital media contained within cube . Images\/photos, video and audio are preferably arranged by persons in general or restricted to those that have administrator privileges such as a password or PIN number. Screens  are preferably provided with touch sensitivity to control the GUI for cube  or other control mechanisms are preferably applied to control the GUI such as control by the computation element, docking station or an input for a control device such as a Infrared (IR) remote control, wireless keyboard or a mouse, etc. Further embodiments can have the GUI for cube  controlled by the computational device itself.","Embodiments for the computational element resident graphical user interface (GUI) used for cube  can employ \u201cTabs\u201d to access each logical group.  show computer monitor screen printouts of preferred GUI screens with which a user can interface with to control cube .","Images can be selected and placed into folders, selected from folders or entire folders are preferably selected. Folders, hard drives or other storage media are preferably scanned for image formats (.bmp, jpg, tiff, jpeg200 etc.). Folders are preferably placed within a computational element and selected while cube  is interfacing with the computational element. In another preferred embodiment cube  is provided with a storage device or sufficient memory and the folders are preferably placed within cube  itself. Once selected, files or folders are preferably operated on or transferred. Multimedia files that are transferred to cube  may undergo a reformatting (transcoding) process to optimize these files for use with cube .

Cube  could be programmed according to various embodiments to provide settings for sleep or timeouts periods. For example, cube  can go into sleep mode if not in use for 5 minutes. The sleep mode is preferably intended to conserve power, or change to \u201cclock mode\u201d or turn on screen saver mode.","In another embodiment, cube  is preferably programmed to provide a startup banner upon being turned on. For example, cube  can display a startup banner that is user configurable reading \u201cAlexia's Cube\u201d or \u201cAntonio's Cube\u201d, etc. The banner can rotate around the sides  until a predetermined time, such as once cube  has fully booted (ready for user interaction). The banner could also be displayed if cube  goes into a screen saver mode, similar to a Windows\u00ae based PC once a screen saver is active. The banner within an embodiment, however, is preferably displayed on all sides  in three dimensional mode if so desired.","As previously described, cube  in a cube shaped embodiment can function as a Rubik's Cube\u00ae. The sides  have screens  that are dynamic and configurable by the user. The user via cube  software preferably selects digital images for a puzzle that will be displayed on the sides  for the currently active puzzle. The user can select the puzzle by interacting with cube . In one particular embodiment, cube  is preferably activated using an accelerometer to detect if cube  has been moved.","Each side  of the cube embodiment for cube  is preferably thought of as a monitor similar that found on modern day laptops or flat panel displays (or cellular phones). The difference being that the manner of display of the monitor has been altered. By dividing the monitor into 3\u00d73 cubelets, the pixel resolution of the monitor formed on a side  will be the three times the resolution of any individual cell. Thus, if each center cubelet  and edge cubelet  or corner cubelet  was to a have a resolution of 341\u00d7256 pixels, the entire monitor formed on a side  could be viewed as the sum having a total resolution 1024\u00d7768 pixels.","Alternatively, the monitor formed on a side  could be made up of a mini-LCD or OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) displays made up of many pixels in a common format, such as 160\u00d7160 pixels. These types of displays are currently in common use. Thus the resulting monitor would have a resolution of 480\u00d7480 and images or videos could be converted to fit within this resolution.","As previously discussed above, as seen in  sophisticated electronics are housed in each cubelet: center , edge  and corner . The cubelets contain various electronic elements such as a processing element and a communication mechanism. The communication mechanism can have a two fold purpose. The first purpose would be to send or receive data to\/from the cubelets. This data would typically be some type of multimedia data such as audio, video, images or a combination thereof. The second purpose would be to ensure that cube  receives the power to display on the cubelet face or in the case of any nine cubelets on a given side, to display the data for the face of the cube.","As previously discussed, the processing element can range from a relatively simple microcontroller to a rather sophisticated microprocessor. The term processing element as used herein broadly refers to any device that can provide the functionality for cube . This could be a microprocessor, a microcontroller, an (application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), filed programmable gate array (FPGA), digital signal processor (DSP) or other technology that can perform the functionality required by cube .","The master (preferably one of the four corner cubelets) cubelet is responsible for performing all the operations required for interfacing various parts of cube , such as continuously querying all slave pieces for their current status, in terms of proper electronic functionality as well as system state (i.e. is the cube in a solved state, is the battery level low, etc.).","In an embodiment as shown in , the armatures  mechanically connect the center cubelets  to the core . Connector springs  (), form the redundant data and power distribution bus. Bus is a common term in the industry and defines a connection mechanism through which data or power is imparted to other parts of cube . This bus is referred to herein as the data over power (DoP) bus and provides both the electrical and data connection necessary to interface all cubelets , ,  to cube . The DoP bus is comprised of custom spring connectors , which are designed with a curved \u201chead\u201d allowing the cubelets (,,) to easily rotate or roll over the plastic surface of the outer cubelet walls. The spring connectors  are soldered in place to the connector plates  () and protrude through openings in the cubelet walls as discussed earlier. The electronics are installed within the individual cubelets , and  as shown in .","As shown in , the inside cavity of every edge piece  preferably holds a battery . There are twelve edge pieces (in a \u201ccube\u201d embodiment example) in cube , thus twelve rechargeable batteries provide redundant power paths to cube . Also, as shown in , corner piece  preferably includes an accelerometer and a speaker (not shown).","As shown in , there are custom spring connectors protruding from all four sides of every center and edge cubelets (, ) and from each of three sides for corner , cubelets. This assures a constant and redundant data and power connection at all times throughout cube , regardless of the orientation of any face at any given time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":"10"},"Different geometric shapes could possibly have more or fewer cubelets. While an embodiment of a \u201ccube\u201d (3\u00d73\u00d73) allow users to identify cube , with the well know Rubik's Cube\u00ae and provide an enjoyable puzzle, puzzles can also be made out of other three dimensional geometric shapes. For example, instead of a cube shape, the system could be shaped as a pyramid and the puzzle could still be played by rotating pieces about three axes.","Various pyramid embodiments could be implemented. One type of pyramid embodiment could function as a display. In a display embodiment the pyramid could display images or video and these images could be visible from multiple sides. In another embodiment, the pyramid shape could be formed into sections that could be rotated to form a puzzle similar to a Rubik's Cube\u00ae. Section could be made to rotate about multiple axes. Further embodiments could be made to rotate about three axes.","Embodiments are possible that can have greater or fewer than six faces. In a preferred embodiment, there are fewer faces by reducing the number of rotational axes or by simply using fewer cubelets and employing an addressing\/connection scheme for the remaining cubelets to receive power and data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 14"],"b":["987","987"]},"A power source for the system may be located in any cubelet. An embodiment as shown in  depicts battery  located in edge cubelet .","The cubelet internals housed on PCB  preferably includes various peripheral electronics such as but are not limited to: USB, firewire; Bluetooth; Zigbee cores, accelerometers; touch sensitive interfaces; cellular or other type of interface. The selection of the interfaces to be used in any given system is a design choice that can vary according to different embodiments of cube .","The DoP bus provides the transport mechanisms for data and power between the cubelets via the custom spring connectors () protruding from each of the four sides of the center cubelet  as shown in  For the sake of clarity only five of the six center cubelets  are shown in . It should be noted that every cubelet has a similar redundant DoP bus architecture. Edge cubelets , likewise have four redundant DoP connections and the corner cubelets  have three redundant DOP bus connection points.","Through this redundant DoP bus architecture algorithm logic, command\/control\/query and other system status and event information is communicated through cube  as depicted in .","In order to interact with the configurable capabilities of cube , embodiments of cube  are preferably designed with touch and motion sensitive technology, similar to those found in today's iPhone\u2122 (i.e. touch sensitive screen, motion sensitive via accelerometer technology etc.)","Cube  is preferably provided with touch\/motion sensitive interfaces that allows the user to access Administrator capabilities. This allows the user to Enter PIN code to lock\/unlock or enter Administrator mode on cube . Once in Administrator mode the user has the ability to configure elements, turn cube  on or off, select new puzzles, select a slide show to play, associated music themes, descramble a current puzzle on cube , select music lists to play or turn wireless capability on\/or off, for example.","A key feature of cube  is that electrical and data connectivity is maintained even after cube  has been manipulated by the user. In the above paragraphs it was described in detail how a preferred cube  is constructed. As shown in , custom spring connectors allow for electricity and data to flow even as the cube has been manipulated.","For example, to understand the data and electrical connectivity, it is useful to consider cubelet shown in .","In , cubelet has connectivity with cubelets , and ","In , the user has turned the top row of cubelet clockwise. Cubelet has connectivity with cubelets and ","In , the clockwise turn is complete. Cubelet  has connectivity with cubelets ,  and .","In , the user has rotated the leftmost column forward.

Images may be displayed on screens  regardless of how the user may manipulate cube .","Embodiments using differing geometric shapes are envisioned. One embodiment could employ a cube shape and mechanically function much like a Rubik's Cube\u00ae except that electronics are preferably included for managing complex algorithmic analysis as well as managing the display associated with each side (or face) and with each cubelets of any given side. Another embodiment could form a pyramid like shape. Still other embodiments can employ geometric shape with eight or sixteen sides as in a sphere embodiment, for example.","Although the above-preferred embodiments have been described with specificity, persons skilled in this art will recognize that many changes to the specific embodiments disclosed above could be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
