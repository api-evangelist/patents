title: Optically transduced MEMS magnetometer
abstract: MEMS magnetometers with optically transduced resonator displacement are described herein. Improved sensitivity, crosstalk reduction, and extended dynamic range may be achieved with devices including a deflectable resonator suspended from the support, a first grating extending from the support and disposed over the resonator, a pair of drive electrodes to drive an alternating current through the resonator, and a second grating in the resonator overlapping the first grating to form a multi-layer grating having apertures that vary dimensionally in response to deflection occurring as the resonator mechanically resonates in a plane parallel to the first grating in the presence of a magnetic field as a function of the Lorentz force resulting from the alternating current. A plurality of such multi-layer gratings may be disposed across a length of the resonator to provide greater dynamic range and/or accommodate fabrication tolerances.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention were developed under Contract No. DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/325,683, entitled OPTICALLY TRANSDUCED MEMS GYRO DEVICE, to Nielson, et al., filed even date herewith, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","The present invention generally relates to Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) sensors, and more particularly to Lorentz force magnetometers.","Many conventional MEMS force and inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, magnetometers, and magnetometers, etc. include a pair of drive electrodes to which an alternating current (AC) is applied to induce a mechanical resonance in a suspended member.","In Lorentz force magnetometers, the alternating current is of a frequency tuned to induce mechanical deformation of the suspended member in a desired resonance mode by passing current through the suspended resonator so that, in the presence of a magnetic field, Lorentz forces form in the resonator inducing the resonator to mechanically deform. A number of techniques have been applied to sense the extent of deformation induced by the Lorentz forces and thereby measure the magnetic field strength. For example, deformation of the resonator is often sensed by capacitive coupling between resonator and the support, as measured by either primary drive electrodes or secondary sensing electrodes. Piezoelectric techniques have also been utilized, for example, by sensing mechanical deformation of the resonator with a piezoelectric material embedded in a resonator.","However, the conventional sensing techniques suffer from cross-talk and inherent sensitivity and other limitations. Both capacitive and piezoelectric techniques may also lack dynamic range such that many separate devices are required to conduct field measurements within different magnetic environments or where field strength varies widely and\/or rapidly over time. Accordingly, there remains a need for MEMS Lorentz magnetometers that are more sensitive and\/or have greater dynamic range.","Embodiments of the present invention include MEMS magnetometers with optically transduced resonator displacement. Improved sensitivity, crosstalk reduction, and extended dynamic range may be achieved with devices having a deflectable resonator suspended from a support, a first grating extending from the support and disposed over the resonator, a pair of drive electrodes to pass an alternating current through the resonator, and a second grating in the resonator overlapping the first grating to form a multi-layer grating having apertures that vary dimensionally in response to deflection occurring as the resonator mechanically resonates in a plane parallel to the first grating in the presence of a magnetic field as a function of the Lorentz force.","In embodiments, a plurality of multi-layer gratings may be disposed across a length of the resonator to provide greater dynamic range and\/or accommodate fabrication tolerances. In certain embodiments, phase between first and second gratings of each multi-layer grating in the plurality is varied to account for fabrication variation and ensure at least one multi-layer grating provides a threshold level of light intensity modulation with resonator displacement. In certain other embodiments, multi-layer gratings are disposed at locations of the resonator which experience different degrees of deflection, enabling a large dynamic range of magnetic field strength to be optically transduced via light intensity modulation satisfying predetermined threshold criteria.","In embodiments, a resonator has a bulk substrate thickness substantially equal to that of the support for increased dimensional mass, increased out-of-plane rigidity, and increased conductive cross-section at anchor points. In certain such embodiments, separate crystalline layers of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate are electrically connected with conductive vias through the insulator layer to form conductive anchors through an entire thickness of the support substrate.","In embodiments, methods of sensing a magnetic field include placing embodiments of the MEMS magnetometer described herein in a magnetic field and measuring the amplitude, or another displacement characteristic of resonance induced in the resonator, in response to the Lorentz effect of alternating current tuned to a resonant frequency of the resonator passing through the resonator. In certain such embodiments, light sources interrogate the multi-level gratings with a wavelength of light that is greater than grating feature dimensions (e.g., spaces or line elements) and intensity modulation of zeroth orders reflected or transmitted through the grating are sensed with a photosensitive device. Intensity variations are output for determination of magnetic field strength.","In the following description of optically transduced MEMS magnetometers, numerous details are set forth, however, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known methods and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, to avoid obscuring the present invention. Reference throughout this specification to \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, function, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrase \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, functions, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For example, a first embodiment may be combined with a second embodiment anywhere the two embodiments are not mutually exclusive.","The terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected,\u201d along with their derivatives, may be used herein to describe structural relationships between components. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. Rather, in particular embodiments, \u201cconnected\u201d may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. \u201cCoupled\u201d my be used to indicated that two or more elements are in either direct or indirect (with other intervening elements between them) physical or electrical contact with each other, and\/or that the two or more elements co-operate or interact with each other (e.g., as in a cause an effect relationship).","The terms \u201cover,\u201d \u201cunder,\u201d \u201cbetween,\u201d and \u201con\u201d as used herein refer to a relative position of one material layer with respect to other layers. As such, for example, one layer disposed over or under another layer may be directly in contact with the other layer or may have one or more intervening layers. Moreover, one layer disposed between two layers may be directly in contact with the two layers or may have one or more intervening layers. In contrast, a first layer \u201con\u201d a second layer is in contact with that second layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1C and 1D","FIG. 1A"],"b":"100"},"As illustrated in , the MEMS magnetometer  includes at least one deformable diffractive optical structure (e.g., a multi-layer grating A) disposed on a top side (or alternatively a bottom side) of the MEMS magnetometer  for optical domain transduction of the resonator displacement. Transduction in the optical domain enables greater sensitivity than conventional techniques and also enables the resonator to be bulk machined which enables the MEMS magnetometer  to be fabricated simultaneously with the bulk micromachined gyroscope described in the above referenced U.S. Patent Application, entitled OPTICALLY TRANSDUCED MEMS GYRO DEVICE, to Nielson, et al. A multi-axis inertial sensor of superior performance may be provided with both inertial and magnetic sensing functions provided by multiple such optically transduced MEMS devices monolithically integrated on a same substrate. As such, in certain advantageous embodiments, one or more of the MEMS magnetometers described herein are provided in combination with one or more bulk micromachined gyroscopes. Of further advantage, the crosstalk present when Lorentz force drive and capacitive or other electrical sensing is used together is not present when optical displacement sensing resulting from the deformable diffractive optical structures is used.","In embodiments, a MEMS magnetometer includes a support and at least one resonator suspended from the support. Examples of more than one resonator include a tuning fork magnetometer. It is understood that based on the illustrative single resonator embodiments provided herein, one of skill in the art may readily adapt a conventional thin film tuning fork magnetometer design, or other multi-mass magnetometer known in the art, to incorporate one or more of the techniques described herein, such as optical domain transduction, bulk machining, etc.","In the exemplary embodiment depicted in , the support  forms a frame completely surrounding a resonator . As further shown in , both the support  and the resonator  have at least a bulk substrate thickness, T. As such, the resonator  and the support  have substantially the same thickness with minor thickness differences between the two arising from differences in the thin film processing over the substrate  for one or the other of the resonator  and the support . For example, one or more layers of thin film materials such as silicon dioxide, polysilicon, silicon nitride, electrode metallization, etc. utilized in the fabrication of the MEMS magnetometer  may be present to differing extents between the support  and the resonator .","Generally, the bulk substrate thickness, T may vary depending on convention for the material selected for the substrate  (). While, the substrate  may generally be any material suitable for semiconductor device fabrication, in advantageous embodiments a bulk substrate composed of a poly or single crystalline material such as, but is not limited to, silicon, germanium, silicon-germanium, or a III-V compound semiconductor material is utilized. In embodiments, the substrate  has conductivity sufficient for a voltage applied for drive of the resonator to pass through the entire bulk substrate thickness T without detrimental voltage drop. For example, impurity doped substrates may be utilized, as known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate  is a semiconductor (silicon) on insulator (SOI) substrate having a buried insulator layer  (e.g., silicon dioxide) spanning the entire area of the substrate , as known in the art. For such embodiments, the bulk substrate thickness T includes both a base semiconductor substrate portion A disposed below the buried insulator layer , and also an overlying semiconductor substrate portion B. Generally, the bulk substrate thickness, T is to be at least 500 \u03bcm. In a preferred embodiment where the substrate material is silicon (e.g., a single crystal silicon wafer), the bulk substrate thickness, T will be approximately 700 \u03bcm (i.e. between about 650 \u03bcm and about 750 \u03bcm).","As further shown in , delineation of the resonator  from the support  is by the trench  that is nearly continuous with the only discontinuities occurring at anchor points (e.g., anchors A and B). As further shown in , the trench  has a lateral gap dimension, G, defining the critical dimension and aspect ratio of the trench . As the trench  passes completely through the substrate , the trench  is at least 500 \u03bcm deep (e.g., as measured from a bottom side of the substrate ) and approximately 700 \u03bcm deep for the exemplary silicon substrate embodiments. Because the lateral gap dimension, G, does not limit device displacement transduction sensitivity, the dimension may be whatever is sufficient for the amount of resonator displacement induced during resonance and\/or otherwise needed for a given deep trench etch process. Generally, the lateral gap dimension, G, is microns wide. In exemplary silicon substrate embodiments, the lateral gap dimension, G, is between 20 \u03bcm and 60 \u03bcm for an aspect ratio between about 20:1 and 30:1, which is readily attainable using conventional anisotropic silicon etching techniques known in the art.","While a resonator may generally have any shape, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the resonator  is a beam having a longitudinal beam length extending along a first dimension (e.g., x-dimension in ). The bulk substrate thickness, T, is therefore orthogonal to the longitudinal beam length, extending out-of-plane (e.g., in the z-dimension) and a transverse beam length is along the y-dimension. As such, the trench  defines faces of the resonator which extend in the z-dimension through the bulk substrate thickness. Separated from the resonator face A by the trench  are opposing support faces B and C which each form a portion of electrically independent drive electrodes A, B. The drive electrodes A, B are isolated from surrounding regions of the support  by isolation  wrapping around the MEMS magnetometer  and are to be powered by an AC signal applied via pads A, B, respectively. Each of the two anchor points A and B are electrically coupled to the corresponding ones of the electrodes A, B and conduct current to opposite end portions of the resonator . For the preferred SOI embodiments, current conduction through the anchor points A, B is provided across the entire bulk substrate thickness T with conductive vias  passing through the buried insulator layer  to electrically couple the base semiconductor substrate portion A with the overlying semiconductor substrate portion B, as shown in .","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the first and second electrically independent support faces B and C diverge at a center of the resonator  (separated by isolation ) and wrap continuously around the anchors A and B converge back at a center of the resonator on an opposite side of the resonator  (again separated from each other by isolation ). With the electrodes A, B contacting both legs of each anchor A and B, current is spread across all four anchor legs. The legs of anchor A and B are ideally located in the vicinity of the nodal point of the desired resonant mode to reduce energy losses in the desired resonant mode of the mechanical resonator.","As further illustrated in , the resonator , as attached to the support  at two anchor points, is to deflect along the longitudinal axis relative to the support  in response to an AC signal imparted by the drive electrodes A and B in the presence of a magnetic field. In the exemplary embodiment, the resonator  is to oscillate in the plane of the support  only (i.e., in an x-y plane) with oscillation modes out of the x-y plane (i.e., in the z-dimension) suppressed by the anchors A, B having a bulk thickness T (e.g., 700 \u03bcm) which is many times a critical dimension of the anchor in the x-dimension of approximately 50 \u03bcm. Further the resonant beam has an aspect ratio such that its thickness in the z-dimension is thicker than its width in the y-dimension that forces the desired in-plane resonant mode to be the lowest frequency mode. In the exemplary embodiment, in the presence of the magnetic field, current passing through a longitudinal length between the anchors A and B induces the longitudinal, in-plane deflection through the Lorentz effect. With the current applied at an AC frequency approximately equal to a resonant frequency of the resonator , the Lorentz force is amplified by the mechanical Q of the resonator . In a first embodiment, the resonator  resonates only in response to the Lorentz force being of sufficient magnitude (i.e., when in the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field). In a second embodiment, the driven AC signal alone induces the in-plane resonance with amplitude of the resonance then modulated by the Lorentz force.","In an embodiment, the deformable diffractive optical structure employed for optical transduction of resonator displacement is a multi-layer grating. In the exemplary embodiment, each grating (i.e., grating) in the multi-layer gratings A, B, A-C, A-C, and A, B is a sub-wavelength grating, however chirped gratings and other forms known in the art may also be employed. As shown in , the multi-layer grating B includes a first grating B rigidly affixed to the support  and extending over the trench  to be disposed over a second grating B formed on the resonator . Each of the first and second gratings B and B may be formed in either the substrate , or as illustrated in , in thin film layers , , respectively, which are formed on the substrate . In the exemplary embodiment, the first grating B is disposed in a material layer  that forms a bridge spanning the transverse length of the resonator . Exemplary thin film materials which can be used for layers  and  include silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and polysilicon, as well as any other material known in the art having adequate thermal stability and structural integrity for the geometries and functions described herein.","As further illustrated in , aperture dimensions of a multi-layer grating is to vary with the displacement of the second grating B relative to the first grating B as the resonator deflects along its longitudinal length in the plane of resonance. While first-order gratings with feature dimensions significantly larger than a wavelength of light used for the optical transduction (i.e., the operating wavelength) may be used, near field multi-layer gratings are preferred as being capable of modulating the intensity and polarization of an incident light in response to much smaller displacements of the grating elements (i.e., lines and spaces). Near field multi-layer gratings having line elements of the gratings separated by distances which are less than the operating wavelength are known to modulate the intensity of reflected or transmitted zero orders even when displacement in-plane of the grating is only fractions of a wavelength. For a detailed description of such near field multi-layer gratings, the interested reader is referred to commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,173,764 and 7,339,738 to Carr et al., which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. The sub-wavelength displacement sensitivity possible with the near field multi-layer grating enables a level of magnetic field sensitivity heretofore unknown.","In an embodiment, a MEMS magnetometer includes a plurality of near field multi-layer gratings. As shown in , the plurality of multi-layer gratings , , , and  are disposed in a one dimensional array across the longitudinal beam length. In an embodiment, the plurality of multi-layer gratings is disposed symmetrically about a center of the resonator . In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the plurality of multi-layer gratings is disposed symmetrically to have pairs of the multi-layer gratings disposed over points of equivalent deflection. For example, multi-layer grating pair A and A are disposed equidistant from a center of the longitudinal beam length (extending along x-axis if ). Similarly, multi-layer grating pairs B and B, C and C, A and A, B and B are similarly equidistant from the beam center, beam ends, and anchors A, B. An alternative symmetrical arrangement has a single multi-layer grating centered over the center of the longitudinal beam length.","In an embodiment, across the plurality of arrayed multi-layer gratings, line elements in the gratings of each multi-layer grating have a same pitch, but an alignment offset between the gratings  and  is different across the plurality of multi-layer gratings so that phase between the overlapping gratings is modulated across the plurality of multi-layer gratings.  illustrates an expanded plan view  of a portion of the MEMS magnetometer . The expanded plan view  illustrates multi-layer gratings A and A. Inset within , cross-sectional views A illustrates line elements in the first grating A having a first pitch P, defining a period of the first grating A. Similarly, line elements in the second grating A have a second pitch P. The pitches Pand Pmay be substantially equal to each other, but are not necessarily so. Alignment between the first and second gratings A and A defines a phase \u03c6for the first multi-layer grating A.","In the cross-sectional view B inset within , line elements in the first grating A have the first pitch P. Similarly, line elements in the second grating A have the second pitch P. As such, between the two multi-layer gratings A and A, the pitches of respective gratings are equal. Alignment (i.e., overlay) between the first and second gratings of the multi-layer gratings A and A is however different such that a phase \u03c6for the second multi-layer grating A is different from the phase \u03c6. In one exemplary embodiment, the difference in phase between adjacent ones of the arrayed gratings is 10-20 nm. In the preferred embodiment, phase is varied in equal steps from one end of the resonator to the other so that over the ten multi-layer gratings arrayed along the longitudinal beam length of the resonator , phase is varied by 80-150 nm to account for misalignment of the gratings forming each multi-layer grating that could reduce the intensity modulation with displacement. In another embodiment, phase is varied in equal steps from the center of the resonator to each end so that over two sets of five multi-layer gratings arrayed along the longitudinal beam length of the resonator , phase is varied by 40-75 nm. As such, multi-layer grating phase is the same at locations of equivalent degrees of deflection. In another embodiment however, the multi-layer grating phase \u03c6 is varied only within the grating pairs. For example, just as the multi-layer grating pairs A and A have differing phases \u03c6and \u03c6, multi-layer grating pairs B and B have the same two differing phases \u03c6and \u03c6, multi-layer grating pairs C and C also have the same two differing phases \u03c6and \u03c6, and so do multi-layer grating pairs A, A, and B, B. As such, phase is varied across two locations having equivalent degrees of deflection permitting a phase selection and a degree of deflection to be independently selected.","Varying the multi-layer grating phase \u03c6 across an arrayed plurality of multi-layer gratings enables magnetic field sensing system incorporating the MEMS magnetometer  to undergo a functional test where multi-layer gratings in the array may be binned out to identify the grating having a phase, \u03c6, that satisfies a predetermined threshold criteria, e.g., a greatest displacement induced modulation of light intensity (e.g., zeroth order) or an intensity modulation level within a predetermined range. Variation in the fabrication process affecting the gratings may therefore be accounted for to advantageously improve measurement sensitivity. In an alternate embodiment, whether or not multi-layer grating phase is modulated across the plurality, more than one multi-level grating may be utilized for displacement transduction. For example, differential measurements may be performed and\/or a comb filter or other filtering may be applied to combine outputs from more than one multi-level grating in each array and remove common mode noise, etc. as known in the art of electrical signal conditioning.","As further depicted in the expanded plan view  in , apertures  and intervening line elements  are in an x-y plane parallel to the plane of the support, and to the plane of resonance. The major aperture lengths extend along the x-dimension and to define the first grating period along the y-dimension to transduce displacement resulting from the in-plane deflection along the longitudinal beam length. As shown in , the second grating B comprises a similar plurality of regularly spaced line elements in a second plane parallel to the plane of the support , and plane of resonance, but separated in the z-dimension from the first line elements. This z-dimension separation between gratings may be less than a wavelength of light utilized for interrogation of the grating.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":["300","100","300","124","144","154","300","302","1","310","1","304","124"]},"For the exemplary linear grating, light having a specific wavelength (i.e., operating wavelength) is diffracted into modes that emerge along multiple discrete angles. For the preferred near field grating embodiments where the multi-layer gratings are \u201csub-wavelength,\u201d the light source  is to emit an incident light beam  at a wavelength that is greater than the pitch of the grating (either the first grating A or second grating A, although in the preferred embodiment where the both the first and second grating have the same pitch, the wavelength is grating than the pitch of both first and second gratings). The sub-wavelength grating has only a zeroth-order mode and a surface wave mode. When optically coupled, varying the offset between the two gratings allows for modulation of the light between transmission and reflection in the zeroth order mode.","Exemplary detectors  include a PIN photodiode, an active pixel sensor (APS), or the like. In one near field embodiment, the first photodetector - is to measure an intensity of zeroth-order light modulated by the multi-layer grating A, though other orders may also be sensed. The first detector - (i.e., a position sensing detector) is to detect the light portion - reflected off the multi-layer grating A. A second detector - (i.e., a reference detector) is to detect a light portion - of the light  reflected off a reference surface outside the multi-layer grating A (i.e., the reference light portion - bypasses the multi-layer grating A). The reference detector - provides an electrical output signal which can be combined with the electrical output signal of the detector - to substantially remove any common-mode noise (i.e., noise due to the light source or other factors which is common to both reflected light portions - and -) and thereby improve a sensitivity for sensing relative displacement of the second grating A disposed on the resonator. In alternate embodiments of the present invention where a transmitted light portion is detected, a reference detector can be similarly used to detect a portion of the incident light beam  which bypasses the multi-layer grating A. Output from first detector - provides a first basis for outputting a displacement measure which is then translated downstream into a sensed magnetic field strength (gauss).","For the exemplary embodiments employing a plurality of multi-layer gratings, each multi-layer grating having a particular phase is paired with a light source  and at least one optical detector , for example an array of LEDs or VCSELs may be disposed over each array of multi-layer gratings.  illustrates a cross-section view of the magnetic field sensor  taken through a second multi-layer grating A on the substrate  disposed relative to a second light source - that is fabricated in a substrate -, which may be the same substrate as -, or a separate (third) substrate. First detector - and reference detector - operate in the same manner described for detectors - and - to detected light portions - and -, respectively, with the position sensing output from first detector - being a second basis for outputting a sensed magnetic field strength. The intensity modulation generated by one from the plurality of multi-layer gratings, or intensity modulation generated by each multi-layer grating of the array may be collected simultaneously (in parallel) or serially sampled in a time divided (e.g., in round robin fashion) or other multiplexed manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","300","405","100","410","415","122","420","425"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1A"],"b":["500","500","300","400","405","100","510","122","515","425","500","512","516","425","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","300","605","100","610","620","630","400"]},"It is to be understood that the above description is illustrative, and not restrictive.
