title: Transimpedance amplifier input stage mixer
abstract: A Gilbert cell mixer design is disclosed. Instead of using a differential transconductance stage as typically done, the design employs a differential transimpedance amplifier input stage. By utilizing a transimpedance input stage to the Gilbert mixer, feedback is used to obtain higher linearity without sacrificing noise performance. The transimpedance input stage supplies a current signal to the cascode connected Gilbert switching quad, so the transimpedance amplifier output is taken from the collector of the transimpedance amplifier output transistor, instead of the emitter as normally done with transimpedance amplifiers.

The amplitude of the differential input RF signal can be linearly controlled by a differential AC voltage. Gilbert cells are commonly used in a number of applications, including mixers, automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers, amplitude and sideband modulators, amplitude modulation (\u03bcM) and sideband detectors, frequency doublers and dividers, squaring and square-root circuits.","The typical implementation of a Gilbert cell mixer utilizes a simple differential pair as the input transconductance stage. This is cascode connected with the Gilbert switching quad, which is typically driven by a local oscillator signal. Such mixer designs suffer from a number of problems, including poor linearity of the transconductance differential amplifier input stage. Conventional techniques such as emitter degeneration can be utilized to improve linearity, but this has a direct, negative impact on noise performance of Gilbert cell mixers.","There is a need, therefore, for improved Gilbert cell mixer designs.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a device for mixing signals. The device includes a Gilbert mixer stage having a cascode connected switching quad, and a differential transimpedance amplifier input stage operatively coupled to the Gilbert mixer stage. The differential transimpedance amplifier input stage is for generating a current signal that is applied to the cascode connected switching quad of the Gilbert mixer stage. In one example case, the differential transimpedance amplifier has an output transistor, and the current signal is taken from a collector of the output transistor. In another example case, the differential transimpedance amplifier has closed loop negative feedback taken from an emitter of an output transistor. In another example case, the differential transimpedance amplifier comprises an input transistor and an output transistor. An input signal is applied to a base of the input transistor, and an impedance at a collector of the input transistor produces open-loop voltage gain, and amplified signals on the collector of the input transistor are applied to a base of the output transistor. In one such case, the current signal is taken from a collector of the output transistor. In another such case, the input transistor is connected in a common emitter configuration. In another such case, emitter voltage of the input transistor is raised by a diode. In some cases, the differential transimpedance amplifier can be configured with degenerated current sources for facilitating rejection of common mode input signals. In another specific configuration, the device may be included, for example, in a system-on-chip (e.g., for integrated applications that require signal mixing), or may be implemented with discrete components. Any number of variations will be apparent in light of this disclosure.","For instance, another embodiment of the present invention provides a device for mixing signals that includes a Gilbert mixer stage having a cascode connected switching quad, and a differential transimpedance amplifier input stage operatively coupled to the Gilbert mixer stage, for generating a current signal that is applied to the cascode connected switching quad of the Gilbert mixer stage.

Instead of using a differential transconductance stage as typically done, the design employs a differential transimpedance amplifier input stage. By utilizing a transimpedance input stage to the Gilbert mixer, feedback is used to obtain higher linearity without sacrificing noise performance. The transimpedance input stage supplies a current signal to the cascode connected Gilbert switching quad, so the transimpedance amplifier output is taken from the collector of the transimpedance amplifier output transistor, instead of the emitter as typically done with transimpedance amplifiers.","General Overview","As previously explained, a typical Gilbert cell mixer utilizes a transconductance input stage, as illustrated by the circuit of . As can be seen, the circuit includes a differential transconductance amplifier stage (RF input stage) operatively coupled to a Gilbert cell (mixing stage). The power supplies of Vcc and Vee are provided as typically done.","In such a typical Gilbert cell mixer, the RF input stage to the mixer has a differential transconductance pair of transistors, Q and Q. This transistor pair converts an applied input voltage at the bases to an output current at the collectors. The differential input voltage is designated as Inand In, and the differential output current is designated as Iand I. The differential output current Iand Iis then mixed with the local oscillator signal (LOand LO) applied to the Gilbert switching quad, which is made up of Q-Q. The differential output signal of the mixer stage (Outand Out) is taken at the collectors of the Gilbert quad.","While this conventional approach is efficient in terms of relatively few components used, it has shortcomings. For instance, Q and Q utilize no feedback. Linearity is dependent on the semiconductor process used and how much emitter degeneration is used, which is impedance element Z. When impedance Z is a resistive element for broadband applications, high linearity can be achieved at the expense of low mixer circuit gain and high noise figure. Narrow band applications can partially mitigate this shortcoming by utilizing reactive components (i.e., inductors or capacitors) for Z. However, there are still limits in how linear the differential transconductance amplifier can be made. The other impedances Z-Z are generally used for shaping the circuitry frequency response and gain. Typical impedance values are as follows: Z=Z=100 ohms; Z=Z=70 ohms; and Z=45 ohms.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the differential transconductance amplifier input stage is replaced with a transimpedance amplifier circuit utilizing negative feedback. This technique provides several improvements in performance over the open-loop input stage, including higher linearity without sacrificing noise performance.","Mixer Circuit",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As can be seen, the circuit is implemented with transistors Q-Q and impedances Z-Z. The present invention is not intended to be limited to a particular type of transistors or impedances. Rather, the mixer circuit topology shown in  can be implemented using any number of suitable transistor and impedance types. For example, the transistors Q-Q can be implemented with CMOS FETs or Bipolar Junction Transistors, or any other suitable transistor technology. Likewise, the impedances can be, for instance, resistive, capacitive, inductive, or a combination thereof. The Gilbert cell (mixer stage) can be implemented as typically done.","As can further be seen, the transimpedance amplifier is a differential circuit and has symmetrical qualities, thereby allowing analysis of one circuit half to be equally applied to the other circuit half. For instance, this example embodiment can be discussed in terms of the left circuit half, which generally includes transistors Q and Q and impedances Z, Z, Z, Z, and Z. The discussion of this left circuit half will equally apply the right circuit half, which generally includes transistors Q and Q and impedances Z, Z, Z, Z, and Z.","In operation, transistors Q and Q form a transimpedance input amplifier. The RF input signal (In) is applied to the base of transistor Q. A large collector impedance Z produces large open-loop voltage gain at transistor Q. In some embodiments, transistor Q is connected in a common emitter configuration (where impedance Z is a short to ground). The amplified signal on the collector of transistor Q is then applied to the base of transistor Q, which serves two functions. In particular, transistor Q buffers the signal from the collector of transistor Q to drive the feedback resistance. In addition, transistor Q generates a current output (I) at the collector which is applied to the Gilbert switching quad, at the emitters of the Q-Q transistor pair. In typical differential transimpedance amplifier circuits, the output would be taken from the emitter of transistor Q as a voltage signal, with transistor Q configured in a common collector configuration. This embodiment, however, has adapted the differential transimpedance amplifier circuit into a new configuration, where the feedback is still tapped off the emitter of transistor Q, but the output is taken as a current signal (I) from the collector of transistor Q. The Gilbert switching quad (more specifically, transistors Q and Q of the quad) uses the current signal Iin normal fashion.","Given the symmetry associated with a differential circuit, and as previously explained, everything stated for transistors Q and Q can be applied to transistors Q and Q, respectively. For purposes of clarity, however, a detailed discussion is now provided. In operation, transistors Q and Q form a transimpedance input amplifier. The RF input signal (In) is applied to the base of transistor Q. A large collector impedance Z produces large open-loop voltage gain at transistor Q. In some embodiments, transistor Q is connected in a common emitter configuration (where impedance Z is a short to ground). The amplified signal on the collector of transistor Q is then applied to the base of transistor Q, which serves two functions. In particular, transistor Q buffers the signal from the collector of transistor Q to drive the feedback resistance. In addition, transistor Q generates a current output (I) at the collector which is applied to the Gilbert switching quad, at the emitters of the Q-Q transistor pair. As previously explained, the output of a typical differential transimpedance amplifier circuit would be taken from the emitter of transistor Q as a voltage signal, with transistor Q configured in a common collector configuration. This embodiment, however, has adapted the differential transimpedance amplifier circuit, where the feedback is still tapped off the emitter of transistor Q, but the output is taken as a current signal (I) from the collector of transistor Q. The Gilbert quad (more specifically, transistors Q and Q of the quad) uses the current signal Iin normal fashion.","The differential transimpedance amplifier based approach has advantages over a conventional transconductance approach in the following ways. The closed loop feedback can greatly improve the linearity of the mixer circuit, without sacrificing gain or noise figure. This can be done with resistive elements to maintain a broad band response. In the traditional transconductance approach, improved linearity is achieved by increasing the degeneration impedance, Z in . However, and as previously explained, this reduces the gain and increases the noise figure significantly, especially if resistive degeneration is used in a broad band application. In contrast, a mixer configured with a differential transimpedance amplifier input stage as described herein decouples linearity and gain. As such, high gain and low noise figure can be achieved simultaneously with high linearity. Most of the linearizing benefits achieved with negative feedback taken from the emitter of transistor Q are present in the current-mode signal taken from the collector of Q. Likewise, most of the linearizing benefits achieved with negative feedback taken from the emitter of transistor Q are present in the current-mode signal taken from the collector of Q. In this sense, taking the output from the transimpedance amplifier circuit from the collectors of Q and\/or Q is beneficial.","Impedance elements Z and Z generally enable the mixer circuit to behave in a differential way. The Ininput can be left open or terminated while the Ininput is driven with a signal, or vise-versa. Differential behavior partially reconstructs an inverted copy of the applied RF input signal in the non-drive half of the input stage. Impedance Z can be, for example, any passive device or combination of such devices, one or more diode drops, an active current source, or shorted directly to ground. Impedances Z, Z, and Z effectively shape the frequency response and gain of mixer circuit, and can be implemented, for instance, with one or more passive devices (e.g., resistors, capacitors, inductors, or combination thereof). Alternatively, or in addition to, impedances Z, Z, and Z can be implemented as one or more diode drops or an active current source, as discussed with reference to -","In some embodiments, the RF input (Inand In) can be applied to the transimpedance input stage through an impedance network. This impedance can be tailored to meet the overall circuit gain and input matching requirements. For instance, the mixer circuit gain for the RF input Inis generally proportional to Z\/Z\u2225Z\u2225(Z\/2), where \u2225 represents parallel combination of networks. Similarly, given differential circuit symmetries, the mixer circuit gain for the RF input Inis generally proportional to Z\/Z\u2225Z\u2225(Z\/2).","The transistors shown in this example of  are bipolar NPN transistors, but other transistor types (e.g., BJT PNP, FETs) can be used, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure. Moreover, mixer circuitry configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention can be implemented, for example, with discrete componentry (e.g. printed circuited board or card populated with discrete components) or as one or more integrated circuits (e.g., system-on-chip, or chip set formed using any number of suitable semiconductor processes). In one example case, Silicon Germanium (SiGe) processes are used, such as IBM processes 5 HP, 7 HP or 8 HP. Indium Phosphide, regular Silicon, Indium Gallium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide are all viable processes generally available that can be used to implement an embodiment of the present invention.","Example impedance values in accordance with one specific embodiment are as follows: Z=Z=100 ohms; Z=Z=450 ohms; Z=Z=60 ohms; Z=Z=70 ohms; Z=0 ohms (short circuit); and Z=45 ohms. The transistors Q-Q in one such example case are bipolar NPN transistors implemented using standard Silicon Germanium (SiGe) semiconductor processes. The impedances Z-Z can be implemented, for instance, as thin film resistors. A number of variations on the mixer circuit can be implemented.","Dynamic Range Increase","One such variation is shown in . In this example embodiment, the circuit is mostly configured as shown in , and can have the following example impedance values in: Z=Z=100 ohms; Z=Z=450 ohms; Z=Z=68 ohms; Z=Z=70 ohms; and Z=180 ohms. Instead of a short circuit, however, impedance Z is implemented with a diode (e.g., SiGe) as shown in . Just as previously explained with reference to , the various components can be implemented using standard SiGe semiconductor processes, although other embodiments can be implemented using discrete components if so desired.","In any case, in this specific embodiment shown in , the emitter voltage of transistors Q and Q is effectively raised by diode D (e.g., by 0.4 to 0.9 VDC, depending on the diode junction type). As such, all of the bias voltages are shifted upward in the transimpedance input stage. This allows more room for voltage swing at the emitters of transistors Q and Q, effectively increasing the dynamic range of the mixer circuit. Note, however, that this increased dynamic range comes at the expense of increased power consumption.","Common Mode Rejection","Another variation is shown in . In this example embodiment, the circuit is mostly configured as shown in , and can have the following example impedance values in: Z=Z=100 ohms; Z=Z=450 ohms; Z=Z=68 ohms; and Z=180 ohms. As shown in , however, impedances Z-Z are replaced with degenerated current sources Q-Q (including the corresponding resistors R-R), which are biased from a voltage reference Vref. Just as previously explained with reference to , the various components can be implemented using, for example, standard semiconductor processes, although other embodiments can be implemented using discrete components if so desired.","Vref can be generated, for example, on chip or by another circuit. In any case, this configuration enables the transimpedance input stage to better reject common mode input signals applied to Inand In. Again, additional power supply headroom is needed, and thus more power is required. So consideration of the various trades should be made. Transistors Q-Q can be, for example, MOSFET devices without negatively impacting circuit performance. In one such example case, MOSFET devices are provided using the IBM\u00ae 8 HP SiGe BiCMOS process, although any number of suitable semiconductor processes can be used.","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of this disclosure. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"b "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
