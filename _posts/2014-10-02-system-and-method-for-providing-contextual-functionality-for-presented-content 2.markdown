For example, the spring app allows the user to view on a companion device which setting or location among inputs a display device is currently presenting. View functions  can include functions for one or more of content information, external content information, media context and notifications. Content information functions may allow for the spring application to provide information related to active content without having to present guide or information on the display device (e.g., TV). By way of example, content information may include one or more of channel metadata, event\/program metadata, music album metadata, music metadata, image metadata, photo album metadata, video metadata, device data and App metadata. A view external content information function allows for the spring application to retrieve data associated with presented media or active content from one or more third party services, such as media databases, entertainment servers, etc. External content information may be based on a publish control metadata function  which is configured to obtain and\/or store metadata for content presented by a display device. A notification feature allows for actions taken by the spring application to be provided to the display device. In which case, the display device can acknowledge the action and present a message to the user that the action has been completed.","Search  allows for configuration of a device to allow for customization of the spring presentation and for control of the device based on one or more settings.","According to another aspect, the spring application may provide a user experience framework.
