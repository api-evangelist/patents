No. 61\/843,543 filed Jul. 8, 2013, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under contract ECCS-1102275 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to organic thin film transistors and methods of making organic thin film transistors.","Organic electronic materials are finding increasing application in a variety of fields including displays, photovoltaics and other optoelectronic apparatus. Advantages of organic materials in electronic applications include increased processibility, general substrate compatibility and reduced complexity of device fabrication. However, commercialization of organic electronics is often hindered by insufficient device performance, poor reproducibility and limited device lifetime compared to inorganic devices. For example, an important transistor parameter is charge carrier mobility. Transistors incorporating soluble small molecule organic semiconductor single-crystal channel materials demonstrate high mobilities, generally ranging from 1 to 6 cm\/Vs. In comparison, transistors of thin film organic semiconducting materials often have mobilities at least an order of magnitude less. Such a reduction in mobility effectively precludes the use of thin film organic semiconductors in fast switching transistor applications.","In one aspect, organic thin film transistors are described herein which, in some embodiments, can demonstrate enhanced carrier mobility. An organic thin film transistor described herein comprises a source terminal, a drain terminal, a gate terminal and a dielectric layer positioned between the gate terminal and the source and drain terminals. A vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic film comprising small molecule semiconductor is in electrical communication with the source terminal and drain terminal. In some embodiments, the transistor has a carrier mobility (\u03bc) of at least about 1 cm\/V\u00b7s. In some embodiments, \u03bcis at least about 3 cm\/V\u00b7s. Additionally, a transistor described herein can have a threshold voltage (V) ranging from about \u22123V to 3V. Moreover, in some embodiments, a transistor described herein has a subthreshold swing (S) of less than about 1 V\/dec.","In addition to the foregoing properties, a transistor described herein can demonstrate a significant reduction in trap density, N, at the interface of the vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic film and dielectric layer. In some embodiments, for example, a transistor has a Nof less than 1Ecm\u2212eV.","An organic thin film transistor described herein, in some embodiments, further comprises a work function alteration layer positioned between the vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic film and at least one of the source terminal and drain terminal. In some embodiments, a work function alteration layer is positioned between both the source terminal and the organic film and the drain terminal and the organic film.","An organic thin film transistor described herein can further comprise a surface energy alteration layer positioned between the vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic film and one or more dielectric layers of the transistor. In one embodiment, for example, a surface energy alteration layer is positioned between the vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic thin film and the dielectric layer separating the source and drain terminals from the gate terminal. In some embodiments, a surface energy alteration layer is positioned between the vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic thin film and a dielectric substrate.","Additionally, in some embodiments, the vibrationally-assisted drop-cast organic film of the transistor comprises crystalline grains of the small molecule semiconductor. The crystalline grains, in some embodiments, have an average size in at least one dimension greater than 30 \u03bcm. Moreover, in some embodiments, a small molecule semiconductor comprises one or more acenes.","In another aspect, methods of making an organic thin film transistor are described herein.

For example, electrically conductive plates can be arranged in a manner to place the deposited solution in an electrical field when a voltage is applied to the plates. In some embodiments, the applied voltage is an AC voltage. Alternatively, the applied voltage can be a DC voltage. Additionally, the electric field can demonstrate a singular orientation or variable orientation during vibration and\/or solvent evaporation of the deposited solution.","Moreover, a method of making an organic thin film transistor described herein further comprises providing a gate terminal. A gate terminal, in some embodiments, is provided on a side of the dielectric substrate opposing the source and drain terminals. In other embodiments, a gate terminal is provided over the organic film, wherein a gate dielectric is provided between the organic film and gate terminal.

One drop of the diF-TES ADT solution was applied in the center of the Petri dish, and the SAM-treated substrate comprising the source and drain terminals was placed on the drop of diF-TES ADT solution. Six drops (\u02dc25 \u03bcL each) of the diF-TES ADT solution were placed on the SAM-treated substrate and 250 \u03bcL of chlorobenzene were added to the Petri dish around the substrate. The Petri dish was covered with a cover.

The amplitude of the function generator or audio amplifier was adjusted so the rms voltage across the speaker terminals (4 ohm, 5 inch) read 45.0 mV. The apparatus was turned on to initiate vibrations, and vibrations were continued for 20 hours. The substrate comprising the deposited organic thin film was removed and placed in a vacuum oven to remove any remaining solvent.","A Comparative organic thin film transistor was also prepared in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the difference being that the diF-TES ADT solution was not subjected to vibration during the drying process.","The electrical properties of the Vibrationally-assisted and Comparative organic thin film transistors made as described above were measured using a commercially available probe-station and an Agilent 4155 C semiconductor parameter analyzer.  illustrates current-voltage characteristics of the Vibrationally-assisted organic thin film transistor in the saturation regime.

The device of  exhibited a \u03bcof 3 cm\/V\u00b7s, a Vof 0.7 V, an S of 0.43 V\/dec, Nof 6.8Ecm\u2212eVand an on\/off ratio of about 10. Further,  illustrates current-voltage characteristics of the Comparative organic thin film transistor (dashed line) relative to the Vibrationally-assisted organic thin film transistor (solid line). SAC in  refers to solvent assisted crystallization of the diF-TES ADT while VAC refers to vibration assisted crystallization of the diF-TES ADT. The Comparative device demonstrated inferior characteristics, including a \u03bcof 0.9 cm\/V\u00b7s, a Vof 11 V, an S of 1.0 V\/dec and Nof 1.8E.","Organic thin film transistors employing various vibrationally-assisted drop cast organic thin films were produced in accordance with the procedure of Example 1.
