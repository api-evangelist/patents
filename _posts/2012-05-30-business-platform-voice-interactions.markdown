Such models may be created, for example, by a model designer or architect via a platform that creates and extends applications for enterprise voice interaction scenarios. Designers may be able to define a model (represented in a specified XML schema) that represents the voice interaction between a set of enterprise services and end-user voice commands. The platform may be pluggable and provide an ability to add new models which will describe new business interactions without any coding. For example,  is an example of a design tool Graphical User Interface (\u201cGUI\u201d)  that might be used to create new models according to some embodiments. In particular, the designer might add and\/or arrange elements  to the model, such as elements  associated with interactive steps, conditions, voice messages, output parameters, business information interfaces, etc. The design tool GUI  might also let a designer graphically couple  the elements  as appropriate to define a new business interaction model.","Once a designer is finished modeling via the GUI , an XML file may be generated which can be deployed to a voice interaction server. According to some embodiments, this may automatically add the modeled business scenario to any device that communicates with the voice interaction server. Note that the information defined via the design tool GUI  may be automatically converted into XML statements as appropriate.

For example a CRM process might make sure that steps taken by a user are appropriate, and navigate the user (e.g., via a text-to-speech tool) to the next step in the workflow process. Thus, an interactive enterprise business voice platform may bring forward to a user the backend workflows and help navigate the user through various workflow step making sure he or she adheres to the enterprise rules and transaction policies. According to some embodiments, the platform may further monitor a user's spoken words in connection with a \u201cspeech adherence\u201d policy (e.g., to ensure that a person is using proper terminology).","Thus, some embodiments may establish methods and mechanisms to efficiently, accurately, and\/or automatically facilitate voice interactions between a user and a remote enterprise server.
