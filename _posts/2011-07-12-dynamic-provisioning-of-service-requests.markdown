title: Dynamic provisioning of service requests
abstract: An enhanced service DNS server may receive service requests and interface with an integrated metadata repository/policy definition server to determine service policies associated with the service request. The service policies may aid the enhanced service DNS server in determining if a requestor associated with the service is authorized to receive the service and if the service requestor is authorized to receive the service, the service policies may detail how the enhanced service DNS server may route the service request to the appropriate service provider over the network. This scheme may help to automate the process of implementing changes to services provided over a network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/181,145 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/181,151, which were filed concurrently with this application and which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Aspects of the invention generally relate to ways in which an entity may dynamically assign routing mechanisms for service requests. In particular, an enhanced service domain name system (DNS) server may interface with a metadata repository and\/or policy definition server to determine an appropriate network route for a requested resource.","Conventional domain name systems (DNS) are configured to include static, hard-wired definitions of how domain names are translated into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Moreover, multiple services are grouped together behind a domain name (e.g., uniform resource locator (URL), and the like) in a way that is not agile and secure.","For instance, in conventional systems, a user requests a URL by routing a request to an appropriate network bus; the network bus then routes the request to a provider of the requested URL (e.g., a web page server). When changes are made to how servers can access services that undergird these URLs (e.g., from one URL to another) or when new services come online, static definitions within the DNS server of how URLs are translated into IP addresses must be manually changed or added, which can be an error-prone, time-consuming, and expensive process. In addition, in conventional private networks, manual intervention may be required for a host of situations, including opening up a firewall rule, creating a load balancer rule, and\/or inserting a piece of middleware to route services to a particular destination, and the like.","Moreover, while users may request a given URL and may navigate through the URL to access a desired service, a user may not be able to directly access the service itself. The circuitous process of accessing desired services in conventional networks may lead to end-user frustration.","Thus, there is a need for new strategies for requesting access to services and routing these service requests to the appropriate destination.","In light of the foregoing background, the following presents a simplified summary of the present disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description provided below.","Aspects of the disclosure address one or more of the issues mentioned above by disclosing methods, non-transitory computer readable media, and apparatuses for allowing an enhanced service domain name system (DNS) server to route service requests to the appropriate destination. The enhanced service DNS server may perform these functions by accessing service policy information stored within an integrated metadata repository and\/or policy definition server.","Other aspects of the disclosure relate to an enhanced service DNS server that interfaces with an integrated metadata repository in real-time, as the service request is made, and dynamically retrieves the appropriate routing mechanism for the requested resource at the time the service request is made.","Other aspects of the disclosure relate to the implementation of changes in service policies without manually changing the hard-wired definitions stored in an array of DNS servers; instead, these changes may be effectuated by changing policy definitions within a single metadata repository and\/or policy definition server.","Aspects of the disclosure may be provided in a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions to perform one or more of the process steps described herein.","As discussed above, entities such as companies, governmental agencies, universities, and the like struggle with the time and expense associated with making changes and\/or additions to services provided by the network maintained by the entity. Therefore, there is a need for new systems and methodologies for implementing service changes within a network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The disclosure is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Computer readable media may be any available media that may be accessed by enhanced service DNS server  and include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise a combination of computer storage media and communication media.","Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

For example, memory  may store software used by the enhanced service DNS server , such as an operating system , application programs , and an associated database . Also, some or all of the computer executable instructions for enhanced service DNS server  may be embodied in hardware or firmware.","Enhanced service DNS server  may operate in a networked environment supporting connections to one or more remote computing devices, such as computing devices , , and . The computing devices , , and  may be personal computing devices or servers that include many or all of the elements described above relative to the enhanced service DNS server . Computing device  may be a mobile device communicating over wireless carrier channel .","The network connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks.

In addition, the application programs  may include computer executable instructions for invoking functionality related to dynamically assigning a service address for a given service request.","Embodiments of the disclosure may include forms of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media include any available media that can be accessed by an enhanced service DNS server . Computer-readable media may comprise storage media and communication media and in some examples may be non-transitory. Storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, object code, data structures, program modules, or other data. Communication media include any information delivery media and typically embody data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism.","Although not required, various aspects described herein may be embodied as a method, a data processing system, or as a computer-readable medium storing computer-executable instructions. For example, a computer-readable medium storing instructions to cause a processor to perform steps of a method in accordance with aspects of the disclosed embodiments is contemplated. For example, aspects of the method steps disclosed herein may be executed on a processor  on enhanced service DNS server . Such a processor may execute computer-executable instructions stored on a computer-readable medium.","Referring to , an illustrative system  for implementing example embodiments according to the present disclosure is shown. As illustrated, system  may include one or more workstation computers . Workstations  may be local or remote, and may be connected by one of communications links  to computer network  that is linked via communications links  to enhanced service DNS server . Workstations  may include many of the same hardware\/software components as enhanced service DNS server . In some embodiments, workstations  may represent data stores (e.g., a policy definition server and\/or integrated metadata repository) for storing service policy data accessed and used by enhanced service DNS server . In other embodiments, workstations  may represent various user terminals for accessing enhanced service DNS server . In system , enhanced service DNS server  may be any suitable server, processor, computer, or data processing device, or combination of the same. Enhanced service DNS server  may be used to process the instructions received from one or more users.","Computer network  may be any suitable computer network including the Internet, an intranet, a wide-area network (WAN), a local-area network (LAN), a wireless network, a digital subscriber line (DSL) network, a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a virtual private network (VPN), or any combination of any of the same. Communications links  and  may be any communications links suitable for communicating between workstations  and enhanced service DNS server , such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, and the like.","The steps that follow in the Figures may be implemented by one or more of the components in  and\/or other components, including other computing devices.","In accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, methods, computer-readable media, and apparatuses are disclosed that allow an entity, such as a company, government agency, university, and the like, to implement advanced methodologies for dynamically assigning network routes to service requests.","According to an illustrative aspect, to implement the network solution, an entity (e.g., a corporation) may use an enhanced service DNS server  configured to run computer-executable program instructions related to each step of the service request routing process. In particular, the enhanced service DNS server  may resolve a service URL (e.g., the URL of a service provider) into a service address of a service provider for the service URL. For example, a service URL for accessing sports content may be \u201csports,\u201d meaning that a user may access a preferred service provider for sports content within a private network by typing in the word \u201csports\u201d into a browser. Similarly, the service URL for accessing the latest news content may be \u201cnews,\u201d and the service URL for accessing the latest weather information may be \u201cweather.\u201d One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that alternative naming conventions may be used to designate a service URL.","In general, a service request may represent a higher order construct that specifies a desired resource. For instance, if a user initiates a service request for \u201csports,\u201d the enhanced service DNS server  may access policy definition metadata stored on an integrated metadata repository and\/or policy definition server that specifies a particular sports content provider. If the same user initiates this service request at a later date, the policy definition metadata for this service request may have changed during the interim; if so, the enhanced service DNS server  may access policy definition metadata that specifies that the service request for \u201csports\u201d should be routed to a different sports content provider.","As another example, if the entity implementing the enhanced service DNS server  is a financial organization (e.g., a bank), servers within the bank's network may receive a variety of service requests from a bank employee on behalf of a bank customer, including those related to opening a new bank account, registering for a credit card, applying for a loan, and the like.","In some aspects, a department or group (e.g., an enterprise architecture group, and the like.) within an entity such as a corporation may be responsible for dynamically configuring metadata and policy definitions undergirding the metadata. This group may decide to make changes to policy definitions and the metadata for a number of reasons, including those related to new services that need to be accommodated, a change in the quality of a service offered by a service provider, lack of availability of a service provider at the time that the service is requested, and a change in the cost of the service offered by the service provider, among other things.","The service request may initially be routed to the enhanced service DNS server  to determine the appropriate routing mechanism for the service request. In assigning the appropriate routing mechanism, the bank may access service policy information in a metadata repository, which may either be integrated with the enhanced service DNS server  or a standalone storage device.","In some embodiments, the enhanced service DNS server  may access information about standardized service policies both from an integrated metadata repository and\/or a policy definition server. By accessing the metadata stored in the integrated metadata repository and\/or policy definitions within a policy definition server, the enhanced service DNS server  may automate the process of configuring network elements to handle service requests across an entity such as a corporation. In other embodiments, both the integrated metadata repository and the policy definition server may be merged into one storage device. In certain aspects, the policy definition server and\/or integrated metadata repository may be known as a service repository, which is configured to store and publish standardized information about services so that they are discoverable by users of a private network.","The integrated metadata repository and the policy definition server may store data related to operational (e.g., run-time) policies such as those relating to entitlement, routing, work load management, logging, protocol bridging, format translation, filtering, and\/or business process management, among other things. Policies related to entitlement may include details on security functions such as authentication (e.g., establishing identity through a credential), authorization (e.g., determining if access is authorized for a privileged resource), and auditing of services and\/or service requests. Policies related to routing may define how to decide where to route a given service request or a response to a service request (e.g., DNS\/QUEUE resolution, site selection, content or context based routing, and the like).","For instance, using a fixed address to access a service (via an IP address, server name, service bus URL or queue name), may create undesired coupling between the service consumer and the physical instance of the service or an intermediary such as a service bus or middleware processing node or segment. Due to this coupling, any change in the physical layer or migrations to new servers (such as promotion along a test pipeline to production) may create the need for software changes and introduces a barrier to agility. Partial solutions (such as Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI)) create a runtime service lookup to decouple the logical use from the physical implementation. This implementation enables the needed virtualization, because service addressing uses outside facilities to allow adjusting addresses without touching the service, whether from the consumer\/request or within an integration bus. But conventional implementations require changes to every application to look-up endpoints in a custom way (via UDDI or other non-standard means) and adjust the address being called, creating a barrier to adoption.","In accordance with certain aspects of the disclosure, an approach which eliminates both agility and adoption barriers is to embed the service name itself or service basket string as the path identifier using a standard method where no client application coding is required. This implementation is possible by extending the standard DNS to reference the service name and then extend the centralized DNS look-up mechanism to access any dynamic end-point information associated with that service name stored in either Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or repository form. This method may be applied to any protocol, such as HTTPS.","Traditional DNS would simply return a virtual IP address from a static pool of addresses. The enhanced service DNS server  may instead return a dynamic address selected from a dynamic pool of virtual IPs that were associated with that service URL via an LDAP lookup or repository query. For greater performance and reliability, the VIP pool for each service URL may be cached local in the enhanced server DNS server  and refreshed periodically.","The dynamic nature and real-time update capabilities for the first hop from client (service requestor) to service node eliminates some potential for transaction failure (by eliminating manual configuration). This implementation may also open the door to context-driven routing to the best available servicing node (e.g., a service router or service gateway) or to the lowest cost or performance or availability-optimized end-point or servicer.","In certain aspects, an example of context-based routing or decisioning, triggered by a run-time context, includes cost\/performance-based routing (based on comparative costs per transaction and availability to lower-cost cloud computing versus higher cost and more resilient internal services on an entity controlled network). In this example, a service request may be routed in a network based on the lowest cost provider that meets the minimum availability and performance service level agreements (SLAs) for each request type. Another example of context-based routing or decisioning, triggered by a run-time context, includes value-based service level management, where the business value (transaction amount or business impact of failure) for each transaction type (or service request type) may be coded as metadata in a service repository and is used to determine which transactions (or requests) may be guaranteed processing and which may be throttled or redirected when resources become constrained or demand exceeds rated capacity. Yet another example of context-based routing or decisioning, triggered by a run-time context, includes resource-based timing, where the amount of resources (e.g., threads, memory, connections, time-out values, and the like) may be allocated based on granular measurements of available resources by provider and service type. A final example of context-based routing or decisioning, triggered by a run-time context may include the use of alternate path triggers. In this example, when virtual machine work-load management is configured, a service gateway may determine that only some traffic may be served using dynamic content (from the active service provider virtual machine instances). Service gateways may then route excess traffic to alternate internal service providers or adjust cache parameters in the message response header to trigger service of some requests via cached content that is still relevant but aged to a greater degree until demand subsides or additional dynamic service providers become available or more responsive.","In general, the ability of a service repository to define significant triggers (driven by environment or run-time context) and to render resultant actions in a common way (e.g., XML) which may be acted upon by a diverse set of vendor tools throughout the network or even across multiple divisional or corporate boundaries may represent a breakthrough extension of federated connectivity and service management.","With the advent of cloud computing, where emerging low cost service providers or end-points may use dynamic IP addressing, a solution like the enhanced service DNS server  may be a key enabler for both agility and cost reduction. Likewise, the ability to dynamically provision end-to-end services and connectivity flows in a fully metadata-driven fashion may enable real-time deployment of new infrastructure, including dev-on-demand and other on-demand paradigms.","Policies related to work-load management may include information on how many network components may participate in responding to a service request (connection distribution, local load balancing, Virtual Machine (VM) level workload management (WLM), and the like). Policies related to logging may include information on when to log data (e.g., when a service request is made to measure performance metrics of the network such as the amount of time that the network takes to fulfill the service request, when access to a privileged network resource is granted or denied, when deceptive acts are committed on the network, and the like.)","Policies related to protocol bridging may include information on how to change data from one format to another format (e.g., to allow one application to communicate with another). Policies related to format translation may include information related to editing data to make the data suitable for use in a given application (e.g., changing a double quotes to a single quote within a message, and the like). Policies related to filtering may define techniques (e.g., via style sheet filters, and the like) to strip away information that is not needed in a service transaction. For instance, if a network is providing a service related to obtaining a credit card, a filtering policy may specify that sensitive information such as the social security number of the service requestor be removed from the service request before transmitting the service request to a company that prints credit cards. Finally, policies related business process management may specify how complicated service requests may be divided into sub-requests. In some embodiments, business process management policies may describe orchestration of discrete services into a composite service.","In a typical multinational firm or federated enterprise that spans many large divisions, there may be multiple distributed information repositories. Each may use a different vendor solution for storing and managing services or integration flows or connections. By including an integrated metadata repository, system  may have the flexibility to store and manage service or connectivity-related metadata (such as service or operation names, Web Services Description Language (WSDL) or interface details, authentication credentials, authorization credentials, authorization contracts or entitlements (either at the user or system level), triggers for actions such as logging, service level management and throttling, and multi-factor content-based routing, end-point and load balancer details, transformation and orchestration logic or rules, service-bus or segment mapping or other decisioning criteria) across this flexible array of departmental or divisional repositories while still being able to federate into a common repository that can normalize the information via a common application programming interface (API) or file interface specification and translate the enterprise view of the design-time data into run-time flows, routes or policies that can be enforced or executed in real-time as part of the cross-vendor service mediation framework (potentially interfacing to off-premise resources or entities via a virtual private internet connectivity.)","As an example, assume that a multi-division bank stores web service information in each division using division specific repositories. In this example, division A may use a first commercially available repository, division B may use a second commercially available repository, division C may use a home grown repository, and division D may use a third commercially available repository. All of this service metadata may be integrated\/imported using a common repository with a common interface or file format (e.g., a common API). This federated data may drive enterprise level reports showing holistic cross-divisional service interactions. The enterprise metadata may be used to create XML-formatted control files that enable any node of the network (comprising a vast array of diverse vendor tools configured to act as service mediation framework components such as service routers or service gateways). This implementation may transform what used to be thousands of independent and uncoordinated vendor point solutions into a grid of interconnected and highly integrated common components that respond to centrally managed instructions or policies.","A common set of policies can be described via various tools and ultimately stored in open formats such as a common XML format to describe run-time policy statements. The enterprise repository may manage this combination of enterprise service metadata and enterprise policies to control and manage connectivity, security, failover, route-away, logging, transformation and translation, orchestration and context based decisioning. The run-time context (real-time performance, cost, availability, quality-of-service (QOS), run-time characteristics such as resource usage and availability) may be measured and fed-back or made available to any node of the service mediation framework or to the enterprise repository itself to enable situation specific actions (context aware decisions).","Examples of the types of metadata stored in an integrated metadata repository may include the name of a given service request, the network route that needs to be taken to reach a service provider for each service request, logging information related to the service request, the expected amount of time for getting a response to the service request, and the like. In general, metadata may include any piece of information that defines the interaction between a service requestor and a service provider, determines the route that a service request must take to get to a service provider, and\/or authenticates or authorizes a service request. The policy definition server may store a separate copy of all the information within the integrated metadata repository and additional data, including a list of common functions for a given service and\/or the policies that guide the use of these functions. The policy definition server and\/or the integrated metadata repository may export a file in a standardized format (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML)) that any element (e.g., server) may process. The exported file may include information that allows the servers within a network to communicate about services via common protocols.","In certain aspects, the policy definition server and\/or integrated metadata repository may define enough policies and metadata to cover all or a vast majority of all of the interaction points within an entity such as an organization. In some embodiments, the policy definition server and\/or integrated metadata repository may export the policy information for service requests in a standard way. The data stored in and transmitted by the integrated metadata repository, the policy definition server, and\/or the enhanced service DNS server  may be in a variety of formats, including XML.","In this way, if an organization (e.g., a financial institution, and the like) adds a new feature that depends on a web service to its corporate network, the wait time for integrating the new feature to the corporate network may be reduced drastically. Thus, potential delays to market share that depend on this new feature may also likewise be reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["101","301","303","101"]},"Next, in step , the enhanced service DNS server  may access service policies related to opening a new bank account from the integrated metadata repository and\/or the policy definition server. For instance, these service policies may detail how service requests for opening a new bank account are routed to a service provider (e.g., a server handling new accounts, and the like). Relevant service policies accessed may also detail whether or not the service requestor is authorized to receive this service. The enhanced service DNS server  may also access any number of other service policies related to opening a new bank account, including those related to work-load management, the generation of performance and\/or access logs, protocol bridging, format translation, filtering, and business process management.","Based on the entitlement policies accessed in step , the enhanced service DNS server  may determine if the service requestor is authorized to open a new bank account in step . If the service requestor is not authorized to receive the service, the process may move to step  where access to the service is denied. In this case, the process may move back up to step  where the process may restart when a new service request is made.","If the service requestor is authorized to receive the service, the process may move to step  where the enhanced service DNS server  may route the service request to the appropriate service provider (as determined by the routing policies accessed from the integrated metadata repository and\/or policy definition server) for opening a new bank account. The data transmitted to the service provider may also include any other relevant information related to the service request, such as any of the other policy information accessed by the enhanced service DNS server  in step .","Next, the process may move to step  where the enhanced service DNS server  may receive a response from a server configured to handle requests for new bank accounts. This response may include a new bank account number, the minimum balance associated with the account, access authorization credentials for the account, and any number of other pieces of information. Once the enhanced service DNS server  receives this information, server  may transmit the response to the service requestor in step . In some embodiments, the enhanced service DNS server  may have to contact the integrated metadata repository and\/or policy definition server to route the response back to the requestor; in other embodiments, the enhanced service DNS server  may store the routing mechanism to the service requestor in an internal memory when the initial service request is made.","If the same user or a different user decides at a later time that another service request to open a new bank account must be made, the enhanced service DNS server  may contact the integrated metadata repository and\/or policy definition server to determine if any changes have been made to the metadata\/data governing any of the policies (e.g., routing, and the like) related to the service request. If no changes have been made to the relevant service policies, the enhanced service DNS server  may handle the second service request in the same fashion as before. On the other hand, if changes have been made to the relevant service policies, the enhanced service DNS server  may automatically update the way that the new service request is fulfilled. For instance, if a new routing policy is specified for satisfying the service request, the enhanced service DNS server  may route the service request to a new server.","Using this process, the name of a service (rather than just a URL) may be requested and the enhanced service DNS server  may be configured to access information to determine the appropriate routing mechanism for the service request. By using the enhanced service DNS server , any modifications to service policies may be implemented by making a change within a single policy definition server rather than a collection of DNS servers. In this way, the routing of a service request to an appropriate destination may be driven by data for DNS rather than by a manual process.","Aspects of the invention have been described in terms of illustrative embodiments thereof. Numerous other embodiments, modifications and variations within the scope and spirit of the appended claims will occur to persons of ordinary skill in the art from a review of this disclosure. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the steps illustrated in the illustrative figures may be performed in other than the recited order, and that one or more steps illustrated may be optional in accordance with aspects of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example and is not limited in the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals indicate similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
