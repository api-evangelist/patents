{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/199,950, filed Jul. 19, 2002, which has since issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,379,978 on May 27, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The invention relates to an electronic item management and archival system.","Individuals, businesses, government agencies, and other institutions of all types issue checks and similar financial documents to make payments in the United States and internationally. There is a well-defined and well-known process within the banking system that supports checks as a payment mechanism. Included within this process is the practice of imaging checks and performing document management on the imaged checks. Example document management processes include archiving and storing the imaged checks. After the checks are archived and stored, later document management processes can include querying the archive and retrieving stored documents from the archive.","Similarly, there are countless numbers of other industries that require archiving, storing, querying, and retrieving of images, audio recordings, or video recordings.","The invention provides an electronic item management and archival system for managing and archiving items. Each item includes at least one of image data, audio data, and video data. The system includes an item-generation device configured to provide items and a server in communication with the item-generation device. The server is configured to receive the items from the item-generation device, archive at least one of the received items to an archive, and retrieve at least one of the archived items from the archive. In some embodiments, the server includes architecture that supports a pool of threads promoting multiple, independent archive and retrieve operations concurrently. Some embodiments of the invention can further include a storage device in communication with the server. The storage device is configured to receive the archived items from the server and store the received items.","The invention also provides a host machine for an electronic item management and archival system. The host machine includes a communications endpoint that receives items, a processor connected to the communications endpoint, and software executable by the processor. In some embodiments, the software includes instructions that create one or more virtual servers. The one or more virtual servers include at least one server that facilitates independent and concurrent communication between multiple Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) applications and at least one server that creates and manages an archive.","The invention further provides a method of managing an archive having items. Each item including a virtual object and query data associated with the virtual object. Each virtual object is selected from the group consisting of image data, audio data, and video data. The method includes providing a plurality of items, archiving at least one of the provided items to an archive, querying the archive, retrieving at least one of the archived items from the archive, and repeating one or more of the providing, archiving, querying, and retrieving acts. In some embodiments, the method also includes structuring a bus that allows two or more of the providing, archiving, querying, retrieving, and repeating acts to occur concurrently.","The invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. The terms \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d and \u201cmounted\u201d are used broadly and encompass both direct and indirect connections, couplings, and mountings. In addition, the terms \u201cconnected\u201d and \u201ccoupled\u201d are not restricted to physical or mechanical connections or couplings. As used herein the terms \u201cmachine,\u201d \u201ccomputer,\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d are not limited to a device with a single processor, but may encompass multiple devices (e.g., computers) linked in a system, devices with multiple processors, special purpose devices, devices with various peripherals and input and output devices, software acting as a computer or server, and combinations of the above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"As used herein, the term \u201cimage\u201d data refers to data (or a file having data) that represents an image of a physical object. For example, the physical object can be a document (e.g., a financial document) and the \u201cimage\u201d is data representing an image of the object. For another example, the physical object can be a form having entered information and the \u201cimage\u201d is data representing the completed form. Example original documents include checks (e.g., for a demand deposit account (DDA)), signature cards, driver's licenses, photographs, applications (e.g., loan applications), reports, and other related documents. The term \u201cvideo\u201d data refers to data (or a file having data) that represents a plurality of images. The term \u201caudio\u201d data refers to data (or a file having data) that represents one or more sounds. The original image, plurality of images, or sound(s) are referred to as an \u201cactual\u201d object, and the item includes a \u201cvirtual\u201d object representing the actual object.","Unless specified otherwise, the term \u201cimage\u201d is used below to include \u201cimage\u201d data, \u201cvideo\u201d data, or \u201caudio\u201d data representing an object. For simplifying the description below and unless specified otherwise, the EIMA system  is described in connection with check processing and the image is an image (front or back) of the check. However, the invention is not limited to check processing, and a claim should not be limited to check processing unless check processing is specifically recited within the claim.","Further, while an EIMA system  is described in detail below, not all aspects of the system are required in all embodiments. Rather, some embodiments include only some of the components and\/or perform only some of the operations described below. Additionally, other embodiments can include additional components and\/or include additional operations that are not disclosed below but nonetheless can be incorporated with the EIMA system .","I. EIMA System","As shown in , one embodiment of the invention comprises the EIMA system  that includes one or more item-input devices , one or more host servers , one or more workstation computers , and one or more peripheral devices . Each of these elements is described below.","A. Item-Input Device","In general, the item-input device  provides information regarding a plurality of images (e.g., checks) to the host server . As used herein, the term \u201cinformation\u201d is broadly construed to comprise images and data relating to or obtained from the images. For example, if the provided information relates to checks, then the information may include the front and back images of each check and data (e.g., MICR data obtained from the check) obtained from each check. The image(s) and data for one document form an item. Example item-input devices (also referred to as item-generation devices) include scanners, check transports, video generation devices having a camera or similar component, sound generation devices having a microphone or similar component, and data feeds for receiving data from other devices (e.g., web feeds from other devices or feeds that receive previously stored data including items).","The item-input device  includes a controller  configured to control the input device  and\/or to receive input data. The controller is configured to provide one or more \u201cthreads\u201d  of data. Additionally, although only one item-input device is shown in , the EIMA system  can include multiple item-input devices  (a second is shown in phantom) providing multiple \u201cthreads\u201d of information to one or more host servers  via a network connection . However, unless specified otherwise, the description below is for a system  having only one item-input device, and is specifically a check scanner.","1. Example Item-input Device","In one embodiment, the item-input device  includes a NCR 7780 scanner having multiple scanning components. The scanner scans financial documents (e.g., checks) and obtains related financial data from the document in a well-known manner. For example, the related financial data can include magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) information (account numbers, check numbers and related data, depending on specifics of the documents recorded, and the institution requirements), optical character recognition OCR information, and similar information. The resulting images can be in any format (e.g., .jpeg, .tif, .bit, etc.).","The item-input device  also includes a controller  that, among other things, communicates with the scanner (e.g., via a LAN) to receive information from the scanner and to communicate the information to other components (e.g., to the host server ). Example controllers include a computer (e.g., a PC) having software executed by the computer to configure the computer, a specially designed electronic device having programmable logic executed by the electronic device to configure the device, or application specific or special purpose circuits.","The item-input device  also has a sorter (e.g., a hard-wired sorter or a virtual sorter), which may be part of the scanner or the controller. The sorter includes a rule-based engine having rules that control the flow of the resulting scanned images and related data. That is, checks are provided to the scanner in a commingled relationship, the scanner scans the checks to create one or more images, the scanner obtains data relating to the checks, and the rule-based engine performs front-end processing on the checks to sort the checks. For a simple example, the rule-based engine may specify that a check having transit number \u201cA\u201d be provided on thread A and a check having transit number \u201cB\u201d be provided on thread B. The rule-based engine can include any number of rules to sort the checks. For other embodiments, the rule-based engine can include rules based on different image (or video or audio) items (e.g., different types of checks, different types of financial documents, etc.). In yet other embodiments, the host server  can include the virtual sorter.","The controller  further includes one or more connections (e.g., an Ethernet connection) that connect the scanner to the host server . The connection between the controller  and the host server  can be a direct connection or an indirect connection (e.g., via a network such as an intranet or the Internet).","As will be discussed further below, information travels throughout the system  using \u201cthreads.\u201d Each thread  contains information (e.g., a plurality of items) having one or more similar characteristics. Because of the similar characteristics, the same operations are performed on the information contained in a thread . For example, the information can be routed to a specific host server  or a specific storage device (discussed below). As will become more apparent below, the concept of utilizing multiple threads (and consequently performing multiple processes) can be utilized throughout the whole system .","B. Host Server","The EIMA system  includes a host server  that runs software. As used herein the term software is broadly construed to include computer programs, procedures, modules, data, etc. executable by one or more processors. The software includes software modules (also referred to herein as applications) that are executed by the host server to perform one or more processes or supporting functions. Some of the software modules result in the host server having \u201cvirtual\u201d servers. The host server  is a Hewlett Packard V-Series server in one embodiment of the invention.","In some embodiments, the host server  receives information, including images and related data, from the item-input device ; processes the information; archives the information; receives instructions or requests from the workstation ; performs operations based on the received instructions or requests; and communicates information to the workstation  or to the one or more peripheral devices . An example of such a server is the Titan 4.0 server offered by ImageSoft Technologies of Maitland, Fla.","For the EIMA system shown, the host computer includes the servers listed in TABLE 1. It should be noted that not all of the servers described below are required for all embodiments and the EIMA system  can include additional servers not described below. The titles of the servers and the division of the functions of the servers are for explanatory purposes only.

For the embodiment described herein, the bus is based on a CORBA architecture. Other architectures can also be used without departing from the invention.","In general, the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (\u201cCORBA\u201d) is a standard created by the Object Management Group (\u201cOMG\u201d) that enables operation between different computers, operating systems, and programming languages (e.g., distributive computing). The CORBA standard generally specifies how client applications may invoke requests on server objects. CORBA specifies the Object Request Broker (\u201cORB\u201d) that allows applications to communicate with one another regardless of where the applications reside on a network. Using a standard Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (\u201cIIOP\u201d), a CORBA-based program from a vendor, on almost any computer, operating system, programming language, and network, may communicate with a CORBA-based program from the same or another vendor, on almost any other computer, operating system, programming language, and network. The IIOP specifies how ORBs communicate over networks and can utilize TCP\/IP implementation of a General Inter-ORB Protocol (\u201cGIOP\u201d). The GIOP defines aspects of ORB communication including how messages are sent, how bytes are ordered, and how parameters are arranged for remote object invocations.","Creation of a distributed computing system based on the CORBA standard can generally begin with an outline of desired functionality and translation of the design into software objects. The objects are expressed in terms of Interface Definition Language (\u201cIDL\u201d) interfaces and collected into related modules. In one embodiment of the invention, the IDL is utilized for creation of Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) definitions that define how the client and host server systems communicate. One or more IDL files are compiled to generate stub code and skeleton code. The stub code becomes the interface that client applications use to initiate an operation from a server and is programming language independent. The skeleton code provides the interface to object implementations that the host and\/or virtual servers may provide. Libraries provided through the IDL compilation provide the mechanism for communication between client and host server processes. The CORBA specification ensures that this communication be platform and language independent. Host and\/or virtual server applications are created for publishing the object references by name through a naming service and, upon the request of a client application, a reference to a generic CORBA object is returned. This object reference is then narrowed to the stub representation of the remote CORBA object. The client can then invoke operations through the stub reference as if the object was local to the client. Requested operations from the client application are sent to the skeleton reference obtained through the naming service. Using the ORB, CORBA IDL stubs and skeletons serve as a connection between client and server application threads. In addition, each client and server can have threading definitions defined in a Portable Object Adapter (POA), which controls the communication to a CORBA Object by associating the object with the ORB. Each POA service may use single threaded or multiple-threaded communication protocols and the multiple-threaded protocols may be further defined as \u201cpools\u201d of threads or as a thread per client. The machine independence of the CORBA standard, as utilized by embodiments of the invention, allows for multiple processes to communicate across machines, platforms, and languages, thereby providing a distributed computing environment.","In another embodiment, the CORBA communication protocols are utilized to abstract client and server interactions. Using the IDL, APIs are created that separate the architecture logic. Therefore, the CORBA communication layer acts to \u201chide\u201d or \u201cmask\u201d the host and virtual servers from the client or business logic. Each server process in the EIMA system  can be defined to utilize the multiple-threaded \u201cpools\u201d of threads, thereby allowing non-blocking calls to be handled from a large number of client applications. Each client application can be handled independently and, therefore, do not block each other during communication with the servers. The name service and event service, defined by the CORBA specification, are used to handle name lookups for services and event routing or channeling. In addition, a host or virtual server may execute multiple Generic-Input Applications (\u201cGIAs\u201d), statement prints, and exports at the same time, all of which may execute independent of each other and interact separately with an archive or database. Implementation of the CORBA bus in this embodiment also includes providing object services for use by multiple distributed object programs. These services include domain-independent interfaces such as the naming service, a trading service, a repository service, an indexing service, a set service, a parameter service, a log service, an application service, and a redundancy\/replication service. The services are available to CORBA objects and a client may initiate multiple services if desired. For example, a client application may invoke multiple services when interfacing data with input\/output (\u201cI\/O\u201d) devices. Alternatively, multiple threads can exist within the services themselves. For example, depending on the operation, a user or client may invoke multiple threads within the repository service. In some embodiments, the EIMA system may also implement a factory concept whereby a server is a service \u201cfactory\u201d that handles queries each time a client connects and requests an individual session. Each session manages its own client and then allows for the abstraction and separation of logic for multiple client applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 50","b":["5000","5005","5010"]},"2. Applications","In addition to the software already described above, the host server  includes additional modules that interact with the one or more workstations to perform additional operations. This suite of modules generally comprise two sets of modules: 1) management programs and utilities (collectively referred to as management programs), and 2) Web-based user programs. The management programs allow an administrator to control the host server and, more broadly, the EIMA System. The Web-based programs, which run in a Web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer), are accessed from an EIMA Web site and allow users to perform operations (e.g., perform queries, print statements, export objects, etc.) on the archive. Various software modules that interact with the workstation are summarized in TABLE 2 and are further discussed in detail in the operation section. Similar to the servers, not all of the modules described below are required for all embodiments and the host server can include additional modules not described below. The titles of the modules and the division of the functions of the modules are for explanatory purposes only. One or more functions performed by the modules may be combined with other modules.

The GIA is an application that receives data from the scanner , performs operations on the data (e.g., for consistency), and archives the data to one or more databases. The one or more databases form an archive (discussed further below). Example operations performed by the GIA include: Image Capture, Image Match, MICR Exit, Batch Update, and MICR exit.","Before proceeding further, it should be noted that an identifier used for identifying a particular component, application, tool, engine, operation, act, button, etc. is for identifying that component, application, tool, engine, operation, act, button, etc. only, and should not be limiting. For example, the term \u201cImage Capture\u201d identifies an application used by the EIMA system  for capturing images. Other terms for identifying the application could be used in place of \u201cImage Capture.\u201d","The operations of some of the applications in TABLE 2 are briefly described below. A more detailed discussion of these applications are further discussed in the operations section below.","a. Image Capture","Image Capture allows a user to import images through 1) scanning documents into an archive and then using Image Match (discussed below) to insert images into the database, 2) importing raw files from disk or tape, 3) importing TIFFs or other objects, or 4) importing text documents using the Import Server.","b. Image Match","Image Match verifies the contents of an image database with a user-supplied match control file (MCF) and prepares the images for Image Print. The Image Match process verifies that all images expected for capture were captured and that no extra images exist. Images referenced in the MCF but not found in the database are referred to as missing items. Images in the database but not referenced by the MCF are called free items. After the images are validated by this process, they can be printed with statements (Match for Print). When Image Match is complete, it generates Missing and Free Items reports and appends a record to an Audit report, which lists the processing statistics.","c. Batch Update","The Batch Update feature lets the user update user fields in a query table after the cycle has been ingested into the archive database. In Batch Update, the user loads data from a specified source file or tape in a temporary table. This data file can include all or some of the items in a cycle. The EIMA system  finds matches in the cycle with items in the file. Only matched items will be updated with the fixed data in the input file. Batch Update is an option that appears at the end of an Image Match session.","d. Image Print","Image Print controls the statement printing process. It combines statement text data in the print control file (PCF) with the images from the image database to produce statements with images, instead of original items. The resulting imaged statement can be sent directly to the printer and\/or to tape for offline printers, mainframe printers, or selective reprints. When the Image Print process has completed, a record that lists the processing statistics is appended to the Audit report.","e. Archive and Optical and Tape Administration","The archive function is used to store, track, and access images as they are migrated from one type of storage device (discussed below) to another. When images are first captured, they are initially stored on the fastest retrieval media (local hard drive) or RAID. After the images have been retained on the hard drive for a designated period of time, they are migrated to other media for more permanent storage. The archiving and distribution functions enable the system to store images on optical disk or tape.","f. Reconciled Export","Reconciled Export allows the user to export and distribute the results of a query to a CD-ROM writer. In one embodiment, the exported images are written as compressed, tagged image file format (TIFF) graphic images. You can use Image Library Offline to view and organize the CD-ROM images.","C. One or More Peripheral Devices .","The one or more peripheral devices  include one or more memory devices for, among other things, maintaining the archive. The one or more memory devices can include RAID, optical storage, tape-storage and similar storage devices. The one or more memory devices store a plurality of databases that form an archive, which can be of various types including \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cdistributed.\u201d As will become more apparent below, a distributed archive can include multiple local archives.","1. Local Archive","An archive is designed to hold any type of item. That being said it is necessary to have routines to pass items to the archive, export items from the archive, and view items in the archive. In one embodiment, the local archive supports three storage media for image storage and one storage media for indexes.","The three media or tiers of the archive are RAID, Optical, and Tape. The composition of the archive is driven by cost, retrieval time, and\/or service agreements. Each media has its advantages and disadvantages. RAID is a random accessible media with the highest cost per byte of storage, but it is self-recoverable and very fast. The cost of this media is falling but it still remains expensive per byte compared to other media.","Optical is a random accessible media, which uses a jukebox to reduce the number of active drives required to provide a level of service. The media is never brought into direct contact with anything that will damage it and as a result it is a very reliable long-term storage media for high activity with long life. This media is the best of the three for long-term storage and retrievability without a duplicate backup. With the ability to use multiple drives at any point in time, this media is highly accessible at a much lower cost per byte stored and can provide the fast access necessary for on-line queries.","Tape is a serial media, which uses a silo to manage the tape media. This is viewed by many institutions as the preferred media for long-term storage even with the need to maintain a duplicate of each media to insure recoverability. The media is brought into contact with the read\/write heads and as a result is very susceptible to damage if used highly over a period of time. This media is the least expensive per byte stored but it is also the slowest media. The speed of the retrievals from this media is a direct function of the speed of the drives and the technique used to store the data on the media.","Each industry will have its own migration strategies relating to the movement of the images among levels of the archive. There are several methods to achieve this migration. The following discusses the different methods available to the institutions using an archive of the invention. Unlike previous archives, the archive of the invention moves images from any archive tier to any other archive tier. Also, through the use of different capture processes, the objects being received into the archive can be placed on any tier of the archive and any of the distributed archive locations at the same time. There are many considerations to doing this and just because the archive is capable of it does not mean that it is in the institutions' best interest to use this capability. Additionally, it should be understood that other aspects of the EIMA system  can use an archive of the prior art.","a. Migrate from the RAID Tier to the Optical Tier to the Tape Tier","This is the traditional method used by institutions and it allows the institution to purchase the least expensive solution while providing a system that supports good response time and the ability to optimize the data that is stored. This method allows the user to do all repair work on the object and deletion of extra objects prior to the migration to the next level of the archive. Some institutions will migrate from the RAID tier once maintenance is complete to both the Optical and Tape tier at the same time. Many institutions have the ability to store the object at capture time on all Tiers of the archive used by the site. This capability is available through the use of the prime pass capture capability, but the institution looses the ability to optimize the storage of objects identified later. The institution will inherently use more storage because the objects that are deleted during maintenance remain present on the slower tiers of the archive using space even though they are not accessible due to the deletion of the indexes.","b. Direct Capture to any Tier","This is available with the archive of the invention. In one implementation, the capture controller software takes a match control file (MCF) file from the mainframe that has the database to which the item is to be sent, and the document identification number (DIN) number of the item as part of the MCF entry. This allows the capture controller to read the MCF, populate all the data fields, use the DIN number to pull the item images, and send the item down the thread to the proper database. An advantage to the institution of this type of activity is that it avoids the time-consuming migration process from one media type to another. However, a detriment to the institution is that this method does not provide any method of optimizing the way objects are moved to the slower tiers of the archive so as to allow for retrievals that will roughly match the higher speed tiers of the archive.","c. Current Migration Strategy","To avoid the need to go through very time consuming reorganizes of the storage, the objects are migrated in large blocks, which, for example, can represent a days capture. Until all the objects in a block have been migrated, the block space cannot be freed for the storage of new objects. This method works well for all parts of the archive that have random access and if the long term archive tier is used very sparingly this method will also work for the serial tier of the archive. Because many institutions want to go to two tier archives it has become necessary to provide a migration strategy that will organize the object placed on the serial media in a way that will facilitate the optimal retrieval of the objects from this tier. The following defines this optimal migration strategy.","d. Organized Migration Strategy","This method can be used most effectively when an institution has a minimum number of days (e.g., 45 days) of RAID object storage. In this case, the migration takes place over a ten-day period for the previous thirty days of items on the archive. One tenth of the previous 30 days is migrated to tape every day so that after ten days all the items have been migrated. Of course, a different proportion can be used. These items are organized on the tape according to what data elements are used the most to retrieve the object. Once all the items have been migrated from this 30-day period, all the objects are deleted in a way so as to keep the number of days defined in the service level agreement (SLA) on the high-speed tier and the space is freed for the capture of additional objects. Once there is 30 days of un-migrated data on RAID, the 10-day migration cycle begins again. This method of migration is tailored to the maximum retrieval speed of objects on the long-term archive. With 45 days of RAID, the user has the long-term archive optimized on a 30-day bases and the days of storage are used in the following way:\n\n","e. Capture to Database","This capability allows the capture of any object into any database on either a collective basis or an individual object basis. When a capture is started it can be directed into a specific database or, through the use of a front-end capture routine, can route the individual objects to different databases based on the accompanying index data. In the case of an item-processing department, this means that transit items can go to one-database and on-us items to a different database. This also means that the banks that process for other banks can route the items for each of its bank customers to its own database.","2. Distributed Archive","a. Introduction","When an institution outgrows a single site environment or would like to have more than one active system to back-up data, a distributed archive can be used. The distributed archive feature allows some embodiments of the invention comprising the EIMA system  to add data to multiple separate archives at multiple locations, while providing many threads of internal archive access. The feature supports maintenance and retrieval of archive data from the various sites, in addition to optional long-term storage sites within the network. Each location has all the capabilities identified as basic to the local archive but, through the distributed archive, capabilities appear to each application (e.g., Export, Statement Print, Query, etc.) as if the plurality of archives are one distributed archive.","In one embodiment, the distributed archive is server based and makes full use of the CORBA Bus. The distributed archive server makes all sites look and operate as one. This means that any function that operates at one location can have full access directly to all other locations within the security capabilities allocated to the distributed archive. The speed of the distributed archive is only constrained by the speed of the line connecting the geographically dispersed locations.","To manage the network traffic and to eliminate the delivery of duplicates, the distributed archive includes internal rules. Example internal rules include rules for routing request to the fastest service location and rules that allow for the removal of duplicates prior to responding to a query.","As shown earlier, through the use of the direct capture to a database capability, there is the ability to deliver items to many databases at the same time with each database on different media and locations. An update capability can be used to automate the updating of all locations that house the same item. This capability makes full use of the distributed archive capability of the system to find all locations housing an item that is being updated and then it also is used to update the same items held in different databases as well as at different geographical locations.","In some embodiments, the distributed archive provides the institution with the ability to have different geographical locations, provides full \u201chot\u201d backup for other locations without forcing the purchase of full redundant hardware at each location and\/or different physical servers in a single location (or any combination of physical servers and geographical locations), and\/or provides hot backup for other locations (or servers), thus leveraging the use of existing and planned hardware. The loss of a single geographical location does not effect the retrieval of requested information from sites that are operational and, if the same data is redundant in an alternate location, the request is be fully satisfied automatically from the alternate site. If the data is not held at an alternate location or has not arrived at the alternate location, the requesting user is provided with all available data and is notified that a site is down that may have additional data and that the user may want to request that data at a later time. When the site that is down comes back on line, it will connect back into the network automatically and without the involvement of institution personnel.","If the distributed archive is used with a hot backup strategy, then it can be coupled with the appropriate migration strategy. If the institution has enough bandwidth on their network, this synchronization is done through the network. If the institution's network is not robust enough to handle the volume created by image data, it will be moved via tape. When tape is used to synchronize the archives, then, when the tape arrives at the remote location and is loaded into the appropriate tier of the archive, the indexes at the distributed location are updated and a verification record is forwarded to the originating location identifying the fact that the synchronization tape has arrived and is now in the remote location. If no synchronization record arrives after a period of time, a new tape is created to replace the original tape.","Although specific installations may vary on the basis of hardware and\/or network configuration, the functionality remains the same for some embodiments of the invention. The use of CORBA and Java enable the EIMA system  to run on any operating system and hardware, regardless of platform, database, operating system, programming language or network hardware\/software used. The distributed architecture is highly scaleable and is sufficiently dynamic to accommodate a verity of potential archive systems. Further, the Java programming enables the system to link to other Web-centric applications (e.g., online banking).","In some embodiments, the distributed archive contains multiple sites all of which have the capability of querying across connected sites. A set of user-defined rules determines the level of query capability accorded to each user of the system. Query capability is the functionality of being able to search the system indexes on the basis of an individual object attribute or combination of object attributes to find the token necessary to retrieve the desired object. Query capability can be either local or global. Retrieval of an object on the basis of a call with a token argument is not considered query capability, it is simply a retrieval operation supported by a low-level media specific local index.","Upon the completion of either prime pass capture, utilizing Image Import, re-pass capture, MICR repair, match and missing\/free item resolution (all of which are discussed further below), a captured items index is stored and available for query and retrieval. If any changes occurred in the index data as a result of any of these activities and the objects have already moved to the alternate location(s), then update index data should automatically be forwarded to all locations now housing the object. Access to these items, as well as items captured at other sites within the distributed environment, will be facilitated by the appropriate distribution Proxy(s). The Proxy Servers provide the ability to submit requests and return responses from multiple distributed locations without any user intervention. This ability to satisfy individual query and retrieval requests by gathering responses from multiple sites is the foundation of Distributed Archive.","Items captured at a particular site can remain at that site on any installed and supported media (magnetic disk, optical platter or tape) for as long a period as is suitable to the needs of the installation. This time period could be as short as one day or could be counted in years. Additionally, captured data can be exported in whole or in part to one or more Global Archive Sites at any time and then be deleted from the original source location once it is confirmed that the data has been successfully archived at the new site. This deletion indicator only indicates that the item is eligible for deletion. The actual deletion is governed by the local archive parameters.","In a purely geographically distributed archive, indexes reside on the same server as the tables showing the physical address of images on various media. To the system, physical locations may appear as a single virtual index.","b. Use of the Distributed Archive in Providing Institutions with Items.","In one embodiment, users of the distributed archive are institutions with multiple facilities that are used for item processing. The institutions typically have network connections between the associated sites (e.g., a WAN). However, the system configuration can be adapted based on the user's access needs, locality of reference, and desire to modify existing network connectivity. The network speed and traffic pattern can dictate the objects are moved via sneaker-net via the high-speed network. An institution having the distributed archive can also be a very large processing center which has many clustered capture platforms, each operating independently, but to the user being viewed as a single unit.","In some embodiments, every location is considered a master location; there are no slave or redundant locations. When objects are moved from one location to another, that data is imported into the new location and the introduction of a new item into an archive cause no action except the update of the object and index archive. If any index item is read for the purpose of updating a query, the index item is set to all locations to determine if that index set is held at a different location. All locations that respond instruct to make this index set read only for the duration of the update operation.","All updates to the indexes are distributed to all locations having the same index set. This is done by monitoring the write operations, retaining all the changes to the indexes, then issuing a distributed query for the item that was changed and sending the changes to all locations responding that this object is held at the location. If any location fails to respond, the update is held until a response is obtained from the location that the item updated is not housed. Once all sites are updated then the read only lock can be removed from all other locations.","Security features exist on two levels in some embodiments: 1) within the application and 2) through the login and password features provided by the database management system. The security facility within the application is used in establishing a connection to the database data server.","By consolidating similar objects together, the archive reduces the number of tapes involved in retrieval and makes more objects available on a single tape storage media. As an example, if a subpoena was received for all items that were received for an account over the previous 4 years, this request would be processed as follows:","(Present Process) Each cycle is migrated to tape and depending on the size of the tape there can be any number of cycles on a tape. For purposes of this example there will be only one cycle per tape and one required object per tape. With 260 cycles per year this would mean to satisfy this request would mean that it would be necessary to mount 1040 tapes less the number of cycles still on tiers 1 and 2 assuming at least one item is received daily.","(Organized Migration Strategy) The number of days of items on a single tape is a function of the number of days of tier 1 storage that the institution has purchased (see Organized Migration Strategy earlier in this document). If there are 45 days of tier 1 storage, then a single tape will have 30 cycles worth of objects for this account grouped together on a single tape. This would mean that to satisfy the request the system would only have to mount 35 tapes less the number of cycles still on tier 1 and 2. This represents 3.37% of the mounts when compared to the prior art systems and the number of mounts will go down in direct relationship to the number of days of tier 1 storage that is maintained.","In some embodiments, the virtual sorter front-end to GIA provides the ability to take a feed from any device either prime pass or re-pass and route the objects through the use of rules to any database. The database thread to which the item is routed retains its ability to have a MICR exit tied to that thread only. When the transaction exit capability is added to the virtual sorter the institution now has the ability to populate a transaction identification field identified in the class definition for the type of object being captured. The composition of a transaction is defined by rules contained in the exit and is independent of the rules used to route an object to a database. The application of the transaction rules is done prior to the application of the routing rules.","The following example is how item processing can use the above capabilities to maintain the content of a deposit as a transaction:\n\n","Once the objects are in the archive the user can make use of the index database and define different views of the archive based on how the user wants to use the items in the archive. The transaction field may or may-not be part of the data used to create these specialized views. In most cases these workflow related archive views will be only available for specified periods of time and will be used for very special work processing.","Through the use of this capability the user can structure any views they please of the archive no matter whither the items are held in the archive in different databases at their local facility or at different locations. In the case of the financial institution these views can include: all-items in Capture Sequence, cash letter (which can have multiple document types tied together by unique deposit identification), on-us (or account) number order, route\/transit number order, exception items (which can be by type, institution, etc.), high dollar amount, etc.","c. Site Management Reports","To better manage the distributive archive it may be necessary to provide more and better reports on what is going on within the archive. These reports can take the form of screen and paper reports, and can be used to balance the transaction activity within the archive.","As an example of a management report, the system can balance the number of items received from a sorter with the number of items sent. Further, the system can balance the number of images that should have been sent against the number received and archived by database. In one embodiment, these reports address all parts of the system in such a way that there is no function performed in the system without appropriate balancing and management reports. This balancing and management reporting can include: capture, export, print, queries, and inventory.","d. Performance Requirements","The performance of the distributed archive is largely dependent upon the network configuration. The system architecture is designed to minimize the data to be sent over the network by limiting network activity to remote procedure calls and image movement upon query requests only. Large data movement between archive sites is targeted for high-volume media such as tape. However, nothing in the system design will preclude the use of a network for large-scale image movement for institutions who wish to invest in network communications with sufficient bandwidth to support that activity.","e. Export to a Remote Archive","Export to a remote archive allows for data captured at any site to be exported to any other location. The export media can be a tape, which can then be physically transported to another site. Alternately, the network connection can be utilized for an export to a remote site. Export can also be directly to an NFS mounted UNIX file system or a PC based Remote File System (RFS).","Once transported to the new site, the information can be reingested into the remote archive through the GIA module. Once the data is successfully ingested into the archive a message can be sent to the originating site indicating that the original data has been successfully migrated and it can be deleted when its retention time expires.","Due to the large volumes of data to be exported, the exported data will be drawn directly from the local archive as the export is in progress, only a catch large enough to insure maximum network transmission speed will be maintained.","f. Example","An example of a distributed archive  configured in accordance with some embodiments of the invention is shown in . Site A sends its data to Site B for backup and Site B sends its data to Site A for backup. Since Site C does not have a tape silo and it keeps only 180 days on raid and optical. Site C sends their data to both Site A and Site B. For this embodiment, there are two copies of Site C's information. The end result is that there are two copies of all data. Distributive Archive allows multiple copies to be at multiple locations and allows a site (e.g., Site C) to search multiple sites. Site C can use the distributed network to obtain the data as fast as possible and based on its location and the network speed to either Site A or Site B.","g. Functional Description","For a local archive, a Repository Proxy Server manages communications with Optical Repository, Tape Repository and Disk Repository. For a distributive archive, in one configuration, each repository creates a Remote Repository Proxy. The Remote Repository Proxy communicates with the local Optical Repository, Tape Repository, and Disk Repository, but it will also log into the remote buses locations and communicate with the Optical Repositories, Tape Repositories, and Disk Repositories (See ).","When the Remote Repository Proxy is called, it is provided with a list of items needed. The indexes are retrieved without starting actual image retrieval until the user tags the image as needed. A similar proxy can be used for the index database.","h. Other Peripheral Devices ","As will become apparent below, the one or more peripheral devices  can include other devices such as a printer (e.g., Xerox, IBM, and HP-PCL compatible printers) for printing statements, an optical disc writer (e.g., a CD-ROM writer), a communications port for sending facsimile transmissions or electronic communication (e.g., email) transmissions, or other known peripheral devices.","D. One or More Workstations.","In some embodiments, the one or more workstations  provides an interface between the EIMA system  and a user or administrator, provides requests or instructions (both also referred to as inputs) to the host server  (which are initiated by the user or administrator), receives information from the host server  (e.g., originating from the archive), and provides information to the user. An example workstation is a personal computer. However, other workstations are possible including Unix machines, laptop computers, handheld devices, Internet appliances, and similar devices. The operation of the workstations for initiating an application (e.g., a query, an export, a statement printing, etc.) are further described in the operations section below.","A diagram of one workstation  is shown in . One specific workstation is an Intel\u2122 based computer employing a Windows\u2122 operating system and an Explorer\u2122 browser. Other types of computers with appropriate operating systems can be used.","The workstation  includes a communications port  for communicating with the host server , one or more input devices, and a visual display unit . In one embodiment, the one or more input devices includes a keyboard  and a mouse  that allows a user to input data to the workstation . Other data input devices can be used including a keypad, trackball, touch screen, touchpad, pointing stick, microphone or similar device. The input devices  and  having a corresponding driver program stored in the workstation allowing the workstation to communicate with the input devices  and . The corresponding driver program for the mouse  is a pointer driver program that generates a \u201cpointer\u201d on the display unit . The pointer driver program allows the pointer to be moved on the visual display unit when a user manipulates the mouse  and to select items when the user pushes buttons on the mouse  in a prescribed order. Of course other input devices can have corresponding driver programs and can perform functionally similar to the mouse .","II. Operation","A. General Description","While the discussion herein relates to scanned documents (and specifically checks) other objects, including video and audio objects can be imported, archived, and exported. The names of the modules (or applications) below are for explanatory purposes only. The operations performed by most of the modules described below can be extended to other types of objects. Additionally, none of the modules described below are essential to the invention, although many embodiments use many of the modules.","1. Image Capture","Image Capture allows a user to import images through 1) scanning documents into the EIMA archive and then using Image Match (discussed below) to insert images into the database, 2) importing raw files from disk or tape, 3) importing TIFFs or other objects, or 4) importing text documents using the Import Server.","For checks, Image Capture inputs scanned images and associated MICR data and then stores the MICR data in a temporary table. Any records with invalid MICR data are automatically flagged for repair, and Repair GUI (discussed below) is used to validate these records.","2. Image Match","Image Match verifies the contents of the image database with a user-supplied match control file (MCF) and prepares the images for Image Print. The Image Match process verifies that all images expected for capture were captured and that no extra images exist. Images referenced in the MCF but not found in the database are referred to as missing items. Images in the database but not referenced by the MCF are called free items. After the images are validated by this process, they can be printed with statements (Match for Print). When Image Match is complete, it generates Missing and Free Items reports and appends a record to an Audit report, which lists the processing statistics.","3. Batch Update","The Batch Update feature lets the user update user fields in a query table after the cycle has been ingested into the archive database. In Batch Update, the user loads data from a specified source file or tape in a temporary table. This data file may include all or some of the items in a cycle. The EIMA system  finds matches in the cycle with items in the file. Only matched items will be updated with the fixed data in the input file. Batch Update is an option that appears at the end of an Image Match session.","4. Image Print","Image Print controls the statement printing process. It combines statement text data in the print control file (PCF) with the images from the image database to produce statements with images, instead of original items. The resulting imaged statement can be sent directly to the printer and\/or to tape for offline printers, mainframe printers, or selective reprints. When the Image Print process has completed, a record that lists the processing statistics is appended to the Audit report.","5. Archive and Optical and Tape Administration","The archive function is used to store, track, and access images as they are migrated from one type of storage device to another. When images are first captured, they are initially stored on the fastest retrieval media (local hard drive) or RAID. After the images have been retained on the hard drive for a designated period of time, they are migrated to other media for more permanent storage. The archiving and distribution functions enable the system to store images on optical disk or tape.","6. Reconciled Export","Reconciled Export allows the user to export and distribute the results of a query to a CD-ROM writer. In one embodiment, the exported images are written as compressed, tagged image file format (TIFF) graphic images. Image Library Offline can be used to view and organize the CD-ROM images.","B. Operation of One Embodiment of the EIMA System","1. Overview of the Main Menu of the Host Server as Accessed by a Workstation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0191"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","110","115","500","115","110","500","500","500"]},"Before most EIMA system  procedures can be performed, the user specifies the document type, database, and cycle on which the user wants a particular function to be run. However, setting the database and cycle is not a prerequisite for all EIMA procedures. For example, running Reconciled Export (discussed below) does not require the user to select a database and cycle. The user can tell which document type, database, and cycle is currently selected by viewing the text in brackets (, , and ) that appears after the first three main menu options. In the example shown in , the selected document type is Check, the database is TestDB_, and the cycle is 20010314. The user can change the document type, database, and cycle by entering text in the appropriate field.","2. Server Management","The user verifies that a server is running by checking if the server's abbreviation appears in the List of Servers on the Application Server Termination Program menu  (). If the server abbreviation appears on the list, then the server is running. If the server abbreviation does not appear on the list, then the server needs to be started.","To get to the menu of , the user selects the File Management & Utilities Menu option  (). At the File Management & Utilities Menu  (), the user enters the Drop Application Server(s) option . This results in the Application Server Termination Program Menu  being displayed. The Application Server Termination Program Menu  provides information on the status of each virtual server. For the embodiment shown in , the Application Server Termination Program Menu  uses abbreviations, which correspond to the servers shown in TABLE 1, and, if the server is listed, then the server is running. Further, entering the number of a server and then pressing Enter stops that server.","3. Image Capture","a. Overview","Image Capture should be performed for the desired documents before the user runs Image Match or Image Print. The user can import images into the EIMA system using the following methods: 1) Scanning documents into the archive and then using Image Match to insert images into the database, 2) importing raw file data from disk or tape (raw file import is used for testing only), 3) importing objects (e.g., TIFF images), 4) and importing text documents using the Import Server.","Image Capture transfers the document images and associated information (MICR code) from the scanning device to the host system, reviews each MICR code for correct syntax, stores the images and associated information in an image database, scans and stores the special images used by Image Print, and\/or adds a record to the Audit report that lists the processing statistics. The images and their associated MICR data are supplied from the scanning device(s).","(i) Parameters","Image Capture requires that the images and associated MICR data for a specific database\/cycle name and image capture parameters. The parameters that define Image Capture processing requirements are defined in a Default and Override Parameter files. The Default Parameter file is used by Image Capture each time it is executed. It is also used by all databases in the environment.","(ii) Quality Monitor","During Image Capture, Quality Monitor can display a sample of the images as they are added to the archive. Quality Monitor displays a new image according to the user-specified time increments (e.g., seconds). See the discussion for Repair GUI below for more information on using Quality Monitor.","(iii) Multiple Scanners","Multiple scanners are supported by executing separate copies of Image Capture software concurrently. The concurrently running copies of Image Capture can be output to separate databases or the same database. Access to a separate Main Menu  is required for each software copy of Image Capture.","(iv) MICR Errors","The user corrects any MICR errors detected by Image Capture by using MICR Repair. The user performs MICR repair any time after Image Capture is started. After Image Capture and MICR Repair have been completed, the user is ready to initiate the Image Match process to validate images and associated data against the match control file (MCF). After Image Match is complete, the user can run the Image Print process to print images and associated data on customer statements.","(v) Batch Tickets","If the user runs Incremental Match, the user can scan a batch ticket prior to scanning the corresponding batch of items or type the Batch ID at the Main Menu . A batch ticket is a MICR-encoded document that contains a four-character ID that uniquely identifies the batch. The batch ID is appended to the Match Control File name when the file is brought into the system using File Load. In this way, the scanned images are matched to the correct MCF.","b. Image Capture for Systems Using Match","The user begins Image Capture when he is ready to scan a new batch of items. If the user uses the Windows version of Quality Monitor, the Quality Monitor program is running on the client. Scanned images are stored in an image database that is identified by a unique combination of database and cycle name. When the user is ready to capture images, the user can create a new database and cycle for the new set of images or can append the images to an existing database. The database and cycle names may be predetermined by predefined procedures and the name can be related to a corresponding match control file (MCF).","In one embodiment, the user performs the following acts to capture document data and images into a database cycle:\n\n","c. Capture Recovery","If Capture terminates as a result of an user error or system problem such as a server returning an exception, the Capture Recovery process can accurately roll back tables and post information regarding the last item correctly ingested. The capture recovery process on the host system is as follows:\n\n","d. TIFF Image Import Utility","(i) Overview","The user can import TIFF images from tape, CD-ROM, a UNIX processor or other devices for the purpose of transferring images from a main location to a satellite location or for importing special document types. The TIFF Image Import Utility supports  (square tape), Quarter Inch Cartridge (QIC), CD-ROM, UNIX process, 8 mm tape, Digital Linear Tape (DLT), Tiff Import using GiaGate (imports directly into the archive without using Micr Repair\/Repair GUI or Image Match), and Import from third party applications.","(ii) Importing Tiff Images","To import TIFF images, the user performs the following acts to capture images from tape:\n\n","e. Overview of Importing Images","As an alternative to scanning the images directly into the Image Archive database through the Image Capture program, the user can use Image Import to convert an existing image database to the format used by Image Archive and use the Import server to import the images into the archive.","(i) Archive Import API","Due to the unique aspects of an existing image database, each client may need a specialized interface that connects to Archive Import API. The user can also use a Generic Importing Application offered by ImageSoft Technologies of Maitland, Fla. The Generic Importing Application (GIA) resides over the Archive Import API and acts as a socket server to more easily obtain the images from other platforms.","A ScanGate II program resides on the host system and is an import application that receives images from the network and imports them directly into the Archive database using the Archive Import API application. Although ScanGate II can accept images directly from an Image Soft scanner application, its main purpose is to receive images from another image system where the images have already been validated and associated with other control information. Images and data that have been ingested by ScanGate II are not sent to the ImageSoft MICR Repair system.","(ii) Image Sets","The existing image database may already have assigned names that identify the sets of images, but these names need to be converted to the format used by the Archive. During Image Import, a database\/cycle name is assigned to each set of images imported from the image database. For the EIMA system  described herein, the cycle name should be in the format YYYYMMDD, which typically represents the original processing date for the set of images. The database name\/set name typically represents the customer or business entity owning the images or if desirable this may represent the type of image.","4. Image Match","a. Overview of Image Match","For reconciliation purposes, Image Match is used to verify that data in the user-provided match control file (MCF) matches the captured data in the archive. Image Match also allows the user to view free items, move items, and insert missing items into the archive. The Match Menu also contains an option for clearing the currently selected match file. The Match procedure is performed after the user has scanned MICR data and images and resolved MICR problems, and before images can be queried and viewed in an image viewing program, such as Net Query (discussed below).","Image Match also provides ability to add additional search fields to each of the image records using Batch Update. Batch Update allows the user to update the captured data with additional field data that is not part of the original MICR data. For example, the user's company may require that a microfilm number be added as a search field to all the records in the captured data. Image Match further provides the ability to generate match statistics reports.","For the embodiment described herein, Image Match is required for Image Archiving and Distribution and Statement Generation. The Print server is used to organize images before statement generation (discussed below).","When documents are scanned, the data from the MICR line is captured and then ingested into the image capture index in the archive. When Image Match is run, data in the MCF is compared to the captured data in the archive. Image Match looks at specific fields in both sets of data, and then attempts to verify if the data matches or does not match. Following the Image Match process, a match statistics summary that details the results of the match session is displayed onscreen.","Each MCF record preferably contains MICR data, including the fields required for Image Match, group ID and period in statements, and user fields. Each record in the captured data contains information about the corresponding image including MICR data (made up of the account number, serial number, amount, transaction code, and transit\/routing number) and the fields required for retrieving the image from the database (e.g., the image location and the size of the image). The MICR data corresponding to the image may have been changed by a MICR Exit program to conform to the data provided in the MCF.","The Match Control Menu (MC) option  of the Main Menu () is used to access the Match Control menu, which includes a perform match option on the Match Menu to initiate match. ScanGate II users do not need to run Image Match for archiving and distribution.","b. Types of Match","For one embodiment, two levels of match are run. One level or both levels of match can be processed during Image Match. The user sets parameter to determine which fields are used to perform the match assessment. The actual fields that Image Match uses for data verification vary depending on the user's operational needs.","The first level of Image Match is by account field, serial field, and amount field. This type of match attempts to match the two sets of data using the account number, serial number, and amount fields; and then optionally, by the transaction code field and transit routing number field. If Image Match is unable to make a match against these fields, it will try to match the data against the account number field and the serial number field, and then, optionally, using the transaction code field and transit routing number field.","The second level of Image Match is by account field and amount field. This type of match attempts to match the two sets of data by comparing the account number field, and amount field, and then, optionally, by the transaction code and transit routing number fields. This match is used only after the other items in an account have been matched by the account number, serial number, and amount fields. Other criteria of levels for performing a match are possible.","c. Initiating Image Match","The Image Match process allows captured data and images to be available for query and viewing in the Net Query program. After running Image Match, missing and free items are generated, and the user can generate a Free Items report, a Match Statistics report, a Missing Items report, and an Audit report. In addition, Image Match can perform statement printing.","During an Image Match session, the user will have an option to run a batch update. Batch Update allows the user to update the captured data with additional field data that is not part of the original MICR data.","When performing a match, the match database and cycle should be selected. Additionally, the user should start (if not already running) the CORBA Name Server, the Set Server, the Bus Administrator Server, the Proxy Index Server, the Parameter Server, the Disk Repository Server, the Log Server, and the Repository Proxy Server before performing the match.","To run Image Match, the following acts are performed:","Open the Match Menu:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0236","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":["At the Main Menu , the user enters the Match Control Menu option , resulting in a Match Control menu  () opening. At the Match Control menu , the user navigates the software resulting in the initiation of the Image Match process.","The user then selects the Enter Batch ID option . A Batch ID list appears for the user's review. At the Batch ID list, the user selects the batches for the matching procedure. After selecting the batches, the user is returned to the Match Menu .","At the Match Menu , the user selects the Load Match Control File(s) option , resulting in an MCF File List being displayed. An example list  is shown in . The user then selects the correct MCF files from the MCF File List  corresponding to the batch files. After selecting the MCF files, the user is returned to the Match Menu .","At the Match Menu , the user selects the Perform Match option . This results in the Image Match process beginning. Upon completion, a summary of the match results displays and then the free item selection prompt appears.","The user can then perform a free item selection. After free item selection is performed, a directory of the defect items is displayed, and then the Batch Update prompt appears. At the Batch Update prompt, the user can populate the captured data with additional field data. A list of match summary results is displayed and then the Image Match process is completed and the user returns to the Match Menu ."]}}}},"d. Resetting Match","The resetting match options clears the temporary match space. For example, if user loads the wrong match file, resetting match will clear the match file, so that the user can load the proper match control file.","e. Correcting Free and Missing Items","If any missing or free items are noted in the onscreen match results summary, the user can correct these items and then rerun Match. Free items are extra images that have been noted in the capture data, but not in the match control file (MCF). Free items indicate that there is a discrepancy between the number of items in the capture data and the number of items in the MCF.","Missing items occur when there are records in the MCF with no corresponding images. There is usually a direct correlation between the number of free items and the number of missing items.","Free items can be the result of scanned items that do not belong in the current database cycle or incorrect MICR data. If a large percentage of free items appear on the report, there was likely a mechanical problem during Image Capture. It is possible that the wrong tray was scanned or not all of the trays were scanned. In this case, the user runs Image Capture again. If the percentage of free items is small, the discrepancies are probably the result of incorrect or illegible MICR data. In this case, the user needs to release the images to the MICR Repair workstation for correction. Once the MICR data is repaired, the user should be able to run Match again without error. To correct the unmatched items, the user performs the following acts in this embodiment of the invention:\n\n","5. Verify Capture","a. Overview of Verify Capture","If the image data is captured \u2018clean\u2019 (i.e., defective data has been repaired and the MICR exit has taken place), then after capture takes place, the index tables are set as matched. If, however, the user would still like to verify whether all the items that have passed to GIA are actually stored in the archive, then the user can provide a text file containing a user-defined set of fields to be matched against. The match fields can be configured through the parameter service. Verify Capture matches items in the file with rows in the Index table and provides reports with results of the match. Verify Capture provides match statistics, a list of missing items, a list of free items. The differences between Image Match and Verify Capture include: Image Match performs match incrementally, Verify Capture does not, Image Match only matches those items that are marked as \u201cunmatched\u201d and Verify Capture matches items that are already marked as \u201cmatched,\u201d Image Match updates a user-specified set of fields from items in the MCF file and Verify Capture does no updates.","To perform Verifying Capture, the user navigates from the Main Menu  to the Verify Capture option. Upon initiation of Verify Capture, the MCF file is loaded and matched against the database and cycle. The match results are displayed. The user can then generate capture reports.","6. Text File Batch Query (TFBQ)","a. Overview of Text File Batch Query (TFBQ)","To export a selected group of images to media such as a CD-ROM, the user can create a text file that includes query criteria and destination specifications. This file is called a Text File Batch Query (TFBQ).","The TFBQ can be created on a PC using any ASCII editor that does not embed formatting characters into the file. The file can also be created on a UNIX system using \u201cvi\u201d, the text editor for Unix systems. Once created the user creates the file, moves or copies the file to a directory on the host system and then executes the file to locate the images.","Each TFBQ includes of one or more queries or jobs. Jobs are written using the following guidelines:\n\n","7. Exporting Images","a. Overview of Reconciled Export","Reconciled Export allows the user to export check items and images that meet a specific criteria to a CD-ROM writer (other method of deliveries are possible). Once the job has been exported to the CD-ROM writer, the user can create CD-ROMs that contain the query results of the TFBQ. The CD-ROM's can then be distributed for viewing with an Image Library Offline program. An example Image Library Offline program is offered by ImageSoft Technologies of Maitland Fla. The scope of items that are exported to the CD-ROM writer is determined by the Export Job's query criteria. A text file batch query is used to specify each export job's query definition and destination specifications.","Prior to running Reconciled Export, the user should verify that the export job's query and export destination parameters are defined in the TFBQ, the export job's TFBQ and corresponding match control file (MCF) are placed in the correct directory, the export job's parameters are set in the job control file (JCF) and then placed in the correct directory, and the Export server is running.","During Reconciled Export, the user reviews the Job List report that is updated after the user starts the export process. The Job List report shows if any missing items have been found for a particular export job. If missing items have been detected, the user should correct these items and then rerun Image Match. A Missing Item report can be generated from the Export Reconciliation Menu. After a successful export, the export job is released to the CD-ROM writer for CD-ROM production.","b. Overview of the Job Control File","The Job Control File contains the parameters that are used to process an export job in Reconciled Export. These parameters define the export job's name and the directory locations of the files that contain the query specifications, and the MCF and report data. A job control file can contain multiple export jobs. Before running Reconciled Export, the job control file parameters should be set. The job control file parameters include JOB_NAME, TFBQ_FILE, and MCF_FILE parameters, which are typically required; and REPORT parameters, which is optional. The JOB_NAME parameter designates the name of the export job, which is generated before and after Reconciled Export. The TFBQ_FILE points to the location of the text file batch query (TFBQ) file in EIMA system. The TFBQ file contains the export job's query criteria and the destination specifications. The MCF_FILE points to the directory location of the match control file (MCF). During Reconciled Export, data in the MCF is compared to the captured data in the archive. The MCF contains the MICR data, the Group ID, and period in statements, and the query fields. The REPORT parameters point to the location of an optional report file.","c. Overview of the Job List Report","The Job List report is generated and updated during the Reconciled Export process to help the user track the progress of the user's export jobs. The Job List report shows the before and after status of the export jobs. Before items are exported, the Job List report lists the number of items that will be exported to the CD-ROM writer, and if any missing items were detected. After items have been exported to the CD-ROM writer, the Job List report shows the ID that was assigned to each export job.","The Job List report provides the batch that contains the items and images that will be exported to the CD-ROM writer based on the query criteria in the text file batch query (TFBQ), the Name of the job as specified in the job control file, the number of items that met the TFBQ's criteria and the number of items that will be exported to the CD-ROM writer, the number of items in the batch but missing from the MCF, and the number assigned to the export job. This number assigned to the export job can be used to track the progress of the export job. If the user uses the Job Manager or Resource Manager program, the same export ID number that appears in the Job List report is shown in both of these programs.","d. Running Reconciled Export","The Reconciled Export process enables the user to export images to a CD-ROM writer by loading the job control file that contains the query specifications. If missing items are detected, the user has the option of viewing a Missing Item Report.","To export images to a CD-ROM, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","8. File Management","a. Deleting a Cycle","The user can delete a database cycle from the following locations:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0313"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["SERVICE","DESCRIPTION"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["RAID repository","Selecting this option deletes the database cycle from"]},{"entry":[{},"the RAID repository."]},{"entry":["IDX service","Selecting this option deletes the database cycle from"]},{"entry":[{},"the module that keeps track of item descriptors or"]},{"entry":[{},"query tables."]},{"entry":["Set service","Selecting this option deletes the database cycle from"]},{"entry":[{},"the module that tracks database and cycle names"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"To delete a database cycle from one or all of the following locations, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","b. Deleting a Database","Deleting a database permanently removes the database from the archive. Before the user deletes a database, the user should delete all cycles within the database.","The user performs the following acts to delete a database:\n\n","c. Migrating from RAID to Optical","Migrating from RAID to optical allows the user to move a copy of the document data and image files in a particular database cycle from disk (RAID) to an optical device. The migration process enables the user to free up disk space. After the user has successfully migrated the files from disk to optical, the user can delete the database files from disk. The Optical Repository server and the Optical Robotic server need to be running. To migrate images from RAID to Optical, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","d. Restoring from Tape","The Restore procedure for multi-file backup is the same as the standard restore procedure except that now the system keeps track of cycles that the user has backed up and their corresponding tape Volume IDs. The system will request that the user mount the specific tape Volume ID for the cycle he has selected to restore.","9. Image Print","a. Overview of Print Server","The purpose of the Print Server is to allow the user to retrieve a subset of images from a database cycle for statement printing. For example, the user can have a database that contains all items for an entire month, or the user may want to pull out items for customers who require statement print. The user uses a match control file to match up the items that he wants to print. The user can then run statement print for the clients that require it.","The print server retrieves the objects directly from the archive database. Any objects received and placed into a new cycle are in a format that is immediately viewable by NetQuery. In addition, the Print Server allows the user to export print images to a remote server for printing purposes instead of on the main host system.","b. Retrieving Images using the Print Server","The following steps refer to two different servers: a main server and a receiving server. To retrieve images using the Print Server, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","c. Overview of Image Print","Image Print produces account statements with both text and images in some embodiments of the invention. Image Print retrieves images that are predetermined by Image Match from the image database, processes them, blocks them on a page, and formats them for a particular laser printer with the appropriate header information. It then merges the images with statement text data in an output data stream to a designated printer and\/or tape drive.","(i) Surrogates","If the user has defined surrogate images, they will be printed in place of any missing items during the Image Print process. Parameters for surrogate images may be defined using the Parameter Menu.","During the Image Print process, communications software controls the actual transmission of documents to the output device. The ability to format customer statements for output to a laser printer, and merge the statement text with the blocked images, is an important Image Print feature.","(ii) Different Statement Formats by Database","If the user wants to modify the format of statements by groups of account numbers, the user must place all image statements for a set of accounts in a single database and use the Parameter Menu to modify the format parameters. In addition, Image Print parameters provides the user with several options for increasing efficiency and controlling presentation of the final output.","Types of parameters the user can change by database include:","(a) Page Formatting","Arranges text information on statement and image pages. For images, the user can specify page size and margins, page numbering, duplex support, image placement, and image bordering. For text data, the user can specify font, print position, and include text lines on image pages. The user can add text such as serial number and amount on or under the images.","(b) Account Separator Images","The user can use Account Separator Images to separate multiple accounts associated with the same customer for consolidated printed statements. This is necessary when a customer (single customer number) has several accounts. The user can create up to 99 different line separators by using the Image Match line parameter. The line separator can be a simple as a horizontal line or it can be more elaborate.","(c) Statement Splitting","Splitting statement printing into batches is a very useful and timesaving function of Image Print. This function enables the user to specify how Image Print processes statement information for maximum efficiency.","(d) Good\/Bad Split","Statements identified as having exceeded a user-specified ratio of missing or bad images can be processed into a separate file for further processing while good statements continue through the printing process unhampered. For example, the user can specify that each statement missing more than three individual images and\/or more than 10 percent of total images is bad.","Good\/bad splitting is executed from the Print Control Menu and is controlled by parameters specified in the default and\/or override parameter file. If the specifications designated by the parameters are exceeded, the statements are processed as bad.","The user may find it beneficial to use the Good\/Bad Split function even if he does not require the statements to be split. This Split function performs many of the same processes as Print, but in a fraction of the time. This provides a way to review for errors before running Print.","(e) Volume Split","Statements can be sorted into different print files according to their size (volume) as defined by the user in the parameters file. This enables the user to use printing and processing hardware in a more efficient manner. The user can direct large volume files, grouped for example by zip code, to special handling equipment or configure equipment in the fashion which best suits each type of printing session.","(f) Defining Output Segments","The document sets that are produced by Image Print can be grouped into output segments, so that one segment can be completed and begin printing while later document sets within the same job are still being formatted.","(g) Defining the Target Printer","Statements can be formatted for a variety of Xerox, IBM, and HP-PCL compatible printers. The target printer may have special parameter requirements.","Before running Image Print, the following conditions should exist:","Image Print parameters should be defined\u2014Image Print parameters provide information for page formatting, headings, printer channel assignments, splitting routines, etc. As many sets of parameters can be maintained as are required to meet different processing requirements. For example, a banking institution may require one set of parameters for printing account statements and another for money market accounts. During the initial installation period, a trial and error approach to adjusting parameter specifications may be necessary in order to fine tune the statements' final presentation.\n\n","The Print Control File should be loaded and ready for processing\u2014For standard Image Print runs, the Print Control File (PCF) is built by the institution's account processing procedures. The PCF contains the body of the standard statement text and determines the accounts to be printed and their sequence.","Image Match processing for the proposed run should be complete\u2014The Image Match process uses information contained in the user-produced Match Control File (MCF). The MCF is generated by the institution's account processing system and this information is then used for Image Print.","d. Printing Directly to HP or IBM Printers","Before printing statements, the user defines the print parameters (e.g., identifies page formatting, headings, etc.), defines the load parameters (e.g., identifies where the files are located, PCF exit program to use, etc.), and defines Capture, Match, and Archive Parameters. The Capture, Match, and Archive parameters determine scaling of images, levels of matching, etc. Additionally, the user obtains a Match Control File (MCF), obtains a Print Control File (PCF), and retrieves image objects from different cycles. To print directly to HP or IBM printers, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","e. Printing to Tape","In addition to printing directly to HP or IBM Printers, the user can print to tape. The user first obtains the image objects, MCF and PCF as discussed in the previous section. The user then loads a blank tape into the tape drive. Typically, a minimum of two blank tapes, one for the index and one for the data is required. After loading the tape the user \u201cprints\u201d the information to the tape. When this process is complete, the user takes the data tape to the printer that the user uses for printing the statements. The user loads the tape into the print controller's tape drive. The user can then print the statements.","f. Direct Printing to Xerox HPIP","An HPIP server processes the print stream in a manner that replicates data as if it came from a tape. The EIMA includes an HPIP board and HPIP software in a workstation allowing the user to print directly to the printer at a faster speed. The user first obtains the image objects MCF and PCF as discussed earlier.","The user then performs the following acts to directly print to the HPIP as follows:\n\n","g. Generating a PCF","Using the Print Control File options in the Support Menu, the user can customize bank information and control printing of separator pages. The user performs the following acts to generate a PCF from the EIMA system  instead of loading a specific PCF from another system:\n\n","h. Miscellaneous Topics Relating to Printing","If the print jobs are large and taking up too much space on the hard drive of the workstations, the user may want to divide the jobs into segments.","Occasionally, individual statements may be damaged or lost after they have been distributed to customers. After processing images, some customers delete the images from the database. Deleting the images makes it impossible to recreate the run or perform restarts to reprint lost or damaged statements. Implementing an archiving procedure allows the user to access copies of the text and images required for statement reprinting.","Image Print provides a reprint utility that can be used to reprint statements which is archived to tape at the end of each Image Print run. Each run also creates an index that is saved to tape or disk depending on the selection in the parameters. The archive records are similar to the records written to the statement output file, except that each statement is preceded by a header record simplifying the statement identification.","The reprint capability enables the user to print a single statement or a range of statements from an index tape. To reprint statements, the user can reprint to a tape first and then print, or can reprint directly to the printer.","To reprint, the user performs the following steps:\n\n","10. Reports","a.

Repair Graphical User Interface (GUI)","1. Introduction to Repair GUI","a. Overview of Repair GUI","The functions of the Repair GUI are similar to the MICR Repair and Quality Monitor modules in that Repair GUI helps control the quality of the Image Capture process by allowing the user to view images as well as correct MICR field data. The Repair GUI may also be customized to meet specific needs.","The Repair GUI has two operating modes: Repair mode and Monitor mode. When the user logs into the Repair GUI, the user chooses whether to use its monitor or repair capabilities. The user enters the Repair mode to correct any scanning errors that corrupted MICR data. The user may also use it after the image matching (Image Match) process to correct free items. The fields that appear in the Repair GUI are defined by a system administrator.","During Image Capture, the user can enter Monitor mode to display samples of the images as they are scanned. If the user spots scanning errors, the scanner can be adjusted, enabling immediate correction.","b.

How Repair Works","Repair mode is used for correcting any scanning errors detected by Image Capture or Image Match. The corrections are made to the database index, which is where the data is stored. The database index contains the image location, MICR data, and any other data associated with the image. Repair is usually performed any time after Image Capture has detected faulty data or to correct free items remaining after Image Match.","During Image Capture, the scanner scans the items (documents, such as checks) and reads the MICR data. MICR data is the record of field values for a number of variables printed (in magnetic ink) in specific locations on the original document. Field values may include account numbers, check numbers and related data, depending on specifics of the documents recorded, and the customer requirements. The scanned digital images and associated MICR data are sent to the UNIX host, where Image Capture stores the images in an image database and records the image location and associated field value data in the database index.","Image Capture passes the data through a series of validations. Validation fails if there is one or more unreadable characters, a missing field, or the number of characters is incorrect. The data may fail validation because the scanner did not read it correctly. Situations that may result in unreadable data include: a document is fed at an angle into the camera area, labels are incorrectly placed, or the image has marks or scratches across the MICR data area.","If any of these situations should occur, it becomes necessary to fix the data contained in the database index file. The index is flagged for each image that has a detected problem.","During repair, each index item needing repair is displayed on the workstation one at a time. The operator enters the missing or corrected data. The scanned images themselves are not changed. Instead, the data stored in the database index is corrected.","2. Repair GUI\/Host System","a. Starting and Killing the Repair Server","Before starting a Repair GUI session on the workstation, the user should first start the repair server. Starting the repair server was discussed earlier. After the user is finished with the Repair GUI session, the user kills (i.e., stops) the repair server.","3. Repair GUI\/PC Module","a. Starting Repair GUI","The Repair GUI Repair mode can be used anytime after Image Capture identifies an item with duplicate or unreadable data. If the user needs to enter data for an empty field or to edit other data that the system has not tagged as needing repair, he creates a Repair Set while in Monitor mode. From the workstation, the user initiates Repair by performing the acts below:\n\n","b. Navigating Repair GUI","The Repair GUI main screen contains the image(s) and the image's respective associated field data. The user can cycle through the images and change field data by use of various image controls. The screen includes two image windows. The image displayed in the first window defaults to the object's front view. The image displayed in the second image window defaults to the back view. The user can force the image back view to appear in the first window, by selecting Options\/Swap Image. The user may also specify a third image window.","The user can also enlarge and shrink the image windows and arrange them as desired by clicking and pulling on the window's borders. Further, the user can also click and drag the mouse to zoom in on a specific rectangular section of an image.","The user can browse through the images and further manipulate them by clicking on image manipulation buttons.

Creating Shortcuts","Repair GUI contains two separate types of keyboard shortcuts: Old Style Shortcuts and Stored Field Values shortcuts. Old Style Shortcuts are shortcuts that are set by the software. Stored Field Value shortcuts are created by the user.","Stored Field Value shortcuts are useful if the user uses certain fields that consistently contain the same values. Simple keystroke shortcuts allow the user to enter the field values he sets for each keyboard shortcut. For the embodiment described herein, the shortcuts involves pressing the <CTRL> key and a single-digit number. For instance, the user can define a stored field value so that when he hits <CTRL>+1, the field is filled with the pre-set Value.","To define Stored Field Value shortcuts, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","d. Repairing Items","After the user selects the repair set, he can resize the image by dragging the borders of the window. The user can also resize the Fields window so that the fields are more visible.","For each image, the user examines the field data in the information line and edit that data as needed. The user may define special characters that appear in place of unclear and missing characters using the parameters file that is associated with each database. For instance, the user might use an \u201c!\u201d to appear in place of unclear characters and an \u201cM\u201d in place of missing characters.","The user clicks the Update button to save changes and move to the next item. If the user is uncertain whether the item needs updating, the user can click \u201cSkip\u201d to move the current item to the end of the file. If an item does NOT need updating, the user clicks Update without making changes, so the item does not reappear.","If certain fields have been defined as \u201cMandatory\u201d, the user will not be able to proceed if a Mandatory field contains no data. If the user clicks Update, the user will receive a warning message. (e.g., \u201cThis operation will permanently remove this item. Continue? You will be unable to proceed to the next item until you select either es or o.\u201d)","The Fields window's title bar lists the errors contained in the current batch. When the user clicks the Update button, this number decreases.","When there is no longer a number in the title bar of the Fields window, the current batch has been totally repaired. Additionally, no images will appear on-screen.","e. Deleting Items","To delete the current image, along with its accompanying data, the user clicks the Delete button. Since this will permanently delete the item from the database, a confirmation request message appears. The item is removed from the database when the user confirms the request.","f.

Monitor Mode","a. Overview of Monitor Mode","Repair GUI's Monitor mode is used in conjunction with the UNIX-based Image Capture program to monitor the documents scanned into database files. This option helps to ensure the accuracy of the data. The user can compare the data recorded from the scanning operation to the data on the associated image. By doing spot checks the user can detect scanning errors or burned out scanner light bulbs, and reset the scanner if necessary.","There are two ways to use the monitor capability: while the items are being scanned and after items have been scanned into a database. The Repair GUI should not be started until after capture has begun. This is because the capture process creates the Batch ID that the Repair GUI needs in order to retrieve the images.","b. Initiating Image Capture","The operator performs the following acts to initiate Image Capture:\n\n","c. Setting the Timer","The Monitor mode timer can be set to display a new scanned image at intervals (integer seconds) controlled by the user. To set the timer, the user should already have selected a SetName, SetDate and Batch repair set. If the timer is set when the scanner is not running, then the same image will be refreshed, over and over as long as the button remains active.","d. Reviewing Previously Scanned Documents","The process is the same as for reviewing scanning images (Initiating Image Capture) except there is no need to start the scanner. Additionally, there is no need to set the timer since all the images have already been scanned. The user can use the navigation buttons to view the images.","In one embodiment, the Field portion of the screen is \u201cgreyed-out\u201d when in Monitor mode (instead of having a \u201cwhite background\u201d as during Repair mode). This is to prevent the user from editing fields in Monitor Mode. Instead, the user is simply viewing the images and their associated data. If there is a need to edit field data, the user uses the Repair mode.","5. Repair Sets","a. Overview of Repair Sets","For the system described herein, there are two methods available for updating field data: Batch Update (discussed earlier), and Repair GUI. Repair GUI allows the user to create repair sets. Repair sets let the user mark a subset of items in a cycle for repair. The user creates the repair sets while in Monitor mode, but the repair sets the user creates are accessed and modified in Repair mode.","The repair set process works in much the same way as a query filter. The user may want to repair only images that have amounts between $100 and $500, for instance, or to repair images that have only a particular serial number (or series of serial numbers). If an item in a cycle fits the criteria defined for the repair set, it is \u201ctagged\u201d as having an error. The user can delete the repair set later, and subsequently \u201cun-tag\u201d the items.","b. Creating Repair Sets","The user performs the following acts to create a Repair Set:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0695","num":"0918"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00067","num":"00067"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 66"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["OPERATOR","DEFINITION"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["=","equal to"]},{"entry":["!=","not equal to"]},{"entry":["<","less than"]},{"entry":[">","greater than"]},{"entry":["=<","less than or equal to"]},{"entry":[">=","greater than or equal to"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"If the user selects equal to (=) or not equal to (!=), a Range check box will appear, for specifying a range of values. To specify a range for the field, click the Range check box. The window is then enhanced with a pair of data entry windows, so the user can enter the minimum and maximum values in the spaces provided. For convenience, in the window space below the range values, the Amount window will display any previously entered ranges from which the user may select.","For example, if the user needs to create a repair set that includes all capture dates between Jan. 1 and Jan. 15, 2000. In this example, the user selects the Operator=(equals) and clicks the Range check box that appears. When the user clicks the Range box, two unlabeled data entry windows will also appear. In the left data entry window the user enters 0000000020000101 (year 2000, 1month, 1day). In the right data entry window the user enters 0000000020000115 (year 2000, 1month, 15day).\n\n","6.

Inadequate class groups cannot be modified, only deleted and recreated (added).","b. Adding Class Groups","To give a user group permission to repair a class, the user performs the following acts:\n\n","F. Reconciliation","1. Overview of Reconciliation","Reconciliation provides for manual batch reconciliation of Free Items and matching Missing Items into the archive.","Free Items are images scanned during the capture process that the system is unable to match with any item from the Match Control File (MCF). The client site provides MCFs. The MCF is used to enable the system to link images and Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) data read from the images to the respective object's data that is stored in the MCF. The MCF theoretically should contain the correct information for every object captured.","Missing items are those items identified in the client-supplied Match Control File (MCF) that do not have identified object images (and MICR data) with which they can be matched. This usually occurs because the images captured have faulty MICR fields that the system could not read, or the matching image objects were not scanned in.","In one embodiment, reconciliation runs on the client using Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Advanced Imaging (JAI), and CORBA. Other environments are possible.","Reconciliation displays each Free Item, along with the most likely missing items from the Match Control File (MCF) for that batch. When a user chooses (and confirms) the Match Control File row that is appropriate for a free item, the data for the Free Item is modified to equal that Match Control File data. The application then marks that image as Matched and that image is immediately available for querying and other archive functions, such as export and statement print. In order for the Missing Item Report, Free Item Report, and Match Statistics to be updated, the user must also select the \u201cUpdate Match Reports\u201d option from the UNIX Match Menu.","2. Logging In","The user performs the following acts to login in the Reconciliation application:\n\n","3. Batch Selection Window","The Batch Selection window  () provides access to three levels of nested folders. This is a hierarchical window, where the user can expand and contract the tree structure. A Database Icon contains one or more Cycle Icons, each of which contains one or more Batch Icons.","The user double clicks a Database Icon  to display its available cycles. The user double clicks a Cycle Icon  to display its available batches. The user double clicks a Batch Icon to reconcile that batch.","The information in parenthesis, located to the right of the batch ID number  (0000 in the example in ), indicates the number of free items and missing items contained in that batch.","4.

Overview of Queries","A query is a request for document items in a particular database cycle. Queries are defined and executed from the Query screen. To retrieve specific document records, the user must set criteria for the query. Criteria is a set of limiting conditions that retrieves a specific set of records. The user can construct a simple or advanced query in the Query screen. A simple query allows the user to search for documents using a comparison operator. An advanced query allows the user to search for documents using both comparison and logical operators. The user can also set criteria on the same field multiple times. When the user executes a query, the query request is sent to the server. The server searches for records in the specified database(s) and then returns only those records that meet the criteria.

Seal Verification","1. Overview","In another application, the object checks are encoded with a \u201csecured seal\u201d that contains specific information (e.g., check value, payee, date, check number, branch name, MICR information, etc.) about a check. When the check is presented at the bank for payment, the scanner includes an application that deciphers the \u201csecured seal\u201d to allow for verification that the check was properly issued and has not been altered. An example application for obtaining information from a seal or watermark is offered by Signum Technologies. In one specific embodiment, data is encoded and printed as a seal, watermark, diagram, picture, illustration, stamp, figure, or similar item (collectively referred to as a \u201cseal\u201d). Upon scanning the image, the application enlarges the seal and obtains the encoded data using a key. The application then decodes the obtained data.","In one embodiment, the obtained from the seal is imported into the host server  as an XML file along with the associated check image. A character recognition engine processes the check image by recognizing the payee and CAR amount of the check. The recognized results are then validated against the seal along with other check data passed by the scanner. The results are viewed via a document query application (e.g., NetQuery) and displayed in a standard report. Another embodiment  is schematically shown in .","2. Import Utility Service","a.
