title: Method and apparatus for protecting digital data by double re-encryption
abstract: In addition to re-encrypting the data using an unchangeable key, the data is double re-encrypted using a changeable key. The changeable key is used first and the unchangeable key is then used, or in another case, the unchangeable key is used first, and the changeable key is then used. In the aspect of embodiments, there is a case adopting a software, a case adopting a hardware, or a case adopting the software and the hardware in combination. The hardware using the unchangeable key developed for digital video is available. In adopting the software, encryption/decryption is performed in a region below the kernel which cannot be handled by the user to ensure the security for the program and for the key used. More concretely, encryption/decryption is performed with RTOS using a HAL and a device driver, i.e., a filter driver, a disk driver and a network driver, in an I/O manager. Either one of two filter drivers, with a file system driver between them, may be used. Further, both filter drivers may be used.

No. 09\/806,510, filed Apr. 16, 2001 U.S. Pat. No. 7,093,295 titled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROTECTING DIGITAL DATA BY DOUBLE RE-ENCRYPTION\u201d by Makoto Saito.","The present invention relates to a system for managing digital contents. In particular, the present invention relates to a system used for managing copyrights of digital content, for which copyrights are claimed, and for protecting the secrecy of the digital content so as to achieve enhanced digital content distribution and to realize digital content commerce.","Hitherto, widely spread analog content deteriorate in quality each time it is stored, copied, edited and transferred. Hence, no serious detriment from copyright violations occurs during these operations. However, digital content does not deteriorate in quality after repeated storing, coping, editing and transferring. Thus, the control of digital content copyright is an important issue.","Digital data such as digital video data, digital audio data, etc. is usually supplied to users on a payment basis accompanying a broadcast, transfer of a DVD, etc. In these cases, the data is encrypted and supplied in a manner which excludes unpaid viewing. The encrypted and supplied digital data is decrypted using a crypt key, which is supplied to the user by certain means, before the data is viewed. Because the quality of decrypted digital data does not deteriorate even when it is stored, copied or transferred, if the data is stored, copied or transferred by the user, secondary viewing free of charge may occur. Non-authorized re-use of the decrypted digital data content is against the benefit of the data content provider. In this respect, systems and equipment have been developed to prohibit re-use, i.e., secondary utilization such as storage, copying or transferring the digital data content.","However, the prohibition of the secondary utilization makes it less attractive for users of the digital data content and it is now recognized that this may hinder the propagation of the use of the digital data content. In this respect, it is now proposed to prevent illegitimate use by re-encrypting the decrypted digital data content so that the use of the digital data content is more attractive for users.","When the digital data, which is stored in a medium and is given or lent to a user or which is transferred to the user, is used for secondary utilization such as storing, copying or transferring, it is impossible for the copyright owner to protect his or her copyright(s) in the digital data, which is in the hands of the users. Therefore, a certain method is required to protect copyrights automatically and forcibly.","Under such circumstances, the present inventor has made various proposals with the purpose of protecting digital content copyrights.","In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications 46419\/1994 (GB-2269302; U.S. Ser. No. 08\/098,415) and 141004\/1994 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,115; U.S. Pat. No. 5,901,339), the present inventor proposed a system for managing copyrights by obtaining a permit key from a key control center via a public telephone line, and also, an apparatus for such a purpose in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 132916\/1994 (GB-2272822; U.S. Ser. No. 08\/135,634).","Also, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications 271865\/1995 (EP0677949A2; U.S. Ser. Nos. 08\/416,037) and 185448\/1996 (EP0704785A2; U.S. Ser. No. 08\/536,747), a system for copyright management of the digital contents was proposed.","In these systems and apparatus, those who wish to view an encrypted program makes a viewing request to a management center via a communication line using a communication device. Upon receipt of the viewing request, the management center transmits a permit key and charges and collects a fee.","Upon receipt of the permit key, the requestor transmits the permit key to a receiving device by on-line or off-line means. When the permit key is received, the receiving device decrypts the encrypted program by using the permit key.","The system described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 271865\/1995 (EP0677949A2; U.S. Ser. No. 08\/416,037), uses a program for managing the copyright and copyright information, in addition the key for use permission, to manage the copyright of the digital content in displaying (including process to sound), storing, copying, editing and transferring the digital contents, including real-time transmission of digital video content, in a database system. The program for copyright management watches and manages in a manner that the digital content is not used outside the use permission or user's request.","Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 271865\/1995 (EP0677949A2; U.S. Ser. No. 08\/416,037) describes that the digital content is supplied from a database in the encrypted state and is decrypted by the copyright management program only when it is displayed or edited, and is again in the encrypted state when it is stored, copied or transferred. Further, it describes that the copyright management program itself is encrypted and is decrypted by using a permit key, and the decrypted copyright management program performs decryption and encryption of the copyrighted data, and that, when a utilization other than storing and displaying the data is performed, copyright information including information of the person who performed the utilization is added to the original copyright information and stored as history.","Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 287014\/1996 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,579; EP0715241A-2) proposed an apparatus for decryption\/re-encryption having a configuration of a board, a PCMCIA card, an IC card or an IC for the copyright management and a crypt key escrow system. This application also describes the copyright, management method applied to a video conference system and an electronic commerce system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,706, also describes an apparatus for decryption\/re-encryption having an IC configuration.","Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 272745\/1996 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,999; EP0709760) proposed a system, in which the copyright of original data and the copyright of new data produced by editing the original data or editing a plurality of original data are protected by confirming the validity of a use request based on a digital signature on an edit program, in combination with the use of a secret-key cryptosystem and a public-key cryptosystem.","Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 288940\/1996 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,740,246; EP0719045A2) proposed various forms for applying the copyright management system to a database system, a video-on-demand (VOD) system or an electronic commerce system.","Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 288940\/1996 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,158; EP0746126A2) proposed a system in which copyrights of original data and new data are protected by using a third crypt key and a copyright label in case of using and editing a plurality of data.","As it can be understood from the data copyright management systems and the data copyright management apparatus proposed by the present inventor as described above, the management of data copyrights can be accomplished by encryption\/decryption\/re-encryption and limiting usage of digital content by the copyright management program. The cryptography technique and usage limitation can be realized by using a computer.","In a case where secret information is exchanged via a network, the information is encrypted for preventing piracy.","It is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,818 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,441 that information piracy during transmission is prevented by encryption. Using a plurality of keys in such a case is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,504,116, 5,353,351, 5,475,757 and 5,381,480, and performing re-encryption is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,514.","The protection of copyrights in the secondary utilization of digital data by the copyright management program can be realized by re-encryption\/re-decryption of the decrypted digital data and by managing and performing the re-encryption\/re-decryption by using the copyright management program.","Of course, it goes without saying that the means for carrying out re-encryption\/re-decryption includes cases where software is used and cases where hardware is used.","Here, the operation to obtain encrypted data C from non-encrypted data M by using a key K is expressed as:\n\n(),\n\nand to obtain decrypted data M from encrypted data C by using the key K is expressed as:\n\n().\n","When re-encryption\/re-decryption of the decrypted data M is repeated, re-encryption is expressed as:\n\n\u2200((1, 1), ),\n\nwhere i is a positive integer, and re-decryption is expressed as:\n\n((1, 1), ).\n","Referring to , description will be given on an arrangement of a conventional set-top box (STB) and on a method for protecting the digital data performed in the set-top box.","Description is not given here on peripheral circuits not directly related to

the double re-encrypted data C- in the storage medium is erased and the data re-encrypted by using the unchangeable key K and the external changeable key K is re-stored.","As described above, because the re-encryption is performed using the unchangeable key K before the re-encryption using the second changeable key K, even when the unchangeable key K is discovered by others, since the data is also encrypted by using the second changeable key K, it is very difficult to cryptanalyze the encrypted data without further finding out the second changeable key K.","In this arrangement, the changeable key encryption\/decryption unit  is simply added to the unchangeable encryption\/decryption unit  of the conventionally proposed set-top box shown in , and accordingly, a set-top box employing the present invention can be easily achieved.","In the description of this embodiment, the encryption unit  and the decryption unit  are contained in the unchangeable key encryption\/decryption unit  and the encryption unit  and the decryption unit  are contained in the changeable key encryption\/decryption unit . Of course, it goes without saying that these units , ,  and  may also be separately provided.","The operation as described above can be easily implemented by providing a computer arrangement having a CPU and a system-bus in the set-top box .","Digital data content is handled not only in the set-top box but also in a computer such as a personal computer.","Referring to  through , description will be given on embodiments of the present invention applied to an apparatus using a personal computer.","Unlike the set-top box where all components are constituted of hardware and are operated only by the hardware, a personal computer is an apparatus, which is operated by controlling the hardware incorporated in the apparatus using software.","In order to efficiently operate the computer, a) operating system (OS) is used, which manages the overall operation of the computer.","A conventional operating system used in the personal computer comprises a kernel for providing basic services such as memory management task management, interrupt handling and communication between processes, and an operating system service providing other services.","However, with the advances in computer developments, for example, the functional improvements of a microprocesor and the price decrease of RAM used as main memory, and also the user's demand for an increase of the performance ability of computers, improvements in the functions of the operation system to manage the overall computer operation has been required. Accordingly, the scale of the operating systems has become comparatively larger than before.","Since such an enlarged operating system itself occupies a large amount of space in the hard disk where it is to be stored, the space to store application programs or data needed by the user is liable to be rather limited, and that may lead to inconvenience for the user in using the computer.","To cope with such situations, newer operating systems are of designed with user-dependent subsystem parts (such as an environmental subsystem for performing emulation of the other operating systems and graphics, and a core subsystem such as a security subsystem) removed from a kernel. Basic parts of an operating system consist of a HAL (hardware abstraction layer) to absorb differences of hardware, micro-kernels to provide a scheduling function, an interrupt function, an I\/O management function, etc., and a system service API (application programming interface) interposed between the subsystem and the micro-kernel.","With the above arrangement, expandability of the operating system needing changes or additions of function is improved, and portabilty of the operating system corresponding to the intended purpose can be made much easier.","By the distributed arrangement of elements of the micro-kernel to a plurality of network computers, it is now possible to easily realize a distributed operating system.","Computers are used in computer peripheral units, various types of control units, communication devices, etc., in addition to personal computers typically represented by the desk-top type or notebook type personal computers. In such cases, unlike the operating system for a general-purpose personal computer, in which importance is put on the man-machine interface, a real-time operating system is adopted, in which importance is placed on speedy execution. An operating system, especially one for embedding, is suitable for each of these units and devices.","Of course, the cost for development is increased when developing an operating system specially tailored for different embedded devices. For this reason, it is recently proposed to use a general-purpose operating system in the personal computer also for the embedded type real-time operating system. By arranging a program specific for the embedded type in a subsystem combined with a micro-kernel, it is now practical to obtain an embedded type real-time operating system.","Major functions of the operating system include task management such a scheduling or interrupt processing.","The task management has mainly two different types in the operating system: single task type, which only performs one task processing at the same time, and multi-task type for performing a plurality of task processings at the same time. The multi-task type is divided into a multi-task type where changeover of the task depends upon the task to be processed, and a multi-task type not dependent upon the task to be processed.","Among these, the single task type allocates one process to an MPU so that the MPU is not free until the process is completed. A non-preemptive multi-task type allows the MPU to be allocated a plurality of processes by time division, so that process is not executed unless the process in execution gives the control back to the operating system. A preemptive multi-task type interrupts the process in execution at a certain time interval, so that the control is forcibly transferred to the other process.","Therefore real-time multi-tasking can be achieved only by the preemptive type.","The task management in the computer is carried out according to the process, which is a unit having system resources such as a memory, a file, etc., and the process is managed according to a thread, which is a unit to allocate CPU time with divided processes. In this case, the system resources are shared by all threads in the same process. This means that there are more than one thread to share system resources in one process.","Each task to be processed by the multi-task type has a priority spectrum, which is generally divided into  steps. The normal task performing no interrupt is classified into dynamic classes, which are divided into 0-15 steps, and the task performing interrupt is classified to real-time classes to be divided into - steps.","Interrupt processing is executed using an interrupt enable time (normally 10 milliseconds) called a \u201ctime slice\u201d unit. Ordinary interrupt is executed at 10 millisecond time slices.","Under such circumstances, a time slice has been recently proposed, in which an interrupt enable time called a \u201creal-tine slice\u201d is 100 microseconds. If this real-time slice is used, it is possible to execute an interrupt with priority over the conventional interrupt of 10 milliseconds.","In a third embodiment shown in , changeable key encryption\/decryption processing by software and the management of a crypt key in the computer are carried out by a real-time OS provided in the HAL.","In , reference numeral  represents an operating system in a computer;  a display unit for displaying output from the computer;  an unchangeable key encryption\/decryption unit; and  a data storage medium such as a digital versatile disk (DVD) RAM or a hard disk, or a data transfer system such as a network.","The operating system  comprises an operating system service  and a system service API , which are user regions, and a kernel  and a HAL , which are non-user regions. The system service API  is arranged between the operating system service  and the kernel  and serves to mediate between the operating system service  and the kernel . The HAL  is arranged at the lowermost layer of the operating system  and serves to absorb differences in the hardware for the software.","The operating system service  comprises an application , a subsystem  and a security subsystem . The kernel  comprises a plurality of micro-kernels  and  and a kernel . The micro-kernel  has task management functions such as scheduling, interrupt, etc., and the micro-kernel  has an I\/O management function.","The micro-kernel  having the I\/O management function comprises an I\/O management , device drivers such as a disk driver  and a network driver , which are managed by the I\/O manager, and a filter driver  which is inserted when necessary between the I\/O manager  and the device drivers such as the disk driver  and the network driver .","The changeable key encryption\/decryption processing in the computer is executed by software. In case of the third embodiment, the changeable key encryption\/decryption processing is carried out by the aforementioned real-time OS (RTOS) with priority over other tasks in the HAL  in the operating system .","Similar to the first embodiment shown in , digital data supplied by broadcasting means such as digital terrestrial wave broadcasting, digital CATV broadcasting, digital satellite broadcasting, etc., by network means such as Internet, or by a digital storage medium such as a DVD, a CD, etc., is encrypted using a first changeable key K to prevent illegitimate use:\n\n1(1)\n\nand is supplied.
