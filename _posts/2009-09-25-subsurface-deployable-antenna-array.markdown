{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to subsurface deployable antennas and, more particularly, to a cable deployed antenna array having watertight antenna elements which move away from each other for operation, and then move toward each other for compact storage.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","It is a challenge for undersea vehicles to maintain broadband communications via satellite links and with surface vessels while remaining undetected at cruising speed and depth.","The electrical conductivity of seawater inhibits electromagnetic radiation (radio signals) from penetrating to significant depths below the sea surface. At HF, VHF, UHF and microwave frequencies, the \u201cskin depth,\u201d or depth to which a given wavelength of radio energy will penetrate, is limited to a few centimeters. As a general rule, penetration into seawater is shallower with decreasing wavelength (increasing frequency). Therefore, without an external antenna, an undersea vehicle cannot remain undetected and communicate at depth and speed.","For communications at cruising speed and depth, undersea vehicles have had to rely upon extremely low frequency (ELF) transmissions. The ELF wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is measured in kilometers (frequencies in the kilohertz range). Seawater skin depths at these frequencies permit communications to some significant depth, but the long wavelengths limit the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. Consequently data rates are extremely low. This low data rate can make it difficult or impossible to transmit lengthy messages or images.","For undersea vehicles to currently communicate at shorter wavelengths (i.e., HF, VHF, UHF and microwave frequencies) the undersea vehicle can come near to the surface and extend a whip antenna or mast above the sea surface. However, at shallow depths, the undersea vehicle is easily detectable and vulnerable.","Towed buoyant antennas have been developed over time and successfully employed, but not without some technical deficiencies at ELF through HF wavelengths. Research has been continuing into developing low-profile antenna arrays for satellite and surface vessel communications in the VHF, UHF and microwave regimes. At these shorter wavelengths, significant bandwidth is available and consequently higher data rates can be achieved.","However, the relatively small and low profile antennas are susceptible to washover. Washover is the condition where an antenna becomes inundated by seawater. The degree and frequency to which an antenna is briefly rendered inoperable by washover is a function of antenna geometry, speed and course, as well as sea wave parameters.","Current developments in low-profile antenna design employ multiple element antennas to overcome the effects of washover. Multiple antennas in an array increase the probability of at least one antenna being exposed rather than washed over at any given time. Multiple antenna arrays are also used for increasing overall antenna gain and to permit array phasing and directional beam forming. In the prior art, these multiple antenna arrays require substantial storage space when not deployed. The problem is that undersea vehicles have very limited available storage space.","The following United States patents describe various prior art systems that may be related to the above and\/or other electronics equipment storage systems:","U.S. Pat. No. 6,870,508, issued Mar. 22, 2005, to Rivera, discloses a slotted antenna with a plurality of loop structures and interconnecting conductors that define a slot. The antennas can operate in a single band or over multiple bands. Flexible or inflatable substrates enable easy storage aboard an underwater craft and facilitate deployment and towing behind an underwater craft with minimal chances of detection.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,226,328, issued Jun. 5, 2007, to Puzella et al., discloses an extendable spar buoy sea-based communication system includes a spar buoy having a retracted configuration deployable from an underwater vessel and an extended configuration after deployment, and a communication subsystem mounted to the top of the spar buoy and supported thereby.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,199,763, issued Apr. 3, 2007, to Bryan, Jr. et al., discloses an antenna system for operation near a ground plane, for example, at or near the surface of a body of water. The system also includes, for example, a buoyant support and\/or housing for transporting the antenna to and\/or maintaining the antenna at or near the surface of a body of water.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,710,746, issued Mar. 23, 2004, to Anderson et al., discloses an antenna having a reconfigurable length, and a method of reconfiguring an antenna. The antenna can comprise an enclosed composition capable of forming plasma operable as an antenna, an energy source configured for applying variable energy levels to the composition to thereby form variable plasma configurations, and an enclosure containing the composition. The enclosure can have a proximal end, wherein upon application of a first energy level to the composition, a first plasma length with respect to the proximal end is formed, and upon application of a second energy level to the composition, a second plasma length with respect to the proximal end is formed.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,683,579, issued Jan. 27, 2004, to Rivera, discloses a compact antenna that transmits and receives broadband electromagnetic energy signals over a hemispherical pattern in air at the ocean's surface. The antenna has an elongate semi-cylindrical shell, a circular end disc connected to one end, and a semi-circular end disc connected to the other end to form a half-cylinder cavity. A curved plate is connected to the circular end disc and a curved body portion has a curved end extending parallel with the semi-cylindrical shell. A vertical stem has an upper portion connected to the curved plate. The semi-cylindrical shell, circular end disc, semi-circular end disc, and vertical stem are made from a material that is conductive of electromagnetic signals, and they can be differently dimensioned to change the center frequencies to embrace different broadband ranges. The antenna is deployed and retrieved from a submarine in a tow body.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,983, issued Oct. 3, 2000, to Rivera, discloses a wideband, low-profile, towable submarine antenna. The antenna is formed with a metal cylinder having a longitudinal slot. The entire antenna may be encapsulated in a tow body and towed horizontally on the surface of the water. The longitudinal slot is open at one end and closed, or shorted, at the opposite end. The location of the antenna feedpoint is placed along the slot so as to set up two sets of frequency resonances. This configuration provides two voltage standing wave ratio minimums, thereby extending the effective reception and transmission range over the entire military UHF frequency range (225-400 MHz).","U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,918, issued Nov. 2, 1999, to Sirmalis, discloses a hydrodynamically and stealth shaped suite of antennas and sensors mounted above a hydrodynamically and stealth shaped mast. The mast is configured to extend from the sail of a submerged vessel to the surface so as to provide the vessel with satellite communications capabilities. The hydrodynamic shape of the mast minimizes the surface wake and the stealth shape of the antenna suite and mast minimizes the radar cross section of the system, lessening detection by hostile forces. To obtain a stealth shape, the radar suite utilizes a conformal phased array antenna. In addition, electro-optical sensors in the antenna suite provide visual, environmental and other sensing capabilities to the system. Further, structurally embedded ESM antennas provide ESM and radar capabilities. When in the retracted position, the antenna system conforms to the hydrodynamic and stealth shape of the submerged vessel and the conformal phased array of the antenna suite forms an integral part of the conformal phased array of the vessel.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,940,046, issued Aug. 17, 1999, to Saleem, discloses an easily reconfigurable mast antenna system disposed within an RF transparent radome where modularly, interchangeably designed antenna of the system are detachably attached to each other via an electronic interface connector and to a carrier backbone. RF, DC and fiber optic cables transmit signals to antennas operating in the range of 5 kHz to 18 GHz.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,117, issued Aug. 3, 1999, to Gerhard, discloses a buoyant loop antenna, deployable along a cable, which includes a core region comprising a plurality of annular ferrite beads. These annular shaped beads include a center hole and generally concave first end and a generally convex second end. The ferrite beads are aligned with the concave end of one bead against the convex end of another bead. This allows the cable to flex while the beads maintain contact with each other, providing flexibility and resistance to crushing. The core region has a loop wire wrapped helically around it, forming the loop antenna. The loop wire element starts and ends at the same end of the core region, forming a loop. This loop allows transmission and reception in and athwart (side to side) direction. This novel wire loop antenna can be combined with a straight wire antenna (which provides reception in a fore and aft direction) to provide an omni-directional cable antenna assembly.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,376, issued Jun. 7, 1994, to Eniger, discloses an improved ice penetrating arctic buoy for release from a submarine submerged under a layer of ice. The device includes a Global Positioning System navigational processor receiver and\/or a Emergency Position Information Radio Beacon and\/or surveillance apparatus, an antenna for transmission and\/or reception of appropriate RF frequencies, such as Global Positioning System or other R.F. frequencies found in the environment above the ice or EPIRB R.F. frequencies originating in the buoy into the environment above the ice. Convertor means converts navigational information and\/or other information outputted from said Global Positioning System receiver into coded corresponding information. An onboard transmitter sends coded information acoustically or optically and\/or electrically to the submarine via an underwater data link.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,165,504, issued Jan. 23, 2007, to Miller, discloses an antenna linear extension and retraction apparatus and method of use for a submersible device. The apparatus includes a body having a cavity formed at an external surface. A bladder containing a core material is arranged within the cavity. The core material contracts and expands the bladder depending upon a pressure that surrounds the bladder. An antenna is operatively connected with the bladder and moves between a retracted position and a deployed position as the bladder contracts and expands.","The above-cited prior art does not adequately disclose a low-profile, undersea antenna array implementation that is stored in a retracted (or physically compressed) state while stowed in a limited storage space, but upon deployment, expands to a full operational dimension. As such, a continuing need exists for an antenna that reassumes a compact state during the retrieval and stowing process. Such a novel implementation would allow for control over the inter-antenna element spacing, thus making it feasible to mechanically adjust the antenna for optimum hydrodynamic performance (and minimal washover) for a given sea state. The same ability to modify antenna element spacing would be applicable to array phasing and beam forming considerations. Summarizing, a long felt need exists for the solutions to the above-described and\/or related problems.","It is therefore a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to provide an improved subsurface deployable antenna array.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a self-deploying and\/or low-profile undersea antenna.","It is a still further object of the present invention to enable HF, VHF, UHF and\/or microwave communications while at cruising speed and depth.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an antenna array which can be compactly stowed.","It is a still further object of the present invention is to provide an antenna array that can be automatically retrieved, compacted and stowed at termination of deployment while at cruising speed and depth.","Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus as a subsurface deployable antenna array. The antenna array may comprise elements such as a tow cable which is deployable from a subsurface vessel. A plurality of watertight antenna modules is slidably mounted on the tow cable. The watertight antenna modules are electrically interconnected so as to cooperate to form the antenna array. The watertight antenna modules may comprise a specific gravity whereby buoyant force acting on the watertight antenna modules urges the watertight antenna modules to float on a surface of a body of water. In this way, the antenna array at least substantially conforms to the surface of the body of water.","Expandable and contractable connectors are disposed between respective ones of the plurality of watertight antenna modules. Preferably, the tow cable extends through the expandable and contractable connectors.","After deployment, the antenna array is expandable in a direction substantially parallel to the water surface as the plurality of antenna modules slide away from each other over the tow cable. The connectors are contractable for storage of the antenna array whereby an overall length of the antenna array contracts as the plurality of antenna modules are urged to slide toward each other. The connectors are sufficiently flexible that when expanded to permit respective ones of the plurality of antenna modules to individually floatingly conform to a variable surface of the water. The connectors may include a helical fiber optic and metallic signal path.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the connectors may include remotely controllable hydraulic or mechanical assemblies operable for adjusting spacing between the antenna modules whereby an overall length of the array is remotely controllable.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the expandable and contractable connectors include a helical spring which is mounted between the respective ones of antenna modules. A low coefficient of friction polymer coating may be disposed between the tow cable and the watertight antenna modules slidably mounted on the tow cable.","The subsurface deployable antenna array may further include a flexible skin surrounding the helical spring. The end-most watertight antenna module may be affixed in position on the tow cable. The watertight antenna modules may each include an electro-optical circuit which converts between radio signals and optical signal. The electro-optical circuit is connected to the optical signal path through the tow cable.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , , and , there is shown one embodiment of antenna array . The antenna array  comprises a plurality of antenna modules  which may vary in number. Each antenna module  may comprise one or more antenna elements, which may be configured in a wide variety of different ways.","Disposed between the antenna modules  are expandable\/contractable connectors . The spacing between the antenna modules  is determined by the state of the expandable\/contractable connectors . In , the connectors  are shown in an expanded state thereby increasing the spacing between the antenna modules . In , the connectors  are shown in a contracted or stowable configuration.","The connectors  comprise metallic and\/or fiber optic cables which interconnect with the antenna modules . The metal wiring discussed herein may typically comprise copper wiring. The metallic and\/or fiber optic cables in the connectors  are discussed in more detail hereinafter with respect to , A, B, and C.","Accordingly, the expandable\/contractable connectors  provide control over the inter-antenna element spacing of the antenna array . In one embodiment, the connectors  may be utilized to mechanically adjust the antenna array  for optimum hydrodynamic performance (and minimal washover) for a given sea state. The same ability to modify antenna element spacing of the antenna array  is applicable to array phasing and beam forming considerations.","The tow cable  may comprise metallic and\/or optical cables to interconnect the antenna array  with a vessel such as a submarine  as shown in . The present invention provides a low-profile, antenna array with an array implementation of antenna modules that can be stored in a retracted (or physically compressed) state. Therefore, the antenna array  may be stowed in a limited storage space typically associated with submarines.

Depending upon design and application, the antenna module  may be cylindrical and may comprise textural or shape features that mitigate washover and\/or improve hydrodynamics. The cylindrical structure may be utilized to house antenna(s)  and associated electronics and electro-optical components  within a water-tight chamber . The antennas  may include antenna elements and\/or connectors , which are indicated by dash lines.","Each connector  is secured to one or more associated antenna modules , for example, at anchor points . The antenna modules  comprise termination and distribution nodes  for cable assemblies within each connector, which are discussed hereinafter with respect to , , B, and C. Thus, nodes  may connect to metal wiring and\/or optical fibers , which connect to the electronics and electro-optical components .","The nodes  may also connect to metal wiring and\/or optical fibers  which connect to inter-module compressible helical cable assemblies that provide signal paths to the adjacent antenna. The middle-positioned antenna modules  comprise metal wiring and\/or optical fibers  on both sides thereof to associated connectors .","The end-most or terminal antenna module  connects to metal wiring and\/or optical fibers of the tow cable \u2014as indicated at a cable connection . End-most or terminal antenna module  may be secured to the tow cable  and\/or prevented from sliding by stop  and\/or other securing means as desired.","The antenna modules  may comprise a cylindrical structure that defines an internal-axially oriented receptacle  through which the tow cable  passes and slides during deployment and recovery. The receptacle  is fabricated in such a manner as to maintain the watertight character of the chamber  in which the antenna  and associated electronics and opto-electronics  may be housed. The receptacle  and\/or the tow cable  may be lined with a low coefficient of friction material (e.g., Teflon\u00ae) to facilitate a sliding action over the tow cable as the array is expanded or contracted.","Inside of the antenna modules , a wide variety of types of antennas and electronic configurations may be housed, depending on the particular application. Single or multiple antennas operating at the same or widely different frequency bands may be installed. The antenna configurations can be anything from simple dipole antennas to more complex slotted cylinder antennas\u2014again depending on operational needs. The antennas  may be imbedded in the dielectric material of the antenna module  and\/or be mounted within the chamber .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["20","40"]},"A low noise amplifier  is connected to the receiver side output of the T\/R switch . The low noise amplifier  increases the gain of a received signal to the appropriate level for an electronic-to-optical converter . The radio wave energy may be converted into photonic energy at the same carrier frequency as was received. The electronic-to-optical converter  may also perform a multiplexing function to wavelength multiplex the received signal onto an optical carrier. This photonic representation of the radio wave signal may be passed through an optical coupler  into helical fiber optic cable  that interconnects the adjacent antenna modules  until reaching the end-most antenna module. From there, the signal may be passed down an optical fiber in the tow cable  back to appropriate signal conversion and processing equipment shipboard.","Similarly, on the transmit side of T\/R switch , a power amplifier  is connected to the antenna module . The input of the power amplifier  is connected to an optical-to-electrical converter , through a coupler , and through a preferably helical fiber optic path  that connects adjacent antenna modules . The fiber optic path  and mechanical wiring path  are shown in a helical configuration.","Eventually the signal is passed back to the fiber optics of the tow cable  to the appropriate transmitter electronics onboard. While other configurations of optical and\/or copper wiring could be utilized than helical so long as they accommodate the expandable\/contractable nature of the connectors , a helical configuration is the preferred embodiment.","Running in parallel with the helical fiber optic path  is a helical bundle of copper wires  that carry electrical power, ground and any necessary control signals that are distributed to each of the antenna modules . While  shows the fiber optic path  and copper wiring path  separately for clarity, preferably both helixes are wound together. These wires are connected to their onboard source preferably through multiple optical fibers and copper wires in the umbilical tow cable .","The circuitry of  is shown as an example only and other configurations may be utilized. For example, in other applications, separate transmit and receive antennas and different arrangements of electronics and photonics may be employed. Other signals may also be sent to the antenna electronics module via the fiber cable and tapped off the fiber for control or module monitoring functions (not shown). A means of multiplexing or combining the transmitted and received signals on the optical fiber may be used, for example, as part of the optical coupler .","Internally and structurally, the tow cable  is similar to a \u201ctypical\u201d submarine tow cable with the exception of having a very low coefficient of friction jacket  (indicated schematically as a dashed line component in  and ) over part or all of the length, so that the antenna modules  slide more easily over the tow cable.","The tow cable jacket  is an abrasion resistant flexible polymer. The tow cable jacket  is provided at least on the portion of the tow cable over which the antenna modules  slide during deployment and retrieval. The tow cable jacket  may be manufactured from a low coefficient of friction polymer. In this way, the tow cable  passes easily through the center receptacles  of all included antenna modules  and interconnects to the compressible helical cable at the aft-most antenna module\u2014as indicated in .","The tow cable  may comprise several copper conductors  (indicated schematically in  and ) used to supply appropriate antenna module power and control signals. Preferably there are several optic cables  (indicated schematically in  and ), for transmission of direct radio frequency energy (RF) to photonic energy. For fiber optic transmission, signal attenuation is significantly less over long cable lengths. The cable also includes a strength member (typically Kevlar\u00ae) and a buoyancy element. In some cases, there may be a hydraulic control line (not shown) for expanding\/contracting the array of the antenna array .","As discussed above, connector , which is connected between each adjacent antenna modules , provides signal continuity and distributes fiber and copper signal paths to each of the interconnected antenna modules . The connectors  may comprise a compressible interconnecting helical cable configuration\u2014as indicated in , B, and C. Helical bundle  may comprise the fiber optic  and metallic signal cables.","The helical bundle  may also contain a strength member (typically Kevlar\u00ae) and a mechanical structural element that acts as a mechanical spring to expand the antenna array upon deployment. Hydraulic, electric, or mechanical means , , and  can be also employed to expand\/contract the helix, depending on the particular design and application of the system. For example, the hydraulic, electric, and\/or mechanical means , , and  may comprise remotely controllable winches which may allow a greater or less spacing between the antenna modules . The hydraulic, electric, or mechanical means , , and  may be mounted entirely within the connector  or may comprise end or anchor components mounted in the associated antenna modules .","Accordingly, there are at least two basic implementations for element spacing, namely a fixed module spacing and dynamic module spacing. The fixed spacing concept of inter-module spacing control is the simplest implementation. Here, fixed module spacing between adjacent antenna modules, via mechanical expansion of a helical spring  (illustrated schematically in ) and\/or via mechanical means such as the length of a cord, cord adjustment, or the like, has been predetermined and is not dynamically alterable.","On the other hand, dynamic module spacing enables the antenna user to remotely control the inter-module spacing, via the hydraulic, electric, or mechanical means , , and  thus permitting real-time dynamic adjustment. This remote controllable spacing adjustment capability enables array phasing and beam forming capability, as well as an opportunity to physically \u201ctune\u201d the overall array length for optimal hydrodynamic performance across a wide variety of sea states and headings.","The connector  may be jacketed with a comparatively tough, smooth expandable\/contractable polymer skin  that protects the helical bundle  and facilitates lower hydrodynamic drag. The scallops or ripples  illustrated in , B, and C are exaggerated for illustration purposes. In practice, the ripples  are physically small to limit hydrodynamic drag and to limit wake creation and washover.","In operation, the antenna array  may be stored in a compressed state in a compartment of a submarine sail . The antenna array  may then be mechanically deployed while the submarine is at cruising speed and depth. As the tow cable  is reeled out, the antenna array  would physically expand as the antenna modules  slide apart from each other along the coaxial tow cable .","For a typical undersea vehicle application and due to the limited storage space available, the maximum stowed dimension of submarine antenna array  would be on the order of 12-15 feet in length and 6-12 inches in diameter. Upon deployment, the diameter would remain constant but the length of submarine antenna array  can expand to any practical and physically realizable length required for a specific application. Mechanisms and means for the cable reel deployment of towed antenna arrays currently exist.","As discussed above, expansion may occur via mechanical expansion of the inter-module helical spring, which can be assisted by other mechanical, electrical and\/or hydraulic means. In one embodiment, the antenna array  may expand to full length after being deployed from a submarine sail . Once the antenna array  is fully deployed and expanding, the tow cable  continues to reel out until the buoyant antenna array  has surfaced and is being towed at an appropriate standoff (perhaps several hundred meters to a kilometer). The submarine  may continue at cruising speed and depth with the umbilical antenna fully deployed and communications link established.","Upon deployment, once the antenna array  has extended to a full operational length, the antenna array floats to the surface and provides a low profile communications means. The flexible design of the connectors  allows the antenna modules  to suitably follow the sea wave shape, decreasing the effects and frequency of antenna element washover. The overall antenna array  is substantially parallel to the surface of the body of water rather than extending vertically out of the water as other types of antennas do","After a communications session is completed, the submarine  may continue at cruising speed and depth while retrieving the antenna array  by reeling in the tow cable . As the antenna modules  enter the storage space, the inter-module helical spring  is compressed by tension of the tow cable  (and perhaps assisted by other inter-module mechanical or hydraulic means). Each subsequent inter-antenna helical spring  is compressed as the in-reeling process continues until the full complement of the array modules  is again stored. Mechanisms and means for the cable reel retrieval of towed antenna arrays currently exist and are known to those ordinarily skilled in the art.","While the present invention is described in terms of use in a particular embodiment for an undersea vehicle or submarine, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that numerous industrial, commercial and military applications take advantage of this concept. Some potential applications include enabling HF, VHF, UHF and microwave surface communication by submerged vessels. The present invention enables HF, VHF, UHF and microwave surface communications from submerged oceanographic sensor arrays.","Many additional changes in the details, components, steps, and organization of the system, herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
