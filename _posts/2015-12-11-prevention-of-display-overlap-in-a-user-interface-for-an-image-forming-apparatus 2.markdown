The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The disclosures herein generally relate to an information processing apparatus, a computer readable recording medium storing a program for causing a computer to execute a process and a user interface.","2. Description of the Related Art","For an image forming apparatus having a function such as a printer, an operator sets a print condition or the like from a user interface (in the following, referred to as \u201cUI\u201d) provided by the image forming apparatus. Moreover, in an image forming apparatus for so-called commercial printing which prints a large amount of documents for business use and binds books (an image forming apparatus suitable for production printing), the UI is not only used for setting print conditions but also utilized for managing a work flow, in which print processes for a print job are defined.","In the above-described image forming apparatuses, in association with introduction of higher functions, information that can be managed increases, and information to be displayed on the UI also increases. However, information that can be displayed on one UI at a time is restricted. Conventionally, a UI which takes account of operability and convenience for the operator has been studied (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 4895613). Japanese Patent No. 4895613 discloses an image forming apparatus that can display by switching between a basic screen and a simple screen, which is different from the basic screen and displays operation condition items, a number of which is less than that displayed in the basic screen. Moreover, Japanese Patent No. 4895613 describes displaying a simplified screen as a pop-up screen by the operator selecting input keys displayed on the basic screen. Since detailed items related to the input keys are displayed on the pop-up screen, the operator becomes able to utilize information with display size greater than an area of a display device.","It is a general object of at least one embodiment of the present invention to provide an information processing apparatus, a computer-readable recording medium storing a program for causing a computer to execute a process and a user interface that substantially obviate one or more problems caused by the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","In one embodiment, an information processing apparatus includes an acquisition unit configured to acquire status information of an image forming apparatus; and an information display unit configured to constantly display the status information of the image forming apparatus in a first region on a display device, to display setting information regarding image processing to be performed in the image forming apparatus in a second region on the display device, the second region being adjacent to the first region and to display a relation display element related to the setting information at a position so as not to overlap the relation display element with the first region.","In another embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium stores a program for causing a computer of an information processing apparatus to execute a process of constantly displaying on a display device status information of an image forming apparatus. The process includes acquiring the status information of the image forming apparatus; displaying constantly the status information of the image forming apparatus in a first region on the display device; displaying setting information regarding image processing to be performed in the image forming apparatus in a second region on the display device, the second region being adjacent to the first region; and displaying a relation display element related to the setting information at a position so as not to overlap the relation display element with the first region.","In yet another embodiment, a user interface for constantly indicating status information of an image forming apparatus, includes a first display element, in which setting information regarding image processing to be performed in the image forming apparatus is displayed; a second display element, in which the status information of the image forming apparatus is constantly displayed; and a third display element, which is related to the setting information displayed in the first display element, and is displayed overlapped with the first display element but not overlapped with the second display element.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.","<Outline of a User Interface of an Image Forming Apparatus According to a Present Embodiment>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["5","11","12","13","11","12","13"]},"Then, in the present embodiment, the present status display area  is an area for displaying the present status of the image forming apparatus and is not hidden by a pop-up screen .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["5","99","99","11"]},"Therefore, by the UI  according to the present embodiment, an operator of the image forming apparatus can constantly perceive the present status of the image forming apparatus.","Meanwhile, \u201cconstantly\u201d means that the present status display area  is always displayed without being hidden.

First, in the image forming apparatus for commercial printing, it is important to display a present status of the image forming apparatus on the UI for the operator. The operator preferably always perceives whether the image forming apparatus is in a state of being executable for printing at present, since for commercial printing the productivity of the image forming apparatus is directly linked to business benefits.","Accordingly, in the image forming apparatus for commercial printing, as shown in , a partition  dedicated for displaying status is arranged in a predetermined partition of the UI, and information such as a list of printing jobs is displayed in a partition  other than the dedicated partition . Since the partition  dedicated for displaying status always displays the status of the image forming apparatus, the operator can always perceive the present status of the image forming apparatus or the like.","However, in a case where the operator causes the pop-up screen  to appear in the above-described UI in order to display or input additional information related to the partition  other than the dedicated partition, the pop-up screen  may overlap the partition  dedicated for displaying the status, as shown in . In a case where the operator is concentrated on display contents of the pop-up screen  or inputting, it may be difficult to find a change in the status of the image forming apparatus in the partition  dedicated for displaying status. Moreover, even when the operator does not operate using the pop-up screen , in a case where the operator leaves the image forming apparatus while displaying the pop-up screen , the operator cannot monitor the status of the apparatus, and is difficult to find a change in the status of the image forming apparatus.","According to the present embodiment, an information processing apparatus that can constantly display status of an image forming apparatus can be provided.","<Other Example to which Present Embodiment is Applied>","As described above, the best mode for working of the present invention is explained with reference to the embodiments.
