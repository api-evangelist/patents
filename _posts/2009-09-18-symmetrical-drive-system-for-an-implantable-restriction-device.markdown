{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to laparoscopic implanted restriction system designed to be implanted in the body of a patient around a biological organ having a pouch or duct to regulate functioning of the organ or duct. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an implantable telemetrically powered and controlled ring suitable for use as a gastric band to treat obesity or as an artificial sphincter.","2. Description of the Related Art","Obesity refers to a body weight that exceeds the body's skeletal and physical standards. One well recognized parameter used to measure obesity is Body Mass Index (BMI), because it takes into account patient height and not just weight. BMI is calculated by dividing weight by height squared and is expressed in kg\/m2.","Obesity is well recognized as a serious health problem, and is associated with numerous health complications, ranging from non-fatal conditions to life-threatening chronic diseases. Surgical intervention generally is the treatment of choice for patients afflicted with morbid obesity. Such intervention not only mitigates the myriad of health problems arising from being overweight, but may also reduce the risk of early death of the patient. Left untreated, morbid obesity may reduce a patient's life expectancy by ten to fifteen years.","Morbidly obese patients as a group are poorly adapted to attain sustainable long-term weight loss using non-surgical approaches, such as strict diets combined with exercise and behavioral modification, even though such methods are acknowledged to be the safest. For this reason, there is a continuing need for direct intervention to provide effective, long-term treatments for morbid obesity. Three main surgical procedures are currently in use: Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (\u201cRYGB\u201d), Vertical Banded Gastroplasty (\u201cVBG\u201d) and Adjustable Gastric Banding (\u201cAGB\u201d).","In RYGB a small stomach pouch is created and a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is attached to the pouch so that food bypasses the lower stomach, the duodenum and the first portion of the jejunum. The RYGB procedure is both restrictive, in that the small pouch limits food intake and malabsorptive, in that the bypass reduces the amount of calories and nutrients the body absorbs.","VBG employs a non-adjustable synthetic band and staples to create a small stomach pouch. AGB employs a constricting synthetic ring defining a gastric band that is placed around the upper end of the stomach to create an artificial stoma within the stomach. The band is filled with saline solution and is connected to a small reservoir\/access-port located under the skin of the abdomen. The AGB band may be inflated, thereby reducing the size of the stoma, or deflated, thus enlarging the stoma, by puncturing the access-port with a needle and adding or removing saline solution. Both VBG and AGB are purely restrictive procedures, and have no malabsorptive effect.","It is sometimes necessary to re-operate, either to relieve the patient or to adjust or change the previously implanted band. In such cases, the previously implanted band must be cut and either removed or replaced. These operations are difficult to carry out, difficult for the patient to tolerate and costly.","Several attempts to overcome the drawbacks associated with hydraulically actuated gastric bands, are found in the prior art. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6,547,801 to Dargent et al. describes a surgically implanted gastroplasty system having a flexible tactile element that engages a motor-driven notched pulling member. The motor is powered and controlled by an inductive circuit, so that the diameter of the ring may only be changed by operation of an external remote control.","All of the foregoing surgical techniques involve major surgery and may give rise to severe complications. Recent developments have focused on the use of laparoscopic implantation of the gastric ring to minimize patient discomfort and recuperation time.","In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide apparatuses and methods for regulating functioning of a body organ or duct that provides high precision in controlling the degree of constriction imposed upon the organ or duct, without the drawbacks associated with prior control mechanisms.","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for regulating the functioning of a patient's organ or duct including an elongated member having a first end and a second end. A fastener is disposed on the first end of the elongated member. The fastener is configured to engage the second end of the elongated member so that the elongated member forms a loop around the organ or duct. A tension element is disposed for movement within the elongated member. A symmetrical drive system including a drive element associated with and engaging the tension element for causing the tension element to control the tension applied by the elongated member against a patient's body organ or duct is further provided.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the symmetrical drive system includes a flexible first threaded member and a flexible second threaded member controlled by a single motor.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the motor includes a first actuated drive and a second actuated drive.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the first actuated drive and the second actuated drive are simultaneously controlled by the motor.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the flexible first member includes a first end and a second end. The first end of the flexible first member is secured to a first end of the tension element and the second end of the flexible first member is fed into the first actuated drive of the motor. The flexible second member includes a first end and a second end, and the first end of the flexible second member is secured to a second end of the tension element and the second end is fed into the second actuated drive of the motor. The flexible first member is either drawn into or pushed further out of the first actuated drive and the flexible second member is either drawn into or pushed further out of the second actuated drive to either reduce or increase a diameter of the tension element.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the first actuated drive employs a nut upon which a threaded surface of the flexible first member rides so as to push or pull the flexible first member through the first actuated drive and the second actuated drive employs a nut upon which a threaded surface of the flexible second member ride so as to push or pull the flexible second member through the second actuated drive.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for regulating the functioning of a patient's organ or duct including an elongated member having a first end and a second end. A fastener is disposed on the first end of the elongated member. The fastener is configured to engage the second end of the elongated member so that the elongated member forms a loop around the organ or duct. A tension element is disposed for movement within the elongated member. The tension element is composed of a flexible first member and a flexible second member, wherein the flexible first member is movable relative to the flexible second member. A drive element is associated with and engages the tension element for causing the tension element to control the tension applied by the elongated member against a patient's body organ or duct.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the flexible first member is threaded externally and the flexible second member is internally threaded.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the flexible first member is shaped and dimensioned to seat within the flexible second member in a manner coupling the flexible first member to the flexible second member but allowing rotation of the flexible first member relative to the flexible second member for controlled adjustment of their relative positions.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein one of the flexible first member and the flexible second member is attached to a rotational motor such that as the motor turns the flexible first member is either drawn into or pushed farther out of the flexible second member to either reduce or increase the diameter thereof.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the flexible first member is a hollow shaft at a first end of the tension element and the flexible second member is a threaded shaft at a second end of the tension element.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the threaded shaft is movably coupled to a drive motor secured at a free end of the hollow shaft for controlling movement of the first end of the tension element relative to the second end of the tension element.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the drive motor includes an input passageway shaped and dimensioned to guide the threaded shaft therethrough and into a cavity defined by the hollow shaft.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the elongated member includes a first segment and a second segment. The first segment includes a first end and a second end and the second segment includes a first end and a second end. The second end of the first segment and the second end of second segment are linked via a quick connect coupling.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the tension element is composed of a first tension segment and a second tension segment. The first tension segment includes a first end and a second end and the second tension segment includes a first end and second end. The first end of the first segment and the first end of the second segment are linked via the drive element that couples the first end of the first tension segment to the first end of the second tension segment.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the second ends of the first segment and first tension segment and the second ends of the second segment and second tension segment are linked via the quick connect coupling.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the first ends of the first tension segment and the second tension segment terminate with a screw fitting engaged by a drive motor of the drive element.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the drive element includes an angled beveled gear connected to a motor which is in turn connected to the second ends of the first and second tension segments.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein angled racks are formed along the first ends of the first and second tension segments.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein the flexible first member includes camming surfaces and the flexible second member includes camming surfaces. The respective camming surfaces of the flexible first member and the flexible second camming member interact to control expansion and constriction of the tension element.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when viewed in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which set forth certain embodiments of the invention.","The detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. It should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and\/or use the invention.","Referring now to , the banding or implantable restriction system  of the present invention is described. The banding system  includes an external control  and implantable gastric band . In the following description reference will be made, by way of illustration, to a gastric band  in the form of a ring  designed to be implanted around the stomach to selectively adjust the diameter of the opening of the stoma, and thereby control food intake. Such regulation has the effect of creating a feeling of satiety in the patient after relatively little food is consumed, and provides an effective treatment for morbid obesity.","It is to be understood, however, that the present invention is in no way limited to gastroplasty, but on the contrary, advantageously may be applied to regulate the functioning of other body organs or ducts, such as in the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, urinary or fecal incontinence, colostomy, ileostomy or to regulate blood flow in connection with isolated organ perfusion for treatment of cancer. When applied in the treatment of urinary continence, the implantable portion of the present banding system , in particular, the elongated member in the form of a ring  will be implanted around the bladder or urinary tract, while in the case of fecal incontinence, the ring  may be implanted around a portion of the gastro-intestinal tracts, such as anal structures of the intestine. With this in mind, the present banding system  is MRI compatible and all elements thereof are non-ferro-magnetic.","As discussed above, the present invention relates to an implantable restriction system. A preferred embodiment of the implantable restriction system is disclosed herein with reference to a gastric band used in restricting the effective size of the stomach for application in bariatric procedures. As such, the implantable restriction system of the present invention is referred to as including a gastric band or ring throughout the present disclosure, although those skilled in the art will appreciate the concepts underlying the present invention may be applied in a variety of implantable restriction devices as briefly discussed above.","System Overview","With respect to , the self-contained external control  comprises a housing  having a control panel  and a display screen . The external control  includes a digital signal processor and may be battery-powered or powered using an external power supply, e.g., connected to an electric wall outlet. An external antenna  is coupled to the external control  via a cable . As described more fully with respect to , the external control  includes a controller (such as a microprocessor) that controls the emission of radiofrequency signals to the gastric band  to both control and power operation of the gastric band .","The external control  accepts a patient microchip card , which corresponds to the specific gastric band  implanted in the patient, and stores data, such as the implant identification number, adjustment parameters (e.g., upper and lower limits of an adjustment range, etc.) and information regarding the last adjustment position of the ring . The external control  as shown in  includes a signal strength indicator , as described in more detail below with respect to , an ON\/OFF button , an OPEN button , a CLOSE button , a COUPLING button and a menu options panel .","During use of the present banding system , the physician need only turn on external control  using the ON\/OFF button , position the external antenna  over the patient's chest above antenna\/controller pod , check the coupling by depressing the COUPLING button , and when the coupling is sufficient, adjust the degree of constriction using the OPEN button or the CLOSE button to control the effective circumference of the ring  in a manner discussed below in greater detail. The diameter of the gastric band  is continually displayed on the display screen  with a precision of about 0.1 mm for the entire range of diameters of the ring , e.g., from 19 mm fully closed to 29 mm fully opened.","Still referring to  and as briefly mentioned above, the gastric band  of the present invention includes a ring  coupled to an implantable antenna\/controller pod  via an antenna cable . The antenna\/controller pod  includes a removable tag  that may be used to laparoscopically position the ring . The ring  includes a first end  having a clip  that slides over and positively engages a second end  of the ring .","As described in detail below, the ring  is configured to be straightened to pass through the lumen of a commercially available 18 mm trocar for delivery to a patient's abdomen (see ). The tag , antenna\/controller pod  and antenna cable  are passed through a clip  to form the gastric band  into a substantially circular ring  around an upper portion of the patient's stomach, thereby reducing the diameter of the opening of the stomach. In its undeformed shape, the ring  assumes a circular arc configuration that facilitates positioning of the ring  around the stomach and also in self-guiding the clipping procedure.","The ring  of the present invention comprises a flexible tubular member having a smooth, flexible and elastic membrane, thus ensuring atraumatic contact with the patient's stomach tissue that is easily tolerated. When engaged with a dorsal element , the membrane  is stretched by an appropriate factor (i.e., 20%-40%), so that when the ring  is in it's fully closed position, little or no wrinkling appears on the membrane surface. The ring  has approximately the shape of a torus of revolution of substantially cylindrical cross-section. Alternatively, the ring  may have other suitable cross-sections, including rectangular. The housing  on the second end  of the ring , the clip  on the first end  of the ring  and the dorsal peripheral portion  of the ring , preferably are made of a biocompatible material such as silicone. An interior portion  of the ring  may be constructed in a variety of manners as discussed below in greater detail to permit engagement with the tissue without bunching or rippling, and, as discussed below in greater detail, may be covered in various manners to enhance the ring\/tissue interface and protect the ring .","Implantable Ring","Referring now to , the internal structure of the ring  is described. In particular, and as depicted in , the ring  includes a flexible tension element  having a fixed end  statically mounted to the first end  of the ring  and a free end  that is engaged with a motor-driven drive element  and extends into a cavity in the housing . The tension element  is slidingly disposed within a substantially cylindrical tube of a compressible material , e.g., ePTFE, as illustrated in , so that when the tension element  is pulled through the drive element , the compressible material  is compressed and the diameter of opening  is reduced. The compressible material  is preferably surrounded on its dorsal face by a dorsal element . The dorsal element  is flexible, but sturdier than the elastomeric material of the compressible material. The dorsal element is preferably composed of silicone. Both the compressible material  and the silicone dorsal element  preferably are enclosed within a membrane  of elastomeric biocompatible material, as shown in , to prevent tissue in-growth between the ePTFE compressible material  and the silicone dorsal element . The membrane  may be affixed to the dorsal element  using a biocompatible glue to prevent leakage in case of accidental puncture on the dorsal surface.","With reference to , various embodiments have been developed for improving the interaction between the inner surface  of the ring  and the tissue it engages as the band  is constricted about the stomach of a patient. In accordance with a first embodiment as shown with reference to , a fluid bladder  is added to the inner surface  along the internal circumference of the ring  such that the fluid bladder  interfaces with the tissue. In addition, to improving the tissue band interface, the addition of a fluid bladder  along the inner surface  of the ring  allows for ready adjustments to the restrictive level of the ring .","In accordance with such an embodiment, and as briefly discussed above, the fluid bladder  is formed along the inner surface  of the ring  for direct engagement with the tissue when the ring  is applied to the stomach and constricted thereabout. The fluid bladder  is preferably made of silicone (or other biocompatible material) and is constructed as an elongated cylindrical member  with a high degree of flexibility allowing it to conform to the surface of the tissue to which it is applied without adversely affecting the tissue when applied thereto for long periods of time. The cylindrical member  extends about substantially the entire length of the inner circumference of the ring . As such, the fluid bladder  includes a first end  adjacent the first end  of the ring  and a second end  adjacent the second end  of the ring .","The cylindrical member  includes a central lumen  shaped and dimensioned to receive a filling fluid as discussed below. The cylindrical member , and ultimately the central lumen , includes the closed first end  and the open second end . The second end  is provided with a port  in fluid communication with a filling tube  that extends from the fluid bladder  to a remote fluid source  allowing for the controlled application of the fluid to the fluid bladder  for filling thereof as desired by the medical practitioner deploying and installing the present ring . In accordance with such an embodiment, it is contemplated the remote source of fluid  could be integrated with the antenna\/controller pod  as discussed below in greater detail.","The filling tube  is provided with a first end  which is secured to the port  of the fluid bladder  and a second end  positioned remote from the first end . The second end  is fixedly or selectively secured to a source of fluid  for filling the fluid bladder  as one may desire in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the fluid source  is a miniature fill port which is subcutaneously implanted (for example, in conjunction with the antenna\/controller pod ) for access and addition of fluid as required by the needs of the patient being treated. The fill port  includes a flexible access septum  through which the medical practitioner may access the internal cavity  of the fill port  for increasing or decreasing the volume of fluid applied to the fluid bladder  positioned along the inner surface  of the ring  and in direct contact with the tissue of the stomach.","It is further contemplated that to achieve a softer tissue interface without secondary adjustability, the fluid bladder may be prefilled prior to implantation. Where such an implementation is employed, a fluid port would not be required. The fluid could be added directly through a catheter attached to the fluid bladder. Once added, the fluid would be trapped by plugging the catheter (for example, tying in a knot, adding a fluid plug, luer activated valve, etc.).","In the event of a mechanical or electrical adjustment feature failure the fluid bladder would allow at least minor adjustments to the band. The fluid bladder can be used as a safety feature in case the mechanical adjustment is not functioning properly, since fluid could easily be removed from the bladder un-tightening the gastric band and relieving the pressure applied to the stomach.","It is contemplated the fluid bladder could be prefilled with a substance or solution prior to installation. Where the fluid bladder is prefilled, the fluid within the fluid bladder is hyper-osmolar relative to the implanted physiological environment. For example, the filling fluid may be a salt solution or ionic polymer solution, sodium alginate, sodium hyaluronate, etc. The fluid may also be hypo-osmolar relative to the implanted physiological environment, such as, a non-ionic polymer solution poly(ethylene glycol). The fluid may also be a non-Newtonian fluid, such as, a polymer solution selected from the group consisting of a poly(vinylpyrrolidone), carboxymethylcellulose, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(acrylamid), sodium hyaluronate, hyaluronic acid, and alginates. The fluid may further be a non-aqueous fluid or gel, such as, a silicone oil or fluorosilicone oil.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, the ring  is shaped and dimensioned to provide for more compliant material and\/or construction by altering the cross sectional geometry of the ring  to reduce the spring constant of the compressible material  between the tension element  and the tissue. In addition, improved compliance and construction are achieved by altering the construction of the gastric band  such that a secondary, softer material is introduced into the space between the tension element  and the tissue, giving the gastric band reduced spring constant. Improved compliance and construction is further achieved by combining a reduced spring constant with a viscoelastic filler material to give viscoelastic (or rate dependent) deformation characteristics.","In accordance with this embodiment, and as show with reference to embodiments shown in , variations in the spring constant of the gastric band  between the tension element  and the tissue is achieved through the formation of longitudinally extending space(s)  within the compressible material . In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the space(s)  maintains a constant shape along the length of the compressible material , although it is contemplated the shapes of the space(s)  may be varied along the length of the compressible material  and the ring . In practice of the present embodiment, the spring constants may be derived or inferred from tissue interface pressures in the range of \u2212100 mmHg to 300 mmHg gauge pressure wherein the basic relationship is determined by the formula p=F\/A. However, it is also contemplated pressures outside this range may also be used.","The space(s)  may be filled with another material such as silicone rubber, a lower durometer polymer or closed-cell foam to give a reduced spring constant. The space(s)  within the cross section may also include viscous or viscoelastic filler materials. That is, they demonstrate rate dependent response to dynamic force conditions such as the passage of food through the esophagus. Potential viscous\/viscoelastic filler materials include, but are not limited to, saline liquid or gel silicone, biogels, close cell foams, or pack granules or spears of one or more materials.","In addition to improving the spring constant, the incorporation of open space(s)  in the compressible material  as disclosed herein maximizes the interface between the ring  and the tissue thereby spreading the forces or interface pressures applied to the tissue in accordance with the present invention.","As discussed above, the space(s)  may take a variety of forms. For example, and with reference to , the space  takes the form of a substantially C-shaped lumen. In accordance with an alternate embodiment as shown with reference to , the space  takes the form of truncated triangle wherein the top section (that is, the narrow portion adjacent the tension element ) of the triangle is curved and the bottom section (that is, the wide portion removed from the tension element ) of the triangle includes a slightly concave base. In accordance with yet a further embodiment, and with reference to , first and second arcuate spaces  are provided on opposite sides of the ring . Once again, and with reference to , four elongated spaces  are provided. The elongated spaces  are oriented such that when viewed across the cross section of the ring , the longitudinal axis thereof extends transversely against the longitudinal axis passing through the center of the ring . In accordance with yet a further embodiment, and with reference to , the spaces  are formed so as to extend circumferentially about the compressible material  of the ring  and take the form of arcuate members whose concave surfaces  faces away from the center of the ring  and whose convex surfaces  face away from the center of the ring .","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, and with reference to , the ring , and in particular, the compressible material , may be provided with a fluid chamber  extending along the inner circumferential portion of the compressible material . In contrast to the embodiment disclosed above with reference to , the fluid lumen or chamber  forms part of the compressible material and is preferably integrally formed with the compressible material . As such, the compressible material  may be thought of as including a fluid lumen  along its inner surface, the fluid lumen  being shaped and dimensioned for maintaining a desired fluid therein so as to improve the stress profile being applied to the tissue.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fluid chamber  includes a cross-sectional profile, when viewed along a plane transverse to the circumferential axis running along the center of the ring , that remains constant along the length of the ring . The profile is elliptical defining an arcuate inner wall  and an arcuate outer wall  with the concave surfaces thereof facing each other.","In addition to improving the tissue to ring interface by providing greater compliance along this area, the fluid chamber  may also allow for expansion of the gastric band  in the event the mechanical adjustment system fails. In particular, the fluid lumen  is maintained in fluid communication with a remote fluid pressure source as discussed above with reference to . As such, and if the mechanical or electrical adjustment feature fails, fluid may be pumped into the fluid lumen  creating additional pressure that is transferred to the stomach about which the ring  is positioned. Alternatively, fluid may be removed from the fluid lumen  thereby relieving pressure applied to the stomach about which the ring  is positioned. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, it is contemplated the fluid source may be housed in and controlled by the antenna\/controller pod  of the ring . It is further contemplated, the fluid source may also be manually adjusted by a separate connection to a fluid port.","In accordance with still a further embodiment, the cross-sectional geometry of the gastric band  may be varied to cover other alternatives. As shown with reference to , the geometry is altered such that the tension element  is positioned off center of the compressible material , that is, the cross sectional area of the ring  itself. By doing this, the tension element  takes advantage of rotational torque resulting from the off center positioning and produces mechanical advantages during the constriction of the ring .","With reference to the embodiments shown with reference to , a softer tissue ring interface is achieved by positioning a flexible strip  along the inner surface  of the ring , and between the compressible material  and the membrane . This strip  is designed to spread the forces of the tension element  along the entire circumference of the ring  and is preferably made from a polymer. With reference to , the strip  is placed along the inner surface  of the ring , and not between the compressible material  and the membrane . In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the strip  includes an inner surface  and an outer surface . The inner surface  is substantially smooth and flat and is adapted to directly face the tissue upon constriction of the ring , with the strip  positioned between the compressible material  and the membrane . The outer surface  includes substantially flat portions  and a central protrusion  which is shaped and dimensioned to directly engage the tension element  upon constriction thereof. As such, and when the tension element  is tightened, the tension element  applies pressure directly to the central protrusion  of the flexible strip . This pressure is transferred along the entire length of the flexible strip  such that pressure is evenly distributed along the inner surface  of the strip . In accordance with yet another embodiment, and with reference to , the inner surface  of the strip  may take the form of a resilient tubular member  with additional compliance. By utilizing such a design, the interior volume  defined by the strip  may be filled with viscoelastic materials enhancing the compliance of the strip  and the overall tissue ring interface.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, and with reference to , B, A and B, the ring  further comprises a layer  of a relatively rigid material disposed on the dorsal periphery of the ring . The layer , which may comprise a plastic or metal alloy, prevents the exterior diameter D of the ring  from changing during adjustment of the tension element  to reduce the internal diameter (or opening ) of the ring . The layer , by its structural rigidity, imposes a circular arc shape for the entirety of the ring . Advantageously, the layer  allows the tension element  to be adjusted following encapsulation of the ring  by fibrous tissue after implantation, since adjustment of the internal diameter of the ring  does not change the external diameter D of the ring .","The foregoing feature is illustrated in  where the ring  is shown in its fully opened and fully closed positions, respectively. As discussed above, the layer  forms a rigid skeleton that permits the internal diameter of the ring  to change while maintaining the external diameter D constant. Radial movement of the tension element  is transmitted to the membrane  by the compressible material . ePTFE is particularly well-suited for use as the compressible material  because it can undergo a 3:1 reduction in length without experiencing a significant increase in cross-section.","Accordingly, and as depicted in , increase or reduction of the effective length of the tension element  results in reversible radial displacement at the internal periphery of the ring  opposite the dorsal periphery. This in turn translates into a variation of internal diameter of the ring  from a fully open diameter to a fully closed diameter by expanding or controlling the ring  to control the tension applied by the ring  against a patient's body organ or duct. Preferably, the fully open internal diameter is about 35 mm, and the fully closed internal diameter is about 15 mm. More preferably, the fully open internal diameter is about 29 mm, and the fully closed internal diameter is about 19 mm.","Referring now to , the tension element  in accordance with a first embodiment is described. This tension element is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005\/0143766, which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the tension element  has sufficient flexibility to permit it to be formed into the substantially circular shape of the ring , while also being able to transmit the force necessary to adjust the ring diameter. The tension element  therefore comprises a flexible core , preferably a metal alloy wire of circular cross section, on which is fixed, and wound coaxially, at least one un-joined coil spring which defines the screw thread pitch.","As shown in , the tension element  preferably comprises two un-joined coil springs that form a screw thread: a first spring , wound helicoidally along the flexible core , and a second spring  of greater exterior diameter. The second spring  preferably comprises coils  of rectangular transverse section, so as to delineate a flat external generatrix. The first spring  is interposed between coils  of the second spring  to define and maintain a substantially constant square screw thread pitch, even when the tension element  is subjected to bending.","As a consequence of the foregoing arrangement, the ability of the tension element  to maintain a substantially constant thread pitch, when subjected to bending, confers great precision on adjustments of the ring . This is especially so when it is realized that as the tension element  is drawn through the drive element , an ever-increasing curvature is imposed on the remaining portion of the tension element . However, because the foregoing arrangement of un-joined coils maintains a substantially constant screw thread pitch, the energy needed to drive the drive element  remains low and the efficiency of energy transmission resulting from the use of a square screw thread pitch remains high. In addition, the use of a square screw thread pitch guarantees a stable adjustment position even when the drive element is unpowered.","Referring now to , the tension element  is described. The free end  includes a crimped cap , the second spring  has coils with a square transverse section, and the first spring  (not visible in , but shown in ) is intertwined between the coils of the second spring . The flexible core  extends through the first and second springs , , and terminates close to the crimped cap . In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the tension element  further comprises a third spring  that is coupled to the flexible core , and the first and second springs ,  at junction . The third spring  includes a loop  at the end opposite to junction , which permits the tension element  to be mounted to the first end  of the ring .","With respect to , the tension element  is shown disposed within a skeleton  of the ring . The skeleton  includes a layer  that forms the dorsal periphery (corresponding to the layer  of , B, A and B), an anchor  that accepts the loop  of the tension element , and a drive element housing . The skeleton  is preferably constructed from a high strength moldable plastic. As further depicted in , the skeleton  extends along a greater arc length than the tension element . In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the third spring  permits the gastric band  to be straightened for insertion through a standard 18 mm trocar, despite the differential elongation of the skeleton  and the tension element . This feature is illustrated in , which depicts the ring  inserted through 18 mm trocar  so that the ring  is substantially straight.","Referring now to , the housing  of the free end of the ring  is described. The housing  comprises an elastomeric material, such as silicone, having a recessed portion , a tension element cavity  and a cable lumen . The recessed portion  is configured to accept the drive element housing  of the skeleton , so that as the tension element  is drawn through the drive element  it extends into the tension element cavity . A cable lumen  extends through the housing  so that the antenna cable  may be coupled to the drive element . The housing  preferably may be grasped in area G using atraumatic laparoscopic graspers during manipulation of the gastric band .","In , the drive element housing  of the skeleton  is shown with the drive element  and the tension element  disposed therethrough. The antenna cable  is coupled to a motor (not shown) disposed within the drive element housing . The tension element  is in the fully opened (largest diameter) position, so that the crimped cap  contacts the printed circuit board  of the reference position switch, described below with respect to .","Because the tension element  must be drawn through the drive element  to cause tightening thereof, the tension element  described above necessarily requires that the tail end , that is, the end nearest crimped cap , of the tension element  extends beyond the drive element  with the extending portion increasing as the ring  is tightened, making potential interference with the viscera possible. In addition, the tension element  may cause localized stress to the inside surface, for example, the compressible material , of the gastric band  as well as potentially to the viscera.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment and with reference to , the diameter of the ring  is adjusted without the need for a tension element including a tail end which is extended and retracted as the need for adjustments in the diameter of the ring  are desired. The tension element  in accordance with this embodiment is composed of an inner first strap member , an outer second strap member  and a camming strap member  moveably positioned therebetween. The first strap member  includes an inner surface  and an outer surface , the second strap member  includes an inner surface  and an outer surface , and the camming strap member  includes an inner surface  and an outer surface . The inner surface  of the first strap member  is substantially smooth and is shaped and dimensioned for facing the tissue which the ring  engages. The outer surface  of the first strap member  includes a plurality of recessed camming surfaces  shaped and dimensioned for interacting with protruding camming  surfaces extending from the inner surface  of the camming strap member . Similarly, the outer surface  of the second strap member  is substantially smooth and is shaped and dimensioned for facing the tissue which the ring  engages. The inner surface  of the second strap member  includes a plurality of recessed camming surfaces  shaped and dimensioned for interacting with protruding camming surfaces  extending from the outer surface  of the camming strap member .","As discussed above, the camming strap member  is shaped and dimensioned for positioning between the first strap member  and the second strap member  in manner such that the camming strap member  is in sliding contact with the first and second strap members ,  but is free to move relative thereto. As such, when the camming strap member  moves circumferentially relative to the first and second strap members , , the protruding camming surfaces ,  of the camming strap member  interact with the recessed camming surfaces ,  of the respective first and second strap members , . As a result of this interaction, the first strap member  is caused to move inwardly or outwardly selectively decreasing or increasing the effective diameter of the ring .","Controlled movement of the camming strap member  is achieved by a drive element  secured at the first end  of the camming strap member . In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the drive element  is a conventional drive mechanism, for example, screw drive, friction belt drive, servomotor, etc.","It is further contemplated the recessed camming surfaces ,  and the protruding camming surface ,  may be adjusted in height and location along the circumference of the tension element  so as to adjust the ability of the tension element  to control adjustments in the diameter of the ring . That is, the total adjustment range of the tension element  will depend on the configuration of the recessed and protruding camming surfaces , , , , specifically, the number of camming surfaces and the height of the camming surface. In the simplest case the adjustment diameters could be described as","\u03b8=original diameter","h=height of wedge","\u03b8=final diameter","\u03b8=\u03b8+2(h)","This tension element  construction offers a variety of advantages, including: the cost of the flexible spring assembly disclosed with reference to other embodiments can be avoided and the total throw of the motor can be reduced therefore reducing the length of the tail section. Multiple camming surface configurations can be adapted to the design to achieve different adjustment ranges while a constant pressure profile on the restricted tissue can be is maintained.","Drive Element","With respect to , the drive element  used in conjunction with the tension element  disclosed with reference to , includes a motor  coupled to the antenna cable  that drives the nut  through the gears . As with the various embodiments presented throughout the present disclosure, the motor may take a variety of forms including, but not limited to a stepper motor and piego motor. The nut  is supported by upper and lower bearings  to minimize energy losses due to friction. The nut  is self-centering, self-guiding and provides high torque-to-axial force transfer. The drive element  is disclosed in greater detail with reference to U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005\/0143766, entitled \u201cTELEMETRICALLY CONTROLLED BAND FOR REGULATING FUNCTIONING OF A BODY ORGAN OR DUCT, AND METHODS OF MAKING, IMPLANTATION AND USE\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Referring now to , the reference position switch of the present banding system  is described. Because the drive element  of the present banding system  employs a nut  driven by a stepper motor , there is no need for the system to include a position sensor or encoder to determine the length of the tension element  drawn through the drive element . Instead, the diameter of the ring  may be directly computed as a function of the screw thread pitch and the number of rotations of the nut . To ensure an accurate calculation of the degree of restriction imposed by the ring , however, it is desirable to provide at least one reference point.","This reference datum is accomplished in the ring  of the present invention using a reference position switch that is activated when the ring  is moved to its fully open position. The crimped cap  on the free end of the tension element  serves this function by contacting electrical traces  on the printed circuit board  (and also limits elongation of the screw thread). The circuit board  is disposed just above the bearing , which forms part of the drive element  (see also ). When the crimped cap  contacts the traces , it closes a switch that signals the implantable controller that the ring  is in the fully open position.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to , a symmetrical drive system  is employed. Briefly, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the drive system  employs two flexible members ,  which, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, are flexible screws simultaneously operating upon the tension element  using a single motor  with a dual actuated drive , . The dual actuated drives ,  provide directional control for loosening or tightening the flexible members , . In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the body of the tension element  is constructed in substantially the same manner as that described with reference to the embodiment shown in ,  and . However, and considering the flexible members interact with the dual actuated drives for controlled constriction and expansion of the ring , the body of the tension element may be constructed of various materials and may be constructed without departing from the spirit of the present invention. However, and as will be appreciated based upon tile following disclosure, flexible first and second screws ,  are secured to the opposite ends ,  of the tension element  allowing for actuation in accordance with the embodiment disclosed herein.","By drawing the tension element  at both ends, and simultaneously applying pressure to the opposite ends, the applied tension is uniformly distributed along the length of the tension element .","More particularly, a flexible first screw  is provided at one end of the tension element . The first screw  includes a first end  and a second end . The first end  is secured to a first end  of the tension element  and the second end  is fed into a first actuated drive  of the motor . Similarly, the flexible second screw  includes a first end  and a second end . The first end  is secured to a second end  of the tension element  and the second end  is fed into a second actuated drive  of the motor . With the first and second ends ,  of the tension element  respectively secured to the first end  of the first screw  and the first end  of the second screw , and the motor  connecting the second ends ,  of the first and second screws , , a complete circular loop is created. The effective circumference of the circular loop is, therefore, readily adjusted by manipulating the extent to which the first and second screws ,  are drawn into the first and second actuated drives ,  of the motor .","As briefly discussed above, the motor  is provided with first and second actuated drives , . The first and second actuated drives ,  include respective inputs ,  that are positioned on opposites sides of the motor  for receiving the second ends ,  of the respective first and second screws , . As such, the second end  of the first screw  is fed into the input  of the first actuated drive  where it is engaged by a drive mechanism (for example, a screw drive in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention). The second end  of the second screw  is fed into the input  of the second actuated drive  where it is engaged by a drive mechanism (for example, a screw drive in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention).","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the drive mechanisms of the first actuated drive  and the second actuated drive  employ nut-like features upon which a threaded surface of the first and second screws ,  ride so as to push or pull the first and second screws ,  through the motor body. When the motor  is energized, the first and second screws ,  move in opposite directions and tighten the tension element  about a central axis of the ring . Because both screws ,  move at the same time, the tension element , and ultimately, the gastric band , can be adjusted twice as fast as a single direction screw with the same amount of work.","With the first screw  engaged by the drive mechanism of the first actuated drive  and the second screw  engaged by the drive mechanism of the second actuated drive , actuation of the motor  is controlled to actuate the first and second actuated drives ,  to either simultaneous draw the first and second screws ,  into the motor  or the simultaneous push the first and second screws ,  out of the motor  for either decreasing or increasing the effective circumference of the tension element .","By employing the embodiment described above, symmetrical movement allows for a more uniform distribution of force on the tension element . The tension element  is also fixedly secured to the ring  at an anchor point  diametrically opposite the motor . In this way, the first and second screws ,  connected to the tension element  pull the membrane  of the ring  uniformly inward or outward from the anchor point  diametrically opposite the motor  of the gastric band . It should be noted that is contemplated that the anchor point is not limited to the top of the gastric band but may be located at one side or opposite the motor drive.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment as shown with reference to , the drive system  includes a tension element  composed of two flexible members (referred to as springs) , . The springs ,  are linked together so as to define the tension element  used in increasing or decreasing the circumference of the ring. The flexible first member  is threaded externally like a bolt (inner spring) and the flexible second member  is internally threaded like a nut (outer spring). The inner spring  is shaped and dimensioned to seat within the outer spring  in a manner coupling the inner and outer springs ,  but allowing rotation of the outer spring  relative to the inner spring  for controlled adjustment of their relative positions as discussed below in greater detail.","More particularly, the outer spring  is attached to a rotational motor  with the inner spring  threaded into the outer spring . As the motor  turns the inner spring  is either drawn into or pushed farther out of the outer spring  to either reduce or increase the diameter of the stoma defined by the ring . To prevent total restriction of the stomach, the outer spring  or inner spring  is provided with a hard stop  that will prevent further restriction. It will be appreciated that the inner and outer springs could also be thought of as a flexible screw and flexible nut.","Referring now to , yet another embodiment is disclosed. In accordance with this embodiment, the tension element  mounted within the ring  is provided with a flexible hollow threaded shaft  at its first end  and a flexible threaded shaft  at its opposite second end . The threaded shaft  is movably coupled to a drive motor  secured at the free end  of the hollow threaded shaft  for controlling movement of the first end  of the tension element  relative to the second end  of the tension element .","More particularly, the hollow threaded shaft  defining the first end  of the tension element  includes a free end  and a coupled end , while the threaded shaft  defining the second end  of the tension element  includes a free end  and a coupled end . The coupled end  of the hollow threaded shaft  is secured to the coupled end  of the threaded shaft .","A drive motor  is secured to the free end  of the hollow threaded shaft . The drive motor  includes an input passageway  shaped and dimensioned to guide the threaded shaft  therethrough and into the cavity  defined by the hollow threaded shaft . As such, and with the threaded shaft  engaged with the drive motor , the drive motor  is actuated to either draw into or push threaded shaft  out of the hollow threaded shaft  to either reduce or increase the diameter of the stoma defined by the ring . To prevent excessive inward or outward movement, it is contemplated the threaded shafts may be provided with a hard stop(s) (not shown). Additionally, to facilitate connection to the coupled end of the hollow shaft a tapered lead end feature may be added to the free end of the threaded shaft. Similarly, it is further contemplated the hollow threaded shaft may have a cone like feature to more readily facilitate alignment to the threaded shaft during connection.","In accordance with yet a further embodiment and with reference to , a quick connect coupling  for use in conjunction with a screw drive mechanism  is employed. The quick connect coupling  is a snap-together feature molded into a central segment  of the ring .","More particularly, the ring  contains the silicone sleeve that interacts with the patient's stomach to create the gastric band , but the ring  is split at the central segment  to allow for controlled splitting of the ring  in a manner allowing for ease of deployment and ease of removal. As with the embodiments discussed above, a tension element  extends within the ring  and similarly includes a split in the central segment . Accordingly, the ring  may be thought of as including a first segment  and a second segment . The first segment  includes a first end  and a second end  and the second segment  includes a first end  and a second end . The tension element  is similar composed of a first tension segment  and a second tension segment . The first tension segment  includes a first end  and a second end  and the second tension segment  includes a first end  and second end . The first end  of the first segment  and the first end  of the second segment  are linked at the motor  that couples the first end  of the first tension segment  to the first end  of the second tension segment . Completing the circle defined by the ring and tension elements , , the second ends ,  of the first segment  and first tension segment  and the second ends ,  of the second segment  and second tension segment  are linked via the quick connect coupling .","In practice, the gastric band , with the quick connect coupling  disconnected allows the second ends ,  of the first and second segments ,  of the ring  to move freely relative to each other. Thus, the ring  can be positioned adjacent the stomach and the quick connect coupling  is used by the surgeon to first place and attach the gastric band  during surgery. The first end  of the first tension segment  and the first end  the second tension segment  each terminate with a drive screw . The drive screws  engage the drive motor  and are actuated thereby. The motor  may then be used to open and close the gastric band  about the stomach of the user.","It is contemplated the first and second tension segments ,  could be made of braided cable, laminate polymers, or even a single wire. The body of the first and second tension segments ,  may be substantially wider than the drive screw  to uniformly distribute the load. The non-braided version will be more susceptible to fatigue and failure so appropriate materials like nylon may need to be used. As discussed herein in greater detail, the first and second tension segments ,  are housed within a center molded cavity of the gastric band  that allows them to slip with respect to the gastric band  so that as they are tightened stress does not build up in the silicone outer sleeve that would tend to wrinkle or fold the outer membrane.","With regard to the drive motor , it is housed within a pocket in the middle of the gastric band  and is secured to the first end  of the first segment  of the ring . The motor housing  is grounded and attached to the housing sleeve  so that when energy or power is applied; the motor shaft  rotates, not the motor housing . The motor housing  is attached to a drive screw  that is coupled to the opposite first ends ,  of the first and second tension segments , . If one polarity is applied, the motor shaft  rotates in a first direction and the system is tightened drawing the first ends ,  of the respective first and second tension segments ,  toward one another. If the opposite polarity is applied, the motor shaft  rotates in a second direction opposite to the first direction and the system loosens, pushing the first ends ,  of the respective first and second tension segments ,  away from one another. The drive thread configuration can be changed to allow for different speed or torque ratios of the motor to the linear travel of the screws. This will also prevent back travel when the motor is not energized due to the inertia within the motor itself. Additionally, if power is always present, it is contemplated active braking could be incorporated by applying the same polarity to both poles of the motor thereby increasing its holding strength, although usage of power for braking might not be practical in certain application as it would consume power more quickly. It is further contemplated this could also be achieved passively by using a stepper motor which would inherently braking when power is removed.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment as shown with reference to , a tightening nut  is rotated around the outside of the first and second tension segments ,  and has a worm gear  coupled to the motor (not shown). The worm gear  prevents back travel and forces cannot be passed from the tension segments ,  back to the motor if the motor is not moving the disclosed worm gear configuration. Rotation in either direction by the motor drive shaft  linearly moves the screw head ends \u2032, \u2032 of the first and second tension segments ,  towards each other or away from each other since the first and second tension segments ,  are not actually rotated. It is contemplated the threading on the ends of the first and second tension segments may not be circumferential but only on one side. This would improve guidance and prevent slipping of the threads.","It is further contemplated the screw ends could be connected to drive cables forming the tension segments by crimping the metal thread end to the drive cable, or it could be overmolded plastic if the resulting threading was strong enough to work in conjunction with the drive. It could also be molded in the system as a hole with long fiber filler added to the plastic to improve its tension capabilities.","Referring to , and in accordance with another drive structure for use in accordance with the system described with reference to , a drive  with an angled beveled gearing surface is connected to a motor  which is in turn connected to the outer portion of a gastric band . In this configuration, angled racks ,  are formed along the first ends ,  of the first and second tension segments ,  of the gastric band . As the motor  rotates, both ends ,  of the first and second tension segments ,  of the gastric band  are drawn inward at the same speed if the motor  were to rotate in a first direction, for example, counterclockwise orientation, and the gastric band  is uniformly tightened.","With reference to , it is contemplated the beveled gearing surface of the drive  may be oriented at a 90\u00b0 angle from the above embodiment such that the angled racks ,  are drawn over top of one another. The angled racks ,  in these embodiments require a track with low friction by which they can travel linearly with respect to each other. This track would also ensure that there is a solid connection to the beveled gear and that no slippage occurs.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to , the angled racks ,  (shown above with reference to ) are replaced by high strength cables ,  and connected directly around a motor shaft  in a manner similar to a winch system. The alternative could reduce the complexity of the design as the cables would not require tight tolerances and there would be no concern that the racks could slip from the winch.","In accordance with yet another embodiment, and with reference to , the motor  is external to the gastric band  and has a flexible drive cable  that rotates any internal gears, racks, pinions, etc. (shown with reference to the drive of , although other drive systems are contemplated). The drive cable  is capable of providing adequate torque to the drive screw  in order to tighten the gastric band . The flexible cable drive would be similar to that found on the Johnson & Johnson Mammotome\u2122 MR product. This flexible drive cable could be implemented into several other embodiments as well when coupled with the appropriate hardware at each of the ends.","While the drive element  of the present ring  is robust and not prone to failure, it may at times be necessary to release the tension element  in an emergency. The release of the tension element  would provide for immediate release of tension applied by the ring  to the stomach and permit removal of the ring  from its position about the stomach.","In accordance with a first embodiment of a tension element release system and with reference to ,  and , the tension element  includes a free end  and a fixed end . The fixed end  is secured adjacent the first end  of the ring  via a release mechanism  allowing selective release of the fixed end  of the tension element  from the first end of the ring  for release of tension being applied by the ring . The release mechanism  includes a jaw mechanism  that selectively engages the fixed end  of the tension element . The fixed end  is provided with a bulbous head  that is selectively seated within the jaw mechanism  in the manner discussed below in greater detail.","The jaw mechanism  includes a fixed jaw member  and a movable jaw member . A jaw drive element  is positioned between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member . The fixed jaw member  is substantially L-shaped and includes a first leg  and a second leg  oriented perpendicular to each other. Similarly, the movable jaw member  is substantially L-shaped and includes a first leg  and a second leg  oriented perpendicular to each other. The fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  sit facing each other in a mirror like orientation with the first legs ,  of the respective fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  substantially parallel to each other and the second legs ,  of the respective fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  facing each other in an aligned manner. By adopting this orientation, the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  create a cavity in which the enlarged head  of the tension element  may sit while the remainder of the tension element  extends through the opening  formed between the free ends ,  of the respective second legs ,  of the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw member . As will be appreciated based upon the following disclosure, a spring  biases the movable jaw member  toward the fixed jaw member  maintaining the free ends ,  of the respective second legs ,  of the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw member  in proximity to each other for holding the enlarged head  of the tension element  until it is desired to release the tension element .","When one desires to release the tension element , that is, release the enlarged head  of the tension element  from its position between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member , the jaw drive element  is expanded in a manner pushing the movable jaw member  away from the fixed jaw member . As the movable jaw member  is pushed away from the fixed jaw member , that is, as the jaw mechanism  is moved from its locked orientation with the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw member  in close proximity to its release orientation with the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw member  moved away from each other, the opening  therebetween expands until it is larger than the enlarged head  of the tension element  at which time the fixed end  of the tension element  is released from its position between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member .","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the jaw drive element  is a balloon  which may be selectively expanded for engagement with the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  in a manner selectively moving the fixed jaw member  and the movably jaw member  to their release orientation. While a particular jaw drive element  is disclosed above in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is contemplated other drive element mechanisms may be employed without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","For example, and in accordance with an alternate embodiment shown with reference to , the jaw drive element  might take the form of a balloon  secured to the fixed jaw member , which upon expansion presses against the movable jaw member  to place the jaw mechanism  in its release orientation. It is contemplated such a balloon  would be constructed of silicone and be supplied with fluid for expansion via a catheter  extending along the present apparatus.","Another jaw drive element \u2032 is shown with reference to . In accordance with this embodiment, a shape memory alloy spring  is positioned between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member . The spring  is linked to a source of electricity . Upon application of the a voltage across the spring , the spring  will change shape, for example, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment, expand, forcing the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw members  apart in a manner moving the jaw mechanism  to its release orientation.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment as shown with reference to , the jaw mechanism  includes a first movable jaw member and a second movable jaw member . The first movable jaw member and the second movable jaw member are pivotally connected with first and second spring biasing members , forcing them toward one another. A jaw drive element  is positioned between the first movable jaw member and the second movable jaw member ","The first movable jaw member is substantially L-shaped and includes a first leg and a second leg oriented perpendicular to each other. Similarly, the second movable jaw member is substantially L-shaped and includes a first leg and a second leg oriented perpendicular to each other. Each of the first and second movable jaw members , include a laterally extending flange , through which a pivot pin  extends for pivotally linking the first movable jaw member to the second movable jaw member in a manner described above. The first movable jaw member and the second movable jaw member sit facing each other in a mirror like orientation with the first legs , of the respective first and second movable jaw members , substantially parallel to each other and the second legs , of the respective first and second movable jaw members , facing each other in an aligned manner. By adopting this orientation, the first and second movable jaw members , create a cavity in which the enlarged head  of the tension element  may sit while the remainder of the tension element  extends through the opening  formed between the free ends ,  of the respective second legs , of the first and second movable jaw members , . As will be appreciated based upon the following disclosure, the first and second movable jaw members , are biased toward each other maintaining the free ends ,  of the respective second legs , of the first and second movable jaw member , in proximity to each other for holding the enlarged head  of the tension element  until it is desired to release the tension element . When one desires to release the tension element , that is, release the enlarged head  of the tension element  from its position between the first and second movable jaw members , , the jaw drive element  is expanded in a manner pushing the first and second movable jaw members , away from each other. As the first and second movable jaw members , are pushed away from each other, that is, as the jaw mechanism  is moved from its locked orientation with the first and second movable jaw members , in close proximity, to its release orientation with the first and second movable jaw members , moved away from each other, the opening  therebetween expands until it is larger than the enlarged head  of the tension element  at which time the fixed end  of the tension element  is released from its position between the first and second movable jaw members , ","As with embodiment described above, the jaw drive element  is a balloon  which may be selectively expanded for engagement with the first and second movable jaw members , in a manner selectively moving the first and second movable jaw members , to their release orientation. While a particular jaw drive element is disclosed above in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is contemplated other drive element mechanisms may be employed without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, another jaw drive element \u2032 is shown with reference to . In accordance with this embodiment a shape memory alloy spring  is positioned between the movable jaw members , . The spring  is linked to a source of electricity . Upon application of a voltage across the spring , the spring  will expand forcing the movable jaw members , apart in a manner moving the jaw mechanism  to its release orientation.","In accordance with yet another embodiment shown in , the fixed end  of the tension element  is secured in position for selective release via a fracture mechanism . In particular, the fixed end  of the tension element  is secured to an elongated coupling element  extending within a shape memory alloy tube , wherein upon the application of a change in temperature, for example, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment, heating, of the shape memory alloy tube , the tube  will expand in a manner fracturing the elongated coupling element  and permitting release of the fixed end  of the tension element .","The shape memory alloy tube  is substantially cylindrical and includes a proximal end  and a distal end . The elongated coupling element  is shaped and dimensioned to extend within the tube  between the proximal end  and the distal end . The tube  includes a first opening  at the proximal end  and a second opening  at the distal end . The first opening  is slightly smaller than the enlarged head of the coupling element  and the enlarged head is, therefore, shaped and dimensioned to sit upon the ledge  defined by the first opening . The second opening  of the tube  is slightly smaller than the first opening . However, the second end of the coupling element  also includes an enlarged head which is shaped and dimensioned to sit upon the ledge  defined by the second opening . As such, the coupling element  is held between with first opening  of the tube  and the second opening  of the tube  with the enlarged heads , of the coupling element  sitting outside of the tube . The coupling element  is provided with a reduced diameter fracture section  located between the enlarged head at the first end of the coupling element  and the enlarged head at the second end of the coupling element . In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fracture section  is located adjacent the second end of the coupling element . The fixed end  of the tension element  is secured to the coupling element  at the second end thereof.","With this construction in mind, a heating coil  is positioned about the shape memory alloy tube  for selective heating of the shape member alloy tube  so as to cause expansion thereof. In practice, when it is desired to release the fixed end  of the tension element , the heating coil  is supplied with current causing coil  to heat. The heat causes expansion of the shape memory alloy tube . The expansion of the shape memory alloy tube  results in the application of tension to the coupling element . The applied tension stretches the coupling element  along its length as enlarged heads and are moved apart, which ultimately results in the fracture thereof at the weakened fracture section . Once the fracture section  breaks, the second end of the coupling element  is free to fall away from the tube  along with the fixed end  of the tension element .","It is also contemplated that cooling could be employed as a mechanism for changing the shape of the elongated tube and the tube may be cooled through the use of a Peltier-cooling element positioned thereabout.","In accordance with a variation of the embodiment described above with reference to , the tension element release system is adapted to allow for fluid filling of the gastric band  upon the release of the tension element  or failure of the tension element . In accordance with such an embodiment as shown with reference to ,  and , the ring  is provided with a secondary cavity  that is placed in fluid communication with a fluid source  once the tension element is released. The secondary cavity  extends along the circumference of the ring  and is adapted for filling thereof so as to apply pressure via the application of fluid pressure in manner similar to a conventional balloon based gastric band.","The secondary cavity  extends about the length of the ring  and the tension element  extends within (or adjacent to) the secondary cavity  such that when the tension element  is release as described below fluid access is provided to the secondary cavity  for the inflow of fluid necessary to fill the secondary cavity  and maintain the application of pressure by the ring .","As with the embodiment described above with reference to , the fixed end  of the tension element  is secured in position for selective release via a fracture mechanism.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fracture section  is located adjacent the second end of the coupling element . The fixed end  of the tension element  is secured to the coupling element  at the second end thereof.","With this construction in mind, a heating coil  is positioned about the shape memory alloy tube  for selective heating of the shape member alloy tube  so as to cause expansion thereof. When it is desired to release the fixed end  of the tension element , the heating coil  is supplied with current causing the coil  to heat. The heat causes expansion of the shape memory alloy tube . The expansion of the shape memory alloy tube  results in the application of tension stretching the coupling element  along its length as enlarged heads and are moved apart which will ultimately result in the fracture thereof at the weakened fracture section . Once the fracture section  breaks, the second end of the coupling element  is free to fall away from the tube  along with the fixed end  of the tension element .","However, and in addition to the embodiment described above with reference to , the coupling element  includes a central port  connected to a remote fluid source  via port . The central port  extends from the first end of the coupling member  to a stop point  adjacent the second end of the coupling member , but beyond the fracture section . As such, when the fracture section  is broken as described above, the fluid is free to flow through the coupling element , through the second opening  of the tube  and into the secondary cavity  for filling the secondary cavity  and supplying the ring  with a pressure source for maintaining the application of pressure against the stomach of the user.","Referring to , B and C, yet another embodiment of implementing a balloon based back-up system in conjunction with the mechanical tension offered by the tension element  is disclosed. In accordance with such an embodiment, the fixed end  of the tension element  is secured to the second end  of the ring  via a release mechanism  allowing selective release of the fixed end  of the tension element  from the second end  of the ring  for release of tension being applied by the ring . The release mechanism  includes a jaw mechanism  that selectively engages the fixed end  of the tension element . The fixed end  is provided with a bulbous head  that is selectively seated within the jaw mechanism  in the manner discussed below in greater detail.","The jaw mechanism  includes a fixed jaw member  and a movable jaw member . A jaw drive element  is positioned between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member . The fixed jaw member  is substantially L-shaped and includes a first leg  and a second leg  oriented perpendicular to each other. Similar, the movable jaw member  is substantially L-shaped and includes a first leg  and a second leg  oriented perpendicular to each other. The fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  sit facing each other in a mirror like orientation with the first legs ,  of the respective fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  substantially parallel to each other and the second legs ,  of the respective fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  facing each other in an aligned manner. By adopting this orientation, the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member  create a cavity in which the enlarged head  of the tension element  may sit while the remainder of the tension element  extends through the opening  formed between the free ends of the respective second legs ,  of the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw member . As will be appreciated based upon the following disclosure, the movable jaw member  is biased toward the fixed jaw member  maintaining the free ends forming an opening  between the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw members  in proximity to each other for holding the enlarged head  of the tension element  until it is desired to release the tension element .","When one desires to release the tension element , that is, release the enlarged head  of the tension element  from its position between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member , the jaw drive element  is expanded in a manner pushing the movable jaw member  away from the fixed jaw member . As the movable jaw member  is pushed away from the fixed jaw member , that is, as the jaw mechanism  is moved from its locked orientation with the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw member  in close proximity, to its release orientation with the fixed jaw member  and movable jaw members  moved away from each other, the opening  therebetween expands until it is larger than the enlarged head  of the tension element  at which time the fixed end  of the tension element  is released from its position between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw member .","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the jaw drive element  is a balloon  which may be selectively expanded for engagement with the jaw members ,  in a manner selectively moving the jaw members ,  to their release orientation. As will be appreciated with the following disclosure, the proximal end of the jaw mechanism  where the balloon  is position is in fluid communication with a fluid source  via a port  and the balloon  is oriented along the jaw mechanism  so as to block the flow of fluid until it is desired. When the balloon  is fully expanded for release of the fixed end  of the tension element  as described above, a needle  fixed relative to and extending through the movable jaw member  contacts the balloon  to rupture the balloon . With the rupturing of the balloon , a passageway  is formed between the remote fluid source  and the cavity formed between the fixed jaw member  and the movable jaw members . The remote fluid source  is in fluid communication with the passageway  and fluid is free to flow through the jaw mechanism  and into the secondary cavity  (see ,  and ) for filling the secondary cavity  and supplying the ring  with a pressure source for maintaining the application of pressure against the stomach of the user.","As discussed above with regard to the embodiments in ,  and , a fluid source  is required for implementation of the embodiment. This fluid source  is preferably incorporated into the antenna\/controller pod . In order to ensure fluid pressure is not applied in an undesirable manner, the fluid source  is provided with a fail-safe mechanism for releasing fluid pressure in the event of a malfunction of the tension element and when desired by the operator as discussed below with regard to .","In accordance with a variation on this embodiment, the rupture of the balloon  could allow for the release of fluid from the ring  facilitating release thereof in conjunction with the release of the tension element . This would occur where the fluid source (or in this variation, the fluid reservoir)  is empty and the fluid is allowed to flow from a prefilled secondary cavity  and to the fluid reservoir  rather than the fluid flowing form the fluid source  to the secondary cavity .","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to , B, A and B, the flow of fluid from the cavity  to the fluid source (or reservoir)  may be controlled by an electrically sensitive membrane  that is destroyed upon the application of the electricity. Once destroyed the passageway between the fluid reservoir  and the cavity  of the ring  is open allowing for the free flow of fluid.","In accordance with the concept of allowing for the release of fluid held in the secondary cavity  of the ring , the fluid reservoir  could be an expandable reservoir that expands or contracts to control the volume of fluid (and as such the pressure applied by the ring). Expansion or contraction of the fluid reservoir  is controlled by a shape memory alloy actuator  that expands or contracts the fluid reservoir  based upon the application of electricity (and ultimately the generation of heat therein) thereto via electrical leads . Because the fluid reservoir  will be in a vacuum relationship with the cavity , controlled expansion and contraction of the fluid reservoir  will cause fluid to be drawn from or forced into the cavity  of the ring .","In accordance with an embodiment shown in ,  and , a fluid source valve  is provided along the fluid path to the ring . The fluid source valve  includes a first chamber  in communication with an upstream portion of the fluid source  via an inlet . The fluid source valve  includes a second chamber  separated from the first chamber  by a valve release membrane  formed in a septum  separating the first chamber  from the second chamber . The second chamber  includes an outlet  leading to a catheter  linking the fluid source to the ring . When it is desired to allow for the flow of fluid to the ring , electrical energy as applied to the valve release membrane  destroying the valve release membrane  and allowing fluid to freely flow from the inlet , through the first chamber , the valve release opening  and the second chamber , and into the outlet  for flow though the catheter  and into the ring .","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to ,  and , the fluid source valve  includes a first chamber  in communication with an upstream portion of the fluid source  via an inlet . The fluid source valve  includes a second chamber  separated from the first chamber  by a valve release opening  formed in a septum  separating the first chamber  from the second chamber  and in which a resilient plug  is positioned. The plug  is held in position by upper and lower resilient lips and respectively biasing the plug  with the valve release opening  in septum . The second chamber  includes an outlet  leading to a catheter  linking the fluid source  to the ring . When it is desired to allow for the flow of fluid to the ring , an operator may apply pressure through the skin of a patient to access a flexible upper wall  of the first chamber  and push the plug  from its position within the valve release opening  and allow fluid to freely flow from the inlet , through the first chamber , the valve release opening  and the second chamber , and into the outlet  for flow though the catheter  and into the ring .","In accordance with yet another alternate embodiment, and with reference to ,  and , the fluid source valve  includes a first chamber  in communication with an upstream portion of the fluid source  via an inlet . The fluid source valve  includes a second chamber  separated from the first chamber  by a valve release opening  formed in a wall or septum  separating the first chamber  from the second chamber . A ball  is positioned in the second chamber  and held in valve release opening  by a spring member  biasing the ball  toward the first chamber  and plugging the valve release opening . The second chamber  includes an outlet  leading to a catheter  linking the fluid source  to the ring . When it is desired to allow for the flow of fluid to the ring , an operator may apply pressure through the skin of a patient to access a flexible wall  of the second chamber  and push the spring  in a manner releasing the ball  from its position within the valve release opening  and allowing fluid to freely flow from the inlet , through the first chamber , the valve release opening  and the second chamber , and into the outlet  for flow though the catheter  and into the ring .","In accordance with alternate embodiments as shown with reference to , the fixed end  of the tension element , that is the portion of the tension element  secured to the ring  such that action of the drive element  causes enlargement or reduction in the effective diameter of the tension element , is selectively released via a selective connection mechanism. In accordance with a first embodiment as shown with reference to , actuation of a pin  (whether it be by way of shrinking or removal) allows for movement of first and second detent balls ,  permitting release of a connection  linking the fixed end  of the tension element  to the ring .","In particular, the fixed end  of the tension element  is securely held in position relative to the ring  based upon the interference fit created between a retaining disk  including a circumferential recess  formed along the inner wall thereof, the first and second detent balls , , the pin  and the connection . With the various components held as shown in , the connection  is fixedly held relative to the retaining disk  which is secured to the ring . Once the pin  is removed from its position forcing the detent balls ,  into the circumferential recess  and sitting within a central cavity  of the connection , the detent balls ,  will move centrally (as a result of the tension applied by the tension element ) and the fixed end  of the tension element will be free to move since the interference fit will have been broken.","Referring to , movement of the detent balls ,  is further facilitated by the provision of springs  which encourage the detent balls ,  to move centrally upon the removal of the pin .","As discussed above, removal of the pin is achieved either physically or by way of shrinking. Where it is desired to shrink the pin , the pin  is preferably composed of a shape memory alloy adapted to shrink sufficiently upon the application of heat to allow for the movement of the detent balls ,  from their positioned within the circumferential recess . In accordance with such and embodiment, a heater mechanism composed of a resistive wire (not shown) is coiled about the shape memory alloy pin . The heating coil uses RF energy transferred to the pin  by means of an inductive coupling realized between the antenna\/controller pod  and an external RF emitter.","Alternately, it is contemplated the pin may be constructed for simply sliding from its position within the central cavity of the connection. In accordance with another embodiment, the pin may be an electro activated polymer based drive element which shrinks by means of an applied voltage and\/or current induced in the pin by means of an inductive coupling.","In accordance with a third embodiment as shown with reference to , the fixed end  of the tension element  is selectively secured to the ring  by way of a retaining pin . The retaining pin  is fixedly mounted within the ring  and engages an aperture  formed in the tension element . The retaining pin  is actuated via a mechanically amplified retractable pin assembly . The pin assembly  is secured to the ring  and triggered by the motion of a shape memory drive element or a piezoelectric drive element . The mechanically amplified retractable pin assembly  allows the motion necessary for activating the moving retaining pin  to be extremely small (for example, in the hundreds of a micrometer range). The reduced motion is achieved by means of shape memory alloy or piezoelectric based drive elements.","The embodiment includes a housing  secured to the ring  and in which a spring biased retaining pin  is mounted for movement between a lock positioned and a release position. The retaining pin  includes an output pin  shaped and dimensioned for seating within an aperture  formed at the end of the tension element . The retaining pin  further includes a spring flange  which is acted upon by a drive spring  when the shape memory alloy drive element (such as nitinol)  permits movement thereof. More particularly, controlled movement of the retaining pin  is achieved by creating an interference fit between the retaining pin  and the shape memory alloy drive element  by positioning first and second detent balls ,  between the pin  and the drive element . The drive element  includes a drive element body  having an hourglass shape and moves between a first position (see ) and second position (see ). When the drive element body  is in its first position, the detent balls ,  are forced into an interference position preventing movement of the pin  (see ). However, when the drive element  is heated it breaks a coupling linking it to the base of the housing  and is free to move upwardly under the bias provided by spring  (see ). When the drive element  moves upwardly in this manner, the detent balls ,  are free to move into the narrow section of the drive element body  allowing the detent balls ,  to move from their position interfering with movement of the pin . Thereafter, the drive spring  moves the pin  to its release position disconnecting the retaining pin , in particular, the output pin , from engagement with the tension element .","In summary, the mechanically amplified retractable pin assembly  employs a shape memory alloy drive element  for triggering energy release stored in a loaded compression drive spring . When in the extended position as shown with reference to , the pin  is seen to be loaded by the compression drive spring . The drive spring  remains firmly locked in this position due to the ball lock show in . This is made possible by the drive element body  which drives outwardly an array of detent balls , . Once actuated however, the spring  drives shape memory alloy drive element drives  upwardly thereby causing the detent balls ,  to roll inwardly and allowing the pin  to retract under the force of the drive spring .","Under certain circumstances it may become necessary to release the tension element  for emergency removal of the ring  from its position around the stomach. As such, and in accordance with a first embodiment as shown with reference to , ,  and , the ring , and in particular, the tension element , is provided with a release pin  that allows for release of the free end  of the tension element  from its secure attachment position relative to the ring . The release pin  transversely extends through the ring  at a position adjacent to the fixed end  of the tension element . As a result, when the release pin  extends through the ring  and is in engagement with the fixed end  of the tension element , the tension element  is securely held in position for contraction and expansion of the ring  as discussed herein. However, when the release pin  is pulled from its position along the ring  and out of engagement with the fixed end  of the tension element , the fixed end  of the tension element  is released for free movement within the ring  (see ). As such, the tension created between the free end  of the tension element  and the fixed end  of the tension element , which ultimately allows for a reduction in the effective size of the ring , is released and the ring  is allowed to return to its unbiased large diameter configuration. Once in this large diameter configuration, the ring  may be readily removed from its position about the stomach of the patient.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to , the nut  of the drive element  is replaced with a slip nut  that allows for selective release of the free end  of the tension element  from its position within the drive element . More particularly, the slip nut  allows the threaded free end  of the tension element  to slip past the drive nut  when necessary to allow the band restriction to be released if the motor  fails to operate. The slip nut  has the advantage of being either spring  loaded to release at a known pull force of the threaded screw (see ) or the slip nut  could be normally closed and a linkage  is provided that could be activated at the antenna\/controller pod  (see ).","Referring now to the embodiment presented with reference to , the nut  is spring-loaded for release of the threaded free end  of the tension element  at a known pull force. More specifically, a slip nut  is a nut formed in multiple pieces which are held together via springs or other means.  shows the slip nut  spring loaded to open at a desired pull force on the threaded free end  of the tension element . Springs by design provide force greater than the forces generated under normal conditions when food is swallowed, but if the band is stretched circumferentially by using an esophageal dilator the force overcomes the springs and the threaded free end  slips through the nut  relaxing the restriction.  shows the slip nut  wherein multiple pieces are held together with a linkage  that terminates in the antenna\/controller pod  for disengaging the nut  from the threaded free end . The termination of the linkage  could be activated by a simple toggle .  shows this toggle  and also provides a sketch of the linkage termination. The simple push pull design allows a doctor to make an incision in the skin to access the toggle . A further improvement would be to provide a button, or some means of activating the linkage without cutting the skin to access the release mechanism. In implementing such an embodiment, it is contemplated the button would be spring loaded such that upon access to the button with, for example, a hypodermic needle, pushing the button releases the spring and thereby activates the linkage release mechanism.","With reference to the embodiment shown in , the split nut  is activated for release through actuation of a button  at the antenna\/controller pod . This embodiment overcomes the need for access into the patient's abdomen and could be activated without the need for incisions. If an emergency situation presented itself the patient could have a small incision made above the antenna\/controller pod  on the sternum and the fail-safe linkage  could be activated directly. This would allow the device to be replaced at a later date, or troubleshoot the device and possibly replace the antenna\/controller pod  in a subcutaneous procedure without needing to remove the entire implant.","Another embodiment for the release of the threaded free end  of the tension element  is shown with reference to . This embodiment includes a nut  construction that improves upon the nut's ability to engage and disengage simply. The use of an elliptical nut  that pivots on an axis perpendicular to the axis of the threaded free end  of the tension element  allows for easy engagement and disengagement of the threaded free end  of the tension element . This embodiment also utilizes a linkage  from the antenna\/controller pod  and a switch\/toggle  to pull the threaded free end  of the tension element  for disengagement. The nut  is spring loaded via spring  to provide positive displacement for the nut  to engage the threads of the threaded free end  of the tension element  when the fail-safe is not engaged.  shows the elliptical nut  in the engaged position and  shows the elliptical nut  in the fail-safe disengaged position. In , the linkage wire  that is connected to the antenna\/controller pod  is moved to a position for fail-safe release of the threaded free end  of the tension element , which causes the elliptical nut  to move and release from the threaded free end .","In accordance with yet another embodiment as shown with reference to , an antenna\/controller pod  that utilizes a magnetic deactivation function is disclosed. This requires a magnetic coil or magnetic emitting antenna  to be placed over the antenna  of the antenna\/controller pod  and the oscillating electromagnetic field deactivates the device electronically. That is, the magnetic field induces a reverse polarity in the antenna\/controller pod , which in turn reverses the voltage sent to the motor . This back drives the motor  without the use of the control pod in case of an electrical failure in the controller pod, but the motor was still operable. The controller pod would have a secondary circuit to allow the oscillating magnetic field coupling to generate a sufficient amount of power to drive the motor in a given direction. In this case, the desire would be to rotate the motor such that the pressure around the tissue is relieved. MRI sensitivity should not be an issue as an MRI generates a very high intensity permanent field (which will not generate a voltage in a magnetic coil or magnetic emitting antenna) and a very low intensity oscillating electromagnetic field (which will not generate a significant voltage since it is low intensity). The technical challenges of providing enough energy to the implant to reverse the voltage to the motor  is also challenged if the wires from the antenna\/controller pod  becomes detached from the motor  or antenna\/controller pod  itself.  shows the magnet over the antenna  providing energy to reverse the motor .","Referring now to other embodiments for release of the threaded free end  of the tension element . In ,  and , the drive nut  has a split construction and is composed of four distinct elements , , , forming a central aperture  through which the threaded free end  of the tension element  passes for threaded driving as discussed above. A driving gear  is secured to the outer surface  of the nut  and drives it in a circular configuration as described above. However, the drive nut  is resilient and is adapted for biasing such that the threads  formed along the inner surface of the nut  disengage from threads  formed along the external surface  of the free end  of the tension element . In particular, each of the nut elements -making up the nut  has a C-shaped cross sectional profile as shown with reference to . The C-shaped profile includes a first plate member  and a second plate member  connected by a central connecting member . The central connecting member  also functions as a part of the inner surface  of the aperture  through which the fixed end  of the tension element  passes. The connecting member  is provided with a weakened portion . As such, when pressure is applied to the first plate member  in a direction toward the second plate member , the first plate member  will then move downwardly toward the second plate member  causing the connecting member  to move from its normal orientation relative to the second plate member  and form an acute angular relationship with respect to the second plate member . By applying pressure to all of the first plate members  of the respective nut elements -simultaneously, the inner threads  along the nut  are moved away from the free end  of the tension element  thereby providing for release and free movement of the tension element  relative to the nut .","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, pressure is applied to the first plate member  of the respective nut elements -through the utilization of a plurality of pressure application plates . Each of these pressure application plates  includes a resilient balloon  which may be expanded upon application of fluid pressure thereto. Since the pressure application plates  are formed so as to be positioned directly adjacent the first plate members  of the respective nut elements -, when a balloon  is expanded, the balloon  will expand into contact with the first plate member  of the nut element -pushing it toward the second plate member  of the nut element -and causing the connecting member  to angle away from the free end  of the tension element  as described above.","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, and with reference to ,  and , the nut  is provided with flanges  upon which the internal threading  of the aperture  is positioned. These flanges  are secured to the nut  for controlled movement relative thereto. In particular, and with reference to , when the nut  and in particular, the flanges , are intended for engagement with threading  formed along the outer surface  at the free end  of the tension element , the flanges  are oriented substantially normal to the plane in which the nut  lies. As such, and when in this configuration, the internal threading  along the flanges  engages the threading  at the free end  of the tension element  and rotation of the nut  causes the threaded free end  to be moved relative to the nut  for drawing the tension element  through the nut .","However, the rear outer surface  of each flange  is provided with a resistive heating element  that is connected to an electrical coil  secured along the back surface  of the outer periphery  of the nut . As such, when electricity is applied to the coils , the resistive heaters  are actuated heating the flanges . The flanges  are constructed such that when they are heated, or otherwise encounter a change in temperature, they will bend away from the free end  of the tension element  forming an acute angle with the plane in which the nut  lies (see ). Once in this configuration, and with reference to , the free end  of the tension element  is free to move relative to the nut  for free movement of the tension element  relative thereto.","Referring now to ,  and , yet another embodiment for release of the tension element  is disclosed. In accordance with this embodiment, the fixed end  of the tension element  is secured to a two-bar linkage . When the tension element  is intended for utilization in constriction of the stomach, the two-bar linkage  is folded so that the links ,  nearly overlap (see ). When the band  needs to be released in an emergency, the two-bar linkage  is actuated via a pull lever  (see ) so as to pull the two bar linkage  from its folded configuration and into an extended configuration (see ). With the two bar linkage  in an extended configuration, the effective length of the tension element  is increased providing additional diameter within the ring  and allowing the gastric band  to be moved from its position along the stomach.","Referring now to ,  and , a compression, friction drive assembly  is utilized for pulling the tension element . The friction drive assembly , however, includes a release member  which moves the opposed rollers ,  of the friction drive assembly  apart from each other allowing for free movement of the tension element  within the ring . Controlled movement of the release member  is achieved via the utilization of a pull wire  which, when acted upon, forces the rollers ,  of the friction drive assembly  apart against the bias of the spring  that biases them toward the tension element , permitting free movement of the tension element . In accordance with a preferred embodiment, and with reference to , movement of the wire  is controlled by a screw mechanism  that may be selectively acted upon with, for example, a hex wrench , to loosen or tighten the wire .","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, and with reference to , the antenna\/controller pod  is provided with an access port  providing a medical practitioner with access to the control electronics of the antenna\/controller pod  for control thereof in the event of failure. In accordance with such an embodiment a needle  would access the access port  so as to act like a contact that would either flex contacts ,  or just bridge the contacts ,  to run the motor  in the direction to open the gastric band  to a maximum diameter thereby relieving any pressure applied by the gastric band . For such a method to work, the antenna\/controller pod  is provided with a battery  having a shelf life, for example, of ten or more years, and with enough power to store energy to power the gastric band  for a reasonable length of time. Since there is a battery  provided with the antenna\/controller pod , telemetry could be used via wireless technology such as Bluetooth and could allow a patient to self adjust the gastric band  without the need for a power module. It is further contemplated rechargeable batteries may be employed and recharging may be achieved on a regular basis via a power unit at a doctor's office or while the patient is sleeping so that more benefits could come from the ability to non-invasively adjust the band.","In accordance with a variation on the embodiment disclosed with reference to , the antenna\/controller pod  is provided with dual access ports , linked to the printed circuit band . As such, and when emergency situations arise under circumstances where the antenna\/controller pod  does not have sufficient power, the two needles , applied to the first and second ports , of the antenna\/controller pod  are charged to supply power to the antenna\/controller pod . In accordance with this embodiment, the first and second ports , are provided with self-healing elastomeric targets , for needle placement.","As briefly discussed above, the needles , are charged. As such, the needles , are connected to a power source  that is readily available in a hospital. When the needles , are contacting the conductors ,  in the printed circuit board  of the antenna\/controller pod , the motor  will run in the opening direction and the diameter of the gastric band  is increased to eliminate any pressure applied by the gastric band .","The gastric band  would then return to normal operating conditions when appropriate and can be used as designed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The present embodiment would also function for its intended purpose in the event the printed circuit board failed provided the emergency electrical path employed in accordance with this embodiment is not part of the operating circuitry of the printed circuit board.","Ring Closure System","With respect to , a preferred embodiment of the clip  for securing the gastric band  in the closed position is described. The clip  on the first end  of the ring  includes an aperture , a tab  having a hinge  and a slot . The aperture  is dimensioned to accept the second end  therethrough, while the slot  is dimensioned to accept the flange  disposed on the second end .","To close the ring , the clip  is grasped by the tab  and the tag  of the antenna\/controller pod  (see ) is inserted through the aperture . The clip  is then pulled toward the second end  so that the housing  passes through the aperture  while the housing  is grasped with atraumatic forceps; the conical shape of the housing  facilitates this action. Force is applied to the tab  until the slot  captures the flange , thereby securing the ring  in the closed position. The physician may subsequently choose to disengage the slot  from the flange  by manipulating the tab  using laparoscopic forceps, for example, to reposition the ring . Advantageously, however, forces inadvertently applied to the tab  in an opposite direction will cause the tab  to buckle at the hinge , but will not cause the flange  to exit the slot . Accordingly, the hinge  of the tab  prevents accidental opening of the clip  when the tab  is subjected to forces that cause the tab  to fold backwards away from the housing , such as may arise due to movement of the patient, the organ, of or bolus of fluid passing through the organ.","As discussed above, it may at times become necessary to release the pressure applied by the gastric band . With this in mind, and in accordance with yet another embodiment as shown with reference to , the first and second ends ,  of the gastric band  are provided with a mechanism allowing release from their locked positions via a remote latch unlock mechanism . In particular, the clip  holding the first and second ends ,  of the gastric band  together is released via a variety of electromechanical mechanisms. For example, actuation of an emergency release button (not shown) on the antenna\/controller pod  will cause release of the clip . When the button triggers a communication, a voltage is applied on a flange actuator  by the electronics of the antenna\/controller pod . The temperature of the actuator  then increases and this triggers movement of the flange  toward the inside of the gastric band  until the band clip  is released (for example, via a shape memory alloy actuator or a bimetallic actuator). Such an embodiment, might allow for treatment without the patient visiting the hospital or other treatment center. The unit might be activated via modem or Internet connection by the surgeon.","Antenna\/Controller Pod","With respect to , the antenna\/controller pod  of the present banding system is described. The antenna\/controller pod  is disposed at the distal end of the antenna cable  and includes the removable tag  and holes . The tag  comprises a grip structure that facilitates manipulation and placement of the antenna\/controller pod  during implantation; after which the tag  is removed using a scissors cut. The tag  also includes hole that allows the use of a suture thread to assist in passing the antenna\/controller pod  behind the stomach. The holes  also are dimensioned to be compatible with standard suture needles from size 1-0 to 7-0 to permit the antenna\/controller pod  to be sutured to the patient's sternum, thereby ensuring that the antenna\/controller pod  remains accessible to the external antenna  and cannot migrate from a desired implantation site.","As shown in , the antenna\/controller pod  encloses a printed circuit board  that carries the antenna  and microcontroller circuitry of the gastric band . The antenna  receives energy and commands from the external control  (see ), and supplies those signals to the microcontroller, which in turn powers the motor  of the drive element . The circuitry of the antenna\/controller pod  uses the energy received from the incoming signal to power the circuit, interprets the commands received from the external control , and supplies appropriate signals to the motor  of the drive element . The circuit also retrieves information regarding operation of the motor  of the drive element  and relays that information to the external control  via the antenna . The circuit board preferably is covered with a water-resistant polymeric covering, e.g., Parylene, to permit use in the high (up to 100%) humidity environment encountered in the body.","The antenna\/controller pod  includes a mechanical closure system that is augmented by silicone glue so that the pod is fluid tight. This silicone glue also is used to protect soldered wires  from humidity. The antenna\/controller pod  preferably is small, e.g., 16 mm\u00d733 mm\u00d74 mm, to ensure compatibility with a standard 18 mm trocar and so as to be compatible with placement on the sternum. The antenna\/controller pod  preferably has a smooth, atraumatic shape to avoid tissue damage, has good mechanical strength to withstand handling with surgical graspers and to prevent mechanical deformation to the printed circuit board, and has good electromagnetic permeability to allow efficient energy transmission through the antenna\/controller pod . The antenna\/controller pod  preferably has a relatively thin planar configuration to avoid rotation of the antenna\/controller pod  when placed under the skin, and may include holes that permit the antenna\/controller pod  to be sutured in position.","With respect to , the antenna cable  is shown in cross-section. The antenna cable  preferably is a coaxial shielded cable encapsulated in a silicone tube  to provide biocompatibility. The tube  is selected to provide leak-proof encapsulation, with sufficient strength to permit the antenna cable  to be manipulated with atraumatic graspers. The braided shield  of the antenna cable  prevents longitudinal deformation of the antenna cable , and surrounds five helically wound insulated wires . Four of the wires  are used to supply power to the micromotor of the drive element ; the remaining wire and braided shield  are used to supply a signal from the reference position switch to the controller.","As discussed above with respect to , the gastric band  according to the present invention provides an integrated system for regulating food ingestion in the stomach of a patient, wherein variation of the diameter of the ring  may be adjusted without any invasive surgical intervention. To accomplish this, the drive element  is linked to the subcutaneous antenna\/controller pod  to receive a radio frequency control and power signal. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the motor  of the drive element  has no internal energy supply, but rather is powered by the receiving circuit of the antenna  through a rechargeable energy storage device, such as a capacitor. In particular, the receiving circuit converts radio frequency waves received from the external control  via the antenna into a motor control and power signal. In accordance with an alternate embodiment, it is contemplated the drive element may be driven via an implantable rechargeable battery.","Power and Control Circuitry","Referring to , a preferred embodiment of the circuitry employed in the external control  and the gastric band  of the present invention is described, based on the principle of passive telemetry by FM-AM absorption modulation. The external control  is shown on the left hand side of , and includes a microprocessor  coupled to the control panel  and the display screen  (see ). The external control  produces a signal comprising one or more data bytes to be transmitted to the implantable antenna\/controller pod  and the drive element .","The external control  includes a modulator  for amplitude modulation of the RF wave from the RF generator , which signal is emitted by the external antenna . The emitted wave is received by the antenna  in the antenna\/controller pod , where the AM demodulator  extracts the data bytes from the envelope of received RF signal. The data bytes then are decoded and written into an EEPROM of the microcontroller . A special code is used that allows easy decoding of the data by the microcontroller , but also provides maximal security against communication failure.","An external oscillator , which is a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), provides a clock signal to the microcontroller . The external oscillator  may consist of for example, a relaxation oscillator comprising an external resistor-capacitor network connected to a discharging logic circuitry already implemented in the microcontroller or a crystal oscillator comprising a resonant circuit with a crystal, capacitors and logic circuits. The former solution requires only two additional components, is suitable when the stability of the frequency is not critical, and has low current consumption; the latter solution provides a more stable frequency, but requires a greater number of additional components and consumes more power. The external oscillator  preferably comprises the external RC network, due to its simplicity.","The microcontroller  interprets the received instructions and produces an output that drives the motor  of the drive element . As discussed above, the drive element  comprises a bi-directional stepper motor  that drives the nut  through a series of reducing gears. Preferably, the two coils of the stepper motor  of the drive element  are directly connected to the microcontroller , which receives the working instructions from the demodulator , interprets them and provides the voltage sequences to the motor coils. When the supply of voltage pulses to the stepper motor  stops, the gears are designed to remain stationary, even if a reverse torque or force is applied to the nut  by the tension element .","As also described above, use of a stepper motor  in drive element  makes it is possible to obtain positional information on the nut  and the tension element  without the use of sensors or encoders, because the displacement of the tension element  is proportional to the number of pulses supplied to the stepper motor coils. Two signals are employed to ensure precise control, reference position signal S, generated by the reference position switch of , and the drive element signal S.","According to one preferred embodiment, signal Sis the voltage signal taken at one of the outputs of the microcontroller  that is connected to the motor coils of the drive element . Alternatively, signal Scould be derived from the current applied to a motor coil instead of the voltage, or may be an induced voltage on a secondary coil wrapped around one of the motor coils of the drive element . In either case, signal Sis a pulsating signal that contains information on the number of steps turned by the rotor and further indicates whether blockage of the mechanism has occurred. Specifically, if the rotor of the stepper motor fails to turn, the magnetic circuit is disturbed, and by induction, affects signal S, e.g., by altering the shape of the signal. This disturbance can be detected in the external control, as described below.","Signals Sand Sare converted into frequencies using the external oscillator , so that the voltage level of signal Sapplied to the external oscillator  causes the oscillator to vary its frequency Fproportionally to the signal S. Thus, Fcontains all the information of signal S. When the crimped cap  and the tension element  are in the reference position (that is, the ring  is fully open), the reference position switch produces reference position signal S. Signal Sis used to induce a constant shift of the frequency F, which shift is easily distinguishable from the variations due to signal S.","If the external oscillator  is a relaxation oscillator, as described above, signals Sand Smodify the charging current of the external resistor capacitor network. In this case, the relaxation oscillator preferably comprises an external resistor-capacitor network connected to a transistor and a logic circuit implemented in the microcontroller . With Sand S, the goal is to modify the charging current of the capacitor of the RC network to change the frequency of the relaxation oscillator. If the charging current is low, the voltage of the capacitor increases slowly and when the threshold of the transistor is reached, the capacitor discharges through the transistor. The frequency of the charging-discharging sequence depends on the charging current.","If the external oscillator  is a crystal oscillator, signals Sand Smodify the capacitor of the resonant circuit. In this case, the crystal oscillator circuit preferably comprises a crystal in parallel with capacitors, so that the crystal and capacitors form a resonant circuit which oscillates at a fixed frequency. This frequency can be adjusted by changing the capacitors. If one of these capacitors is a Varicap (a kind of diode), it is possible to vary its capacitance value by modifying the reverse voltage applied on it, Sand Scan be used to modify this voltage.","In either of the foregoing cases, signals Sand Sare used to modify at least one parameter of a resistor-capacitor (RC) network associated with the external oscillator  or at least one parameter of a crystal oscillator comprising the external oscillator .","Referring still to , signals Sand S, derived from the stepper motor or from the output of the microcontroller , may be used directly for frequency modulation by the external oscillator  without any encoding or intervention by the microcontroller . By using the external oscillator  of the microcontroller  as part of the VCO for the feedback signal, no additional components are required, and operation of the microcontroller  is not adversely affected by the changes in the oscillator frequency F. The oscillating signal Fdrives the voltage driven switch  for absorption modulation, such that feedback transmission is performed with passive telemetry by FM-AM absorption modulation.","More specifically, signal Fdrives the switch  such that during the ON state of the switch  there is an increase in energy absorption by the RF-DC converter . Accordingly, therefore the absorption rate is modulated at the frequency Fand thus the frequency of the amplitude modulation of the reflected wave detected by external control  contains the information for signal S. As discussed below, a pickup  in the external control  separates the reflected wave where it can be decoded by FM demodulation in the demodulator  to obtain signal S\u2032. This method therefore allows the transmission of different signals carried at different frequencies, and has the advantage that the ON state of the switch  can be very short and the absorption very strong without inducing an increase in average consumption. In this way, feedback transmission is less sensitive to variation in the quality of coupling between the antennas  and .","In the external control , the feedback signal Fis detected by the pickup  and fed to the FM demodulator , which produces a voltage output Vthat is proportional to F. Vis fed to the filter  and the level detector  to obtain the information corresponding to the drive element signal S, which in turn corresponds to the pulses applied to the stepper motor coil. The microprocessor  counts these pulses to calculate the corresponding displacement of the tension element , which is proportional to the number of pulses.","Signal Valso is passed through the analog-to-digital converter  and the digital output is fed to the microprocessor , where signal processing is performed to detect perturbations of the shape of the feedback signal that would indicate a blockage of the rotor of the stepper motor. The microprocessor  stops counting any detected motor pulses when it detects that the drive element is blocked, and outputs an indication of this status. The level detector  produces an output when it detects that the demodulated signal Vindicates the presence of the reference position signal Sdue to activation of the reference position switch. This output induces a reset of the position of the tension element calculated by the microprocessor  in the external control. In this way, a small imprecision, e.g. an offset, can be corrected.","As described above, the external control  transmits both energy and commands to the implantable controller circuitry in the antenna\/controller pod . The external control  also receives feedback information from the implantable controller that can be correlated to the position of the tension element  and the diameter of the ring . As will be apparent to one of skill in the art, the external control  and the implantable controller are configured in a master-slave arrangement, in which the implantable controller is completely passive, awaiting both instructions and power from the external control .","Pressure Measuring","Measuring the applied pressure via the present ring  is very important in ensuring that excessive pressure is not applied to the stomach. As such, the present invention incorporates the ability to measure the applied pressure in a reliable, effective and convenient manner. In accordance with a first embodiment, and with reference to , the applied current for the motor  is measured and the measured current is utilized in determining the applied pressure and ultimately as a feedback system for measuring the functional state of the gastric band .","In accordance with this embodiment, the current is monitored via a closed loop feedback system  integrated into the operation of the mechanical banding system  of the present invention. By incorporating an electrical current measurement to measure electrical current being drawn by the motor  of the present banding system, the performance of the banding system may be evaluated for determination of among other features, the applied pressure of the gastric band . The current drawn by the motor  is directly related to the force being applied by the banding system. Any increase in the force applied by the gastric band  is proportionally linked to an increase in current being drawn by the motor  of the gastric band . In practice, the current measured in accordance with the application of the present invention is correlated to the static force or pressure the ring  applies to the stomach tissue it encircles.","In addition to its use in measuring pressure, the monitoring of the applied current may also be utilized in determining any loss of performance of the banding system due to component wear down, corrosion, etc.","Referring to , the closed loop feedback system  includes leads  accessing the current flowing from the power source  to the motor . The current is measured using a current sensing circuit  and the output current measurement  is forward to the microcontroller  of the present drive element  for action in accordance with the goals of the present invention.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to , measurements of the applied current are made using a Hall sensor  positioned about the wire  supplying the motor  with electrical power. When a Hall sensor  is positioned above a current carrying wire , it is capable of measuring current flow through the wire  and ultimately the current being drawn for operation of the motor  as it constricts the ring  to apply pressure to the stomach which the ring  surrounds. In accordance with the embodiment disclosed herein, the measured current is derived from a voltage measurement across a series of resistors  in line with the power source  for the motor .","Regardless of the whether a hardwired circuit is employed or a Hall sensor is employed, the voltage is calculated by utilizing Ohms Law, that is, V=IR. Assuming a fixed resistance change in current, a current is directly related to the voltage drop across the resistance of the motor . A typical sensing voltage might be between 50 mV and 200 mV.","In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to , the tension applied by the gastric band , that is the applied pressure of the gastric band , is monitored by a mechanical system . In particular, the tension applied to the flexible tension element  is monitored utilizing a strain gauge  acted on by the threading  of the tension element . By monitoring the force applied to the strain gauge , the operator is provided with an indication when fail-safe action is necessary.","The strain gage  is preferably coupled to the nut  on the drive element housing , for example, by means of a cantilevered beam . The interaction of the nut  with the threading  of the tension element  provides highly accurate force measurements concerning the relationship between the nut  and the threading  of the tension element . By monitoring the force measurements, the pressure applied by the gastric band  is determined and operators of the gastric band  are readily able to determine when fail-safe action is necessary based upon a detection of excess tension in the gastric band .","In accordance with a variation of the use of a strain gauge, the strain gauge  may straddle threading on the tension element  so as to identify the applied force. See . To indentify the applied force the strain gauge output would be connected to a circuit, such as an analog to digital converter (A\/D) or microcontroller , that converts the strain into an applied force. The A\/D or microcontroller  would provide force data to a telemetry circuit  which in turn would send the data to the external reading device . The applied force could be compared to a force threshold (either dynamic or static) either by the internal circuitry  or by the external reading device  which in turn would provide and indication to the state of the drive mechanism. A higher force\/tension in either movement direction may indicate a mechanical failure in the drive mechanism.","As with the prior embodiment, and in addition to its use in measuring tension along the gastric band , the monitoring of the force encountered by the strain gauge  may also be utilized in determining any loss of performance of the banding system due to component wear down, corrosion, etc. As such, the strain gauge is preferably linked to a feedback system controlling operation of the drive element . It is also contemplated that in addition to a strain gage, position\/proximity sensors may be employed, Hall effect sensors may be employed, contact sensors may be employed or a microswitch may be employed.","In accordance with yet a further embodiment as shown with reference to , and where a fluid filled bladder  is incorporated along the internal surface  of the ring , the pressure of the fluid within the bladder  is measured to provide an indication as to the pressure being applied to the stomach via the present banding system .","In accordance with this embodiment, a fluid bladder  is formed along the internal surface  of the mechanical gastric band . The fluid bladder  is formed and positioned such that it directly interfaces with tissue. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the fluid bladder  may be integrally formed with the gastric band or it may be selectively secured thereto for use in accordance with the present invention. As such, and where the fluid bladder  is selectively secured to the gastric band , it may be secured to the gastric band  prior to or during installation (implantation). A pressure sensor  is linked to the fluid bladder  allowing for remote monitor of the fluid pressure within the bladder .","By constructing the ring  in such a manner, not only is a softer tissue interface provided by the fluid bladder , but the inclusion of the fluid bladder  allows for the ability to add a pressure sensor  in the fluid path to measure the fluid pressure in the bladder . When the gastric band  is wrapped around the stomach tissue, the monitored pressure within the bladder  relates to the pressure exerted on the tissue. This pressure reading is then used as a primary or secondary feedback to control the applied restriction employed in accordance with the gastric band  of the present invention.","In practice, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment as disclosed herein, the bladder  is pre-filled with fluid and calibrated prior to implantation. While pre-implantation calibration is contemplated, it is conceived that calibration may be performed after implantation in accordance with the present invention. As such, the fluid bladder may be adjusted to ensure proper calibration. Such adjustments are achieved by connection of the fluid bladder to a filling tube via a port formed in the fluid bladder. The bladder  is preferably made of silicone or another biocompatible material and is preferably filled with a non-aqueous fluid or gel, for example, silicone or fluoro-silicone oil. The pressure  is preferably a piezoresistive or capacitive sensor designed for implantation in a hermetic package. The pressure  is connected to a telemetry circuit  allowing pressure to be read outside the body using an external reading device .","As with the previously discussed embodiments for measuring the applied pressure of the gastric band , the pressure bladder  may also serve as an indicator to the functional state of the mechanical gastric band . Pressure should increase when the gastric band  is tightened and decrease when the gastric band  is loosened. If the mechanical system is not functioning correctly, there will be no change in pressure.","In addition to providing a fail-safe mechanism for operation of the present ring , loading information garnered in the manner discussed above, may also be used to aid the surgeon in correctly setting the band's initial degree of restriction during band implantation. That is, the loading information could also be used to help ensure that the band is initially implanted with the correct degree of restrictive adjustment. In this case an indication of tension element loading would provide surgeons (especially novice ones) with an indication of whether they've sufficiently tightened the band onto the tissue to achieve the desired constriction while also making sure that they haven't excessively tightened the band onto the tissue and\/or undesirably approached the tension element's yield point.","The load measurements may also be used to prevent over-tightening the band during extended use. In particular, the loading information could also be used in an alternative manner if the band has auto-tightness adjustment capability. In this case the surgeon may or may not be present at the time the tension of the tension element is being adjusted. In this scenario, the load and\/or strain measurements could be used to signal the control unit of the motor to either stop tightening the band if a pre-set load threshold is reached or actually reverse the direction of the motor to decrease tension element loading if the threshold has already been exceeded. One way to ensure that the loading threshold is never exceeded is to control the flow of current to the motor using commonly known techniques, such as current clipping, to ensure that the motor is never able to build up enough torque to over-tighten the tension element. Alternatively, an electrical fuse element could be used in conjunction with the current supplied to the motor such that the fuse would trip and either limit or release loads on the tension element if the current supplied to the motor ever exceeds an allowable threshold.","In addition to the measuring techniques discussed above, these benefits could be embodied by use of any of the load measuring techniques, such as, measuring the motor torque. In particular, the tension on the tension element may be derived from motor torque. The algorithm used in this method is explained representatively at: http:\/\/www.dynetic.com\/faq.htm., which states, \u201cThe torque requirement for an application can be calculated, measured directly using a torque measuring deice (torque watch), or measured indirectly using a DC motor. When using a motor, measure the current drawn of the motor under load, and calculate the torque using the equation below:\n\n=()\u00d7()\n","Where,\n\n","Please be aware this equation approximates the true load torque and does not take thermal conditions into consideration. The results are reasonably close and suitable for most purposes.\u201d","The current may be determined by measuring the current across a shunt resistor in series with the motor at the power source. The microcontroller will measure the voltage across the resistor and convert the value to current using Ohm's Law (I=V\/R where I=current, V=voltage and R=Resistance across the shunt resistor) in order to determine torque.","This value may be converted to tension since the tension element is a screw thread or cable.","In general, a representative conversion equation for torque to axial load (cable tension) is:\n\n\n","Where,\n\n","Since it is not generally recommended that induced stress exceed a safe fraction of the yield strength of the tension element, it may be desirable to introduce a fractional coefficient c (less than or equal to 1) in the equation:\n\n\n","Expressed in terms of cable tension:\n\n\n","Since this relationship is linear, however, any correlations such as those discussed below to band adjustments may be made using torque or tension. Thus, current, torque or cable tension may all be used as an adjustment parameter, much the same as the pressure measurements as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006\/0211913, entitled \u201cNON-INVASIVE PRESSURE MEASUREMENT IN A FLUID ADJUSTABLE RESTRICTIVE DEVICE\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","As discussed above, the tension upon the tension element may be measured by monitoring component strain. The tension may be measured directly via a strain gauge. The strain gauge may be positioned in a number of locations such that the tension would cause a strain, i.e.,\n\n","Where,\n\n","So,\n\n\n","In accordance with yet another embodiment, the strain gauge location could be used as a compressive force gage if the nut is free to translate slightly with the thread. The gauge would be positioned under the nut on the side opposite the direction of translation of the threaded shaft and the nut would impose a compressive force on to the gauge when the band is adjusted. In a manner similar to the tension measured above the force could also be measured with compression as well. Thin film load cells are commercially available and can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,272,936. This circuit can be made to fit a very tiny space in-between the nut  and the hosing plate.","In accordance with yet another embodiment as shown with reference to , the axial loads on the tension element  may be measured. In accordance with such and embodiment, the tension force between the end of the spring element (that is the tension member ), and the threaded shaft at the free end  of the tension element  is measured. A small transducer  is attached that measures the axial load seen by the threaded shaft as the gastric band  is adjusted. This could also be employed at various locations along the tension element , such as those indicated by the red circles.","Operational Modes","Referring to , some of the safety features of the banding system of the present invention are described. As discussed above with respect to , both power and control signals are provided to the implantable controller from the external control . Because power is delivered to the implantable controller via magnetic induction, the amount of energy delivered to the controller depends on the quality of the coupling between the external antenna  and the antenna circuitry contained within the antenna\/controller pod .","The quality of the coupling may be evaluated by analyzing the level of the feedback signal received by the external control , and a metric corresponding to this parameter may be displayed on the signal strength indicator , which includes 6 LEDs (corresponding to six levels of coupling). If the coupling between the antennas ,  is insufficient, the motor  of the drive element  may not work properly, resulting in an inaccurate adjustment of the gastric band .","Accordingly, in a standard mode of operation, adjustment may be made only if the coupling quality is strong enough, as indicated by having at least LED  or LED  in  illuminated. If, on the other hand, poor coupling exists (e.g., one of the first four LEDs are illuminated) it is still possible to perform some adjustment of the gastric band , although the adjustment may be inaccurate.","The design of the external control , in combination with the patient microchip card  (see ), also ensures a high degree of efficacy and safety. First, as contemplated for use with the gastric band  of the present invention, the external control  is intended primarily for use by a physician in an office or hospital setting, and not by the patient alone. Of course, in alternative embodiments, such as to treat urinary or fecal incontinence, it would be essential to provide an external control  for use by the patient. The simplicity of the design of the external control  and ease of use would provide no impediment to use by the patient for such embodiments.","As discussed with respect to , patient microchip card  stores, among other data, a serial number identifying a corresponding gastric band  and the diameter of the ring  upon completion of the previous adjustment. When the external control  first transmits energy to the implantable controller of the gastric band , the gastric band  identifies itself to the external control . In the standard mode of operation, the serial number stored on the patient microchip card  must match that received from the gastric band , otherwise no adjustment is permitted.","As a fail-safe, however, the physician still may adjust the gastric band  even if the patient has lost or misplaced his microchip card . In this case, the external control  may be set in a \u201cno card mode\u201d. In this mode, the information displayed on the display screen  of the external control  corresponds only to the relative variation of the gastric band  during that adjustment session, and is no longer indicative of absolute diameter. When the physician activates this mode, an emergency bit is set in the memory of the implantable controller to indicate the \u201cno card mode\u201d. In subsequent adjustment sessions, the implantable controller will signal that the gastric band  was adjusted in the \u201cno card mode\u201d and all further adjustments will be reported on a relative basis. If the patient again locates the microchip card , the emergency bit may be cleared by fully opening the gastric band  and thus reaching the reference contact, which re-initializes the position. Subsequent adjustments will again be managed in the standard mode of operation.","During adjustment of the ring , a physician places the external antenna  in a face-to-face position on the skin of the patient relative to the antenna\/controller pod  of the ring , and to receive feedback information from which the constricted diameter of the ring  may be computed. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, it is possible to vary the diameter of the ring  without having to undertake invasive surgical intervention, and this variation may be carried out at will, because multiple control cycles may be carried out at regular or irregular intervals, solely under the control of the treating physician.","The banding system of the present invention is expected to be particularly reliable, relative to previously-known hydraulic bands that can be adjusted by the patient, because only the physician typically will have access to the external control box needed to adjust the ring. For a ring embodiment intended for treatment of morbid obesity, the patient therefore does not have free access to any means to adjust the diameter of the ring.","Moreover, because the gastric band of the present invention provides a precise readout of the current diameter of the ring in the standard mode of operation, it may not be necessary for the patient to ingest a radiographic material (e.g., barium dye) to permit radiographic visualization of the ring to confirm the adjusted size. The process of adjusting the band accordingly may be carried out in a doctor's office, without the expense associated with radiographic confirmation of such adjustments. In addition, the self-blocking configuration of the tension element and nut, in combination with the mechanical nature of the gastric band, overcome problems associated with previously-known hydraulically actuated gastric band systems.","Methods of Implantation and Removal","Referring now to , the gastric band  of the present invention is shown implanted in a patient. The ring  is disposed encircling the upper portion of the patient's stomach S while the antenna\/controller pod  is disposed adjacent to the patient's sternum ST. The antenna\/controller pod  is located in this position beneath the patient's skin SK so that it is easily accessible in the patient's chest area to facilitate coupling of the antenna\/controller pod  to the external antenna  of the external control  (see ).","Other Features","In addition to the features discussed above, the present invention provides a mechanism for protecting the implanted electronics from electromagnetic interference (for example, from MRI). In particular, the electronics of the device are encased in a titanium case  (see ) and the antenna  is moved external to the titanium case . In this way, the electronics may be implanted deeper into the body cavity, leaving only a thin antenna near the surface of the skin.","In addition, time limit warning on the packaging of the device may be avoided\n\n","As stated in the System Overview portion of the present application, the telemetrically-powered and controlled ring system of the present invention has numerous applications apart from gastric banding for the treatment of morbid obesity. For example, the ring system of the present invention may advantageously be used for the treatment of fecal incontinence, ileostomy, coleostomy, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, urinary incontinence and isolated-organ perfusion.","For treatment of fecal incontinence, the ring may be used with little or no modifications. In addition, because the ring adjustment procedure will be performed by the patient on at least a daily basis, a portable user-friendly external control may be used. In addition, because the ring will regularly be transitioned between the closed and fully opened position, the patient microchip card is unneeded. Instead, the fully closed position may be stored in the memory of the implantable controller, and read by the external remote at each use (subject to periodic change by the physician).","A similarly modified device could be used by patients who have undergone ileostomy or coleostomy, or disposed surrounding the esophageal junction, to treat gastro-esophageal reflux disease.","For treatment of urinary incontinence, the ring may be further modified to minimize the volume of the ring surrounding the urethra by moving the drive element motor to a location elsewhere in the lower abdomen or pelvis, and coupling the drive element to the motor via a transmission cable.","The present invention also may be beneficially employed to perform isolated-organ perfusion. The treatment of certain cancers requires exposure to levels of chemotherapy agents that are too high for systemic circulation. It has been suggested that one solution to this problem is perform an open surgery procedure in which blood flow to the cancerous organ is stopped and quiescent blood replaced by circulation from an external source containing a desired dose of drug. Individual or multiple rings of the present invention may be used as valves to isolate the cancerous organ and permit perfusion of the organ with high doses of drugs. Such procedures could thus be performed on a repetitive basis without surgery, thereby reducing the trauma and the risk to the patient while improving patient outcomes.","Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been described above in detail, it will be understood that this description is merely for purposes of illustration. Further variations will be apparent to one skilled in the art in light of this disclosure and are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.","As discussed above, it is possible to make highly accurate load measurements regarding the load applied by the ring in accordance with the present invention. This information may be used to dynamically adjust the band's degree of restriction to optimize weight loss. This may prove helpful to surgeons in making a correlation between tension on the tension element and how tightly the band is tightened on tissue. Much the same as the pressure measurements as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006\/0211913, entitled \u201cNON-INVASIVE PRESSURE MEASUREMENT IN A FLUID ADJUSTABLE RESTRICTIVE DEVICE\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference; that is, the manner in which pressure magnitude and pulse counting of peristaltic waves is used as a target against which to adjust, the load or strain measurements may be used in a similar fashion as a measure of peristaltic pressure. Such systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006\/0189888, entitled \u201cDEVICE FOR NON-INVASIVE MEASUREMENT OF FLUID PRESSURE IN AN ADJUSTABLE RESTRICTION DEVICE\u201d, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009\/0187202, entitled \u201cOPTIMIZING THE OPERATION OF A RESTRICTION SYSTEM\u201d, which are also incorporated by reference. Pressure waves from esophageal peristalsis will cause tension changes in the cable which may be read and correlated to proper or improper adjustment. Pulses may be counted from this same means, along with pulse width, duration, etc. Much of the information that can be gained will be able to be derived from form the present mechanism.","Multiple methods of storing the measured loads on the band are discloses, which include but are not limited to:\n\n","With regard to storing motor torque, the component torque, as described above, may also be stored for later analysis by a torque measuring device (torque watch). Simpler models would just record and store peak values, which may be sufficient for this application. Alternatively, a more complex model would allow for storage of continuously obtained torque information. Due to storage capacity, it is likely that the data would need to be recorded in set increments and be downloaded periodically. Alternately, if the torque was measured indirectly using a DC motor as described above, a multimeter may be used to record and store peak values and\/or continuously obtain information which could then be converted to torque via the above equations.","As to storing mechanical strain, the component strain, as described above, may also be stored for later analysis by a strain gauge. Simpler models would just record and store peak values, which may be sufficient for this application. Alternatively, a more complex model would allow for storage of continuously obtained strain information. Due to storage capacity, it is likely that the data would need to be recorded in set increments and be downloaded periodically.","Compressive and axial loads may also be stored, as described above. This information is stored for later analysis by a strain gauge. A basic force gauge may be used to store compressive and axial loads. Simpler models would just record and store peak values, which may be sufficient for this application. Alternatively, a more complex model would allow for storage of continuously obtained torque information.","Stored information to interested parties (i.e., Surgeon, Primary Care Physician (PCP), Patient, etc.) may be relayed to other parties for use at remote locations. With regard to the relay of information to the surgeon\/PCP, a surgeon or primary care physician may be interested in obtaining and using the information gathered to make determinations about the restriction provided by the band and\/or complications arising from the tightness of the band. As a result, it is desirable that the information measured and stored as described above is also accessible by the surgeon or PCP. One mechanism for achieving this would be to use an external data logger which would be worn by the patient. Information stored in this device could be downloaded by the surgeon or PCP by means of a USB port. For example, see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006\/0199997, entitled \u201cMONITORING OF A FOOD INTAKE RESTRICTION DEVICE\u201d and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008\/0249806, entitled \u201cDATA ANALYSIS FOR AN IMPLANTABLE RESTRICTION DEVICE AND A DATA LOGGER\u201d, which are hereby incorporated by reference.","As to the relay of information to the patient, patients would be interested in obtaining some information about the status of the restriction in their band for various reasons. For example, one reason would be to indicate that there may be a problem with their implant and direct them to visit their surgeon. Since it would probably not be necessary or useful for them to receive numerical information about the torque, strain or load present in their band, a different type of relaying method would be important. One option would be an audible noise (i.e., alarm) which would indicate to them if there was a potential issue with their implant. Alternatively, if they were wearing an external data logger as described above, a visual light (i.e., flashing red or green) could indicate the status of their implant.","While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be understood that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather, is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 to 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A and 15B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A and 16B","FIGS. 15A and 15B"],"b":["16","16","16","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 27 to 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 39 to 55"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 56A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIGS. 57A","b":["57","58","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIGS. 59 to 71"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 72"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIGS. 73 to 76"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 77 to 94"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 95 and 96"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 97A and 97B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 98 and 99"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 101","FIG. 100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 102","FIG. 100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 103","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 104"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 105"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIGS. 106 to 112"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
