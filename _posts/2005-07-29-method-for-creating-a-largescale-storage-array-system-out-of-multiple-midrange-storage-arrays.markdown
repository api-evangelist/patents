title: Method for creating a large-scale storage array system out of multiple mid-range storage arrays
abstract: Disclosed is a method for creating a large-scale storage array by combining multiple mid-range storage arrays via a host based aggregation engine software application. Each mid-range storage array, also call a storage building block, consists of one or more RAID volumes. Each mid-range storage array has equivalent configuration and property settings including number of drives, RAID level, volume segment sizes, and volume cache settings, but not including the volume label. The complex combination of mid-range storage arrays appears as a single storage system to a data management application of a host computer system. Once the mid-range storage arrays are aggregated into a large-scale storage array, or storage complex array, common features may be modified as a collection of items so that a common modification need only be entered one time for all items in the collection. The storage complex array also permits a management application to interact with the storage complex array as a virtual volume without the need to handle the complexities of the individual mid-range storage arrays. A separate graphical user interface application permits a system administrator to configure the aggregation engine without putting the burden of graphics and user interaction into the operation of the aggregation engine. The host based aggregation engine provides cost savings by creating a high end storage system without the need for costly specialized hardware. The aggregation engine is also scalable, permitting the addition or subtraction of mid-range storage arrays.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["a. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally pertains to storage systems and more particularly to a combination of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) data storage volumes.","b. Description of the Background","RAID storage is common high end data storage for corporate and personal computing. RAID storage permits various strategies to optimize a storage system for redundancy and\/or speed, as well as minimizing trade offs between redundancy and speed. To further expand the abilities of RAID storage, a Storage Building Block (SBB) may be created as a combination of individual conventional RAID storage volumes. By combining the individual RAID volumes into a larger system, a SBB storage system may be created that is larger than individual RAID storage volumes alone.","RAID storage and SBB systems utilize many technical specifications to create standard products that are capable of interoperating with other devices. Communication standards are one of the primary areas of standardization for RAID storage and SBB storage systems. Common communication standards used for RAID storage and SBB systems include: Fibre Channel, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA), and others. The Fibre Channel, SCSI, SAS, SATA, and many other technical specifications are kept by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ANSI is located at 11 West 42nd Street, 13th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10036, telephone number 212-642-4900, and web site www.ansi.org.","An embodiment of the present invention may therefore comprise a method for creating a large-scale storage array comprising the steps of: combining multiple storage building blocks into a storage complex, the storage building blocks being a sub-group made up of at least one RAID storage volume, the RAID storage volume being a RAID storage volume made up of at least one physical hard drive, each of the storage building blocks having equivalent configuration and property settings such as number of drives, RAID level, volume segment sizes, and volume cache settings, but not including a volume label; physically connecting the storage complex to a host computer system; and managing the storage complex using aggregation engine software running on the host computer system such that the storage complex appears as a single storage system to a management application on the host computer system.","An embodiment of the present invention may further comprise a large-scale storage array system comprising: a storage complex, the storage complex being a combination of multiple storage building blocks, the combination of multiple storage building blocks being a sub-group made up of at least one RAID storage volume, the RAID storage volume being a RAID storage volume made up of at least one drive, the combination of multiple storage building blocks and the RAID storage volume being physically connected to a host computer system, each of the combination of multiple storage building blocks having equivalent configuration and property settings such as number of drives, RAID level, volume segment sizes, and volume cache settings, but not including a volume label; and an aggregation engine software application that manages the storage complex such that the storage complex appears as a single storage system to a management application on the host computer system.","An embodiment of the present invention may further comprise a large-scale storage array system comprising: means for combining multiple storage building blocks into a storage complex; means for physically connecting the storage complex to a host computer system; and means for managing the storage complex array using aggregation engine software running on the host computer system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","120","120","118","118","118","118","120","118","120","120","118","102","104","120"]},"The host computer system  runs the data application  that views the storage complex array  as a single virtual storage system. The aggregation engine  and the volume manager  running on the host  provide the ability for the system to interact with the storage complex array  as a single storage system. The volume manager  is a standard software application that interacts with the operating system of the host  to control the communication path aggregation for the storage complex . The volume manager is a software application that may be provided by a number of volume manager software providers such as Veritas Software. Veritas Software is located at 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, Calif. 94043, telephone number 650-527-8000, and web site www.veritas.com.","The SBB's  communicate with the host computer system  using standard storage system communication protocol I\/O channels . The standard communication protocols include, but are not limited to: Fibre Channel, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA). All SBB's  in a storage complex array  must have equivalent configuration and property settings including number of drives, RAID level, volume segment sizes, and volume cache settings, but not including the volume label.","While the volume manager  handles the communication path aggregation, the aggregation engine provides the management and control of the storage complex array . The aggregation engine  is the application which combines the SBB's  into a virtual storage complex array  for interaction with the array management application . The aggregation engine  is a multi-tasking application capable of managing multiple instances of storage complex arrays . The aggregation engine  is also capable of communicating to the multiple storage complex arrays  in a parallel fashion. That is, if multiple storage complex arrays  require the same communication message, the aggregation engine is capable of sending the communication message to multiple storage complex arrays  simultaneously.","The number n of SBB's  in a storage complex array  is a configurable parameter of the aggregation engine . Since the number of SBB's  is configurable, the storage complex array  is scalable because one may add or subtract SBB's  to the storage complex array . Configuration of the storage complex array  is performed via a software array management application  and does not require new hardware. The array management application  is a separate software application from the aggregation engine . The aggregation engine  may be written in the Java programming language and does not include any graphical interface features. The array management software  provides the graphical user interface to configure and manage the aggregation engine . The array management application  may be run on the host computer system , but to avoid the security and system inefficiency problems associated with graphical user interfaces, the array management application  is typically run on a separate management station computer . The management station  communicates with the host computer  over a standard computer network connection . The array management application  sends all management commands  over the network  to the aggregation engine  running on the host computer system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","210","208","208","206","206","204","202","208","210","204","208","204","204","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","306","306","304","304","302","302","306"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","420","422","412","414","416","418","420","422","404","420","422","408","410","412","414","416","418","420","422"]},"In the system  shown in , the SYMbol API permits addressing a number of different attributes including volumes , , , , SBB's , , controllers , and drive clusters , .
