One particular category of these mechanisms is referred to as an actuator. Actuators can be designed to move objects in a rotary motion, or in a linear motion. A rotary actuator is simply a gearbox that either increases or decreases the rotational speed of a prime mover, typically a hydraulic motor, an internal combustion engine, a turbine engine, or an electric motor, to provide a desired level of rotational speed and torque at the output of the machine. Some examples of rotary actuators include: gearboxes, transmissions, differentials, hydraulic rotary actuators, and rotary electro-mechanical actuators. Linear actuators are machines designed to provide force and linear displacement to an object. Some examples of linear actuators include: rack & pinion actuators, hydraulic rams, ball screw actuators, and crank arm actuators.","Historically, hydraulic\/pneumatic motors and hydraulic\/pneumatic rams have been the primary source of power for both linear and rotary actuators. Hydraulic systems offer many advantages to the designer. These advantages include: high power density, accurate position control, low inertia (for high frequency response), and overload protection (via pressure relief valves).","In the last several decades, engineers have started to replace hydraulic\/pneumatic actuation systems with electro-mechanical actuation systems. Electro-mechanical actuators (\u201cEMAs\u201d) offer increased efficiency over their hydraulic and pneumatic counterparts and can eliminate the fire hazards and leakage potentials associated with the hydraulic fluids used in hydraulic actuation systems. One application for linear EMAs is on a space craft thrust vector control system. These EMAs can include redundant architecture to prevent single point failures.","A wiper for a translating ram with recessed features includes a first element conforming to the recessed features of the translating ram; and a second element conforming to the external surface of the translating ram. The first element and second element conform to the cross-section of the translating ram when placed axially adjacent.","A method of manufacturing a wiper for a translating ram with recessed portions includes forming a first element to conform to the recessed portions of the translating ram; and forming a second element to fit axially adjacent to the first element and to conform to the external surface of the translating ram.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIGS. 2A-2B"],"b":["10","12","13","14","16","18","20","22","24","12","26","12"]},"Motor  can be a permanent magnet electric motor with a brake. Motor  is connected to ballscrew shaft  through gearbox  and and causes shaft  to rotate. Ballscrew shaft  is connected to translating ram  through ballscrew nut . The rotation of ballscrew shaft  causes ballscrew nut  to move axially along ballscrew shaft . Translating ram  is connected to ballscrew nut  and moves with nut . This movement of nut  causes ram  to extend and retract relative to housing . Translating ram  moves through recirculating ballspline  and wiper , which are each held in place by housing . Recessed portions  of translating ram  fit together with recirculating ballspline , allowing axial movement of ram  and resisting rotation. Actuator  can include a second motor with brake, gears, or any other configuration of parts known in the art to add redundancy and\/or tailor actuator  to the needs of a particular application.","Actuator  causes translating ram  to extend or retract linearly as needed. Using recirculating ballspline  with translating ram  with recessed portions  gives ram  higher efficiencies than if ram  did not have recessed portions  (and a conventional bushing was used). This is due to the larger surface area contact of balls in recirculating ballspline  contacting recessed portions  of ram . Recirculating ballspline  with recessed portions  also allow low friction linear movement of ram  with anti-rotation torque transfer.","The use and benefits of recirculating ballspine  with recessed portions  are dependent upon the ball elements in recirculating ballspline  corresponding exactly with the dimensions of recessed portions . As translating ram  extends out and then retracts, there is a danger of dirt or other debris becoming stuck on ram  and entering recirculating ballspline . That foreign debris can prevent the low friction movement of ram , and may even cause translating ram  to jam up. Wiper  fits over ram  to prevent any dirt or debris from entering recirculating ballspline  as translating ram  retracts into housing .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["12","12","12","26","27"]},"Translating ram  can be made of steel, stainless steel, titanium aluminum, plastic or any other material that fits the needs of actuator . Recessed portions  can run the length of translating ram  and can be in the configuration shown or can come in other configurations depending on the needs of the system. Recessed portions  can result in sharp edges between recessed portions  and external surfaces  in the cross-section of translating ram . Past wipers were configured to fit cylindrical rams without the sharp edged recessed portions . Because there were no sharp edged recessed portions, past wipers were generally easy to fit and manufacture. A conventional O-ring could be placed on prior art rams to form a seal. However, with the introduction of sharp edged recessed portions , conventional O-rings could no longer be used as wipers were required to fit tightly around a cross-section with sharp edges.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIGS. 3A-3B"],"b":["30","24","12","32","24","12","24","30","32"]},"Wiper  includes first element  and second element . First element  includes extensions  to support second element , portions  conforming to the recessed features of the translating ram; and gaps  to go over external cylindrical surface. Second element  conforms to the external surfaces of translating ram .","As seen in , second element  can be placed axially adjacent to first element  and over extensions  to form wiper . First element  and second element  can be made of an elastic material that has good sliding wear properties. The material properties helps wiper  seal against with ram , while allowing ram  translate through but not wear on wiper . An example of an appropriate material is Turcon\u00ae, a Polytetrafluoroethylene made by Trelleborg Sealing Solutions.","Past attempts at making wipers for translating rams with recessed portions were unsuccessful due to the inability to machine or cast internal sharp corners. Machining or casting always involved some finite radius on the cutting tool used or the casting, resulting in a wiper with gaps between it and the translating ram sharp corners. Wiper  is able to seal even around sharp corners by including first element  to seal recessed portions  and placing it adjacent to second element  conforming to outer portions  of translating ram . The use of two elements,  and  allow wiper  to seal both recessed portions and sharp corners generated by recessed portions  on ram .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4B"],"b":["12","30","24","12","12","30","32","12","12","26","27","24","30","34","36","12","32"]},"First element  of wiper  is placed on translating ram  so that portions  conforming to recessed features fit with recessed portions  of ram . Second element  is then placed axially adjacent to first element  to form wiper . Second element  fits over first element  and is supported by extensions  of first element . Wiper  forms a cross-sectional seal on translating ram , with portions  sealing recessed portions  of translating ram  and second element  fitting with first element  to seal over sharp edges of ram . Wiper  therefore works to prevent dirt or other debris from entering into actuator  as translating ram  is extended or retracted into housing .","By forming wiper  with a first element  conforming to the recessed features of the translating ram and a second element  conforming to the external surface of the translating ram, wiper  is able to form a seal over sharp edges and recessed portions  of translating ram . Wiper  allows the use and benefits of a translating ram with recessed portions while keeping dirt and debris out of the actuator  housing  and recirculating ballspline  (or other device which uses ram ). The sealing against dirt and debris can prevent damage or a reduction in the life of the actuator.","While wiper  has been discussed in relation to use in an actuator with a recirculating ballspline, it can be used in with any device where a translating ram with recessed portions is used. Additionally, the configuration of recessed portions of translating ram and complimentary configurations of portions of wiper  to seal ram can be differed depending on needs of the system.","While a wiper with a first element  with extensions  to support second element  is shown, extensions  are not required, and first element and second element may just sit adjacent to each other and may be held in place by a housing. In an alternative embodiment, there may be some interlocking of first element and second element. Other embodiments could include a compression device, such as an o-ring, a spring, a clamp, etc. The compression device could fit around the outside diameter of wiper  and could provide a higher scraping force between wiper  and translating ram .","While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment(s), it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
