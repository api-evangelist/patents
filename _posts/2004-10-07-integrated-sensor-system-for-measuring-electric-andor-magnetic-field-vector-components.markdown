No. 60\/509,423 entitled \u201cIntegrated Electric and Magnetic Field Sensor\u201d filed Oct. 7, 2003.","The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of DARPA Contract Nos. F33615-02-C-1260 and DAAH01-02-C-R225.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to measuring at least magnetic fields and, more particularly, to an integrated sensor system for measuring vector components of magnetic fields, preferably along with electric fields.","2. Discussion of the Prior Art","Measurements of electric and magnetic fields at low frequencies, generally less than 1 kHz, have been made for many years using discrete sensors to measure the electric field (E-field) and magnetic field (B-field) separately. In addition, it has been proposed to integrate electric and magnetic components into a single sensor. However, when a high level of sensitivity is required, individual sensors are invariably utilized to measure desired components of each field. For example, to make a magnetotelluric measurement, individual magnetic induction sensors are laid on the ground at a separation of a few meters and rods are buried in the ground nearby to measure the horizontal electric field. In most cases, the respective sensors must all be aligned relative to one another and mounted with sufficient rigidity to minimize relative motion. Depending on the accuracy required, such an installation can take a significant time to complete and requires an area in the order of 10 mto operate.","Prior high sensitivity induction sensors have been too large to integrate together. While one cylindrical object of length even up to 2 m is relatively easy to handle and transport, a system comprised of two or three such sensors at right angles to each other, if even contemplated, would be very cumbersome. In addition, prior induction sensors designed for detection of small low frequency signals had diameters in the order of 3 cm or more. Simply stated, prior induction sensors and arrangements that involve them are quite large and sub-optimal, while being inefficient to set-up and operate.","In many applications, the ability to reasonably employ a dual field sensor system will depend on the compactness and even weight of the system. These applications include the installation of dual field sensors in aircraft, spacecraft and ground vehicles, as well as situations where the sensor system must be deployed in a certain way such as hand or air-drop deployment situations. The time consuming set-up and lack of compactness in prior proposals has essentially limited the use of collected E-field and B-field information to geophysical applications, such as magnetotellurics and the measurement of lightning, wherein the sensors can be positioned over a relatively wide area.","When electric and magnetic field data has been collected together, the objective has generally been to collect an individual field parameter as a record of a specific physical phenomena, e.g. lightning. However, the present Applicants have recognized that specific vector components of known orientation in the electric and magnetic field data can be combined to produce a reduced output. For instance, new combined electric and magnetic measurement applications arise, including using information in one measurement channel, e.g., an electric field vector component, to reduce environmental noise in other channels, e.g., multiple magnetic field vector components. In addition, the ratio of various signals in different electric and magnetic axes can be determined to provide source characteristic capabilities.","Based on the above, there exists a need to combine one or more electric field sensors with one or more magnetic field sensors to establish an integrated sensor system which is compact in nature in order to employ the sensor system in a wide range of applications. In addition, there exists a benefit to be able to readily combine different data from individual axes of such an integrated sensor system in order to take advantage of particular relationships between the electric and magnetic fields that pertain to certain properties of the environment or source(s) of interest.","The present invention is directed to an integrated and compact sensor system for determining electric and\/or magnetic vector component information of fields. Sensors are maintained at fixed, well defined relative positions for generating signals from which the vector information is determined. Different data from individual axes of the integrated sensor system is preferably combined in a manner which takes advantage of particular relationships between the electric and magnetic fields.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, multiple sensors are employed for measuring the electric and\/or magnetic fields, with the multiple sensors being preferably, rigidly connected together along defined, intersecting axes, while communicating with a controller for processing and analyzing the data. In accordance with the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the sensor system is self-contained so as to include a built-in power source, as well as data storage and\/or transmission capability, such that the system can operate without an electrically conducting contact with the surrounding environment.","In addition to the electric and\/or magnetic field sensors, the integrated sensor system also preferably includes a global positioning system (GPS) to provide timing and position information. Furthermore, a sensor unit which can determine the orientation and tilt of the sensor system can be incorporated as well. Also, the sensor system can be self-calibrating, wherein structure is provided to produce local electric and\/or magnetic fields which are used to calibrate the sensor system following deployment.","Additional objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments when taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts in the several views.","The present invention provides advances in connection with establishing a compact sensor system that can measure multiple vector components of both electric and magnetic fields at very high sensitivity. By a \u201ccompact\u201d sensing system it is meant that the region over which a particular field is measured is small relative to the spatial variations in the field that are of interest, and\/or is sufficiently compact that a system that measures multiple components of the field is of a convenient size. As will become fully evident below, the compact nature and arrangement of the various sensors allows the sensors to intersect at a common center, while enabling minimum lateral offsets between the sensors.","An example of a multi-axis, combined E-field and B-field sensor system  built according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in . In this system, three orthogonal axes of an electric field are measured with various capacitive sensors \u2013 arranged as pairs in orthogonal oriented directions. To measure the electric field, it is only necessary to measure the potential at two points, subtract one result from the other, and divide by the physical distance, d, between the two points, and multiply by a calibration constant k which is close to unity to allow for the design of the sensor, with k being readily determinable by testing the sensor in a known field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"V","mn":"1"},{"mi":"V","mn":"2"}],"mo":"-"},"mi":"d"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"As will be detailed more fully below, the two measurements can be made by completely different sensors or by connecting two separate potential sensors to an appropriate amplifier with a differential input. The voltage of one sensor can be subtracted in a pair-wise fashion from multiple other sensors to provide the electric field in the direction of the vector joining the measurement points according to the above equation. As shown, each of the six sensors \u2013, which preferably take the form of conducting plates, functions to measure an electric potential in the form of a respective voltage V\u2212Vat its geometric center. More specifically, sensors \u2013 are linked and maintained at fixed relative positions through respective support arms or rods \u2013 to a main body or housing  through insulators, such as that indicated at  for support arm . In accordance with this form of the invention, housing  is formed from attaching three individual sensor modules \u2013, with sensors  and  being carried by module ; sensors  and  being carried by module ; and sensors  and  being carried by module . Support arms  and  are preferably coaxially aligned along a first axis, while support arms  and  extend coaxially along a second axis and support arms  and  extend coaxially along a third axis. As shown, the second axis associated with support arms  and  is arranged substantially perpendicular to the first and third axes.","Housing  also includes first and second end caps, one of which is indicated at . Within housing  is the electronics (not shown) associated with sensor system . Also projecting from each module \u2013 are respective electrical connectors, such as those indicated at \u2013 for module . Electrical connectors \u2013 are provided to link each module \u2013 of housing  to electrical components employed in reading and evaluating the signals received from sensor system . In addition, each module \u2013 includes an associated power switch, such as power switches  and  for modules  and  respectively. At this point, it should be understood that housing  could be integrally constructed, while employing only one set of electrical connectors \u2013 and one power switch , .","With this arrangement, electric fields are constructed in the following manner: E=k(V\u2212V+V\u2212V)\/2, E=k(V\u2212V), E=k(V+V\u2212V\u2212V)\/2 in which the plate voltages Vand the constants kare determined by calibration in a known electric field prior to actual use of sensor system . By virtue of the design of the capacitive-type, multi-component electric field sensor system  represented in , the three measured field components Ex, Ey and Ez intersect centrally in modules \u2013 of housing . However, it should be noted that the individual sensing arrays established by sensors \u2013 need not be arranged perpendicular with respect to each other, but rather only sufficient projection in orthogonal directions is needed to estimate the fields in those orthogonal directions.","As indicated above, electric field sensors \u2013 are spaced by arms \u2013 and insulators . In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, each insulator  actually defines a magnetic field sensor, preferably an induction-type magnetic field sensor. Therefore, sensor system  preferably includes a corresponding number of magnetic field sensors  as electric field sensors \u2013. Positioning magnetic field sensors  in the manner set forth above enables magnetic field sensors  to perform a dual function of insulating the electric field sensors \u2013 and sensing various vector components of a given magnetic field. Although separate insulators and magnetic field sensors could be employed, this arrangement contributes to the compact nature of sensor system , while also minimizing costs. In any case, sensor system  can advantageously sense both electric and magnetic fields and, more specifically, vector components of each of electric and magnetic fields. Integrating the E and B sensor hardware obviously results in a smaller, lighter and less expensive system. These are significant benefits in their own right and make possible some applications, such as deployment of sensor system  on an aircraft.","At this point, it should be noted that support arms \u2013 could actually define the magnetic field sensors, while also spacing and insulating the various electric field (potential) sensors \u2013. In this case, the outer casing (not separately labeled) of each support arm \u2013 acts as the insulator. Instead, a separate insulator could be employed to carry a respective electric field sensor \u2013. In any case, the magnetic field sensors are shown as structural extensions between housing  and electric field sensors \u2013 which adds to the compact nature of the overall sensor system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["400","400","400","430","433","450","440","443","452","455","430","432","452","455","430","433","452","455","400","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["500","530","534","550","540","544","540","544","552","540","350","530"]},"Sensor system  shows a total of five electric potential sensors \u2013. In this embodiment, the field along the vertical axis of the sensor is calculated by subtracting the output of sensor  from the average of the outputs of sensors \u2013. If desired, a sixth sensor (not shown) can be positioned at the bottom end of the magnetic sensor  to provide a single measurement point for the second potential measurement along the vertical axis. The advantage of the five sensor embodiment  shown in  is that, by not having a sensor in the lower part of the system, a mounting means can be positioned there instead.","As with the other embodiments disclosed, sensor system  is preferably battery powered. The signals recorded by each sensor \u2013,  is made relative to the battery voltage that powers sensor system . When the common points of the batteries of any two sensors are connected together, the difference of the sensor outputs gives a reading directly proportional to the particular field. In a preferred version of the multi-axis, multi-field system, a DC battery unit  is used for sensors \u2013 and , thereby ensuring that all measurements are relative to a common reference. In any case, using the approach of  advantageously enables electric field sensors \u2013 and magnetic sensors  to be situated at any desired position.","The most preferred magnetic field sensor to use in the invention is a magnetic induction sensor that incorporates a high permeability material (the core) in order to concentrate magnetic flux. When suitably designed, such a sensor has the highest sensitivity of all types of room temperature magnetic field sensors. For example, a sensitivity of 0.2 pT\/Hzat 10 Hz and 0.03 pT\/Hzat 100 Hz can be achieved using a device less than 50 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. To integrate two more such sensors together so that they intersect at their midpoints with minimal lateral offset (less than 1 cm), it is important to design the sensor with the minimum outer diameter and also to split the sensor winding so that the sensor midpoint has a cross-section only a little larger than the high permeability core material. By minimizing the lateral offset, the orthogonality between sensor outputs is maximized. A compact integrated magnetic induction sensor system so designed is an ideal sensor unit for use with electric field sensors in the manner shown in  and, in addition, can be used as a multi-axis highly sensitive magnetic field sensor in its own right.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","400","500","571","572","300","400","500","572","572","300","400","500","300","400","500","573"]},"As the particular circuitry employed in connection with the sensor system is not part of the present invention, it will not be described in detail here. However,  generally illustrates basic aspects of the present invention wherein both electric and magnetic field data is sent to a controller  in order that the signals can be processed to determine one or more vector components of the electric and\/or magnetic field as represented by magnitude data  and direction data . On a general note, a high-impedance amplifier is preferably connected to each sensor. The amplifier is configured to buffer the output of the sensor and send a representative signal to a subsequent low-impedance circuit. In any case, each sensor is preferably modulated in time in order to increase its sensitivity.","In many cases, a considerable benefit of using both E and B sensors is not just to collect their individual outputs separately, but rather to combine their outputs to provide an integrated, processed electromagnetic system output. The capability to provide an integrated multi-axis electric field measurement is itself advantageous, and the further integration of electric field measurement with one or more axes of magnetic field measurement as set forth in accordance with the present invention provides additional measurement schemes which result in specific electromagnetic sensing opportunities. As will be detailed more fully below, the electric and magnetic field data can be synthesized to reduce the amount of output by combining channel data, while yielding improved fidelity by exploiting specific physical relationships between E and B data for specific targets and environmental conditions.","It is generally desired to combine the particular components of the E and B fields measured relative to the terrestrial frame of reference. Specifically, it is important to determine the vertical component (E, B) and\/or the horizontal components, (E, B) of each field. Such a measurement can be arranged by aligning the sensor system along the axis of maximum gravitational field such that the desired sensor axis is situated in a desired orientation, or by mathematically rotating the output of multiple sensor channels to synthesize a desired measurement, using information from either a separate sensor or an internal calibration arrangement to determine the orientation of the sensor system. A general case is to compute the correlation between different pairs of E and B sensor data. This approach relies upon the fact that the predominant cause of E-field noise is the motion of airborne charged dust and particulates, while the predominant cause of B-field noise is the motion of the sensor itself due to seismic induced vibration or wind buffeting. These noise sources are not generally correlated in a time domain, and so they will not appear in a correlated output. This method is particularly effective when looking at electromagnetic transients (pulses in E and B) that are produced by some sources. The general expression for the correlation of two continuous time domain signals g and h is given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Corr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["g","h"],"mo":","}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"g","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c4","t"],"mo":"+"}}},{"mi":"h","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c4"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03c4"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}],"mo":"\u2261"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Corr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["g","h"],"mo":","}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"g","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c4"}},{"mi":"h","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c4"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03c4"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}],"mo":"\u2261"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Corr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["g","h"],"mo":","}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["g","k"]},{"mi":["h","k"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"\u2261"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"8.9em","height":"8.9ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"Corr","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["g","h"],"mo":","}}},"mo":"\u2261","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["g","k"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"msub":{"mi":["h","k"]},"mn":"1"}}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["g","k"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["h","k"],"mn":"2"}}}}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005-2","num":"00005.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mtext":"E.\u00a0\u00a0C.\u00a0\u00a0Ifeachor,\u00a0\u00a0B.\u00a0\u00a0W.\u00a0\u00a0Jervis,\u00a0\u00a0Digital\u00a0\u00a0Signal\u00a0\u00a0Processing: a practical \napproach, 1993,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0p.\u00a0\u00a0189 "}}}}]},"Another integrated electric and magnetic measurement according to the invention is to compute the coherence between the horizontal components of E (E, E) and B (B, B).

A vertical sensor is susceptible to increased wind induced noise in dependence upon the extent the sensor projects above the ground and, at least in many cases, burying the sensor is not practical. The benefit of taking the coherence between horizontal channels is that, at the high sensitivity provided by the invention, horizontal B-field sensors are limited at low frequency by geoatmospheric (GA) noise.

The core idea is to calculate the coherence between vertical B and horizontal E. Vertical B is generally limited by vibration-induced noise owing to the way and upright sensors couple to seismic ground motion, as well as the increased wind force in the event that the sensor protrudes above the ground. Ehas negligible vibration induced noise and so an algorithm that produces the coherence between Band Ewill have negligible vibration signals and so reduced noise.","The above-described control arrangements are particularly suited to primarily magnetic sources because such sources also generate horizontal and vertical electric fields via the electric currents they induce in the ground. Such sources can be either above ground or below ground. In some cases it is important to distinguish between a signal produced in the ground and a man-made signal produced remotely and traveling through the air. An example of this is to remove interference from above ground power lines from a measurement to locate a buried power cable.","A still further control arrangement according to the invention is to input a measurement of Einto a coherent canceling algorithm to remove above ground power line interference from horizontal E-field and\/or B-field data. This method relies on the fact that the electric field produced by an above ground source is predominantly only in the vertical direction due to the conductivity of the earth. Based on the above description, it should be appreciated that, in a multi-axis integrated electric and magnetic sensor system as described by the invention, one or more of the measurement arrangements described above can be employed simultaneously in parallel. In addition, the noise reduced data produced by one arrangement can be used as inputs to other control functions to provide further improvements.","As indicated above, the detected electric and magnetic field data can be separately stored and\/or outputted, or further processed by controller , such as combining the various data in the ways discussed above, in order to establish processed data outputs as represented in  at . In many practical situations, it is very desirable to be able to confirm that a sensor is operating at its intended performance level and has not been damaged or otherwise become compromised. Furthermore both electric and magnetic field sensors can be strongly affected by being placed in close proximity to natural objects. For example, if an E-field sensor is close to a large conducting object, the field in its local vicinity will be distorted. Another scenario is a change in the coupling efficiency at the sensor input. If the sensor is placed on uneven ground so that one E-field detection surface is much closer to the ground than the others, the effective capacitance of this sensor will be altered and the fraction of the free space field coupled into the sensor changed. Another such scenario concerns the presence of a film of water on the sensor might act to provide an impedance to ground at its input or a shorting impedance between two sensors. In the case of a B-field sensor such effects could occur if the sensor is located in close proximity to a highly permeable object, such as an iron plate in the ground, or very high permeability soil.","A preferred method to monitor these effects is to provide a means on the sensor to create local electric and\/or magnetic fields (represented by self-calibrating unit  in ). An electric field can be produced by a small conducting surface driven at a desired potential, and a magnetic field produced by a small coil wrapped about the body of the sensor and carrying a desired current. These surfaces and coils are made small enough so as to be integrated into the body of the sensor, and not be externally visible. In both cases, the frequency of the potential or current can be swept over a desired range to provide a measure of the frequency response of the sensor of interest. The conducting surfaces and coils are connected rigidly to the sensor so that their positions and couplings will not change under normal operating conditions.","The system calibration is established before use under controlled conditions. Once the sensor is placed in a desired position, the calibration routine can be run as desired to confirm that the sensor is still operational in that it measures the known generated fields. If an improper or no response is detected, it is immediately obvious. Moreover if a small frequency dependent deviation is observed from the expected response, then this deviation can be use to provide diagnostic information as to the source of the problem. In some case the measured data can be corrected by the modified response function to give a more accurate record of the field measured by the sensor.","Although described with reference to preferred embodiments of the invention, it should be readily understood that various changes and\/or modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit thereof. For instance, although the embodiments described above are directed to combination electric and magnetic field sensor systems, some benefits can be realized in connection with integrating a plurality of magnetic field sensors which can determine a vector field component of a magnetic field. In any case, the sensor system is compact in nature and highly sensitive, with the sensor system having a maximum dimension of less than 100 cm, the E-field sensors having sensitivities relative to their input in the range of about 1 mV\/Hzat 1 Hz and the B-field sensors having sensitivities of at least 5 pT\/Hzat 10 Hz and 0.4 pT\/Hzat 100 Hz. In another preferred embodiment, a higher B-field sensor sensitivity of 3 pT\/Hzat 10 Hz and 0.3 pT\/Hzat 100 Hz with a maximum dimension of less than 20 cm is achieved. In a still further embodiment, a very high B-field sensor sensitivity of 0.2 pT\/Hzat 10 Hz and 0.03 pT\/Hzat 100 Hz with a maximum lateral dimension of less than 50 cm is established. Each magnetic field sensor preferably also includes two or more magnetic induction sensors that contain high permeability cores, wherein the plurality of magnetic sensors are arranged to intersect at a lateral offset of less than 1 cm. In any case, the invention is only intended to be limited by the scope of the following claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
