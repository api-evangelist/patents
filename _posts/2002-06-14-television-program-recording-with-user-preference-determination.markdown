{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/096,592 filed on Jun. 12, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,614,987.","This invention relates generally to the field of recording of broadcast type television programs by viewers for subsequent viewing.","Currently, recording of television programs by individuals for viewing at a later time, is generally performed using commercially available Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs). Typically, a VCR may be either manually placed into a record mode or may be programmed to record a selected program at a later time. To program the VCR, the user either enters a date, time and channel of the program desired to be recorded, or enters an identification code of the desired program.","Viewers of television programming increasingly have more choices as to which programs to view. For example, cable television provides a dramatic increase in the number of channels available to a viewer in comparison to the channels available by way of a conventional television antenna. Digital satellite systems provide even more viewing choices. Digital broadcast of programs over cable television systems is expected to further increase the number of channels available to viewers.","One effect of the increase in the number of viewing choices is increased difficulty in deciding which programs to watch. People, particularly those with busy schedules, may not have the time to select and view programs to determine which programs they may or may not like. Programs that may otherwise be desirable to a viewer may never be watched if the program is broadcast at a time that is inconvenient for the viewer. User's may select certain programs for viewing to determine if they like the program. However, with several hundred program selections each week, this task can take a considerable amount of time and is likely to cause certain desirable programs to be overlooked.","It would therefore be desirable to have a system that automatically determines which programs to record based on user viewing preferences. Ideally, appropriate programs matching the user's viewing preferences could then be recorded, thus relieving the user from the task of selecting programs to record from among potentially hundreds of program selections.","In a principal aspect, the present invention determines viewing preferences of a user by monitoring programs viewed by the user and causes recording of programs corresponding to the user's preferences. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, apparatus for causing recordation of television programs comprises a preference agent for causing retrieval of attribute information corresponding to each television program viewed by a user of the apparatus. The preference agent generates classification information indicative of viewing preferences of the user as a function of the attribute information. A recording manager causes recordation and storage to a storage device of television programs having attribute information that matches the classification information.","Embodiments employing the principles of the present invention advantageously cause recordation of programs that match certain viewing habits of the viewer. Such embodiments therefore provide the viewer with stored programs that match certain viewing preferences of the user, which can be viewed at the viewer's leisure. The viewer is therefore relieved of the burden of deciding which programs from among several hundred possible programs to watch.","In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, programs may be recorded for storage in accordance with available capacity of the storage device. Moreover, programs may be deleted in response to selections by the user or based upon a priority, indicated by viewing preferences of the user, in which programs having lowest priority are deleted first to make room for newly recorded programs. The priority of programs may also be a function of time, in which more recently recorded programs are given higher priority.","In accordance with further aspects of the invention, determining which programs to record may also be a function of priority in which programs specified for recordation are given highest priority, followed by programs having attribute information corresponding to one or more user specified criteria, then followed by programs having attribute information corresponding to the recordation preference information.","In accordance with further aspects of the invention, the user specified requests may be in the form of a first type of request comprising information indicative of a specific program and a second type of request comprising specifications indicative of one or more programs having attribute information corresponding to the user's specifications.","In accordance with further aspects of the invention, the user may cause recordation of a currently broadcasted program being viewed by the user by causing generation of a pause input. This advantageously allows a user to interrupt viewing of a currently broadcasted program by recording the remainder of the program for subsequent viewing. Program viewing options may be presented to the user in the form of a menu that provides an easy to use interface for selection of programs and viewing and other options including play, pause, delete, fast-forward, rewind and so forth.","Preferably, the preference agent organizes the recordation preference information in the form of a database organized in accordance with categorization parameters. Programs may be received in either analog or digital formats. Programs stored in digital format are advantageously presented to the user in the form of additional channels. This allows the user to easily switch between programs (either recorded or broadcast) simply by switching channels.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention may be better understood by considering the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the course of this description, reference will frequently be made to the attached drawings.","In , a television control system  operates in accordance with the principles of the present invention to cause recordation of television programs in response to user inputs  and television signals . Television control system  transmits signals to a television monitor  for viewing by the user. Preferably, in digital embodiments, programs that are recorded by system  are presented to the user in the form of additional channels. Thus, the user can rapidly determine, by changing channels, the stored programs that are available for viewing. The user can also change channels between stored programs or between stored programs and currently broadcasted programs. If the user changes channels from a recorded program to another program, playback of the recorded program is preferably paused. Alternatively, whether the playback of the recorded program is paused or continued, is a user selectable option. As described further herein, the user may specify programs for recordation by specification of a particular program, or by specification of particular attributes of the program such as comedy\/drama, actor(s). When manually specifying programs for recordation, the user may specify that the program is to be recorded once or repeatedly, such as weekly, when broadcast.","Signals  include a first component  which contains the information necessary to display video and audio components of a television program on television monitor . Signals  preferably also include a second component  termed herein \u201cattribute information.\u201d An example of such attribute information  is the information available by way of the DVB-SI and ATSC-SI formats and various proprietary formats such as StarSight EPG Data and TVData available from StarSight Telecast, Inc., Fremont, Calif., and TVData, Glen Falls, N.Y., respectively.","Attribute information  for any particular program varies depending on the program type, but typically includes a plurality of categories such as start time for the program, duration of the program, the title of the program and other attributes (categories) of the program, together with an associated value corresponding to each of the categories. Preference agent  processes the attribute information  to generate \u201ccategory\u2014value\u201d pairs . For example, if an attribute for a program is duration, then the category may be duration and the value for that category may be 120 minutes. If the attribute for a program is title, then the category may be title and the value may be \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Other category\u2014value pairs for a movie may include a description category with a short description of the movie being the value, a primary actor category with the names of the primary stars of the movie being the values, a director category with the name of the director being the value, a theme category with the theme such as adventure, comedy being the value, and a ratings category with ratings by particular critics being the value. Category\u2014value pairs for a sports game, such as a football game, may include names of the teams who are playing, the location of the game, and the specific tournament, such as the play-offs, or Superbowl, etc.","The category\u2014value pairs  (preference information) are indicative of viewing preferences of the user. The data shown in  as being associated with the category\u2014value pairs  contains weighting information for the associated category value, in addition to other information shown by way of example further below. Preference agent  maintains the preference information  in the form of a preference database . Television programs  recorded by the system  are preferably stored separately together with the associated attribute information . In an alternative embodiment, the category value pairs  (with or without the associated values) are stored with the television programs  and the raw attribute information  is not maintained by the system .","Preference agent  generates, in response to user viewing habits, data for each category stored in preference database  and for each value of each category. The data generated by preference agent  for each category and value is preferably indicative of the amount of time that the particular category and\/or value is watched by the user relative to the total amount of time that the particular category and\/or value is available to be watched. The relative amount of time that a program is watched by a user is a convenient indication of the user's relative viewing preference. However, other indications of user viewing preferences may also be used. Program source switch  operates in response to user inputs  to select either presently broadcasted programs, by way of television signal  or stored programs from storage devices .","Recording manager  operates to cause recordation and storage of television programs  and attribute information  in accordance with information generated by preference agent  and stored in preference database . Recording manager  also responds to user requests to record particular programs and to user requests to record programs having specified category\u2014value pairs.","The signals transmitted to the monitor  preferably take a conventional analog form. Alternatively the signals transmitted to the monitor  maybe digitally encoded. The exact form of the signals transmitted to the monitor is not critical and may take a form as required by a particular monitor. The television signals  received by the television control system  may take one of a variety of signal formats including analog encoded signals that are encoded in accordance with the well known NTSC or PAL standards. Alternatively, the signals  may be digitally encoded in a manner as transmitted by commercially available digital satellite systems (DSS) or in accordance with the MPEG-2 (Motion Picture Expert Group-2) standard. In any given embodiment of television control system  the signal  may take a variety of the aforementioned forms. For example, television control system  may be coupled to receive inputs from a digital satellite system, the inputs being digitally encoded. The television control system  may also be coupled to receive inputs from a Community Antenna Television System (CATV) in which the signals are either encoded in analog or digital form. The television control system  may also be coupled to receive analog or digital signals from a conventional home antenna.","The attribute information  may be transmitted to the television control system  contemporaneously with the television program  in a variety of ways including industry standards, such as DVB-SI (Digital Video Broadcasting-Service Information) as defined by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETS), or the ATSC digital television standard as defined by the Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC). By way of example, in the DVB-SI protocol, programming for the next six hours is transmitted every eight seconds for each channel. As a further example, program information for the next seven days is available from the interactive on-screen TV program guide available from StarSight Telecast, Inc. Programming information further into the future, such as for the next seven days, may also be obtained in other ways. For example, by receiving the information in a time-multiplexed manner over a particular channel. Such information can easily be transmitted when the user is performing an action that does not require a moving video image on the screen, such as when the user has a control menu displayed on the screen.","Alternatively, television control system  can download the attribute information  separately from the television program  by way of a separate communication session via a modem or the Vertical Blanking Intervals (VBI) contained in television signals. Such separate communication sessions include data download mechanisms supported by the MPEG-2, DVB-SI and DSS protocols.","The attribute information  can take a form under the DVB-SI protocol as shown below:","event_id,","start_time.","duration,","DESCRIPTOR1,","DESCRIPTOR2,",". . .",". . .","DESCRIPTORn.","The event_id field is a unique alpha-numeric code assigned to a program.

In addition, seasonal or holiday programs may be indicated as being preferred during particular seasons or holidays. For example, programs involving summertime activities would be indicated as having higher weighting during the summer than at other times of the year.

The exact hardware and software platforms on which the television control system  is implemented is not important and may take a variety of forms. For example, television control system  may be implemented in a set-top box such as may typically used by individuals in the home to receive CATV signals. Another implementation of television control system  is in the form of a personal computer configured with the requisite hardware and software to receive and display television signals. An example of a set-top box that maybe programmed in accordance with the principles described herein is described in the following documents by IBM Microelectronics: \u201cSet-Top Box Solutions\u201d, Product # G522-0300-00 (Nov. 19, 1997); \u201cSet-Top Box Reference Design Kit\u201d, GK10-3098-00 (Apr. 15, 1998); \u201cSet-Top Box Peripheral Chip\u201d, GK10-3098-00, (Apr. 15, 1998); \u201cSet-Top Box Solutions: Helping Customers Meet the Challenges of Convergence\u201d, G522-0300-00 (Nov. 19, 1997); and \u201cThe challenges of convergence for Set-Top Box manufacturers\u201d, G522-0302-00 (Nov. 19, 1997). An example of an Application Programming Interface (API) available for set-top boxes which can serve as a platform for the embodiments described herein is described in \u201cAPI Requirements for the Advanced Set-Top Box\u201d published by OpenCable (Oct. 21, 1997). An example of an operating system incorporating functionality to support the embodiments described herein is available from OpenTV, Inc. and is described in the following Technical White Paper publications by OpenTV, Inc.: \u201cOpenTV\u2122 Operating Environment\u201d and \u201cApplication Development for OpenTV\u2122.\u201d An advantage of such an operating system is the support provided in the form of function calls to obtain attribute information  from the signals . Alternatively, a general purpose operating system such as the Windows NT operating system from Microsoft Corporation may be used in conjunction with additional software that provides the functions required to extract the necessary information from attribute information  and to perform other manipulation of the received signals  and the stored information .","Storage devices  may include a variety of different types of storage devices. For example preference database  may be stored in a non-volatile, random-access semiconductor memory. Television programs  and attribute information  may be stored on storage devices having greater capacity such as a conventional magnetic, hard disk drive. In general, storage devices  are understood to encompass a variety of storage devices. The exact form of the storage devices  is not critical so long as the storage devices have the capacity and speed to store the necessary information. Storage devices  may also comprise a conventional video cassette recorder (VCR) which operates under control of system  to store television programs  and attribute information  on conventional magnetic tape.","For the purposes of the present description, the television control system  is presumed to be integrated into, or coupled to, a system including a tuner and other functions necessary to receive television signals and to extract the attribute information  from the television signal and to perform other functions typically associated with the receipt and viewing of television signals. In certain embodiments, television control system  may operate in conjunction with a database agent that facilitates interaction with preference database  by causing storage and retrieval of information to or from the database in an optimal manner. The preference database  may be implemented by a commercially available database product such as the Oracle Light database product available from Oracle Corporation which also incorporates the functionality to implement the data base agent described above.","Recording manager  causes recording of programs  by periodically initiating a sequence of steps shown in . At , recording manager  sends a request to preference agent  for ratings of all programs at a particular time (X), or alternatively, for ratings of all programs within a particular time period (X). By way of example, the steps shown in  may be performed every six hours. In certain embodiments, the frequency with which the steps in  are performed may be changeable by the user. Preference agent  responds at step  by providing ratings, from preference database , for each program received from recording manager . Recording manager  then causes recordation of the programs at time X, or within time period X in accordance with the ratings received from preference agent . Specifically, programs having the highest rating are given highest preference for recordation and programs having the lowest rating are given lowest preference to recordation. The recordation is subject to storage capacity constraints. For example, if the highest rated program is one-hour long, and only thirty minutes of recording space is available on storage devices , then the one-hour program is skipped and the highest rated thirty-minute program is recorded.","Highest priority for recording of programs is given to programs specifically requested by the user. For example, if the user identifies a particular program for recording, such as by specifying the date, time and channel, or by specifying an identification code for the program, recordation of that program is given priority over programs rated by the preference agent. Next highest priority is given to programs matching particular category\u2014value pairs specified by the user. For example, if the user does not identify a particular program, but specifies that one-hour long documentaries pertaining to travel should be recorded, then recordation of programs matching such category\u2014value pairs is given priority over programs rated by the preference agent . In alternative embodiments, relative priority between user-specified programs, user-specified category\u2014value pairs and programs rated by the preference agent  is changeable by the user.","Recording manager  manages storage capacity on storage devices  by causing deletion of television programs  in accordance with ratings of such programs generated by preference agent . This is performed in a manner similar to that explained above for determining which programs to record. , which shows the steps taken by recording manager  to determine which programs to delete, is similar to . At step , recording manager  requests ratings from preference agent  of all programs stored on storage devices . At step , preference agent  responds by providing the requested deletion ratings. At step , recording manager  responds by causing deletion, when needed, of programs in accordance with the deletion ratings received from the preference agent . Specifically, when additional space on storage devices  is required to record one or more additional programs, recording manager  causes deletion, or overwriting of programs having the lowest rating first. Thus, stored television programs which are determined by preference agent  to be least preferable, in relation to other stored television programs, are deleted or replaced first, and those determined to be most preferable are deleted or replaced last. Deletion of programs occurs only when required. Advantageously, this results in storage device  typically being filled to maximum capacity, thus providing the user with as wide a variety of programs as possible. The user can specify programs that are to remain on the storage device . Such programs are not deleted by the recording system  in the steps shown in . In addition, the user can specify programs that are to be deleted, and therefore override the steps shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["110","105","400","402","404","406","116","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["406","500","104","502","116","504","116","504","502","116","508","116","510","508","512","514"]},"Availability statistics for programs currently being broadcast are updated by system  when the user is watching a currently broadcast program.
