title: Electonic processing of context-aware business events
abstract: Various embodiments of systems and methods for electronic processing of context-aware business events are described. According to one aspect, business events are enriched with more business semantics by encapsulating business contexts that define the events' producing environment. The produced context-aware events include a structure of context items describing with system and application parameters the producing environment when the events originally happened. During reconstruction of the structure of context items, the contextual business information is retrieved and can be included in the business events to provide the event consumer with more information about the business event.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field generally relates to the software arts, and, more specifically, to methods and systems for electronic processing of context-aware business events.","In computing, context awareness is related to the idea that the computers can be programmed to be aware of and react to their environment, or the environment of their users. Computing devices may have information about the circumstances under which they are able to operate and based on some rules, for example, can react accordingly. Context-aware devices may also try to make assumptions about the user's current situation. A context can be defined as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. Context-aware systems concern acquisition of a context (e.g., using sensors to perceive a situation), the abstraction and understanding of a context (e.g., matching a perceived sensory stimulus to a context), and application behavior based on the recognized context (e.g., triggering actions based on context).","Business applications today increasingly demand a sophisticated event framework to allow data being exchanged in real-time and asynchronous style. Even though many popular messaging framework implementations (such as standard JMS, ActiveMQ, IBM MQ, and so on) exist and message-oriented integration patterns (such as SOA, ESB, OSGI, etc.) are widely applied in practice, there is still a lack of effective models that allow events to be more consumable for end users. Many messages are effective for machine consumption but are difficult for a non-technical person to comprehend. Most events are generated by machines based on some business logic. Typically, events are produced close to source codes, but consumed close to human beings. This leads to gaps between event generation and consumption. Further, information carried by events is normally concise and abstract. It requires more information (i.e., context) to understand what has actually happened, especially when users read them in completely different setups (e.g., time, domain). Events are normally delivered to users and considered as an end node of the process. The next natural step is for users to investigate events and take actions. However, systems today do not provide users any information or navigation to start the investigations or take actions. The user has to depend on previous knowledge of the system.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for electronic processing of context-aware business events are described herein. In various embodiments, the method includes receiving a context-aware event comprising an event and a context associated with the event, wherein the context comprises a structural description of an environment in which the event was generated. The associated context is retrieved from the context-aware event. Then, the context associated with the event is reconstructed in order to reconstruct the environment of the event when the event was generated. Finally, context business information extracted from the reconstructed environment is provided in an enriched event.","In various embodiments, the system includes a processor and a memory in communication with the processor. According to one aspect, the memory includes an event consumption environment that receives a context-aware event that comprises a structural description of an environment in which the event was generated. The memory also includes at least one functional module in the event consumption environment that retrieves the context associated with the event from the context-aware event and reconstructs the context attached to the event to reconstruct the environment of the event when the event was produced. Additionally, an event consumer application is included that receives an enriched event with context business information extracted from the reconstructed environment.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for systems and methods for electronic processing of context-aware business events are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiment.","In various embodiments, methods and systems provide solution that extends the ultimate user experiences of consuming events and also offers a new perspective on how events can be effectively produced for a better consumption. A context-aware event is like a time capsule that does not only capture what happened to an event (e.g., event bodies), but also the environment in which the event took place. The environment in which the event took place is described in the context of the context-aware event. The context of the event is an abstraction of the environment when the event was produced. In a simple scenario, the environment is described by a set of extra dimensions such as system parameters and application parameters added to the classic events and thus generating context-aware events which contexts describe the situation (i.e., environment) that triggers the event. This can be beneficial when users try to reconstruct what has happened to the event by reconstructing the context, and hence the environment, of the event during consumption of the context-aware event. Even though there may be timestamps or even locations encoded in most events\/messages generated today, there is no effective mechanism that leads to producing a comprehensive view of the scenario. This becomes particularly true when events are business oriented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In various embodiments, this structured description including the system parameters or the application parameters is the context of the event. Model  illustrates the context  of an event . Context  includes a set of context items such as context item . The context items represent the system parameters or the application parameters. For example, the context of an event can be represented as a table structure, where each row in the table represents a context item with corresponding data. Context item  is a data element (a parameter) that encapsulates various metadata such as item data  and offers a unified data interface. Item data  is a data element that includes a set of data describing context item . For example, context item  is an application parameter of type \u201cemployee\u201d and item data  includes data \u201cJohn Adams\u201d, \u201csales and marketing\u201d, \u201c6 years\u201d describing the parameter type \u201cemployee\u201d with data such as name, organizational unit, and years worked in the company. The context item  and the item data  form a structural representation of the context  of event .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"As mentioned, the context of the event (the context items and item data) is an abstraction of the environment when the event was produced. In the current example, the set of item data, \u201cproduct\u201d, \u201cfinancial planning\u201d, and \u201cauto industry\u201d describes the environment of the event, this is, the event concerns a product in the financial planning area and more specifically the auto industry.","Further, another context item is included in code snippet . Context item of type \u201cKPI\u201d is described in the context of the event. Context item of type \u201cKPI\u201d is described with a set of item data including \u201cprofit KPI\u201d, \u201cfinancial planning\u201d, and \u201c20,000\u201d that describes the name, the data source, and the value data of the context item of type \u201cKPI\u201d. The context of the event, included in the message body of the message, may include a plurality of context items of different types, which organized structurally with their item data would describe the context of the event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["305","310","305","310","305","315","320","322","324","326","315"]},"When an event  happens in the system, the functional modules are the components that generate and produce the events. In various embodiments, the functional modules use application programming interfaces (APIs) to extract the context  of the event , when the event  occurred, during the generation of the context-aware events . The extracted context  includes a set of system parameters or application parameters, or a combination of system and application parameters that describe the context of the occurred event . The extracted context  is associated with the body of the event  and thus generates the context-aware event . In some embodiments, the event  may be a message and in that case the extracted context  is attached to the message body of the message. In event producing phase , events are produced from the functional modules of the execution environment , their contexts are extracted and attached to the bodies of the events generating context aware events. The context-aware events are handled by event framework . The event framework  provides the context-aware events to the consumption environment  for consumption.","Event consuming phase  includes the components and methods for consuming the context-aware events produced by a processing engine or the application. Event consuming phase  includes a consumption environment , which is a runtime environment of a system that consumes the context-aware events. The consumption environment  includes a set of user interfaces, APIs, and a set of functional modules, such as functional modules , , , that consume the context-aware events. In some embodiments, the consumption of the context-aware events may be performed by a process engine as part of a process such as a workflow that may trigger other workflows. In other embodiments, the consumption of the context-aware events is performed first by the application receiving the context-aware events (e.g., event consumer application ) and then optionally by users of the system. For example, a message (e.g., event) is sent to an e-mail managing program. The message includes context-aware information in the message body, meaning that the message body provides information about the occurred event. This information can be presented as text, graphical images, additional links, attached playable videos, and so on. In some scenarios, the e-mail managing program can scan the message body, retrieve the context information of the message and based on the context information may decide to forward the message to other recipients, to move it to a specific folder (e.g., based on some predefined rules), or perform some other task. Thus, the e-mail managing program will trigger another process in the system to perform the task and may produce another context-aware event. In other embodiments, the e-mail managing program may simply put the message in the inbox and let the recipient of the message look at the message personally and retrieve context information if needed. Some of the context information may be fully presented in the message body and some of the context information may be included as clickable links, attached documents and files, and so on. The recipient may decide if he or she wants to retrieve further context information about the message by clicking the links, opening the attached files, and so on.","In various embodiments, providing and presenting the context information included in an event involves reconstructing the context. The reconstruction of the context is performed by the functional modules of the consumption environment . The event framework  provides the context-aware events to the consumption environment , where the functional modules (e.g., the e-mail managing program) reconstruct the context of the event to retrieve the business information (e.g., context environment data) captured when the event occurred. This information is then presented to the user for better understanding of the occurred event and for possible decision making.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},"In various embodiments, event producer  (e.g., functional module ) sends a request to the execution environment  to extract the business context information (or just \u201ccontext\u201d) of the system and application environment when an event is produced. The context includes business information structured semantically in a set of context items with a set of item data. The structured context represents the system parameters and the application parameters of the system and the application environment when the event is produced. The execution environment  extracts the context  and returns it to the event producer . The event producer  generates a context-aware event based on the occurred event  and the extracted context attached to the occurred event. Then, the event producer  publishes the generated context-aware event to the event framework .","For example, a new employee is hired in a company. New employee business data such as contact information, position, department, picture, and so on is received in a human resources (HR) system. The HR system includes a set of APIs, user interfaces, applications, functional modules, and so on. The received business information may trigger an event in the HR system to create and entry in the system for the new employee. The functional modules of the HR system will then extract the business information that forms the environment of the event, will generate a context for the event, a structure of parameters that describe the business information, attach that generated context to the event and thus will produce a context-aware event.","The event framework  delivers the context-aware event to the consumption environment . In that way, the consumption environment  retrieves the context  of the event . The functional modules of the consumption environment  (e.g. functional module ) reconstruct the context  of the received context-aware event. Reconstructing the context  of the context aware event means to retrieve the structure of the context and its components, these are, the context items and the item data describing the business information of context . Depending on the needs and requirements of the functional modules of the consumption environment , the whole structure or just some parts of the structure can be reconstructed. The context of the event is uniquely identified, thus the full context can be reconstructed at any later stage, that is, it depends on the consumption strategy of the event when to expand the context and how much to add to it. Once the context identifier is kept, then this can be a number of times and add more extensive information as required.","In some embodiments, the consumption environment  may reconstruct at least a portion of the structure of the context and include the retrieved business information from the context in an enriched event and send it to the event consumer application . Following the example above with the HR system and the new employee, the HR system may receive a request to send an e-mail to all employees in the company and notify them about the new colleague. The HR system will retrieve the context with the structured business information stored about the new employee. The functional modules of the HR system will reconstruct the context to get the structure including the business information such as contact information, position, department, picture, and so on. Then, the functional modules will send an enriched e-mail including the retrieved data from the reconstructed structure of the context.","In other embodiments, the consumption environment  may reconstruct at least a portion of the structure of the context, include it in an enriched event, and provide the event consumer application  with an option to further request additional context business information. In that case, upon an additional request, the consumption environment  will reconstruct a second portion of the structure of the context including additional context items and item data and will provide that second portion of the structure to the event consumer application . In the example described above this means that the e-mail message that the HR system will send to all employees of the company will include just some data of the new employee such as name and e-mail address and will also include some links for additional information if needed. When a user clicks on a link in that e-mail, the messaging system will request this additional information from the HR system. The HR system will further reconstruct the context of the business information and provide the requested data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"A normal workflow includes the following acts: 1) investigate the event; 2) collect related information to help understand what has happened, find related documents, perform some application actions, or contact the related parties for more information, and sometimes just simply check if anything has happened in the past related to this event; 3) repeat Act 2 until the background of the event is clarified and fully analyzed; and 4) based on the collected information and analysis, make a decision on how to proceed. In various embodiments, an improved workflow includes the following steps: 1) investigate the event; 2) use the context built in the event to collect related business information; and 3) evaluate the related business information promoted by the application to make the appropriate decisions.","Process  illustrates the steps of the method for consuming context-aware events. At block , a context-aware event is received at the event consumption environment. The context-aware event includes an event that has already with an attached context that structurally describes the environment in which the event happened. In various embodiments, the context includes a structure of a set of context items, where a context item includes at least one item data. The context items represent system and application parameters of the environment when the event happened. The context-aware event is delivered from the event framework  to the consumption environment , where the context-aware event is consumed. At block , the context is retrieved from the context-aware event by the functional modules of the consumption environment .","At block , the retrieved context is reconstructed. The reconstruction of the context represents reconstructing the environment in which the event was produced. In response to reconstructing the context of the event, the structure of the set of context items and item data is obtained. This structure describes the context business information (the system and application parameters) of the producing environment of the event. At block , at least a portion of the context business information is provided in the body part of an enriched event to the event consumer application . At block , related additional context business information is provided upon a request from the event consumer application . When the enriched event is delivered to event consumer application  for consumption, the enriched information (supported by context) can be pulled from the system to provide extra data. For example, related files, documents can be obtained when the event consumer s are browsing the content of the events. In various embodiments, the additional context business information may be provided directly in the body of the same enriched event or in another enriched event body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A","b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["610","620"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["630","620","640"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 6C","b":["650","650","640","640"]},"In various embodiments, business events can be enriched with more business semantics by encapsulating business context that defines the events' triggering environment. Context-aware events enable business events to be consumed in an enhanced user consumption mode. Users are able to explore events by navigating the context such as OLAP dimensions and members. Context-aware events can be presented and analyzed using different dimensions (such as, time, priority, etc.) by leveraging the real business semantics that are captured by the contexts of the events.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions.
