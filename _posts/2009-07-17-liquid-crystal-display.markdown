{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a National Stage Entry of International Application No. PCT\/KR2009\/003965, filed Jul. 17, 2009, and claims the benefit of Korean Application Nos. 10-2008-0070101, filed on Jul. 18, 2008, and 10-2009-0046489, filed on May 27, 2009, which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display.","A liquid crystal display is a device displaying a picture by inserting liquid crystals two sheets of thin transparent substrates. In the liquid crystal display, liquid crystals change their molecular arrangement as voltage is applied via electrodes connected thereto, so that light transmission may be varied to display a picture or a color. The liquid crystal display has advantages of being low power consumption and being capable of sheeting it flat, and thus is now in the limelight of various fields.","The liquid crystal display may be classified into electrical driving scheme and optical driving scheme according to a driving scheme. A representative example of the optical driving scheme is SLM (spatial light modulator), in which the liquid crystal display is controlled by optical signals.","Meanwhile, the electrical driving scheme may be classified into passive matrix type and active matrix type depending on the presence of active elements on driving pixel electrodes.","The passive matrix type may be classified into TN-LCD (twisted nematic-LCD), STN (super twisted nematic-LCD), F-LCD (ferroelectic-LCD) and PD-LCD (polymer dispersed-LCD), according to types of liquid crystals, and the active matrix type may be classified into two terminal type and tree terminal type, according to number of terminals.","In addition, the above two terminal type generally uses MIM (metal-insulator-metal) type or diode type, and the tree terminal type generally uses thin film transistors.","The active matrix liquid crystal display has a color filter substrate (upper transparent substrate), on which common electrodes are formed; an array substrate (bottom transparent substrate), on which pixel electrode are formed; and a liquid crystal panel comprising liquid crystals interposed between said two substrates. This display is such a type that the common electrodes and the pixel electrodes drive liquid crystals by electric field applied up and down, and has excellent transmittance, aperture ratio, resolution and capability for representing moving images.","Meanwhile, to improve viewing angle characteristics, some liquid crystal displays, such as multi-domain liquid crystal display, compensation film liquid crystal display, vertical alignment liquid crystal display (VA-LCD) and in-plane switching liquid crystal display (IPS-LCD), have been developed.","The IPS mode of the above displays is suitable to large area displays such as monitors, and has an advantage that all viewing angles are wide in the left, right, top and bottom directions.","In this IPS mode, a liquid crystal panel has the upper substrate of a color filter substrate and the bottom substrate of an array substrate, which are apart from each other, and opposite to each other, and has a liquid crystal layer interposed between said upper and bottom substrates. On said upper substrate, a black matrix is formed, which serves to interrupt light leakage, in a form of matrix, and red, green and blue layers are formed, sequentially and repeatedly, at regions corresponding to pixel regions, respectively, and an overcoat layer is usually formed thereon. On said bottom substrate, common electrodes and pixel electrodes are formed, whereby the liquid crystal layer operates by horizontal electrical field with the common electrodes and the pixel electrodes.","Generally, said various liquid crystal displays have a structure as represented in . Specifically, the liquid crystal display has a liquid crystal panel comprising a liquid crystal layer () and the upper and bottom substrates (for example, a glass substrate such as a color filter substrate and an array substrate) (-, -), and also comprises the upper polarizer () formed on the upper part of said liquid crystal panel and the bottom polarizer (not represented therein) formed on the bottom part thereof.","A polarizing film (or polarizing element) (-) included in the upper or bottom polarizer comprises a iodine-based compound or a dichroic polarizing material arranged in certain direction, and protective films (-, -) for protecting the polarizing film are formed on the upper part and the bottom part. In addition, additionally functional films such as an antireflective film (-) may be formed on the polarizer.","Such a polarizer is usually attached to a liquid crystal panel via a pressure sensitive adhesive (b). Here, said upper polarizer () is not directly attached to the liquid crystal panel, but following first forming an ITO thin film (a) thereon, it is attached thereto.","The reason for forming the ITO thin film (a) between the liquid crystal panel and the upper polarizer is to solve problems such as malfunction of devices or stains by static electricity generated in procedures of preparing or using liquid crystal displays.","That is, much static electricity is often generated in a process of peeling off a release film on a pressure sensitive adhesive of the polarizer, to attach it to the outside surface of the liquid crystal panel, and also preparation or use procedures. Such generated static electricity affects arrangement of the liquid crystal layer to deteriorate quality of products or induce malfunction of devices. Therefore, to prevent this problem, static electricity is prevented by forming the ITO layer via vapor deposition processes using sputtering equipments and attaching the polarizer on the upper part of such formed ITO layer.","Demand for preventing such static electricity is important, particularly, in the above described IPS-LCD. That is, as both of pixel electrodes and common electrodes in the IPS liquid crystal panel are formed on only the array substrate of the bottom substrate, static electricity generation is particularly problematic in a process of attaching the polarizer to the outside surface of the upper substrate (color filter substrate).","However, with regard to said ITO, there are concerns about demand and supply difficulty and cost increase, and the like, due to depletion of raw materials in future. In addition, since equipments for vapor depositing ITO thin films are expensive, there is a problem that the unit cost of production increases.","Therefore, such an alternative that the ITO layer is not totally formed on the liquid crystal panel, but partially formed thereon, is practiced. Ultimately, it is required to develop techniques being capable to obtain the desired antistatic performance without using said ITO layer.","The present invention is intended to provide a liquid crystal display which may solve problems such as malfunction of devices and generation of electrostatic stains by static electricity and has excellent physical properties such as endurance reliability under high temperature or high humidity condition and optical characteristics.","The present invention provides, as means for solving said problem, a liquid crystal display comprising a liquid crystal panel provided with a liquid crystal layer formed between the upper substrate and the bottom substrate; a conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer directly formed on the upper substrate of said liquid crystal panel; and a polarizer formed on said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer,","wherein said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer has a surface resistance of 9.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less.","The present invention may provide a polarizer which may prevent malfunction of devices by static electricity generated in preparation or use procedures or electrostatic stains, and the like, even without using the ITO layer generally formed between the upper substrate and a polarizer in a liquid crystal panel for an antistatic purpose, and has excellent physical properties such as endurance reliability under high temperature or high humidity condition and optical characteristics, and a liquid crystal display thereof.","The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display comprising a liquid crystal panel including a liquid crystal layer formed between the upper substrate and the bottom substrate; a conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer directly formed on the upper substrate of said liquid crystal panel; and a polarizer formed on said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer,","said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer having a surface resistance of 9.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less.","The liquid crystal display of the present invention is described in more detail below.","As shown in , the present invention is characterized in that a conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer (b) is directly formed on the upper substrate (for example, color filter substrate) (-) and a polarizer is attached thereto. The term \u201cthe conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer directly formed on the upper substrate\u201d as used herein refers to a case in which a polarizer is directly attached, via a conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer, onto the upper substrate of a liquid crystal panel on which a conductive layer such as an ITO layer for antistatic purpose is not formed over the entire surface. The present invention may provide a liquid crystal display solving problems such as malfunction of devices by static electricity generated in preparation or use procedures and generation of electrostatic stains and having excellent physical properties such as endurance reliability under high temperature or high humidity condition and optical characteristics, by giving a pressure sensitive adhesive layer (b) used in attaching the upper substrate (-) of a liquid crystal panel and a polarizer () the optimum antistatic properties, without forming the ITO layer essentially used in the conventional liquid crystal displays.","A liquid crystal panel included in the present liquid crystal display is not particularly limited to any kind. For example, various passive matrix scheme, active matrix scheme, IPS mode and VA mode liquid crystal panels may be used, without limiting any kind. Preferably, an IPS mode liquid crystal panel may be used. In the IPS mode liquid crystal panel, both of common electrode and pixel electrode are formed on the bottom substrate of the panel, so that static electricity especially causes a problem in a process of attaching the polarizer, and the like. However, the present invention may provide a liquid crystal display having physical properties such as viewing angle characteristics, endurance reliability and optical characteristics by solving various problems due to static electricity without forming the ITO layer.","The conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer (b) herein is directly formed on the upper substrate (-) which is included in the liquid crystal panel as above and has no ITO layer formed on the upper part, and the upper polarizer () is directly attached thereto via the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer. Here, the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer directly formed on said upper substrate (-) may have a surface resistance of 9.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less, preferably 7.0\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less. If the surface resistance of the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer is in excess of 9.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1, it is apprehended that the antistatic performance will be lowered. The lower limit of surface resistance of said pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein is not particularly limited, and may be controlled in a range of, for example, 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or more, preferably more than 9.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1. If the surface resistance in the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer is set extremely low, it is apprehended that physical properties such as endurance reliability and optical characteristics of liquid crystal displays will be deteriorated due to increase of antistatic amounts included in the pressure sensitive adhesive layer.","Said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein may have the gel content, represented in the following Equation 1, of 5% to 95%, preferably 30% to 95%, more preferably 40% to 95%, and most preferably 60% to 85%.\n\nGel Content(%)=100\u2003\u2003[Equation 1]\n","wherein, A represents weight of said conductive pressure sensitive adhesive, and B represents dry weight of undissolved conductive pressure sensitive adhesive after immersing it in ethyl acetate at room temperature for 72 hours.","The term \u201cdry weight\u201d used herein refers to a weight of undissolved conductinve pressure-sensitive adhesive itself obtained by drying the immersed conductinve pressure-sensitive adhesive in a suitable condition after the aforementioned immersing process in order to remove ethyl acetate ingredient included therein. Here, the drying condition for removing ethyl acetate is not particularly limited, as long as drying is carried out to be capable of removing ethyl acetate included in the immersed conductinve pressure-sensitive adhesive.","If the gel content of the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein is less than 5%, it is apprehended that endurance reliability will be lowered, such that bubbles are generated in high temperature or high humidity condition. If it is in excess of 95%, it is apprehended that peeling or looseness phenomenon, and the like will be caused in high temperature or high humidity condition.","The components comprised in the conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein are not particularly limited, as long as the surface resistance complies with the aforementioned range. For example, as said pressure sensitive adhesive layer herein, a cured product of a composition comprising a pressure sensitive base resin and an antistatic agent may be used.","Without particularly limiting any kind of the pressure sensitive base resin herein, preferably, a base resin having a weight average molecular weight (M) of 500,000 to 2,500,000, preferably 800,000 to 2,000,000 may be used. If the weight average molecular weight of said resin is less than 500,000, it is apprehended that endurance reliability will be lowered, such that bubbles or peeling phenomenon is caused in high temperature or high humidity condition. If it is in excess of 2,500,000, the adherence property will be lowered.","Preferably, said base resin used herein also may have a glass transition temperature of \u221260\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C. If the glass transition temperature of the base resin herein is less than \u221260\u00b0 C., it is apprehended that elastic modulus of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer will be extremely lowered. If it is in excess of 15\u00b0 C., it is apprehended that endurance reliability of the liquid crystal display will be lowered due to decrease of adherence.","For example, as the above base resin herein, a polymer of a monomer mixture comprising 90 parts by weight to 99.9 parts by weight of (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer; and 0.01 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight of a crosslinkable monomer may be used.","Without particularly limiting any kind of the (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer included in the monomeric mixture herein, for example, alkyl (meth)acrylate may be used. If the alkyl group included in the monomer has much long chain, cohesive attraction of the pressure sensitive adhesive is lowered and glass transition temperature (T) and adherence are hard to control. Therefore, it is preferred to use alkyl(meth)acrylate having an alkyl group of 1 to 14 carbon atoms. Examples of such a monomer herein may include methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-propyl(meth)acrylate, isopropyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl(meth)acrylate, sec-butyl(meth)acrylate, pentyl(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylbutyl(meth)acrylate, n-octyl(meth)acrylate, isooctyl(meth)acrylate, isononyl(meth)acrylate, lauryl(meth)acrylate and tetradecyl (meth)acrylate and use alone or in combination of two or more species thereof. It is preferred that such a (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer in the monomeric mixture is included in an amount of 90 parts by weight to 99.9 parts by weight, relative to the aforementioned crosslinkable monomer. If said amount is less than 90 parts by weight, it is apprehended that the initial bond strength of the pressure sensitive adhesive will be lowered. If it is in excess of 99.9 parts by weight, it is apprehended that a problem with durability will occur due to decrease of cohesive attraction.","The crosslinkable monomer herein may give the pressure sensitive adhesive cohesive attraction and serve to control adhesive strength and endurance reliability, and the like under high temperature or high humidity condition. Examples of such a crosslinkable monomer may include one or two or more of a monomer containing a hydroxyl group, a monomer containing a carboxyl group and a monomer containing nitrogen. Examples of said monomer containing a hydroxy group may include one or two or more of 2-hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 6-hydroxyhexyl(meth)acrylate, 8-hydroxyoctyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxyethylene glycol (meth)acrylate or 2-hydroxypropylene glycol (meth)acrylate, examples of the monomer containing a carboxyl group may include one or two or more of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 2-(meth)acryloyloxy acetic acid, 3-(meth)acryloyloxy propionate, 4-(meth)acryloyloxy butyrate, acrylic acid dimmer, itaconic acid, maleic acid or maleic anhydride, and examples of the monomer containing nitrogen may include one or two or more of (meth)acrylamide, N-vinyl pyrrolidone or N-vinylcaprolactam, but each is not limited thereto. Here, each may be used alone or in combination of two or more species thereof.","In the monomer mixture, said crosslinkable monomer may be included in an amount of 0.01 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight, relative to the aforementioned (meth)acrylic acid ester monomer. If said amount is less than 0.01 parts by weight, it is apprehended that endurance reliability of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer will be lowered. If it is in excess of 10 parts by weight, it is apprehended that adherence or peeling strength will be lowered.","Said monomer mixture herein may further comprise a compound represented by the following Formula 1. Said compound may be added to give the pressure sensitive adhesive control of glass transition temperature and other functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"14.99mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09383481-20160705-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein, Rto Reach represent independently hydrogen or alkyl, and Rrepresents cyano; phenyl unsubstituted or substituted with alkyl; acetyloxy; or COR, where Rrepresents a glycidyloxy or amino unsubstituted or substituted with alkyl or alkoxyalkyl.","In definitions of Rto Rof said formula, alkyl or alkoxy means alkyl or alkoxy having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and is, preferably, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy.","Specific examples of said compound of Formula 1 may include one or two or more of a monomer containing nitrogen such as (meth)acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylamide, N-methyl(meth)acrylamide or N-butoxymethyl(meth)acrylamide; styrene monomer such as styrene or methyl styrene; glycidyl(meth)acrylate; or carbonic acid vinyl ester such as vinyl acetate, but are not limited thereto. When the above compound is included in the monomer mixture, its amount is, preferably, 20 parts by weight or less, relative to (meth)acryl ester monomer or crosslinkable monomer.

Endurance Reliability Evaluation","The prepared pressure sensitive adhesive polarizer was tailored in a size of 262 mm\u00d7465 mm (width\u00d7length) to prepare a sample. Then, the sample was attached to both sides of a glass substrate (300 mm\u00d7470 mm\u00d70.7 mm=width\u00d7length\u00d7height) in a state that optical absorption axes are crossed to prepare a specimen. The applied pressure on attaching was about 5 kg\/cm, and the attaching work was carried out in a clean room, so that bubbles or foreign materials were not caused. To examine moisture-heat resistance of the prepared specimen, said specimen was hold under a condition at a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. and a relative humidity of 90% for 1,000 hours, followed by observing whether or not bubbling or peeling was caused. Further, for thermal resistance, the specimen was hold at a temperature of 80\u00b0 C. for 1,000 hours, followed by observing whether or not bubbling or peeling was caused. Here, just prior to evaluating the specimen state, the specimen was hold at room temperature for 24 hours and evaluated. The evaluation standards were as follows.\n\n","It was observed whether or not electrostatic stains were caused, on or after a polarizer, on which the pressure sensitive adhesive layer was coated, was attached to a liquid crystal cell (32 inches) in a size of 32 inches (400 mm\u00d7708 mm) Specifically, when said polarizer, in which the releasing film was peeled off, was attached to the liquid crystal cell, it was observed with the naked eye using a backlight Whether or not electrostatic stains (whitening phenomenon) were caused.","In addition, the liquid crystal cell, to which the polarizer was attached, was fixed to a module provided with a backlight. Then, while an ion gun (+20 kv, \u221225 kv) was scanned by 25 cycles per second under the drive state, it was observed with the naked eye whether or not electrostatic stains (whitening phenomenon) were caused.","Here, the evaluation standards were as follows.","On Releasing the Release Film","\u25ef: no causing electrostatic stains.","X: electrostatic stains are caused and do not disappear for several seconds or more.","Application of Ion Gun","\u229a: electrostatic stains disappear within one second.","\u25ef: electrostatic stains disappear within 3 seconds.","X: electrostatic stains do not disappear for 3 seconds or more.","The measuring results as above were represented in the following table 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0152"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Endurance","Electrostatic stain"]},{"entry":[{},"reliability","(R.T.\/heat res.\/"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"60\u00b0 C.\/","moisture-heat res.)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"80\u00b0 C.\/","90% R.H.\/","On Releasing","On Scanning"]},{"entry":[{},"1000 hours","1000 hours","Release Film","Ion Gun"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Exam. 1","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u25ef"]},{"entry":["Exam. 2","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u229a"]},{"entry":["Exam. 3","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u229a"]},{"entry":["Exam. 4","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u25ef","\u25ef"]},{"entry":["C.
