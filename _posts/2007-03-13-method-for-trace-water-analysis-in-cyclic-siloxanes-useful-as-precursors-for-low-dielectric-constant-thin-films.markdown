No. 10\/107,885 filed Mar. 27, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,571 in the names of Alexander S. Borovik, Ziyun Wang, Chongying Xu and Thomas H. Baum for \u201cMETHOD FOR TRACE WATER ANALYSIS IN CYCLIC SILOXANES USEFUL AS PRECURSORS FOR LOW DIELECTRIC CONSTANT THIN FILMS,\u201d issued Mar. 13, 2007 as U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,571. The disclosure of said U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/107,885 is hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety. Priority is claimed under the provisions of 35 USC 120.","The present invention relates generally to a method for measuring the water content in siloxanes, particularly, cyclic siloxanes, such as tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS) useful as precursors to low dielectric constant thin films.","As the need for integrated circuits for semiconductor devices having higher performance and greater functionality increases, device feature geometries continue to decrease. As device geometries become smaller, the dielectric constant of an insulating material used between conducting paths becomes an increasingly important factor in device performance.","As device dimensions shrink to less than 0.25 \u03bcm, propagation delay, cross-talk noise and power dissipation due to resistance-capacitance (RC) coupling become significant due to increased wiring capacitance, especially interline capacitance between the metal lines on the same level. These factors all depend critically on the dielectric constant of the separating insulator or inter-layer dielectric (ILD).","The use of low dielectric constant (k) materials advantageously lowers power consumption, reduces cross talk, and shortens signal delay for closely spaced conductors through the reduction of both nodal and interconnect line capacitances. Dielectric materials that exhibit low dielectric constants are critical in the development path toward faster and more power efficient microelectronics.","Alkyl silanes, alkoxy silanes and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) and other materials comprised mainly of Si, C, O and H (SiCOH) are being evaluated aggressively for obtaining low dielectric constant (k) thin-films as interlayer dielectrics in an integrated circuit by a PECVD approach. The resulting films formed when using these precursors give dense SiCOH containing films, having dielectric constants in the range of from about 2.4 to 3.2.","Introducing porosity to the low-dielectric constant SiCOH films may serve to further lower the dielectric constant to values below 2.5.","One particular class of precursors, cyclosiloxanes, (i.e. 2,4,6,8-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS)) is being considered as a source material for the deposition of low dielectric constant (k) thin-films used as interlayer dielectrics in an integrated circuit. Cyclosiloxanes provide a thin film having an open crystal structures or cage structure (e.g. Mantz et al., \u201cThermolysis of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS) Macromers and POSS-Siloxane Copolymers\u201d, Chem. Mater., 1996, 8, 1250-1259). PECVD of thin films from such precursors results in open areas in the structure, which leads to low packing density and hence low k values.","Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the thin film deposition method of choice for large-scale fabrication of microelectronic device structures, and the semiconductor manufacturing industry has extensive expertise in its use.","The purification and reproducible delivery of cyclosiloxanes for CVD is extremely critical for full-scale commercialization of the thin-film process. At present the PECVD deposition process is suffering from irreproducible delivery due to polymerization of TMCTS within the delivery lines and process hardware. Questions related to the purification of TMCTS and elimination of the polymerization must be considered. The exact polymerization mechanism is presently not known. However, studies by the inventors of the instant invention indicate that catalytic polymerization of siloxanes occurs in the presence of water\/moisture, acids and bases. Accordingly, there is a need in the art to reduce water content as well as other catalytic species from siloxanes, providing improved purity, stability and utility.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/015,326, filed on Dec. 31, 2001 discloses a novel method for reducing water levels in cyclic siloxanes to levels as low as 2 ppm, by drying the material through physical absorption methods and\/or azeotropic distillation. However, despite such efforts, a reliable method for the trace water analysis of cyclic siloxanes is not known.","Karl Fischer titration, a commonly used, quality control method for water analysis, fails to deliver accurate measurements of water for cyclosiloxane materials, as the Karl Fischer reagents are not compatible with many cyclosiloxanes. For example, Karl Fischer reagents based on the following redox reaction:\n\nSO+I+2HO\u2192HSO+2HI\u2003\u2003(1)\n","However, in the case of cyclosiloxanes, the Ireacts with the Si\u2014H groups to give a false positive, according to the following mechanism (shown with tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"33.53mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US07439318-20081021-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy, another commonly used analytical technique for measuring water concentrations in many chemicals has detection limits of greater than 40 ppm. As the acceptable water concentration for cyclic siloxanes may be on the order of less than 10 ppm, FTIR could not support such a measurement.","Gas Chromatography (GC) another commonly used analytical technique, reliably and accurately detects concentrations of volatile organics to levels of less than 5 ppm, by a vapor phase\/substrate separation process in a capillary column. However, GC columns available for measurement of trace water fail to meet the same detection standards as for organic molecules, rendering the technique unacceptable for trace water measurements in cyclosiloxanes.","Accordingly, there is a need for an analytical method, which allows for the determination of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials.","Therefore, it is one objective of the present invention to develop an analytical technique for the measurement of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials.","It is a further objective of the present invention to develop an analytical technique for the accurate and precise measurement of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials having detection limits as low as 1 ppm.","It is a further objective of the present invention, to develop a method for the production of super dry cyclosiloxanes, which includes a means by which to efficiently and accurately measure the water content of the super dry cyclic siloxane material.","The present invention relates to the accurate and precise measurement of water concentration in chemical materials requiring trace water analysis.

The amount of hexafluoroacetone used should be in stoichiometric excess of the approximate concentration of water in the chemical reagent and such amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The hexafluoroacetone will react stoichiometrically with water (1:1), while excess hexafluoroacetone, which eludes separately and distinctly from the water derivative of the hexafluoroacetone, ensures that all water molecules in the sample to be measured are converted to the water derivative of the HFA.","In a preferred embodiment, HFA is injected by means of a gas tight syringe into a sample comprising at least a cyclosiloxane compound and trace water. The amount of hexafluoroacetone used is in stoichiometric excess of the approximate concentration of water in the chemical reagent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In the CVD process, a precursor is delivered to a CVD reactor in vapor form. In the case of solids and liquids, this requires heating of the delivery lines, CVD chamber and substrate. It is speculated that cyclosiloxanes, particularly TMCTS, prematurely polymerize in the heated delivery lines due to the presence of trace water in the raw cyclosiloxane material, through a ring opening mechanism. Trace acids and\/or bases, which may be present in the CVD process, further accelerate the ring opening mechanism.","In current CVD processes, COand ammonia (NH) are used as reactant gases when depositing low dielectric thin films from cyclosiloxanes, particularly TMCTS. If the TMCTS is wet, CObecomes HCO, which is a fairly strong acid, and ammonia becomes NHOH, which is a fairly strong base. As acids and bases promote TMCTS polymerization in the delivery tubes of the CVD apparatus, leading to delivery line plugging problems, it is necessary to use dry TMCTS. Accordingly, the instant invention provides a much-needed process for accurately measuring the water concentration in cyclosiloxane materials. (See applicants' currently pending application Ser. No. 10\/015,326 entitled \u201cMethod for Removal of Impurities in Cyclic Siloxanes Useful as Precursors for Low Dielectric Constant Thin Films\u201d)","To determine whether water played a significant role in the polymerization of the TMCTS, the inventors of the instant invention developed a control experiment using H NMR to study such affects. , shows a H NMR spectrum of a commercial sample of raw TMCTS in CDhaving a water content of approximately 125 ppm.

The sample used in  was distilled at 140\u00b0 C. for 20 hours. As shown by , a very small peak (less than 5%) at the position of the polymer resonances indicates formation of the polymer. Thus indicating the need for a highly efficient method for removing water from cyclosiloxane materials as well as the need for an analytical technique for measuring trace water concentrations. , shows a H NMR spectrum of a TMCTS sample after drying over CaH, followed by distillation according to one embodiment of the present invention. The sample having approximately 10 ppm of water shows no signs of polymerization.","U.S. patent application Ser.

As cyclosiloxanes are foreseen by the semiconductor industry as viable candidates for the development and implementation of new low-dielectric constant materials, it is imperative that methods are available to purify and characterize such materials.","Gas chromatography (GC) is a standard technique used in many laboratories and industrial facilities and is useful in analyzing mixtures of volatile substances. Gas chromatographs may be used alone, with various detectors such as flame ionization detector, thermionic emission detector, photo ionization detector, electron capture detector (ECD) and others, or with a mass spectrometer as a detector. In such applications, a gas chromatography (GC) column separates sample components from a sample mixture. In such an application, the gas chromatography (GC) column separates the sample components from the sample mixture and the mass spectrometer analyzes and quantifies the sample components.","By converting water to a volatile organic compound through derivatization, the inventors of the instant invention have developed an accurate and precise means by which to measure water in cyclosiloxane materials to levels as low as \u22661 ppm.","In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to an analytical technique for the accurate and precise measurement of trace water in cyclosiloxane materials comprising:\n\n","In one embodiment, the cyclosiloxane material comprises the formula [R R\u2032Si\u2014O]wherein each of R and R\u2032 is same or different and independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C-Calkyl, C-Calkoxy, C-Calkene, C-Calkyne, and C-Ccarboxyl; and n is from 2 to 8.

Purification methods include but are not limited to, distillation, azeotropic distillation, use of absorbent materials which remove water either physically or chemically via adsorption or reaction; filtration, extraction and, combinations of the foregoing.","In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to a method for production of a super dry cyclosiloxane precursor material comprising:\n\n","As used herein an adsorbent and or drying agent is defined as a substance that absorbs water and or other impurities. Drying agents and\/or adsorbents are grouped into two major classes: chemically acting and physically acting drying agents.","Chemically acting drying agents are substances that bind water in the form of crystallization and may be regenerated by warming. Examples of these types of drying agents are calcium chloride, sodium sulfate, or magnesium sulfate. The second subdivision of chemically acting drying agents is substances that react with water. Regeneration of these drying agents is not possible since the drying agent has undergone a chemical change. Examples of these types of drying agents are, phosphorus pentoxide, metals, and metal hydrides, such as calcium hydride and HFA.","Physically acting drying agents are substances that adsorb water and or other impurities on the surface and in the pores of the drying agent. These drying agents can be regenerated by warming or applying a vacuum. Examples of these types of drying agents are desiccant, silica gel, molecular sieves, activated carbon and aluminum oxide.","The adsorbent bed material used in the purification process of the instant invention may comprise one of many adsorbents and\/or drying agents and\/or mixtures thereof, having affinity for water and\/or at least one acidic impurity. Such adsorbents are readily known to those skilled in the art. For example, the adsorbent may comprise activated carbon adsorbent, (beads or powder), having an average particle size of from about 30 to 50 \u03bcm with a pore size distribution of from about 10 to 50 nm. The drying agent may comprise a liquid or a gaseous material, such as HFA. Further, the adsorbent bed material may comprise molecular sieves, having a particle size distribution from about 100 to 125 \u03bcm and a pore size distribution from about 10 to 50 nm. Still further, the adsorbent bed material may comprise calcium hydride, or calcium oxide, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the adsorbent is selected from calcium oxide and calcium hydride.","In one embodiment, the adsorbent bed material may comprise a combination or series of adsorbents and\/or drying agents. For example, the cyclosiloxane precursor may first contact a drying agent such as calcium hydride to adsorb water molecules and separately contact a carbon adsorbent material for adsorption of an acidic impurity. As a second example the adsorbent bed material may comprise a combination of both calcium hydride and carbon adsorbent to remove both water and acidic impurity in a single step.","The amount of adsorbent used is dependent on the concentration of water and optionally other impurities present in the cyclosiloxane precursor material to be purified and the capacity of the adsorbent bed material. In one embodiment, the adsorbent may be useful in reducing water levels to <20 ppm.","The adsorbent bed material may be placed in a distillation flask or in a separate column so long as the cyclosiloxane to be purified contacts the adsorbent bed material for a period of time sufficient to remove at least a portion of the impurity from the cyclosiloxane precursor.
