{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. HR0011-09-3-0002, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present application contains some common subject matter with copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/905,891, titled \u201cApparatus for Performing SERS\u201d, filed on Oct. 15, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/029,915, titled \u201cApparatus for Performing SERS\u201d, filed on Feb. 17, 2011, and PCT Application No. PCT\/US11\/29810, titled \u201cApparatus for use in Sensing Applications\u201d, filed on Mar. 24, 2011, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Detection and identification or at least classification of unknown substances has long been of great interest and has taken on even greater significance in recent years. Among advanced methodologies that hold a promise for precision detection and identification are various forms of spectroscopy, especially those that employ Raman scattering. Spectroscopy may be used to analyze, characterize and even identify a substance or material using one or both of an absorption spectrum and an emission spectrum that results when the material is illuminated by a form of electromagnetic radiation (for instance, visible light). The absorption and emission spectra produced by illuminating the material determine a spectral \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of the material. In general, the spectral fingerprint is characteristic of the particular material or its constituent elements facilitating identification of the material. Among the most powerful of optical emission spectroscopy techniques are those based on Raman scattering.","Raman scattering optical spectroscopy employs an emission spectrum or spectral components thereof produced by inelastic scattering of photons by an internal structure of the material being illuminated. These spectral components contained in a response signal (for instance, a Raman signal) may facilitate determination of the material characteristics of an analyte species including identification of the analyte.","The Raman signal level or strength may be significantly enhanced by using a Raman-active material (for instance, Raman-active surface), however. For instance, the Raman scattered light generated by a compound (or ion) adsorbed on or within a few nanometers of a structured metal surface can be 10-10times greater than the Raman scattered light generated by the same compound in solution or in the gas phase. This process of analyzing a compound is called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (\u201cSERS\u201d). In recent years, SERS has emerged as a routine and powerful tool for investigating molecular structures and characterizing interfacial and thin-film systems, and even enables single-molecule detection.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the present disclosure is described by referring mainly to an example thereof. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be readily apparent however, that the present disclosure may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, some methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.","Throughout the present disclosure, the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are intended to denote at least one of a particular element. As used herein, the term \u201cincludes\u201d means includes but not limited to, the term \u201cincluding\u201d means including but not limited to. The term \u201cbased on\u201d means based at least in part on. In addition, the term \u201clight\u201d refers to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the visible and non-visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared and ultra-violet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.","Disclosed herein are a method for fabricating an apparatus for use in a sensing application and an apparatus for use in a sensing application. In the method, a plurality of clusters of Raman-active material nano-particles are formed on the tops of a plurality of nano-fingers and transferred to a component layer. The clusters of Raman-active material nano-particles generally form hot-spots of relatively large electric field strength, which generally enhance detection of molecules in sensing applications. In one regard, the formation of the clusters on the nano-fingers enables the hot-spots to have a larger electric field strength as compared with Raman-active material nano-particles that have simply been placed on the component layer because, for instance, the use of the nano-fingers enables the formation of relatively small (less than about 10 nm wide) gaps in the clusters. In addition, by forming the clusters of Raman-active material nano-particles on the nano-fingers and transferring the clusters onto another structure, the clusters may be provided on structures other than those upon which the nano-fingers are able to be formed.","In the method, physical features that are to enhance Raman signals emitted from molecules located near the clusters of Raman-active material nano-particles may also be formed in the component layer. In addition, the apparatus for use in a sensing application disclosed herein may be implemented as part of a sensing apparatus having an illumination source and a detector.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","100","100"]},"According to an example, the sensing application for which the apparatus  is to be used includes, for instance, a sensing application to detect a molecule in an analyte sample with a relatively high level of sensitivity. For instance, the apparatus  may be employed in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), enhanced fluorescence, enhanced luminescence, etc., types of applications.","The apparatus  is depicted as including a component layer  formed of a base layer , a top layer , and a bottom layer . According to an example, the base layer  comprises a dielectric material or other type of material, such as, glass, plastic, polymer, SiO, AlO, etc. In addition, the top layer  and the bottom layer  comprise a metal material such as, gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminum, etc., or a combination of these metals in the form of alloys.","The base layer  is also depicted as including a plurality of physical features , in this instance, inverted cones, formed in the base layer . The physical features  may be formed into the base layer  through any suitable process, such as, etching, lithography, stamping, etc. In addition, the bottom layer  may follow the contours of the physical features . In one regard, the physical features  are to enhance Raman signals emitted from molecules located near the clusters  of Raman-active material nano-particles .","With reference now to , the component layer  is depicted as including gratings formed into the base layer . Again, the physical features  in the apparatus  depicted in  may be formed through any suitable process, such as, etching, lithography, etc. Although  depict particular types of physical features , it should be understood that the physical features  may include other shapes or designs without departing from a scope of the apparatus . For instance, the physical features  may comprise multiple different shapes across the base layer , rounded shapes, other polygonal shapes, etc.","The apparatus  depicted in  is also shown as including a plurality of clusters  of Raman-active material nano-particles  on the component layer . The Raman-active material nano-particles  comprise a metal, such as, gold, silver, copper, platinum, aluminum, etc., or a combination of these metals in the form of alloys, or other suitable material that is able to support surface plasmons for field enhancement for Raman scattering. In addition, the Raman-active material nano-particles  may be multilayer structures, for example, 10 to 100 nm silver layer with 1 to 50 nm gold over-coating, or vice versa. By definition herein, a Raman-active material is a material that supports surface plasmons and facilitates Raman scattering from an analyte adsorbed on or near a surface layer of the material during Raman spectroscopy. According to an example, the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the top layer  are formed of the same metal material.","In some examples, a surface of the Raman-active material nano-particles  may be functionalized to facilitate adsorption of an analyte. For example, the Raman-active material nano-particles  may be functionalized with a binding group to facilitate binding with a specific target analyte species. The functionalized surface of the Raman-active material nano-particles  may provide a surface to which a particular class of analytes is attracted and may bond or be preferentially adsorbed. The functionalized surface may selectively bond with protein, DNA or RNA, for example. In addition, or alternatively, a probe molecule may be sandwiched between the Raman-active material nano-particles  in respective clusters . In one example, the probe molecule may be selected to interact with certain types of analyte and thus may be used to detect the presence of the certain types of analyte. In another example, the probe molecule may interact with analyte molecules to cause the analyte molecules to emit Raman signals having a relatively higher intensity.","According to an example, the Raman-active material nano-particles  in each of the clusters  are attached to each other with a gap between at least two of the Raman-active material nano-particles  being less than about 10 nm in width. More particularly, the Raman-active material nano-particles  in each of the clusters  are attached to each other with a gap being less than between about 0.5 nm and 5 nm. Generally speaking, the relatively small gaps between the Raman-active material nano-particles  in each of the clusters  may be achieved through implementation of the fabrication method disclosed herein. In other words, the fabrication method disclosed herein generally enables the Raman-active material nano-particles  to be relatively closer to each other than may be possible through direct formation of the Raman-active material nano-particles  on the component layer . In addition, the fabrication method disclosed herein may also enable the placement of the clusters  of Raman-active material nano-particles  to be more accurately controlled.","The clusters  may include any reasonably suitable number of Raman-active material nano-particles  arranged in any suitable spatial configuration. For instance, the clusters  may each include two, three, four, five, six, etc., Raman-active material nano-particles  arranged in a dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, septamer, etc., configuration. In addition, different ones of the clusters  may include different numbers of Raman-active material nano-particles  arranged in different configurations with respect to each other. Moreover, the clusters  may be arranged in any suitable configuration on the component layer . For instance, and as shown in , the clusters  may be arranged in a periodic configuration. Alternatively, as shown in , the clusters  may be arranged in an aperiodic configuration respect to each other, such that, there is no periodicity in the x and y dimensions. In other words, if the patterns of clusters  are shifted in the x or y directions, the shifted patterns may not be overlaid with the original pattern. The clusters  may also be arranged in relatively more complex aperiodic arrangements that substantially maximize coverage of the clusters  on the component layer  without forming a periodic configuration. An example of a relatively more complex aperiodic arrangement of clusters is disclosed in the PCT Application No. PCT\/US11\/29810.","With reference now to  there is shown a block diagram of an apparatus  for use in a sensing application, according to an example. It should be understood that the apparatus  may include additional elements and that some of the elements described herein may be removed and\/or modified without departing from the scope of the apparatus . It should also be understood that the elements depicted in the apparatus  are not drawn to scale and thus, the elements may have different relative sizes with respect to each other than as shown therein.","As shown in , the apparatus  includes the apparatus  depicted in , an illumination source  and a detector . An analyte molecule  to be tested is depicted as being positioned on a cluster  of Raman-active material nano-particles . In various instances, the analyte molecule  may enter into a gap between the Raman-active material nano-particles . In other instances, the analyte molecule  may have been introduced between the Raman-active material nano-particles  of a cluster  prior to the Raman-active material nano-particles  being attached to each other. Additional analyte molecules  have been depicted as being present around the clusters .","The illumination source  is depicted as emitting electromagnetic radiation, as represented by the arrow , which may comprise, for instance, light. By way of example, the illumination source  may comprise a laser that illuminates the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the analyte molecules . Illumination of the Raman-active material nano-particles  causes hot spots of relatively large electric field strength to occur. The hot spots are increased at the locations where the Raman-active material nano-particles  contact each other, in this example, the clusters . The electric fields generated at the contact locations between the Raman-active material nano-particles  generally enhance the rate at which Raman light is scattered by an analyte molecule  positioned at or near the contact locations. The Raman scattered light, which is represented by the arrow , is shifted in frequency by an amount that is characteristic of particular vibrational modes of the analyte molecule . The detector  is to collect the Raman scattered light  and spectral analysis may be performed on the Raman scattered light  to identify the analyte molecule  or to detect that the analyte molecule  has been illuminated.","The Raman-active material nano-particles  located near or adjacent to the analyte molecule(s)  may enhance the production of Raman scattered light  from the analyte molecule(s)  by concentrating or otherwise enhancing an electromagnetic field in a vicinity of the analyte molecule(s) . As also discussed above, the contacting of two or more of the Raman-active material nano-particles  with each other may trap the analyte molecule(s) , which may substantially increase the likelihood that the analyte molecule(s)  will be positioned near or in contact with some Raman-active material nano-particles  and thus be positioned within a hot spot. In this regard, the likelihood that an analyte molecule(s)  will produce sufficiently strong Raman scattered light  to be detected by the detector  will thus also be increased. In addition, each of the clusters  forms a hot spot and thus, the likelihood of detecting an analyte molecule  may be relatively high.","Although the Raman scattered light  has been depicted as being directed toward the detector , the Raman scattered light  is emitted in multiple directions. In this regard, some of the Raman scattered light  may be directed into the component layer , which may comprise an optical waveguide. More particularly, for instance, Raman scattered light  may be generated in the component layer  as a result of the analyte molecule  coupling to the evanescent field of a waveguide mode. In these instances, the detector  may be positioned to detect the waves generated in the component layer  from the Raman scattered light . In any regard, the detector  may include a filter to filter out light originating from the illumination source , for instance, through use of a grating-based monochrometer or interference filters. Various examples in which the component layer  comprises an optical waveguide are described in the Ser. No. 13\/029,915 application for patent.","The detector  is generally to convert the Raman scattered light  emitted from the analyte molecule(s)  into electrical signals that may be processed to identify, for instance, the analyte molecule  type. In some examples, the detector  is to output the electrical signals to other components (not shown) configured to process the electrical signals. In other examples, the detector  is equipped with processing capabilities to identify the analyte molecule  type.","According to an example, the apparatus  comprises a system that is integrated on a single chip. For example, the output of the component layer  may be connected to an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG filter). The component layer  may also be directly coupled to optical fibers in the apparatus  through which the illumination light  may be supplied and through which the Raman scattered light  may be outputted. In this example, the apparatus  provides a relatively more compact solution than coupling free-space signals to fibers. Additionally, the apparatus  may be implemented efficiently for a relatively large sensing area for which the free-space signals are substantially more complex and\/or expensive to implement. The component layer  may also be directly coupled to optical fibers in particular instances to form compact field sensors. In this instance, the illumination source , for instance an excitation laser, and the detector , for instance spectral analysis equipment, may be housed in a remote location.","Turning now to , there is shown a flow diagram of a method  for fabricating an apparatus for use in a sensing application, according to an example. It should be understood that the method  may include additional processes and that some of the processes described herein may be removed and\/or modified without departing from a scope of the method . The method  is also described with respect to the fabrication apparatus  depicted in , which respectively show features of the operations implemented in the blocks of the method  to fabricate the apparatus .","At block , a plurality of nano-fingers  () are formed on a substrate . According to an example, the nano-fingers  are formed in a predetermined arrangement on the substrate  to substantially cause clusters  of the Raman-active material nano-particles  to have a predetermined spatial configuration. In addition, the nano-fingers  may be formed in the predetermined arrangement to substantially cause the clusters  to have a predetermined spatial configuration with respect to each other. According to an example, a nanoimprinting technique or a roll-to-roll process may be implemented to form the nano-fingers  on the substrate . In this example, a template may be formed through photolithography or other advanced lithography with the desired patterning to arrange the nano-fingers  in the predetermined arrangement. More particularly, for instance, the desired patterns may be designed on a mold, by E-beam lithography, photolithography, laser interference lithography, FIB (Focused Ion Beam), self-assembly of spheres, etc. In addition, the pattern may be transferred onto, for instance, silicon, glass, or polymer substrate (PDMS, polyimide, polycarbonate, etc.). In other examples, the nano-fingers  may be formed in the predetermined arrangement through implementation of any suitable fabrication process.","The substrate  generally comprises any suitable material to support the nano-fingers , such as, glass, plastic, polymer, SiO, AlO, metal, etc. The nano-fingers  may be attached to the surface of the substrate  through any suitable attachment mechanism. For instance, the nano-fingers  may be grown directly on the substrate  surface through use of various suitable nano-structure growing techniques. As another example, the nano-fingers  may be integrally formed with the substrate . In this example, for instance, a portion of the material from which the substrate  is fabricated may be etched or otherwise processed to form the nano-fingers . In a further example, a separate layer of material may be adhered to the substrate  surface and the separate layer of material may be etched or otherwise processed to form the nano-fingers .","The nano-fingers  are formed of a relatively flexible material to enable the nano-fingers  to be laterally bendable, for instance, to enable free ends of the nano-fingers  to move toward each other, as discussed in greater detail herein below. Examples of suitable materials for the nano-fingers  include polymer materials, such as, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer, polyimide, polyethylene, polypropelene, etc., or any combination thereof, metallic materials, such as, gold, silver, aluminum, etc., semiconductor materials, etc., and combinations thereof. In various examples, the nano-fingers  may be fabricated through a nanoimprinting or embossing process in which a template of relatively rigid pillars is employed in a multi-step imprinting process on a polymer matrix to form the nano-fingers . Various other processes, such as, etching, and various techniques used in the fabrication of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) may also be used to fabricate the nano-fingers .","A nano-finger  may be defined as an elongated, nanoscale structure having a length (or height) that exceeds by more than several times a nanoscale cross sectional dimension (for instance, width) taken in a plane perpendicular to the length (for instance, length>3\u00d7width). In general, the length is much greater than the width or cross sectional dimension to facilitate bending of the nano-finger  laterally onto one or more neighboring nano-fingers . In some examples, the length exceeds the cross sectional dimension (or width) by more than a factor of about 5 or 10. For example, the width may be about 100 nanometers (nm) and the height may be about 500 nm. In another example, the width at the base of the nano-finger  may range between about 10 nm and about 1 micrometer (\u03bcm) and the length may range between about 50 nm and 2 \u03bcm. In other examples, the nano-finger  is sized based upon the types of materials used to form the nano-finger . Thus, for instance, the more rigid the material(s) used to form the nano-finger , the less the width of the nano-finger  may be to enable the nano-finger  to be laterally collapsible. In further examples, the nano-finger  may form ridges in which two of three dimensions (for instance length and height) exceed by more than several times a nanoscale cross sectional dimension (for instance, width). According to particular examples, the nano-fingers  may equivalently be referenced as nanopoles or nanopillars without departing from a scope of the fabrication apparatus .","According to an example, the nano-fingers  are arranged with respect to each other on the substrate  such that the free ends of at least respective neighboring groups of nano-fingers  are able to touch each other when the nano-fingers  are in a collapsed state. By way of particular example, groups of neighboring nano-fingers  are positioned between about 10 to 500 nm apart from each other.","The nano-fingers  have been depicted as having substantially cylindrical cross-sections. It should, however, be understood that the nano-fingers  may have other shaped cross-sections, such as, for instance, rectangular, square, triangular, etc. In addition, or alternatively, the nano-fingers  may be formed with one or more features, such as, notches, bulges, etc., to substantially cause the nano-fingers  to be inclined to collapse in a particular direction. Thus, for instance, two or more adjacent nano-fingers  may include the one or more features to increase the likelihood that the nano-fingers  collapse toward each other. Various manners in which the nano-fingers  may be collapsed are described in greater detail herein below.","At block , respective Raman-active material nano-particles  are formed on the tips of the nano-fingers .  shows a cross-sectional view along a line A-A, shown in , of the fabrication apparatus , according to an example. In addition, a free end of a nano-finger  is magnified in an enlargement , which reveals that the Raman-active material nano-particles  may be formed of a collection of atoms or atom clusters . In addition, although the Raman-active material nano-particle  has been depicted as having a rough surface, the Raman-active material nano-particle  may comprise a continuous layer of the Raman-active material and may have a relatively smooth surface. Moreover, the Raman-active material nano-particles  may have various other shapes than those depicted in . For instance, the Raman-active material nano-particles  may have rounded edges, extend beyond an outer perimeter of the nano-fingers , etc.","The atoms or atom clusters  may be deposited onto the free ends of the nano-fingers  through, for instance, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputtering, etc., of metallic material, or self-assembly of pre-synthesized nano-particles. By way of example, the angle at which the atoms or atom clusters  are deposited onto the free second ends of the nano-fingers  may be controlled to thereby substantially control the deposition of the atoms or atom clusters .","At block , the Raman-active material nano-particles  on the tips of adjacent ones of the nano-fingers  are caused to contact each other to form respective clusters . According to an example, the nano-fingers  may initially be in a first position, in which their free ends are in a substantially spaced arrangement with respect to each other as shown in . The gaps between the free ends may be of sufficiently large size to enable a liquid to be supplied in the gaps. In addition, the gaps may be of sufficiently small size to enable the free ends of the nano-fingers  in the respective clusters  to move toward each other as the liquid evaporates, through, for instance, capillary forces applied on the free ends as the liquid dries. Other non-limiting examples, such as e-beam, ion-beam, magnetic, mechanical force, thermal effect, or electric charge effect, may also or instead be utilized to cause the ends of the nano-fingers  to move toward each other. In any regard, the Raman-active material nano-particles  in the respective clusters  may contact each other and remain in contact with each other through, for instance, van der Waals interactions between those contacting nano-particles .","According to an example, a spacer is introduced between the nano-fingers  prior to block  to space the nano-particles  from each other during the cluster formation process. In this example, the spacer may be a sacrificial molecule or material layer that will be bridged in between neighboring finger  tips, after the transfer at block , this molecule may be washed away or plasma etched, or ozone treated, or may be selectively removed by other proper physical\/chemical treatment.","In addition, or alternatively, according to an example, an analyte  to be tested using the apparatus  is included in the liquid to thus enable molecules from the analyte  to be trapped between the Raman-active material nano-particles  of respective clusters . In addition or alternatively, probe molecules that are to interact with certain types of analytes to enhance detection of the analyte molecules may be included in the liquid to enable the probe molecules to be trapped between the Raman-active material nano-particles  of respective clusters .","According to another example, the Raman-active material nano-particles  may be formed on the tips of the nano-fingers  following the closing of the tips in the clusters . In this example, blocks  and  may be reversed with respect to each other.","At block , the clusters  of Raman-active material nano-particles  are transferred to a component layer . According to an example, the clusters  of the Raman-active material nano-particles  are transferred to the top layer  of the component layer , for instance, as shown in . More particularly, the component layer  is moved toward the fabrication apparatus  as indicated by the arrow  to cause the top layer  to contact the clusters  of the Raman-active material nano-particles . The clusters  of the Raman-active material nano-particles  may bond to the top layer , for instance, through van der Waals interactions between the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the top layer . In one example, the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the top layer  may be formed of the same metal material, for instance, gold, platinum, silver, etc., and may become bonded together. In another example, an adhesive material may be provided between the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the top layer  to cause the Raman-active material nano-particles  to adhere to the top layer . In a further example, a self-assembled monolayer of functional molecules, such as thiol-terminated silane molecule, may be formed on the surface of the top layer  to provide chemical bonding between thiol and the Raman-active material nanoparticles , and therefore ensure the transfer of the Raman-active material nanoparticles  to the top layer .","In any regard, following contacting of the top layer  to the Raman-active material nano-particles  and following adhesion therebetween, the component layer  is moved away from the fabrication apparatus , as indicated by the arrow  (). As shown in , clusters  of Raman-active material nano-particles  are \u201cplucked\u201d off the nano-fingers . In one regard, the attraction\/adhesion between the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the top layer  is stronger than the attraction\/adhesion between the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the nano-fingers  because, for instance, the Raman-active material nano-particles  and the top layer  are made of the same metal material.","According to an example, physical features  are formed in the base layer  of the component layer , for instance, as shown in . As discussed above with respect to , the physical features  may comprise various different shapes and may be formed through various fabrication techniques. In addition, although the physical features  have been depicted as being formed following the transfer of the clusters  of Raman-active material nano-particles  onto the component layer , the physical features  may be formed prior to the transfer of the clusters  without departing from a scope of the method . Moreover, additional fabrication operations may be performed on the apparatus , for instance, the bottom layer  may be applied to the base layer  following formation of the physical features .","Although described specifically throughout the entirety of the instant disclosure, representative examples of the present disclosure have utility over a wide range of applications, and the above discussion is not intended and should not be construed to be limiting, but is offered as an illustrative discussion of aspects of the disclosure.","What has been described and illustrated herein is an example along with some of its variations.
