{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of detecting an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior. In particular, embodiments of the present invention relate to analyzing one or more features of an electronic communication and categorizing the electronic communication as relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior based on the analyzed features.","As personal computers become widespread among households, the Internet (or the World Wide Web) has become a powerful household tool as well. Each day, millions of people use the Internet to shop, to research, to receive education, etc. The Internet has also become a forum for adults and minors alike to meet people. Through emails, chat rooms, and instant messaging, people all over the world use this new means of communication to meet new friends, to converse with friends and relatives, and to explore a wide range of social functions.","Even though electronic communication through the Internet has become a convenient social tool, nonetheless it is potentially very dangerous for users of the Internet, especially for minors. An estimated 70 million minors under the age of 18 use the Internet. Minors use the Internet extensively to communicate with friends and increasingly with classmates and teachers to perform school assignments. However, Internet usage by minors also opens the door for minors to receive an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior. The Internet may provide a false sense of privacy and security. Minors are likely to trust unsafe or predatory individuals on the Internet and thus become targets of a criminal or abusive behavior. Additionally, parents usually have little or no knowledge of minors' communication on the Internet and are not able to remedy an unsafe or undesired behavior. As such, allowing minors access to the Internet has increasingly become a difficult parenting situation.","The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a statistic that each day, at least one adult intends to meet personally with a minor that they have met on the Internet. These unsafe and potentially dangerous individuals stroll through chat rooms or instant messaging sessions looking for potential victims. They use sophisticated manipulation techniques to pretend to be innocuous in order to expose minors to an inappropriate or offensive language, to engage minors to a prurient or sexual conversation, to solicit personal information, characteristics or pictures from minors, and in the worst case, to arrange a physical meeting with minors. Adding to the large amount of intrusive and inappropriate materials on the Internet (e.g., materials with pornographic, hate, or mature content), such a predatory behavior targeted against minors has become a major barrier for parents who want to protect their children from online dangers while still wishing to realize the many benefits of the Internet.","One additional concern for Internet usage by minors involves cyber-bullying. In general, cyber-bullying represents a class of behaviors where electronic communications are used to abuse, exert power on, or deceive minors. Particularly, cyber-bullies engage in an abusive behavior on the Internet intending to scare minors or to harm minors' interactions on the Internet. Cyber-bullying is increasingly becoming a common threat that minors have to face when using the Internet.","Studies of family Internet usage indicate that parents are extremely concerned with their children's safety when the children are on the Internet. Specifically, parents fear that their children may be communicating with or targeted by unsafe or predatory individuals or that their children may be revealing personal information or characteristics to strangers. As discussed, fear of such an unsafe or undesired behavior is a major barrier for families to get online. Removing or reducing this barrier may translate into increased customer base for Internet service providers.","Some known systems and methods try to prevent certain communications by employing filtering programs to block certain keywords and key phrases (e.g., home address, phone number, credit card numbers, etc.) out of emails, chat sessions, or instant messaging sessions. However, such phrase or keyword blocking capabilities are often crude. Furthermore, these known systems and methods often do not offer an effective solution to detect an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior. The keyword matching techniques employed by these known systems and methods usually cannot effectively identify patterns of a communication indicative of an unsafe or undesired behavior.","Accordingly, a solution that detects an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","Embodiments of the present invention effectively provide parents, guardians, or other responsible persons a means to protect their minors from an electronic communication that relates to an unsafe or undesired behavior. In particular, embodiments of the present invention effectively provide a means to identify an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior directed to or engaged by the minors. Parents, guardians, or other responsible persons are alerted for an occurrence of such an electronic communication so that they can supervise their minors. Accordingly, parents, guardians, or other responsible persons can feel more positive about their minors being on the Internet communicating with others or can detect an electronic communication that could possibly result in a dangerous interaction between their minors and unsafe or predatory individuals. In addition, according to an embodiment, the invention may effectively detect whether the minors are involved in an electronic communication that inadvertently or intentionally exhibits an unsafe or undesired behavior on the Internet (e.g., cyber-bullying other minors or sharing personal information such as phone number, address, etc.).","Briefly described, a method employing aspects of the invention detects an electronic communication sent or received by a user and relating to an unsafe behavior. The method includes analyzing one or more features of the electronic communication. The one or more features are indicative of the unsafe behavior. The method also includes categorizing the electronic communication as relating to the unsafe behavior as a function of the analyzed features. The method further includes generating a report if the electronic communication is categorized as relating to the unsafe behavior. The report is indicative of the unsafe behavior. The method also includes sending the report to a responsible person of the user.","In another embodiment of the invention, a system embodying aspects of the invention is adapted to detect an electronic communication sent or received by a user and relating to an undesired behavior. The system includes a computer to receive or send the electronic communication. The system includes computer-executable instructions to analyze one or more features of the electronic communication. The one or more features are indicative of the undesired behavior. The system also includes computer-executable instructions to categorize the electronic communication as either relating to the undesired behavior or relating to an innocuous behavior as a function of the analyzed features. The system further includes computer-executable instructions to generate a report if the electronic communication is categorized as relating to the undesired behavior. The report is indicative of the undesired behavior. The system also includes computer-executable instructions to send the report to a responsible person of the user.","In yet another embodiment of the invention, computer-readable media employing aspects of the invention have computer-executable instructions for performing a method to detect an electronic communication sent or received by a user and relating to an unsafe behavior. The method includes analyzing one or more features of the electronic communication. The one or more features are indicative of the unsafe behavior. The method also includes categorizing the electronic communication as relating to the unsafe behavior as a function of the analyzed features. The method further includes generating a report if the electronic communication is categorized as relating to the unsafe behavior. The report is indicative of the unsafe behavior. The method includes sending the report to a responsible person of the user.","One or more computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions for detecting an electronic communication relating to an unsafe behavior embody further aspects of the invention.","Alternatively, one embodiment of the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","110","106","108","102","104","102","100","108","102","106","102","106","102","100","102"]},"As part of the software instructions operating client , included are instructions for receiving or sending electronic communication . Depending on the type of electronic communication , such instructions may be an email application, an instant messaging application, a chat application, or any other application for receiving or sending electronic communication . The software instructions operating client  further include storing electronic communication  in a memory M of client . For example, the memory M may be a XML history file of an instant messaging application. In another example, memory M may be an inbound or outbound mailbox of an email application. Furthermore, memory M may be a random access memory (RAM) or memory disk located within or separate from client .","Also shown in  is a detector  executed on client  and adapted to detect whether electronic communication  relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the detector  may be executed on a look-up server  coupled to the data communications network. In this alternative embodiment, client  may include instructions to retrieve electronic communication  from memory M and send electronic communication  to the look-up server  via the data communications network. The look-up server  may then execute detector  to determine whether electronic communication  relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior.","According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention, detector  may include a context analyzer , a categorizer , and a report generator , which may be different software components or modules of detector  and may communicate with each other via application programming interfaces (APIs). Generally, context analyzer  may include instructions to control an operation of detector . In particular, context analyzer  may include instructions to determine whether electronic communication  should be analyzed. In one embodiment of the invention, a responsible person  (e.g., a parent, guardian, trusted authority, or other responsible person or entity) of user  may send an input  to context analyzer , as indicated by an arrow . The input  may indicate to context analyzer  that third party  is trustworthy and safe (e.g., the third party  may be a friend, teacher, relative, or family member of user ). In this case, context analyzer  may include instructions to inform detector  to withhold from analyzing electronic communication  either temporarily or permanently. Alternatively, responsible person  may send input  to context analyzer  indicating that third party  is no longer trustworthy so that detector  may start analyzing electronic communication . This embodiment of the invention advantageously provides responsible person  a feedback mechanism to identify trusted third parties. Systems attempting to detect an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior may not always achieve perfect accuracy. Furthermore, true instances of electronic communications relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior may be rare. As a result, many electronic communications detected as relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior may be false alarms. The feedback mechanism of the present invention effectively filters out electronic communications with reduced possibility of relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior before they are analyzed.","The context analyzer  may also include instructions to specify a type of unsafe or undesired behavior so that detector  may detect whether electronic communication  relates to the specified type of unsafe or undesired behavior. For example, responsible person  may send input  to context analyzer  indicating that he or she wishes to detect whether electronic communication  relates to sexual predatory behavior. In this example, context analyzer  may direct detector  to detect whether electronic communication relates to a sexual predatory behavior.","The categorizer  includes instructions to categorize electronic communication . In general, categorizer  may include an unsafe or undesired behavior category model, which may identify combinations of features that are statistically significant in a communication relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. One embodiment of the invention advantageously utilizes pattern recognition to create one or more unsafe or undesired behavior category models. For example, a particular unsafe or undesired behavior category model may be created to identify combinations of statistically significant features of a communication exhibiting or demonstrating sexual predatory behavior, bullying behavior, offensive language, personal information solicitation or revelation, personal characteristics solicitation or revelation, meeting arrangement with a stranger, picture sharing with a stranger, a combination thereof, and so on.","Pattern recognition may create a particular unsafe or undesired behavior category model by using text classification or other techniques to recognize combinations of statistically significant features (e.g., statistically significant keywords, key phrases, and\/or contextual information). Communications relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior often include some features that are commonly shared among such communications. Examples of such commonly shared and thus statistically significant features might include \u201cwhat is your address,\u201d \u201cdon't tell your parents,\u201d \u201clet's meet next week,\u201d etc. Pattern recognition may train a particular unsafe or undesired behavior category model by using transcripts of actual communications that relate to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. Such transcripts may be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act or from other public records (e.g., transcripts of predatory conversations collected by investigators and used to prosecute offenders) so that the unsafe or undesired behavior category model may learn and identify combinations of features that are statistically significant in such actual communications relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior.","An unsafe or undesired behavior category model trained by pattern recognition may be able to identify combinations of statistically significant features that may not be identified by simple keyword matching techniques. In particular, the statistical techniques used by pattern recognition to create category models may generalize features based on training samples such that the unsafe or undesired category model may be able to recognize variations of a given feature. For example, the unsafe or undesired behavior category model may be able to recognize a slangy phrase such as \u201cdon't tell your parents\u201d as relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior. In contrast, the simple keyword matching techniques employed by known systems and methods may not be able to effectively identify such slang or other phrase variations. Nonetheless, it is contemplated by the present invention that keyword matching may be utilized contemporaneously with pattern recognition to identify more accurately an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior.","Based on its analysis of features of electronic communication , categorizer  may generate a rating, and based on the rating, categorize electronic communication  as either relating to a safe or innocuous behavior or relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. The rating of electronic communication  is indicative of a probability that electronic communication  relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. In one embodiment, the rating of electronic communication  is generated based in part on a frequency of a feature appearing in electronic communication  as well as a combination of features existing in electronic communication . Specifically, a feature that by itself may not be indicative of an unsafe or undesired behavior may serve as contextual or aggregating information indicating that electronic communication  relates to an unsafe or undesired behavior. For example, the feature \u201clet's meet next week\u201d alone may not suggest that electronic communication  does or does not relate to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. However, \u201clet's meet next week\u201d in combination with \u201cdon't tell your parents\u201d may suggest that electronic communication  relates to a physical meeting arrangement with a stranger.","In another embodiment of the invention, a distribution of words within an electronic communication may also indicate an unsafe or undesired behavior. For example, appearances of the words \u201ctell\u201d and \u201cparents\u201d in an electronic communication, even though not within a sentence, may nonetheless indicate that the electronic communication is relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior. Accordingly, the present invention advantageously utilizes a number of factors to determine a probability (i.e., a rating) that an electronic communication relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. This is distinguished from the prior art in which a word or phrase is identified or filtered out of an electronic communication without considering contextual or aggregating information of the electronic communication to decide whether the word or phrase truly indicates or suggests that the electronic communication relates to an unsafe or undesired behavior. An exemplary operation of categorizer  in accordance with one embodiment of the invention is discussed hereinafter in connection with .","The report generator  includes instructions to generate a report  if categorizer  categorizes electronic communication  as relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. The report  is indicative of a possible unsafe or undesired behavior related to electronic communication . Report generator  also includes instructions to send report  to responsible person  (e.g., via email or other means), as indicated by an arrow . If responsible person  is also a user of client , report generator  may send report  to an account of responsible person  in a client application (e.g., an email, chat, or instant messaging application) executed on client . In another embodiment of the invention, report generator  may also include instructions to send report  to user .","Typically, report  may include a content of electronic communication  (e.g., a transcript, copy, summary, set of extracted sentences, or highlighted version of electronic communication ) for responsible person  to review the content to determine whether electronic communication  truly relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior. If responsible person  determines that electronic communication  truly relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior, responsible person  may decide how to address or remedy the type of unsafe or undesired behavior related to electronic communication . For example, responsible person  may advise user  to avoid interacting with strangers or sharing personal information online. Responsible person  may also remove third party  from the online or offline contact list of user  or inform law enforcement agency that a possible unsafe or undesired behavior may have occurred. By sending report  to responsible person , the invention advantageously allows responsible person  flexibility in deciding how to address or remedy a type of unsafe or undesired behavior possibly related to electronic communication .","Report  may also include an identification (i.e., an Internet Protocol (IP) address or other identifying information) of a source or recipient of electronic communication . For example, report  may include an alias, user name, email address, or screen name of third party . Including an identification of the source or recipient of electronic communication  in report  advantageously allows responsible person  to identify potential unsafe or predatory individuals so that responsible person  may warn user  against interacting with such unsafe or predatory individuals. Including the identification in report  may also allow responsible person  to identify trusted sources or recipients to filter out electronic communications from or to these trusted sources or recipients without analyzing them. Report  may also include a type of unsafe or undesired behavior (e.g., sexual predatory behavior, personal information solicitation or revelation, offensive language, etc.) that is possibly related to electronic communication  as well as a date and time that electronic communication  is sent or received by user .","Report  may also include a general recommendation on how to address or remedy the identified type of unsafe or undesired behavior related to electronic communication . For example, if the identified type of unsafe or undesired behavior is personal information sharing, report  may generally recommend responsible person  to utilize a blocking software (i.e., a software that blocks personal information from electronic communication ) or to advise user  not to share personal information online. Responsible person  may also specify what kind of and how much information should report generator  include in report . For example, responsible person  may specify (e.g., via input ) that report  should include a content of electronic communication  in detail. In another example, responsible person  may specify that report  should include a summary of a type of unsafe or undesired behavior that is related to electronic communication  and a general recommendation for addressing or remedying this type of unsafe or undesired behavior.","According to one embodiment of the invention, responsible person  may also specify (e.g., via input ) how often should report generator  send report  to responsible person . For example, responsible person  may specify that report generator  should send report  to responsible person  once a day, once a week, once a month, or only when an electronic communication relating to an unsafe or undesired behavior is detected. In this scenario, reports  may indicate all of the electronic communications  sent or received during a period of time (e.g., a day, week, or month) that possibly relates to one or more types of unsafe or undesired behavior.","In one further embodiment of the invention, if categorizer  categorizes electronic communication  as relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior, report generator  may also generate an emergency notification to responsible person  and\/or user . Such an emergency notification is represented in  as an alert , which is sent to responsible person  as indicated by an arrow , or to user  as indicated by an arrow . The alert  may notify responsible person  of any electronic communication  relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior targeted against or engaged by user  which may need urgent attention. For example if third party  is a sexual predator who via electronic communication  has arranged a physical meeting with user , then alert  may notify (e.g., via pager or text\/voice messenger) responsible person  of such a situation so that responsible person  may promptly address or remedy the threat (e.g., by informing law enforcement agency). The alert  may also include an identification (e.g., an IP address or other identifying information) of third party  to locate third party . In another embodiment of the invention, alert  may also inform user  that third party  is unsafe and potentially dangerous. For example, if third party  is soliciting personal information from user , alert  may be a message displaying on a screen of client  alerting user  that third party  is soliciting personal information and that user  should not reveal personal information online. Report generator  may also send alert  to the specific client application that user  uses to send or receive electronic communication . For example, alert  may be an email message sent to an email application, an instant messaging message sent to an instant messaging application, or a chat statement sent to a chat application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["134","108","110","104","134","104","102","134","102","104","104","106","134","104","106","104","134","104","102","106","134","104","104","102"]},"In another exemplary embodiment, indicator  may also be sent to user  or displayed on the screen of client . In this case, indicator  may be utilized to inform user  not to expect privacy rights in electronic communication  as well as caution user  not to employ electronic communication  to engage in an unsafe or undesired behavior. The indicator  may also be displayed to user  as a logo located on a client application used to send or receive electronic communication .","It should be noted that different implementations of system  are also contemplated by this invention. For example, although memory M is shown in  as within client  for convenience, it is to be understood that in other embodiments of the invention, memory M may be one or more memories included within or separate from client . Furthermore, even though context analyzer , categorizer , and report generator  are shown as different software modules or components of detector , it is to be understood that they may all be part of the same software component or module or that each may be a separate software program.","One embodiment of the invention may also be implemented by a server-based system  as illustrated in . The system  includes a communication server  having communication capability for receiving an electronic communication  communicated between a user  using a client  and a third party . The communication server  has a memory M to store the electronic communication . System  further includes instructions to send electronic communication  to a detector . The detector  may be executed on communication server  or executed on a look-up server . Detector  includes a context analyzer  for controlling an operation of detector ; a categorizer  for categorizing electronic communication  as either relating to a safe or innocuous behavior or relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior; and a report generator  for generating a report  or an alert . The report generator  may send the report  to a responsible person , as indicated by an arrow . Report generator  may also send report  to user . The alert  may be sent to the responsible person  as indicated by an arrow , and\/or to user  as indicated by an arrow . Both report  and alert  are indicative of an unsafe or undesired behavior possibly related to electronic communication . Responsible person  may send an input  to the context analyzer , as indicated by an arrow . The input  may indicate whether or not third party  is trustworthy; a type of unsafe or undesired behavior such that detector  may detect whether electronic communication  relates to the specified type of unsafe or undesired behavior; how often should report generator  send report ; what kind of information and how much information should report  include; etc. System  also includes an indicator  sent to third party  and\/or user . The indicator  may also be displayed (e.g., as a logo) on client  used by user  and\/or on another client used by third party . Indicator  informs third party  and\/or user  that electronic communication  is being analyzed.","Referring now to , an exemplary embodiment of a categorizer  adapted to categorize an electronic communication according to one embodiment of the invention is shown.  shows categorizer  having instructions to receive an electronic communication , as indicated by an arrow . In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, categorizer  may include a parser . The parser  includes instructions to parse the electronic communication . For example, parser  may break up a content of electronic communication  into a group or sequence of constituent tokens. Each token may represent a word, phrase, or any other semantic or syntactic representation of a language. According to one embodiment of the invention, parser  may parse the entire content of electronic communication  (e.g., all of the messages sent or received). Alternatively, parser  may parse electronic communication  with respect to a certain period of time (e.g., messages received or sent within the past hour) or with respect to a certain size window (e.g., the last 10 messages sent or received, the last 100 kilobytes of data sent or received, etc.). For example, if electronic communication  is a chat session, then parser  may parse the entire content of the chat session or a particular chat statement sent or received within a period of time or size window. Similarly, if electronic communication  is an instant messaging session, then parser  may parse the entire content of the instant messaging session or a particular instant messaging message sent or received within a period of time or size window. If electronic communication  represents one or more email messages, then parser  may parse a single email message, an entire thread of email messages, or email messages sent or received within a period of time or size window.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["304","306","308","306","306","306","306","306","302"]},"A wide variety of training techniques may be utilized to create unsafe or undesired behavior category model . As one particular example, pattern recognition may be utilized to create unsafe or undesired behavior category model . In the pattern recognition training process, a number of transcripts or documents is collected (e.g., through the Freedom of Information Act or from other public records). These transcripts or documents may generally be divided into three classifications: content (i.e., transcripts or documents relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior), anti-content (i.e., transcripts or documents not relating to the type of unsafe or undesired behavior), and close anti-content (i.e., transcripts or documents not relating to the type of unsafe or undesired behavior but including some features that may appear in content (e.g., a meeting arrangement between two classmates to study)). These transcripts or documents (i.e., training samples) may be fed into computer-executable training instructions. The computer-executable training instructions may identify features that are present in content but not in anti-content or close anti-content. The identified features may then be classified as features that are statistically significant in a communication relating to the particular type of unsafe or undesired behavior. The computer-executable training instructions may also assign a weight to each feature classified as statistically significant. For example, the computer-executable training instructions may assign greater weights to features present in content but not close anti-content and smaller weights to features present in both content and close anti-content. The weight assigned to a given feature may also be based on how frequently the feature appears in content or close anti-content. It is noted that the computer-executable training instructions may be implemented as a number of different architectures. For example, the computer-executable instructions may be implemented as a Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier, a limited dependence Bayesian classifier, a Bayesian network classifier, a decision tree, a support vector machine, a content matching classifier, a combination thereof, and so on.","In one embodiment of the invention, unsafe or undesired behavior category model  may examine each token of electronic communication  to examine whether the token matches a feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model  (i.e., a feature that is statistically significant in a communication relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior). If a token of electronic communication  matches a feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model , then unsafe or undesired behavior category model  identifies the feature as included in electronic communication . One or more features of unsafe or undesired behavior category model  identified as included in electronic communication  are sent to a vector generator  of categorizer , as indicated by an arrow . Unsafe or undesired behavior category model  may also indicate to the vector generator  a frequency that a feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model  appears in electronic communication  (i.e., the number of tokens of electronic communication  that matches the feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model ). The vector generator  includes instructions to generate a feature vector, which is indicative of each feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model  that is present in electronic communication  (e.g., as determined by a match between a token of electronic communication  and a feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model ). The feature vector may also indicate a frequency that a feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model  appears in electronic communication . The feature vector generated by vector generator  may be applied to a probabilistic classifier  of categorizer , as indicated by an arrow .","According to one embodiment of the invention, the probabilistic classifier  may be implemented as a Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier, a limited dependence Bayesian classifier, a Bayesian network classifier, a decision tree, a support vector machine, a content matching classifier, a combination thereof, and so on. Generally, probabilistic classifier  is operative to receive the feature vector generated by vector generator . Based on the features included in the feature vector and their associated weights (as well as a frequency that a given feature of unsafe or undesired behavior category model  appears in electronic communication ), probabilistic classifier  may generate a rating indicating a probability that electronic communication  relates to a particular type of unsafe or undesired behavior. The rating of electronic communication  may be in the form of a percentage. For example, the rating of electronic communication  may indicate that there is a 60% chance that electronic communication  relates to a particular type of unsafe or undesired behavior. Thus, according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the higher the rating of electronic communication , the higher the probability that electronic communication  relates to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior.","In one embodiment of the invention, the rating of electronic communication  may be applied to a threshold comparator , as indicated by an arrow . The threshold comparator  has stored thereon a threshold level. Threshold comparator  includes instructions to compare the rating of electronic communication  to the threshold level. If the rating of electronic communication  is less than or equal to (or less than) the threshold level, then electronic communication  is categorized as relating to a safe or innocuous behavior, as indicated by an arrow . If the rating of electronic communication  is greater than (or greater than or equal to) the threshold level, then electronic communication  is categorized as relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior, as indicated by an arrow . It is noted that a responsible person (e.g., responsible person ) may change the sensitivity of categorizer  by changing the threshold level. For example, the threshold level can be set higher so that fewer electronic communications may be categorized as relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior (i.e., a less chance that electronic communication  is categorized as relating to a type of unsafe or undesired behavior).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["326","300","328","326","300","306","314","300","300","300","302","300","306","314","300"]},"To enhance the accuracy of categorizer  in categorizing electronic communication , categorizer  may also include spell checking and\/or phonetic spell checking capabilities (not shown). For example, before electronic communication  is applied to parser , categorizer  may include instructions to spell check and\/or phonetic spell check electronic communication  to detect and correct any misspellings and\/or phonetic misspellings. Similarly, categorizer  may include instructions to spell check and\/or phonetic spell check the tokens generated by parser .
