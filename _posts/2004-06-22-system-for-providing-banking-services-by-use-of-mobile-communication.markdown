Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a system for providing banking services by use of a mobile communication system, more particularly, in which the mobile communication system is provided with a removable integrated circuit (IC) card chip in which personal identification number (PIN) information, financial account information, etc. are stored, and a banking application for financial transactions which is driven on a Java Virtual Machine and mobile banking such as mobile account inquiry, transfer\/remittance, loan\/payment and so forth are used, thereby maximizing convenience of a user with regard to the mobile banking, and simultaneously minimizing network loads of a communication network and reinforcing security against data and financial information.","2. Description of the Related Art","Currently, as mobile communication systems become enhanced in their performance together with communication networks, there are provided a variety of mobile banking services by use of the mobile communication systems such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) or so forth. In particular, such mobile banking services make it possible for any customer to conveniently use banking services, such as account inquiry, transfer\/remittance and payment, and inquiry and payment of a loan, anytime and anywhere without directly visiting their correspondent banks.","Generally, conventional mobile banking services, for example a mobile account inquiry, mobile transfer\/remittance, and mobile loan overview inquiry\/loan interest payment have employed a wireless Internet system on the basis of WAP (wireless application protocol). Specifically, the conventional mobile banking services allow any Internet banking user to activate a WAP browser of a terminal (e.g. personal computer), to have access to a URL (uniform resource locator) of the corresponding banking server, to input his\/her own ID (identification) and password for authentication, and after authentication, to banking services such as account inquiry, transfer\/remittance, and inquiry of a loan account overview and payment of its interest and so on.","These conventional mobile banking services merely change Internet banking services over a wired Internet into that over the wireless Internet based on the WAP. Because the mobile communication systems fail to provide a large size screen, easy input procedure and storage capability like the personal computer, there is much inconvenience in use.","Further, whenever using his\/her desired banking service, the customer must input various kinds of information, such as ID, password, account number and so forth, through the mobile communication system. Thus, the customer has trouble to use the banking service. Further, because of weak security of the mobile communication system, it is next to impossible to store data related to personal information in the memory of the mobile communication system and to use the data.","In addition, once the mobile communication system has access to the banking server, a series of processes, for example inputting the account number, performing customer authentication, inquiring of a transaction history, inquiring of the loan account overview, paying interest on a loan and so forth, are performed during the session. Hence, there are problems in that the user or customer is weighted with the charge for a phone call etc., and that loads of the communication network is weighted.","To solve the above-indicated problems, it is, therefore, an aspect of the present invention to provide a method for providing banking services by use of a mobile communication system, capable of, during using mobile banking such as a mobile account inquiry service, a mobile transfer\/remittance service, a mobile loan overview inquiry and loan interest payment service and so forth, simplifying complicated inputting of a user.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a system for providing banking services by use of a mobile communication system, capable of, during using mobile banking services, reducing an access time between a mobile communication system and a banking server and minimizing network loads of a communication network","It is yet another aspect of the present invention to provide a system for providing banking services by use of a mobile communication system, capable of, during using mobile banking services, reinforcing security against data and financial information.","To achieve these above-noted aspects, according the present invention, there is provide a system for providing banking services by use of a mobile communication system, in which a variety of financial transactions of at least one financial account of at least one financial institution are processed by the mobile communication system, the system comprising: the mobile communication system, provided with an integrated circuit (IC) card and a memory device to which a banking application is installed, for transmitting and receiving data by wireless, the IC card being stored with information on a personal identification number (PIN) and information related to financial accounts, the banking application processing the financial transactions by mobile banking; a base station transceiver system (BTS) for executing a wireless interface with the mobile communication system and a base station controller (BSC) for performing call processing and for providing a core network interface with the BTS; a packet data switching network (PDSN) for providing a packet data transfer service using a transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP); and at least one banking server for, when being requested to process the financial transactions by the banking application of the mobile communication system, providing information processing the request and information on a response to the request, wherein, when a key signal related to the financial transactions is inputted in the mobile communication system, the banking application installed to the mobile communication system is executed, the PIN information for completing a login to the IC card is inputted, authentication is performed in the mobile communication system, a list of the financial accounts stored in the IC card is extracted and displayed in a display window of the mobile communication system, any one of financial accounts is selected from the list of the financial accounts, a request message of the financial transactions is formed using various kinds of information on the selected financial account and transmitted to the banking server, the banking server processes the financial transactions in response to the financial transaction request message and transmits a result of processing the financial transactions to the mobile communication system, and the result of processing the financial transactions is displayed through the display window of the mobile communication system.","Further, the mobile communication system is provided with a dedicated key for performing only the financial transactions. Preferably, the mobile communication system is any one of a mobile phone, a smart phone and a personal digital assistant (PDA) which have a communication function. A hierarchical structure of software (S\/W) built in the mobile communication system has an IC card driver for managing data of the IC card and system S\/W for managing basic functions of the mobile communication system, which are established as a lower structure, and the banking application and an IC card application programming interface (IC card API), which are established as an upper structure, and a Java virtual machine (Java VM) as an intermediate code for executing the banking application between the lower and upper structures.","Further, the IC card is removable and attachable from\/to the mobile communication system, and performs any one of modification of the information related to the financial accounts stored in the IC card, and addition of new information on the financial accounts, after permitting the login through authentication of the PIN information.","Preferably, the IC card stores the financial account information including an account number and password, a corresponding financial institution code, a kind of the account, and customer information with regard to each financial account of a user, and also has a function for resetting the financial account information so as to allow the financial account information stored in the IC card and that managed by the banking server to be matched with each other.","Meanwhile, the PIN information stored in the IC card is inputted by providing a short message service to the mobile communication system of the user with which the IC card is equipped, and by manipulating the IC card.","And, the mobile communication system and the banking server make use of any one of encryption solutions including E2E (end to end) and WPKI (wireless public key infrastructure) for security of data and financial information.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , a mobile banking system of the present invention is generally composed of a mobile communication system  of a user or customer, a base station transceiver system (BTS)\/base station controller (BSC) \u2014for supporting wireless communication of the mobile communication system , a packet data switching network (PDSN) , and banking servers  installed at each financial institution.","The PDSN  provides a packet data transfer service using a PPP (point-to-point protocol) and a TCP\/IP (transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol) between a RAN (Radio Access Network) and a DCN (Data Core Network), wherein the RAN is composed of the BTS which performs a wireless interface with the mobile communication system , the BSC  which perform call processing and provides a core network interface with the BTS, and so forth. The banking services of the present invention are provided on the basis of the TCP\/IP.","Each banking server  is provided equipment for each financial institution so as to interact with the mobile system including the mobile communication system , the BTS\/BSC  and the PDSN . Further, the banking server  receives various request messages, such as an account inquiry request message, a request message related to transfer\/remittance, a request message related to loan overview inquiry\/loan interest payment, etc., which are transmitted from the mobile communication system  through the PDSN , performs a predetermined customer authentication process, processes the received messages in interaction with its host server, and transmits the processed results and their related data to the mobile communication system  through the PDSN  and the BTS\/BSC .","In this manner, the mobile communication system  and the banking server  has access to each other using the TCP\/IP. Various kinds of data or information are transmitted and received between the mobile communication system  and the banking server  by means of wireless TCP\/IP communication using a wireless data network.","Meanwhile, the mobile communication system  includes a mobile or cellular phone, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) and so on, each of which is provided with all hardware for wireless data communication. The mobile communication system  is equipped with a removable IC card  and a memory device mounting all software (S\/W) for mobile banking services such as account inquiry, transfer\/remittance, loan overview inquiry and loan interest payment, and so on.","The IC card  can be removed from and mounted to the mobile communication system  and has various kinds of stored information, such as personal identification number (PIN) information, financial account information of the user or other persons, customer information and so on. The user can have access to the stored information by PIN authentication, wherein the PIN authentication is performed by inputting information on a password of the IC card , namely the PIN information, and by checking whether the inputted PIN information is matched with stored PIN information or not. Further, various kinds of information related to each financial account and each loan account, for example the account number and password, the code of the corresponding financial institution, the kind of the account (e.g., an ordinary deposit account, a savings account, an installment savings deposit account, a loan account for housing etc.) and so forth, are matched and stored in the IC card .","The stored information of the IC card  is set when the IC card  is issued at a financial institution window such as a bank window. The user can complete a login to the IC card  through the PIN authentication which is allowed to check whether the PIN information stored in the IC card  is matched with that inputted through the mobile communication system  or not, and then is capable of modifying and adding the financial account information (the account number, the password, etc.) through the mobile communication system .","Further, the IC card  has a function for resetting the account information so as to allow the account information stored in the IC card  and that managed by the banking server  to be matched with each other. Preferably, this resetting of the account information is done by a reset key button provided on the mobile communication system .","In addition, when the user applies for the IC card  through a postal service without visiting the financial institution window in person, the financial institution sends the IC card  to the user in a state incapable of setting the PIN information. At the point of time when the user informs the financial institution that he\/her has received the IC card , the financial institution sends a short message service (SMS) message to the user's mobile communication system  with which the IC card  is equipped, and then the user manipulates the IC card  in a state capable of setting the PIN information. Thereby, it is possible to previously prevent misuse of the IC card , which is responsible for loss or theft of the IC card  while the IC card  is sent. Thus, the user is able to have the IC card issued without directly visiting the financial institution. In other words, a short message of the SMS includes a control message for setting the PIN information, and is forwarded to the mobile communication system . The control message, which is forwarded to the mobile communication system , invokes an IC card API (application programming interface) which is built in the mobile communication system  (see ). Then, Java Virtual Machine (Java VM) transmits data of the IC card API to an IC card driver through system S\/W together with the control message. Next, the control message is manipulated at the IC card , thus making it possible to set the PIN information.","Further, in the IC card , some of financial accounts of the user himself\/herself or any other person can be registered and managed by selection of the user as \u201cfavorite deposit accounts\u201d together with information on their depositors in order to facilitate transferring\/remitting money.","The IC card  not only permits access to its stored information only through the PIN authentication, but it can be also attached and used to the mobile communication system  if necessary, and can be separately kept if not used. Thus, it is possible not only to provide convenience of the user when the user inputs information related to the financial accounts but also to ensure security of the inputted information.","Moreover, the mobile communication system  and the banking server  may fundamentally make use of an encryption solution such as E2E (end to end), WPKI (wireless public key infrastructure) etc. for security of data and financial information under the mobile environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"10"},"Referring to , a configuration of software (S\/W) mounted on a memory device of the mobile communication system  has an IC card driver  and system S\/W , which are established as a lower structure, a Java VM (MIDP & MMDP) , and a banking application  and an IC card API , which are established as an upper structure, wherein the IC card driver  is for managing data of the IC card , and the system S\/W  is for managing basic functions of the mobile communication system .","The banking application  is a process S\/W program for executing mobile banking transactions such as account inquiry, transfer\/remittance of funds, loan\/paymnent, and so forth.","The Java VM  is an intermediate code defined so as to allow the (mobile) banking application  to be executed by a virtual machine regardless of an operation system (O\/S) or a platform.","The banking application , as an S\/W program having a series of processes for the mobile account inquiry, receives data and selection instructions through the mobile communication system  or outputs a result of the account inquiry etc., and transmits\/receives data to\/from the IC card  and the banking server .","The banking application  and the IC card API  can perform upgrading independently of the lower structure by use of the functions of the Java VM , and can perform both downloading and upgrading of S\/W through a wireless network.","Meanwhile, a brief description will be made below regarding a process of having access to the IC card  at the banking application .","In the present invention, in order to read out the PIN information and financial account information stored in the IC card , the IC card API  is invoked at the banking application , and the Java VM  transmits the read instructions of the corresponding information to the IC card driver  though the system S\/W  on the basis of the data of the IC card API . Thereby, the IC card driver  drives the IC card  to read out the corresponding information.","Furthermore, the banking application  processes the information which is read out from the IC card , displays it in a display window of the mobile communication system , and requests the banking server  to transmit information caused by the mobile banking services such as the mobile account inquiry, the mobile transfer\/remittance of funds, and the mobile loan account inquiry and loan interest payment.","Hereinafter, each embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings, wherein each embodiment relates to the mobile banking services such as the account inquiry, the transfer\/remittance, the loan account inquiry and payment of the loan interest and so forth.","In each embodiment that will be set forth below, the banking application  has different terms according to each banking service. For example, the banking application  may be classified into an account inquiry application, a transfer\/remittance application and a loan\/payment application, which are all given the same reference number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["11","10","40"]},"Referring to , in order to use the mobile account inquiry service according to the first embodiment, an electronic bankbook service is selected through an mobile banking (M\/B) dedicated key or a menu item that is installed on the mobile communication system  as illustrated in  (S). Then, among the options of the electronic bankbook service, any one, namely an account inquiry service is selected (S).","When the account inquiry service is selected from the options of the electronic bankbook service, the banking application or account inquiry application  activates an input screen of the PIN information in the display window of the mobile communication system  in response to an input signal of the key. Then, when the PIN information is inputted by a user, the account inquiry application  has access to the IC card , reads out the PIN information which has been stored in the IC card , and performs PIN authentication by a comparison of the inputted PIN information with the read-out PIN information (S).","When the password of the IC card , i.e., the PIN information, inputted through the mobile communication system  is matched with the PIN information stored in the IC card and then a login is completed to the IC card , the account inquiry application  outputs financial accounts of the user stored in the IC card  to the display window of the mobile communication system . Thereby, the user checks the kinds of financial accounts and has a list of all general financial accounts outputted to the display window, excluding loan accounts (S).","Then, the user selects one financial account intended for inquiry from the financial account list outputted to the display window of the mobile communication system  and requests the account inquiry (S). In response to this request, the account inquiry application  verifies information on the financial account selected by the user (i.e., account number and password, financial institution code, customer information, etc.) by the IC card , and constructs an account inquiry request message including the verified information.","The mobile communication system  has socket access to the banking server  through the BTS\/BSC  and the PDSN  to establish a data transmission line (S), and forwards the constructed account inquiry request message to request information on a late transaction history of the selected financial account (S). In this case, the mobile communication system  may do so after receiving start and end dates for the account inquiry from the user.","Thus, the banking server  carries out the authentication procedure through the selected financial account information such as the account number and password, the financial institution code, the customer information, etc., which are transmitted from the mobile communication system . When the authentication of the financial account is completed, the banking server  extracts the transaction history information within a recent or designated inquiry time period from a host server, constructs a transaction history response message including the extracted transaction history information, and transmits the constructed transaction history response message to the corresponding mobile communication system  (S).","When the mobile communication system  normally receives the transaction history information on the financial account inquiry through the above-mentioned processes, the data transmission line between the mobile communication system  and the banking server  is released (S), and the account inquiry application  outputs information on date-specific transaction history, balance, etc., of the financial account to the display window of the mobile communication system  (S).","As set forth above, in the present invention, the account number and password, the customer information, etc., are processed by option selection and automatic input without separately inputting them, so that it is possible to afford convenience to the user. Further, the mobile communication system carries out a series of processes such as selection of the financial account in advance, has access to the banking server, and proceeds the account inquiry process, so that it is possible to reduce the time for having access to the banking server and network loads of the communication network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["10","12"]},"Referring to , in order to carry out the banking services, the user presses the M\/B dedicated key installed on the mobile communication system  to activate the electronic bankbook service , and then selects the account inquiry service (inquiry\/transfer of funds on deposit) among the options of the electronic bankbook service .","The display window of the mobile communication system  allows the input screen of the PIN information for launching the account inquiry service to be displayed .

Further, the user can inquires of the overview of the loan and details of the loan interest, and pay the loan interest and\/or principal.","As set forth above, according to the present invention, when the user makes use of the banking services by use of this mobile communication system, the procedure of inputting the account number and ID (PIN)\/password through the mobile communication system each time is omitted, because a removable IC card and a banking application driven on the Java VM are used. Therefore, it is possible to facilitate banking of the user.","Further, according to the present invention, various kinds of mobile banking or authentication are processed before a mobile communication system has access to a banking server. Thus, it is possible to minimize the access time between the mobile communication system and the banking server, and thus, to reduce communication charges of the user, and to minimize network loads of the communication network.","Moreover, it is possible to reinforce security of data and financial information under the mobile environment by the PIN authentication with the removable IC card or any other security modules.","While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
