title: Integrated security system
abstract: A network device used to provide network security includes an interface configured to receive data transmitted over a network. The network device also includes a firewall, intrusion detection logic and forwarding logic. The firewall, intrusion detection logic and forwarding logic process the received data to determine whether the data contains malicious content. When the data contains malicious content, the data may be dropped before it reaches a user device to which the received data was sent. Optionally, the network device may interact with an external device in order to make the forwarding decision. In addition, the network device may subscribe to services offered by the external device to receive updated security information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Exemplary System","Exemplary Processing"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to security systems and, more particularly, to providing an integrated security system for users receiving and transmitting information via a network.","The number of user communicating over public networks, such as the Internet, has increased significantly over the last several years. As a result, companies are providing more products and services over the Internet. Customers may access these products\/services using a personal computer (PC). The customer's PC may include anti-virus software that protects the PC from malicious viruses.","One problem with using conventional commercial off the shelf anti-virus software is that such software is often unable to detect sophisticated attacks and\/or prevent unauthorized users from accessing personal data stored on the customer's PC. In addition, the use of non-PC based devices, such as network appliances, televisions, etc., to access products\/services via the Internet has become increasingly common. Typically, these non-PC based devices include no security mechanisms to combat viruses or other malicious attacks. Therefore, the customer is often left unprotected when accessing products\/services over the Internet.","There exists a need for systems and methods that provide security for users accessing a public network.","These and other needs are met by the present invention where an integrated security device may be connected to an Internet access device to provide security features. The security device may be modular and may perform a number of security functions to provide\/enhance security.","According to one aspect of the invention, a device including at least one interface, a firewall, intrusion detection logic and forwarding logic is provided. The interface is configured to receive data transmitted via a network and the firewall is configured to receive data from the interface. The firewall is also configured to determine whether the data potentially contains malicious content and identify first data in the received data that potentially contains malicious content. The intrusion detection logic is configured to receive the first data and generate report information based on the first data. The forwarding logic is configured to receive the report information and determine whether to forward the first data for processing by a user application based on the report information.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer-readable medium having stored instructions which when executed by a processor, cause the processor to receive data transmitted via a network and receive at least one set of rules from an external device, where the at least one set of rules is associated with processing the received data. The instructions also cause the processor to determine whether the data may contain malicious content using a first set of rules and identify first data that may contain malicious content based on the determining. The instructions further cause the processor to determine whether to forward the first data to a user device based on a second set of rules.","A further aspect of the present invention provides a method for providing security information to a number of user devices. The method includes storing, by a security provider, rules-based security information. The method also includes providing, by the security provider, a number of subscription levels, where each subscription level is associated with a different security level and has a different set of rules-based security information. The method further includes, downloading, by the security provider, a first set of rules-based security information to a first one of the user devices. The downloading is performed in response to at least one of a request from the first user device and a subscription associated with the first user device.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description. The embodiments shown and described provide illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","The following detailed description of implementations consistent with the present invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide a network security device that integrates a number of security functions in a modular unit. The security services\/processing performed by the network security device may include, for example, firewall services, intrusion detection services, data forwarding services and virtual private network (VPN) related processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","130","140","150","130","110","120","120","130","120","130","120","130","100"]},"Network  may include, for example, the Internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), and\/or some other similar type of network that is capable of transmitting data, such as voice and data communications. In fact, network  may include any type of network or combination of networks that permits routing of information from a particular source to a particular destination.","Interface device  may be a modular device that provides security-related processing for user device . Interface device , consistent with the present invention, may provide firewall processing, intrusion detection processing, data forwarding processing, VPN-related processing, etc., as described in more detail below. Interface device  may connect to network  via any conventional technique, such as wired, wireless, or optical connections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["120","120","210","220","230","240","250","260","270","280","290","290","120","120"]},"Processor  may include any type of conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. Storage device  may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor . Storage device  may also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor . Storage device  may also include a read only memory (ROM) device and\/or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for processor . Storage device  may further include a magnetic disk or optical disk and its corresponding drive and\/or some other type of magnetic or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive for storing information and\/or instructions. In an exemplary implementation consistent with the present invention, processor  may execute operating system software stored in storage device . The operating system may provide the platform for integrating the various components\/modules of interface device  and enable interface device  to manage, configure and provision services in real-time or near real-time.","Communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables interface device  to communicate with other devices and\/or systems, such as user device  and network . For example, communication interface  may include a modem or an Ethernet interface to a network. Communication interface  may also include an application programming interface (API) that provides an interface between interface device  (e.g., the operating system being executed by processor ) and an application program being executed by user device . Any conventional API may be used based on the particular system's requirements and\/or the particular application program being executed by user device . Communication interface  may present a received data stream to user device  via the API. Alternatively, communication interface  may include other mechanisms for communicating via a data network.","Firewall  provides packet filtering capabilities for interface device . In one implementation, this filtering may be based on a set of rules that causes firewall  to perform an action on incoming traffic based on, for example, the Internet Protocol (IP) source address, IP destination address, and\/or other fields\/information included in the data stream. For example, firewall  may permit the received traffic to be forwarded to user device  or may drop or block the traffic from reaching user device  when the incoming traffic fails to satisfy the set of rules stored by firewall . Firewall  may also include an anti-virus module that scans the incoming data streams for viruses. The anti-virus module may use signature-based rules or heuristic-based techniques to detect a virus. Firewall  may also detect other forms of malicious content or unwanted data. The term \u201cmalicious content\u201d may encompass, for example, unsolicited messages or e-mails, also referred to as \u201cspam,\u201d and other types of malicious data, such as viruses. Firewall  may use conventional techniques to detect spam or similar information received by interface device  and may also discard this type of unwanted data.","Firewall , consistent with the present invention, may also apply different sets of rules based on the particular type of data it receives (e.g., video data, music data, etc.), the particular type of application being executed by user device , the provider of the received data (i.e., the source) or other factors. Firewall  may receive the rules from an external device, such as CMS . CMS , consistent with the present invention, may provide the particular rules to interface device  on a subscription basis. That is, a user associated with user device  and interface device  may subscribe to security services with CMS , as described in more detail below.","VPN gateway  may include logic for setting up secure tunnels to other devices in system  over network , such as CMS . VPN gateway  may encrypt data for transmission over the secure tunnel. VPN gateway  may also decrypt encrypted payloads and assemble the decrypted payloads for use by other devices in interface device , such as firewall .","Intrusion detection logic  may receive information from other devices in interface device  indicating the detection of anomalous events. For example, intrusion detection logic  may receive data packets from firewall  which match a particular viral signature. Intrusion detection logic  may correlate the data packets to the particular viral signatures and provide a normalized, filtered report for use by other devices\/systems. For example, intrusion detection logic  may provide a report that indicates the number of packets, number of bytes, source address, destination address, etc., associated with the anomalous packets that match the viral signature. Intrusion detection logic  may also take the incoming data streams and correlate events associated with the data streams into a normalized or standardized form. For example, all events associated with the data streams may be stored in a database utilizing uniform records and fields. Intrusion detection logic  may then filter the events by combining a number of similar events into a single event, thereby reducing the overall data set size.","Forwarding logic  may receive information from other devices, such as intrusion detection logic . Forwarding logic  may determine whether to pass received information to other devices, such as user device . Forwarding logic  may make the determination on whether to pass a data stream to user device  based on a set of stored rules. Based on the stored rules, forwarding logic  may pass the data stream or defer the decision on whether to forward the data stream to the application (i.e., user device ) to CMS . For example, forwarding logic  may include a set of IF-THEN-ELSE statements, such as a set a computer aided software engineering (CASE) statements in C, where all decision trees may lead to passing the data stream to user device  or deferring the decision to CMS . In some implementations, forwarding logic  may perform an error recovery procedure on the received data stream by removing the malicious content.","Input\/output device  may include any conventional mechanism that permits an operator to input information to interface device , such as a keyboard, a mouse, a microphone, a pen, a biometric input device, such as voice recognition device, etc. Input\/output device  may also include any conventional mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc.","Returning to , each user device  may include any type of computer system, such as a personal computer (PC), laptop, etc., that is capable of transmitting and receiving voice and\/or data communications via network . User devices  may also include non-computer or non-PC based devices, such as a network appliance, a set top box for interfacing between a monitor (e.g., a television) and a network, a television-type Internet access device, or some other type of device that is capable of transmitting and receiving information to\/from network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","130","310","320","330","340","350","360","310","130"]},"Processor  may include any type of conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. Memory  may include a RAM or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor ; a ROM or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for use by processor ; and\/or some type of magnetic or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.","Input device  may include any conventional mechanism that permits an operator to input information to user device , such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and\/or biometric mechanisms, and the like. Output device  may include any conventional mechanism that outputs information to the operator, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc. Communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables user device  to communicate with other devices and\/or systems, such as interface device , integrated applications, traditional telephony systems, etc., via wired, wireless, and\/or optical connections.","In alternative implementations, user device  and interface device  may be integrated into a single device. For example, some or all of the functions performed by user device , such as executing application programs associated with receiving and transmitting information via network , may be performed by interface device  and vice versa. In other words, the security functions described above with respect to interface device  may be built into a user device , such as a PC-based device, a network appliance, a set top box, a TV-type device, etc.","Returning to , CMS  may provide security related information to users and their corresponding interface devices . For example, CMS  may analyze patterns of attacks to create rules and signatures associated with attacks.","CMS , consistent with the present invention, may provide the particular rules to interface devices  on a subscription basis. That is, a user associated with user device  and interface device  may subscribe to security services with CMS . The security services provided by CMS  may include multiple service levels. The user may select the particular service level based on the particular user's requirements. In this manner, a user may determine the desired level of security he\/she wishes to obtain and may subscribe to the corresponding service level with CMS . In addition, CMS  may adjust\/modify the rules applied by firewall  in a real-time or near real-time manner, as described in more detail below.","Users may also request security information\/services from CMS  on an as-needed basis instead of subscribing for security services with CMS . In this case, the user may pay for security-related services when requesting information from CMS . In either case (i.e., subscription-based or request-based), CMS  may download the security related information for use by interface devices . The security information may include rules that may be used by firewall , intrusion detection logic  and forwarding logic  to perform the functions described above. CMS  may periodically update these rules. For example, when new viruses are detected, CMS  may modify or provide new rules to firewall  that may then be used to detect the new virus. CMS  may provide these updated rules at predetermined intervals or as needed.","CMS , as discussed above, may support a number of service levels. For example, a user may subscribe to any one of a number of security levels, e.g., up to four or more service levels, such as \u201cbronze,\u201d \u201csilver,\u201d \u201cgold\u201d and \u201cplatinum.\u201d Each service level may have its own set of rules and CMS  may download the appropriate rules to interface devices  based on their respective subscription levels. For example, the platinum level may represent the highest security level and include the most stringent rules associated with allowing received data to be forwarded to user devices . CMS  may provide these rules to interface devices  using VPN tunnels established with the respective interface devices .","CMS  may also represent a service point of decision for making routing decisions on behalf of interface devices . For example, CMS  may receive information from an interface device  and determine whether a particular data stream received by interface device  should be forwarded to a user application being executed by user device . CMS  may be a provider-based point of decision associated with a particular service provider associated with routing data via network . CMS  may also be associated with multiple service providers or may be associated with no particular service provider. In each case, CMS  may gather information and assess service wide patterns, such as attack patterns, using known correlation techniques. CMS  may include any combination of software\/hardware based systems to assist the provider in gathering and assessing the information. A human operator of CMS  may also aid in determining the appropriate action, as described in more detail below. It should also be understood that CMS  may process data received from a number of interface devices  at the same time.","Server  may include any conventional server or computer-based system that provides information to user device  via its corresponding interface device . Server  may, for example, represent a company providing products such as video-on-demand, video-based training, downloadable music files or games, on-line gaming, on-line shopping or any other service\/product over network .","As discussed previously, interface device  may perform a number of security-related functions associated with receiving data over network . In implementations consistent with the present invention, the functions performed by the components\/modules of interface device  may be performed by one or more processors executing sequences of instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as storage device . In alternative embodiments, each of the modules\/components may include hardwired circuitry and\/or any combination of hardware, firmware and software. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","120","130","230","410","150","130","110","130","150","150","130","150","120","110","230","240"]},"Firewall  may receive the data and apply a predetermined set of rules to determine whether the data contains anomalies or malicious content (act ). For example, as described previously, firewall  may include an anti-virus module. The anti-virus module may scan the incoming data to determine whether the received data includes a virus or other attack-related data. The anti-virus module may use signature-based techniques and\/or heuristic techniques to detect viruses and\/or other malicious content. For example, heuristic-based techniques may look for common text, transmission characteristics or content patterns that were previously shown to be related to a virus or malicious content.","The anti-virus module may also use \u201crough set logic\u201d to detect viruses and\/or other malicious content. As understood by those of ordinary skill in this art, rough set logic may look at every piece of content it receives to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) type engine to analyze data received at a later time. For example, the rough set logic may examine all the bytes of a received data stream and \u201cscore\u201d the data stream to determine whether the data is appropriate for the user. As additional data streams are received, the rough set logic continues to refine its scoring process based on information gained from previous data streams. In this manner, the rough set logic continues to update and refine its processing to identify malicious content. In any of the above cases (i.e., using rules-based techniques, heuristic-based techniques, rough set logic or any combination of these or other techniques), if the anti-virus module does not detect anomalies or malicious content, firewall  forwards the data stream to user device  (act ).","However, if the anti-virus module detects anomalies or malicious content, firewall  may forward the data stream to intrusion detection logic  (act ). Intrusion detection logic  receives the data stream from firewall  and may filter\/normalize the received data (act ). For example, intrusion detection logic  may count the number of packets, number of bytes, etc., of the received data stream that includes anomalies. Intrusion detection logic  may also provide the normalized data in a concise report format. Intrusion detection logic  may then forward the filtered\/normalized report data to forwarding logic  (act ).","Forwarding logic  receives the report data from intrusion detection logic  and determines if the data steam associated with the report data should be forwarded to its intended destination (e.g., user device ) (act ). Forwarding logic  may use a pre-stored set of rules to determine if the data should be passed to user device . In the event that the data is to be forwarded to user device  (i.e., indicating that the anomalies are not related to malicious content), forwarding logic  forwards the data to user device  (act ).","If forwarding logic  determines that the data is not to be forwarded to user device  (i.e., indicating that the anomalies are related to malicious intent and are not for legitimate purposes), the data may be discarded (act ). That is, forwarding logic  may delete the received data stream. In implementations consistent with the present invention, the received data stream may be stored or buffered in a memory, such as storage device , while the data stream is being examined for malicious content. In an exemplary implementation, the data stream may be \u201cquarantined\u201d in a memory while the data is being examined. That is, the data stream may be stored for a temporary period of time until the examination determines whether the data contains malicious content. While the data is quarantined, the data may be separated from other \u201cgood\u201d data.","In an alternative implementation consistent with the present invention, forwarding logic  may defer the decision on whether to forward the data to user device  to an external entity, such as CMS . In this case, forwarding logic  forwards the report information to CMS  (act ; ). Interface device  may use a secure tunnel\/connection established by VPN gateway  when communicating with CMS . It should be understood that CMS  may not receive the actual data stream from interface device , but may receive report information with pertinent data that may be used by CMS  to determine whether the data stream contains malicious content. The actual data stream may by stored on interface device . In some implementations, however, the actual data stream may be forwarded to CMS .","CMS  may then analyze the report data based on predetermined rules to determine whether the data should be forwarded to user device  (act ). CMS  may automatically make this determination based on predetermined rules stored in CMS . A human operator of CMS  may also assist in determining whether the data should be forwarded to user device .","If CMS  determines that the data should not be forwarded to user device , CMS  signals interface device  to discard the data (act ). If CMS  determines that the data may be forwarded to user device , CMS  signals interface device  to forward the data to user device  (act ). Interface device  receives the indication from CMS  and acts accordingly (act ). That is, interface device  either forwards the data to user device  or drops the data, based on the instructions from CMS .","In summary, interface device  provides a number of security functions in a single, modular device. The services provided may include firewall services, intrusion detection services, data forwarding services and VPN related services. In addition, interface device  operates in an efficient, seamless manner with respect to user device . Therefore, the end user experiences no loss in satisfaction associated with receiving information via network  and executing applications.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide a flexible system and method for providing increased network security. An advantage of the invention is that interface device  has the capability to identify and respond to widespread attack vectors across the Internet. In addition, the invention is scalable across a large number of customers (i.e., interface devices ). Further, multiple central management systems  may be distributed to provide load balancing for a large number of customers. The invention also provides a layered security defense for set top applications or programs that process data on a peer-to-peer basis, a distributed network, a grid-based network, a LAN, a wireless network, or any other similar network. Another advantage of the invention is that interface device  and CMS  provide for cost-effective mechanisms to update and maintain security for users as new security threats are identified.","In this disclosure, there is shown and described only the preferred embodiments of the invention, but, as aforementioned, it is to be understood that the invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein.","For example, the present invention has been described mainly with respect to a separate interface device  being used to process data for a user device . However, as discussed above, the functions of the interface device  and user device  may be combined in implementations consistent with the present invention. In addition, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular combination of hardware\/software\/firmware. Further, actions described as being performed by a particular device, module or logic in interface device  may alternatively be performed by another device\/module\/logic or may be performed by a single element. Lastly, aspects of the present invention have been described as series of acts in relation to . It should be understood that the order of these acts may vary in other implementations of the present invention. Moreover, non-dependent acts may be performed in parallel.","No element, act or instruction used in the description of the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items.
