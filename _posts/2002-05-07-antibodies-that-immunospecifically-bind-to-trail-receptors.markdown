Each of the above identified applications is herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present invention relates to antibodies and related molecules that immunospecifically bind to TRAIL receptor, TR4. Such antibodies have uses, for example, in the prevention and treatment of cancers and other proliferative disorders. The invention also relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding anti-TR4 antibodies, vectors and host cells containing these nucleic acids, and methods for producing the same. The present invention relates to methods and compositions for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, treating or ameliorating a disease or disorder, especially cancer and other hyperproliferative disorders, comprising administering to an animal, preferably a human, an effective amount of one or more antibodies or fragments or variants thereof, or related molecules, that immunospecifically bind to TR4.","Many biological actions, for instance, response to certain stimuli and natural biological processes, are controlled by factors, such as cytokines. Many cytokines act through receptors by engaging the receptor and producing an intra-cellular response.","For example, tumor necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta are cytokines which act through TNF receptors to regulate numerous biological processes, including protection against infection and induction of shock and inflammatory disease. The TNF molecules belong to the \u201cTNF-ligand\u201d superfamily, and act together with their receptors or counter-ligands, the \u201cTNF-receptor\u201d superfamily. So far, at least eighteen members of the TNF ligand superfamily have been identified and at least nineteen members of the TNF-receptor superfamily have been characterized (See, e.g., Locksley et el., (2001) 104:487\u2013501).","Among the ligands there are included TNF-\u03b1, lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LT-\u03b1, also known as TNF-\u03b2), LT-\u03b2 (found in complex heterotrimer LT-\u03b12-\u03b2), FasL, CD40L, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, OX40L and nerve growth factor (NGF). The superfamily of TNF receptors includes the p55TNF receptor, p75TNF receptor, TNF receptor-related protein, FAS antigen or APO-1, CD40, CD27, CD30, 4-1BB, OX40, low affinity p75 and NGF-receptor (Meager, A., 22:291\u2013295 (1994)).","Many members of the TNF-ligand superfamily are expressed by activated T-cells, implying that they are necessary for T-cell interactions with other cell types which underlie cell ontogeny and functions. (Meager, A., supra).","Considerable insight into the essential functions of several members of the TNF receptor family has been gained from the identification and creation of mutants that abolish the expression of these proteins. For example, naturally occurring mutations in the FAS antigen and its ligand cause lymphoproliferative disease (Watanabe-Fukunaga, R., et al., 356:314 (1992)), perhaps reflecting a failure of programmed cell death. Mutations of the CD40 ligand cause an X-linked immunodeficiency state characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin M and low levels of immunoglobulin G in plasma, indicating faulty T-cell-dependent B-cell activation (Allen, R. C. et al., 259:990 (1993)). Targeted mutations of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor cause a disorder characterized by faulty sensory innovation of peripheral structures (Lee, K. F. et al., 69:737 (1992)).","TNF and LT-\u03b1 are capable of binding to two TNF receptors (the 55- and 75-kd TNF receptors). A large number of biological effects elicited by TNF and LT-\u03b1, acting through their receptors, include hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted tumors, cytotoxicity, a role in endotoxic shock, inflammation, immunoregulation, proliferation and anti-viral responses, as well as protection against the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. TNF and LT-\u03b1 are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseased, including endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, tumors, autoimmune disease, AIDS and graft-host rejection (Beutler, B. and Von Huffel, C., 264:667\u2013668 (1994)). Mutations in the p55 Receptor cause increased susceptibility to microbial infection.","Moreover, an about 80 amino acid domain near the C-terminus of TNFR1 (p55) and Fas was reported as the \u201cdeath domain,\u201d which is responsible for tranducing signals for programmed cell death (Tartaglia et al., 74:845 (1993)).","Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiologic process essential to the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (H. Steller, 267, 1445\u20131449 (1995)). Derangements of apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (C. B. Thompson, 267, 1456\u20131462 (1995)). Recently, much attention has focused on the signal transduction and biological function of two cell surface death receptors, Fas\/APO-1 and TNFR-1 (J. L. Cleveland, et al., 81, 479\u2013482 (1995); A. Fraser, et al., 85, 781\u2013784 (1996); S. Nagata, et al., 267, 1449\u201356 (1995)). Both are members of the TNF receptor family which also include TNFR-2, low affinity NGFR, CD40 and CD30, among others (C. A. Smith, et al., 248, 1019\u201323 (1990); M. Tewari, et al., in M. Purton, Heldin, Carl, Ed. (Chapman and Hall, London, 1995). While family members are defined by the presence of cysteine-rich repeats in their extracellular domains, Fas\/APO-1 and TNFR-1 also share a region of intracellular homology, appropriately designated the \u201cdeath domain\u201d, which is distantly related to the Drosophila suicide gene, reaper (P. Golstein, et al., 81, 185\u20136 (1995); K. White et al., 264, 677\u201383 (1994)). This shared death domain suggests that both receptors interact with a related set of signal transducing molecules that, until recently, remained unidentified. Activation of Fas\/APO-1 recruits the death domain-containing adapter molecule FADD\/MORT1 (A. M. Chinnaiyan, et al., 81, 505\u201312 (1995); M. P. Boldin, et al., 270, 7795\u20138 (1995); F. C. Keschkel, et al., 14, 5579\u20135588 (1995)), which in turn binds and presumably activated FLICE\/MACH1, a member of the ICE\/CED-3 family of pro-apoptotic proteases (M. Muzio et al., 85, 817\u2013827 (1996); M. P. Boldin, et al., 85, 803\u2013815 (1996)). While the central role of Fas\/APO-1 is to trigger cell death, TNFR-1 can signal an array of diverse biological activities-many of which stem from its ability to activate NF-kB (L. A. Tartaglia, et al., 13, 151\u20133 (1992)). Accordingly, TNFR-1 recruits the multivalent adapter molecule TRADD, which like FADD, also contains a death domain (H. Hsu, et al., 81, 495\u2013504 (1995); H. Hsu, et al., 84, 299\u2013308 (1996)). Through its associations with a number of signaling molecules including FADD, TRAF2, and RIP, TRADD can signal both apoptosis and NF-kB activation (H. Hsu, et al., 84, 299\u2013308 (1996); H. Hsu, et al., 4, 387\u2013396 (1996)).","One TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand has been reported by several groups and has been ascribed the name Apoptosis Inducing Molecule I (AIM-I) (Intenation Application No. WO 97\/33899) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or (TRAIL) (Wiley, S. R. et al., 3:673\u2013682 (1995)). Pitti, R. M. et al., refer to the new molecule as Apo-2 ligand or (\u201cApo-2L\u201d). For convenience, it will be referred to herein as TRAIL. The amino acid sequence of TRAIL is given in SEQ ID NO:66.","Unlike FAS ligand whose transcripts appear to be largely restricted to stimulated T-cells, significant levels of TRAIL are seen in many tissues, and it is constitutively transcribed by some cell lines. It has been shown that TRAIL acts independently from FAS ligand (Wiley, S. R., et al. (1995)), supra). Studies by Marsters, S. A. et al., have indicated that TRAIL activates apoptosis rapidly, with a time frame that is similar to death signalling by FAS\/Apo-1L but much faster that TNF-induced apoptosis (6:750\u2013752 (1996)).","As many as five TRAIL receptors have been identified, including TR4 (also known as TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) and death receptor 4 (DR4), Pan et al., Science 276:111\u20133 (1997), International Patent Application Nos. WO98\/32856, WO00\/67793, WO99\/37684, WO2000\/34355, WO99\/02653, SEQ ID NO:1); TR7 (also referred to as TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2), DR5, and KILLER, Pan et al., Science 277:815\u20138 (1997), Sheridan et al., Science 277:818\u201321 (1997), Chaudhury et al., Immunity 7:821\u201330 (1997), International Patent Application Nos. WO98\/46643, WO99\/09165, WO99\/11791, WO98\/41629, WO00\/66156, and WO98\/35986, SEQ ID NO:3); TR1 (also referred to as Osteoprotegrin (OPG) osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF), TNFRSF11B, and FTHMA-090 (International Patent Application Nos. WO98\/12344, WO2000\/54651, WO2001\/04137, WO66\/26217, WO98\/07840, WO2000\/21554, WO99\/53942, and WO2001\/03719, SEQ ID NO:5); TR5 (also referred to as TRAIL receptor 3 (TRAIL-R3), decoy receptor 1 (DcR1) and TRID) (Degli-Esposti et al., J. Exp. Med. 186:1165\u201370 (1997), International Patent Application Nos. WO98\/30693, WO00\/71150, WO99\/00423, EP867509, WO98\/58062, SEQ ID NO:2); and TR10 (also referred to as TRAIL Receptor 4 (TRAIL-R4), DcR2, and TRUNDD, Pan et al., FEBS Lett. 424:41\u20135 (1998), Degli-Eposti et al., Immunity 7:813\u201320 (1997), International Patent Application Nos.

TR4 and TR7 contain death domains in their cytoplasmic tails and the triggering of these receptors results in apoptosis. On the other hand, TR1, TR5 and TR10 can inhibit apoptosis induced by the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL in part because of their absent or truncated cytoplasmic death domains, respectively.

When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide at the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=number of identical overlapping positions\/total number of positions\u00d7100%). In one embodiment, the two sequences are the same length.","The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm known to those of skill in the art. An example of a mathematical algorithm for comparing two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul 87:2264\u20132268(1009), modified as in Karlin and Altschul 90:5873\u20135877(1993). The BLASTn and BLASTx programs of Altschul, et al. 215:403\u2013410(1990) have incorporated such an algorithm. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTn program (score=100, wordlength=12) to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTx program (score=50, wordlength=3) to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 25:3589\u20133402(1997). Alternatively, PSI-BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTx and BLASTn) can be used. (See http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.)","Another example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, CABIOS (1989). The ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package has incorporated such an algorithm. Other algorithms for sequence analysis known in the art include ADVANCE and ADAM as described in Torellis and Robotti 10:3\u20135(1994); and FASTA described in Pearson and Lipman 85:2444\u20138(1988). Within FASTA, ktup is a control option that sets the sensitivity and speed of the search.","The term \u201cderivative\u201d as used herein, refers to a variant polypeptide of the invention that comprises, or alternatively consists of, an amino acid sequence of a TR4 polypeptide, a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide, or an antibody of the invention that immunospecifically binds to a TR4 polypeptide, which has been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions. The term \u201cderivative\u201d as used herein also refers to a TR4 polypeptide, a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide, an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a TR4 polypeptide which has been modified, e.g., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the polypeptide. For example, but not by way of limitation, a TR4 polypeptide, a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide, or an anti-TR4 antibody, may be modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein. etc. A derivative of a TR4 polypeptide, a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide, or an anti-TR4 antibody, may be modified by chemical modifications using techniques known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Further, a derivative of a TR4 polypeptide, a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide, or an anti-TR4 antibody, may contain one or more non-classical amino acids. A polypeptide derivative possesses a similar or identical function as a TR4 polypeptide, a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide, or an anti-TR4 antibody, described herein.","The term \u201cepitopes\u201d as used herein refers to portions of TR4 having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably a mammal. An epitope having immunogenic activity is a portion of TR4 that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An eptiope having antigenic activity is a portion of TR4 to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any method known in the art, for example, by the immunoassays described herein. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.","The term \u201cfragment\u201d as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of at least 5 amino acid residues, at least 10 amino acid residues, at least 15 amino acid residues, at least 20 amino acid residues, at least 25 amino acid residues, at least 30 amino acid residues, at least 35 amino acid residues, at least 40 amino acid residues, at least 45 amino acid residues, at least 50 amino acid residues, at least 60 amino residues, at least 70 amino acid residues, at least 80 amino acid residues, at least 90 amino acid residues, at least 100 amino acid residues, at least 125 amino acid residues, at least 150 amino acid residues, at least 175 amino acid residues, at least 200 amino acid residues, or at least 250 amino acid residues, of the amino acid sequence of TR4, or an anti-TR4 antibody (including molecules such as scFv's, that comprise, or alternatively consist of, antibody fragments or variants thereof).","The term \u201cfusion protein\u201d as used herein refers to a polypeptide that comprises, or alternatively consists of, an amino acid sequence of an anti-TR4 antibody of the invention and an amino acid sequence of a heterologous polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide unrelated to an antibody or antibody domain).","The term \u201chost cell\u201d as used herein refers to the particular subject cell transfected with a nucleic acid molecule and the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Progeny may not be identical to the parent cell transfected with the nucleic acid molecule due to mutations or environmental influences that may occur in succeeding generations or integration of the nucleic acid molecule into the host cell genome.","Antibodies of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form, and preferably are substantially purified. By \u201cisolated\u201d is intended an antibody removed from its native environment. Thus, for example, a polypeptide produced and\/or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention.","Antibody Structure","The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kDa) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50\u201370 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, 1gG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. See generally, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light\/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.","Thus, an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same.","The chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the heavy and the ligt chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia & Lesk 196:901\u2013917 (1987); Chothia et al. 342:878\u2013883 (1989).","A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy\/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas of linking of Fab\u2032 fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann 79: 315\u2013321 (1990), Kostelny et al. 148:1547 1553 (1992). In addition, bispecific antibodies may be formed as \u201cdiabodies\u201d (Holliger et al. \u201c\u2018Diabodies\u2019: small bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments\u201d PNAS USA 90:6444\u20136448 (1993)) or \u201cJanusins\u201d (Traunecker et al. \u201cBispecific single chain molecules (Janusins) target cytotoxic lymphocytes on HIV infected cells\u201d 10:3655\u20133659 (1991) and Traunecker et al. \u201cJanusin: new molecular design for bispecific reagents\u201d 7:51\u201352 (1992)).","Production of bispecific antibodies can be a relatively labor intensive process compared with production of conventional antibodies and yields and degree of purity are generally lower for bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies do not exist in the form of fragments having a single binding site (e.g., Fab, Fab\u2032, and Fv).","Anti-TR4 Antibodies","Using phage display technology, the present inventors have identified single chain antibody molecules (\u201cscFvs\u201d) that immunospecifically bind to TR4 (or fragments or variants thereof). Molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, fragments or variants of these scFvs (e.g., including VH domains, VH CDRs, VL domains, or VL CDRs having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1), that immunospecifically bind to TR4 (or fragments of variants thereof) are also encompassed by the invention, as are nucleic acid molecules that encode these scFvs, and\/or molecules.","In particular, the invention relates to scFvs comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 42\u201353, preferably SEQ ID NOs:42 and 43 as referred to in Table 1 below. Molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, fragments or variants of these scFvs (e.g., including VH domains, VH CDRs, VL domains, or VL CDRs having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1), that immunospecifically bind to TR4 are also encompassed by the invention, as are nucleic acid molecules that encode these scFvs, and\/or molecules (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:54\u201365).","ScFvs corresponding to SEQ ID NOS:42\u201353 were selected for their ability bind TR4 polypeptide.","The present invention provides antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to a polypeptide or a polypeptide fragment of TR4. In particular, the invention provides antibodies corresponding to the scFvs referred to in Table 1. Such scFvs may routinely be \u201cconverted\u201d to immunoglobulin molecules by inserting, for example, the nucleotide sequences encoding the VH and\/or VL domains of the scFvs into an expression vector containing the constant domain sequences and engineered to direct the expression of the immunoglobulin molecule, as described in more detain in Example 5 below.","NS0 cell lines that express IgG1 antibodies that comprise the VH and VL domains of scFvs of the invention have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u201d) on the dates listed in Table 1 and given the ATCC Deposit Numbers identified in Table 1. The ATCC is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides antibodies that comprise the VH and VL domains of scFvs of the invention.","In a preferred embodiment, an antibody of the invention is the antibody expressed by cell

present invention encompasses antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to a TR4 polypeptide or a

A TR4 polypeptide includes, but is not limited to, TR4 (SEQ ID NO:1) or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA in clone HCUDS60 contained in ATCC Deposit 97853 deposited Jan. 21, 1997. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention may immunospecifically bind to both TR4 as described above and to TR7 (SEQ ID NO:3) or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA in clone HLYBX88 contained in ATCC Deposit 97920 deposited Mar. 7, 1997. TRAIL receptors may be produces through recombinant expression of nucleic acids encoding the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:1\u20135, (TR4, TR5, TR7, TR10, and TR1; e.g., the cDNAs in the ATCC Deposit Numbers 97853, (TR4) 97798 (TR5, deposited Nov. 20, 1996), 97920 (TR7), or 209040 (TR10, deposited May 15, 1997).","In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention preferentially bind TR4 (SEQ ID NO:1), or fragments, variants, or fusion proteins thereof (e.g., the extracellular region of TR4 fused to an Fc domain) relative to their ability to bind other proteins including TR1, TR5, TR7, or TR10 (SEQ ID NOS:5, 2, 3, and 4) or fragments, variants, or fusion proteins thereof. IN other preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention preferentially bind to TR4 and TR7 (SEQ ID NOS:1 and 3), or fragments or variants thereof relative to their ability to bind other proteins including TR1, TR5 or TR10 (SEQ ID NOS:5, 2 and 4) or fragments, variants, or fusion proteins thereof. In other preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind TR1 TR4, TR5, TR7 and TR10 (SEQ ID NOS:5, 1, 2, 3, and 4). An antibody's ability to preferentially bind one antigen compared to another antigen may be determined using any method known in the art.","TR4 Polypeptides","In certain embodiments of the present invention, the antibodies of the present invention bind TR4 polypeptide, or fragments or variants thereof. The following section describes the TR4 polypeptides, fragments and variants that may be bound by the antibodies of the invention in more detail. The TR4 polypeptides, fragments and variants which may be bound by the antibodies of the invention are also described in International Publication Numbers, for example, WO98\/32856 and WO00\/67793 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention immunospecifically bind TR4 polypeptide. An antibody that immunospecifically binds TR4 may, in some embodiments, bind fragments, variants (including species orthologs of TR4), multimers or modified forms of TR4. For example, an antibody immunospecific for TR4 may bind the TR4 moiety of a fusion protein comprising all or a portion of TR4.","TR4 proteins may be found as monomers or multimers (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher multimers). Accordingly, the present invention relates to antibodies that bind TR4 proteins found as monomers or as part of multimers. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR4 monomers, dimers, trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind at least dimers, at least trimers, or at least tetramers containing one or more TR4 polypeptides.","Antibodies of the invention may bind TR4 homomers or heteromers. As used herein, the term homomer, refers to a multimer containing only TR4 proteins of the invention (including TR4 fragments, variants, and fusion proteins, as described herein). These homomers may contain TR4 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences. In a specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only TR4 proteins having an identical polypeptide sequence. In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind TR4 homomers containing TR4 proteins having different polypeptide sequences. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind a TR4 homodimer (e.g., containing TR4 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences). In additional embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer of TR4.","In specific embodiments antibodies of the present invention bind TR4 homotrimers (e.g., containing TR4 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences).","As used herein, the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing heterologous proteins (i.e., proteins containing polypeptide sequences that do not correspond to a polypeptide sequences encoded by the TR4 gene) in addition to the TR4 proteins of the invention. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind a heterodimer, a heterotrimer, or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer containing one or more TR4 polypeptides.","In specific embodiments antibodies of the present invention bind a TR4 heterotrimer (e.g., containing 1 or 2 TR4 proteins and 2 or 1, respectively, TR7 proteins).","Multimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, ionic and\/or covalent associations and\/or may be indirectly linked, by for example, liposome formation. Thus, in one embodiment, multimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention, such as, for example, homodimers or homotrimers, are formed when TR4 proteins contact one another in solution. In another embodiment, heteromultimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention, such as, for example, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, are formed when proteins of the invention contact antibodies to the TR4 polypeptides (including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein) in solution. In other embodiments, multimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and\/or between the TR4 proteins of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein (e.g., the polypeptide sequence recited in SEQ ID NO:1 or the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA clone of ATCC Deposit 97853). In one instance, the covalent associations are cross-linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences of the proteins which interact in the native (i.e., naturally occurring) polypeptide. In another instance, the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively, such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a TR4 fusion protein. In one example, covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925). In a specific example, the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a TR4-Fc fusion protein (as described herein). In another specific example, covalent associations of fusion proteins are between heterologous polypeptide sequences from another TNF family ligand\/receptor member that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers, such as for example, oseteoprotegerin (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 98\/49305, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example, proteins desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross-linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirely). Additionally, multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter-molecule cross-links between the cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequence of the proteins desired to be contained in the multimer (see. e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Further, proteins that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N-terminus of the polypeptide sequence of the protein and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified proteins (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the protein components desired to be contained in the multimer that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Alternatively, multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, proteins contained in multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides coding for a homodimer that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a TR4 polypeptide to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C-terminus to the N-terminus (lacking the leader sequence) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art applied to generate recombinant TR4 polypeptides which contain a transmembrane domain and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, two or more TR4 polypeptides are joined through synthetic linkers (e.g., peptide, carbohydrate or soluble polymer linkers). Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Proteins comprising multiple TR4 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind proteins comprising multiple TR4 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers.","Another method for preparing multimer TR4 polypeptides involves use of TR4 polypeptides fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper domains and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 240:1759, (1988)), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric TR4 proteins are those described in PCT application WO 94\/10308, hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a soluble TR4 polypeptide fused to a peptide that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells, and the resulting soluble multimeric TR4 is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR4-leucine zipper fusion protein monomers and\/or TR4-leucine zipper fusion protein multimers.","Certain members of the TNF family of proteins are believed to exist in trimeric form (Beutler and Huffel, 264:667, 1994; Banner et al., 73:431, 1993). Thus, trimeric TR4 may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD), as described in Hoppe et al. (344:191, (1994)) and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/446,922, hereby incorporated by reference. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR4-leucine zipper fusion protein trimers.","Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric TR4. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR4-fusion protein monomers and\/or TR4 fusion protein trimers.","Antibodies that bind TR4 receptor polypeptides may bind them as isolated polypeptides or in their naturally occurring state. By \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d is intended a polypeptide removed from its native environment. Thus, a polypeptide produced and\/or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention. Also, intended as an \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d are polypeptides that have been purified, partially or substantially, from a recombinant host cell. For example, a recombinantly produced version of the TR4 polypeptide is substantially purified by the one-step method described in Smith and Johnson, 67:31\u201340 (1988). Thus, antibodies of the present invention may bind recombinantly produced TR4 receptor polypeptides. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind a TR4 receptor expressed on a surface of a cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding amino acids 1 to 468 of SEQ ID NO:1 operably associated with a regulatory sequence that controls gene expression.","Antibodies of the present invention may bind TR4 polypeptide fragments comprising or alternatively, consisting of, an amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:1, encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC deposit Number 97853, or encoded by nucleic acids which hybridize (e.g., under stringent hybridization conditions) to the nucleotide sequence contained in ATCC deposit Number 97853, or the complementary strand thereto. Protein fragments may be \u201cfree-standing,\u201d or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Antibodies of the present invention may bind polypeptide fragments, including, for example, fragments that comprise or alternatively, consist or from about amino acid residues: 1 to 23, 24 to 43, 44 to 63, 64 to 83, 84 to 103, 104 to 123, 124 to 143, 144 to 163, 164 to 183, 184 to 203, 204 to 223, 224 to 238, 239 to 264, 265 to 284, 285 to 304, 305 to 324, 325 to 345, 346 to 366, 367 to 387, 388 to 418, 419 to 439, and\/or 440 to 468 of SEQ ID NO:1. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited value, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes. Moreover, polypeptide fragments bound by the antibodies of the invention can be at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 175 or 200 amino acids in length. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited value, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes.","Preferably, antibodies of the present invention bind polypeptide fragments selected from the group: a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR4 receptor extracellular domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 24 to about 238 in SEQ ID NO: 1); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, both TR4 cysteine rich domains (both of which may be found in the protein fragment consisting of amino acid residues from about 131 to about 229 in SEQ ID NO:1); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR4 cysteine rich domain consisting of amino acid residues from about 131 to about 183 in SEQ ID NO:1); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR4 cysteine rich domain consisting of amino acid residues from about 184 to about 229 in SEQ ID NO:1); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR4 receptor transmembrane domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 239 to about 264 in SEQ ID NO: 1); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, fragment of the predicted mature TR4 polypeptide, wherein the fragment has a TR4 functional activity (e.g., antigenic activity or biological activity); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR4 receptor intracellular domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 265 to about 468 in SEQ ID NO: 1); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR4 receptor extracellular and intracellular domains with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the TR4 receptor death domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 379 to about 422 in SEQ ID NO:1); and a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, one, two, three, four or more, epitope bearing portions of the TR4 receptor protein. In additional embodiments, the polypeptide fragments of the invention comprise, or alternatively, consist of, any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or all 8 of the above members. The amino acid residues constituting the TR4 receptor extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains have been predicted by computer analysis. Thus, as one of ordinary skill would appreciate, the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to about 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","It is believed that one or both of the extracellular cysteine rich motifs of TR4 is important for interactions between TR4 and its ligands (e.g., TRAIL). Accordingly, in highly preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind TR4 polypeptide fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 131 to 183, and\/or 184 to 229 of SEQ ID NO:1. In another highly preferred embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind TR4 polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of both of the extracellular cysteine rich motifs (amino acid residues 131 to 229 of SEQ ID NO:1.) In another preferred embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind TR4 polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting the extracellular soluble domain of TR4 (amino acid residues 24\u2013238 of SEQ ID NO: 1.) In highly preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention that bind all or a portion of the extracellular soluble domain of TR4 (e.g., one or both cysteine rich domains) prevent TRAIL ligand from binding to TR4. In other highly preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention that bind all or a portion of the extracellular soluble domain of TR4 (e.g., one or both cysteine rich domains) agonize the TR4 receptor. In other highly preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention that bind all or a portion of the extracellular soluble domain of TR4 (e.g., one or both cysteine rich domains) induce cell death of the cell expressing the TR4 receptor.","Antibodies of the invention may also bind fragments comprising, or alternatively, consisting of structural or functional attributes of TR4. Such fragments include amino acid residues that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, surface forming regions, and high antigenic index regions (i.e., containing four or more contiguous amino acids having an antigenic index of greater than or equal to 1.5, as identified using the default parameters of the Jameson-Wolf program) of complete (i.e., full-length) TR4. Certain preferred regions are those set out in Table 2 and include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence depicted in (SEQ ID NO:1), such preferred regions include; Garnier-Robson predicted alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions; Chou-Fasman predicted alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions; Kyte-Doolittle predicted hydrophilic regions; Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions; Emini surface-forming regions; and Jameson-Wolf high antigenic index regions, as predicted using the default parameters of these computer programs.","The data representing the structural or functional attributes of TR4 set forth in Table 2, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. Column I represents the results of a Garnier-Robson analysis of alpha helical regions; Column II represents the results of a Chou-Fasman analysis of alpha helical regions; Column III represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of beta sheet regions; Column IV represents the results of a Chou-Fasman analysis of beta sheet regions; Column V represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of turn regions; Column VI represents the results of a Chou-Fasman analysis of turn regions; Column VII represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of coil regions; Column VIII represents a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity plot; Column; Column IX represents the results of an Eisenberg analysis of alpha amphipathic regions; Column X represents the results of an Eisenberg analysis of beta amphipathic regions; Column XI represents the results of a Karplus-Schultz analysis of flexible regions; Column XII represents the Jameson-Wolf antigenic index score; and Column XIII represents the Emini surface probability plot.","In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, XII, and XIII of Table 2 can be used to determine regions of TR4 which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, XII, and\/or XIII by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in Table 2 include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in SEQ ID NO:1. As set out in Table 2, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Among preferred polypeptide fragments bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are those that comprise regions of TR4 that combine several structural features, such as several (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4) of the same or different region features set out above and in Table

another aspect, the invention provides an antibody that binds a peptide or polypeptide comprising an epitope-bearing portion of a polypeptide described herein. The epitope of this polypeptide portion is an immunogenic or antigenic epitope of a polypeptide of the invention. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope\u201d is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen. On the other hand, a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is defined as an \u201cantigenic epitope.\u201d The number of immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes. See, for instance, Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998\u20134002 (1983).","As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope (i.e., that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind), it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See, for instance, Sutcliffe, J. G., Shinnick, T. M., Green, N. and Learner, R. A. (1983) Antibodies that react with predetermined sites on proteins. 219:660\u2013666. Peptides capable of eliciting protein-reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins (i.e., immunogenic epitopes) nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals.","Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides are therefore useful to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that bind to a TR4 polypeptide of the invention. See, for instance, Wilson et al., 37:767\u2013778 (1984) at 777. Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides preferably contain a sequence of at least seven, more preferably at least nine and most preferably between at least about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.","Antibodies of the invention may bind one or more antigenic TR4 polypeptides or peptides including, but not limited to: a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 35 to about 92 of SEQ ID NO:1; a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 114 to about 160 of SEQ ID NO:1; a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 169 to about 240 of SEQ ID NO:1; a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 267 to about 298 of SEQ ID NO:1; a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 330 to about 364 of SEQ ID NO:1; a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 391 to about 404 of SEQ ID NO:1; and\/or a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 418 to about 465 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited range, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either terminus or at both termini. As indicated above, the inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the TR4 protein. Epitope-bearing TR4 peptides and polypeptides may be produced by any conventional means. Houghten, R. A., \u201cGeneral method for the rapid solid-phase synthesis of large numbers of peptides: specificity of antigen-antibody interaction at the level of individual amino acids,\u201d 82:5131\u20135135 (1985). This \u201cSimultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis (SMPS)\u201d process is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211 to Houghten et al. (1986).","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, TR4 polypeptides and the epitope-bearing fragments thereof described herein (e.g., corresponding to a portion of the extracellular domain such as, for example, amino acid residues 1 to 240 of SEQ E) NO: 1 can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgG), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half-life in vivo. This has been shown, e.g., for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins (EPA 394,827; Traunecker et al., 331:84\u201386 (1988)). Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG part can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric TR4 protein or protein fragment alone (Fountoulakis et al., 270:3958\u20133964 (1995)). Thus, antibodies of the invention may bind fusion proteins that comprise all or a portion of a TR4 polypeptide such as TR4.","Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or \u201cmuteins\u201d including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Antibodies of the present invention may also bind such modified TR4 polypeptides or TR4 polypeptide fragments or variants.","For instance, for many proteins, including the extracellular domain of a membrane associated protein or the mature form(s) of a secreted protein, it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus without substantial loss of biological function, or loss of the ability to be bound by a specific antibody. For instance, Ron et al., 268:2984\u20132988 (1993) reported modified KGF proteins that had heparin binding activity even if 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues were missing. In the present case, since TR4 is a member of the death domain containing receptor (DDCR) polypeptide family, deletions of N-terminal amino acids up to the cysteine residue at position 109 in SEQ ID NO:1 may retain some biological activity such as the ability to induce apoptosis. Polypeptides having further N-terminal deletions including the cysteine residue at position 109 (C-109) in SEQ ID NO:1 would not be expected to retain such biological activities because this residue is conserved among family members and may be required for forming a disulfide bridge to provide structural stability which is needed for ligand binding.","However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind TR4 ligand (e.g., TRAIL)) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened TR4 polypeptides to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the TR4 polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a TR4 polypeptide with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six TR4 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the TR4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 up to the serine residue at position number 463 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n\u2212468 of SEQ ID NO:1, where nis an integer from 2 to 463 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO:1.","More in particular, the invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues of A-2 to E-468;

For example the ability of the shortened TR4 polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the TR4 polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a TR4 polypeptide with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six TR4 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the TR4 polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 up to the alanine residue at position number 30, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 24\u2013mof SEQ ID NO:1, where mis an integer from 30 to 467 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO:1.","More in particular, the invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues A-24 to L-467;

In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of residues 1\u2013mof the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:1, where mis any integer in the range of 221\u2013468 and residue C-221 is the position of the first residue from the C-terminus of the complete TR4 polypeptide (shown in SEQ ID NO:1) believed to be required for receptor binding activity of the TR4 protein.","The invention also provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini of a TR4 polypeptide, which may be described generally as having residues n\u2013mand\/or n\u2013mof SEQ ID NO:1, where n, n, m, and mare integers as described above.","Also included are antibodies that bind a polypeptide consisting of a portion of the complete TR4 amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97853, where this portion excludes from 1 to about 108 amino acids from the amino terminus of the complete amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97853, or from 1 to about 247 amino acids from the carboxy terminus, or any combination of the above amino terminal and carboxy terminal deletions, of the complete amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97853.","Preferably, antibodies of the present invention bind fragments of TR4 comprising a portion of the extracellular domain; i.e., within residues 24\u2013238 of SEQ ID NO:1, since any portion therein is expected to be soluble.","It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequence of TR4 can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated, it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity. Such areas will usually comprise residues which make up the ligand binding site or the death domain, or which form tertiary structures which affect these domains.","Thus, the invention further includes antibodies that bind variations of the TR4 protein which show substantial TR4 protein activity or which include regions of TR4 such as the protein fragments discussed below. Such mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitution. Guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in Bowie, J. U. et al., 247:1306\u20131310 (1990).","Thus, antibodies of the present invention may bind a fragment, derivative, or analog of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1, or that encoded by the cDNA in ATCC deposit 97853. Such fragments, variants or derivatives may be (i) one in which at least one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino ace residue(s), and more preferably at least one but less than ten conserved amino acid residues) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as in IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the are from the teachings herein.","Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the TR4 protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations, because they can be immunogenic. (Pinckard et al., 2:331\u2013340 (1967); Robbins et al., 36:838\u2013845 (1987); Cleland et al. 10:307\u2013377 (1993)).","The replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of binding to cell surface receptors. Ostade et al., 361:266\u2013268 (1993) describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF-alpha to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Thus, the antibodies of the present invention may bind a TR4 receptor that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation.","As indicated, changes are preferably of a minor nature, such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein (see Table 3).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Aromatic","Phenylalanine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Tryptophan"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Tyrosine"]},{"entry":[{},"Hydrophobic","Leucine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Isoleucine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Valine"]},{"entry":[{},"Polar","Glutamine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Asparagine"]},{"entry":[{},"Basic","Arginine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Lysine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Histidine"]},{"entry":[{},"Acidic","Aspartic Acid"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Glutamic Acid"]},{"entry":[{},"Small","Alanine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Serine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Threonine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Methionine"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Glycine"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In specific embodiments, the number of substitutions, additions or deletions in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 and\/or any of the polypeptide fragments described herein (e.g., the extracellular domain or intracellular domain) is 75, 70, 60, 50, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 30\u201320, 20\u201315, 20\u201310, 15\u201310, 10\u20131, 5\u201310, 1\u20135, 1\u20133 or 1\u20132.","In specific embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind TR4 polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof (especially a fragment comprising or alternatively consisting of, the extracellular soluble domain of TR4), that contains any one or more of the following conservative mutations in TR4: M1 replaced with A, G, I, L, S, T, or V;

The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro, or in vitro proliferative activity. Sites that are critical for ligand-receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith et al., 224:899\u2013904 (1992) and de Vos et al. 255:306\u2013312 (1992)). In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind regions of TR4 that are essential for TR4 function. In other preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind regions of TR4 that are essential for TR4 function and inhibit or abolish TR4 function. In other preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind regions of TR4 that are essential for TR4 function and enhance TR4 function.","Additionally, protein engineering may be employed to improve or alter the characteristics of TR4 polypeptides. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Antibodies of the present invention may bind such modified TR4 polypeptides.","Non-naturally occurring variants of TR4 may be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques, which include, but are not limited to oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis, alanine scanning, PCR mutagenesis, site directed mutagenesis (see e.g., Carter et al., 13:4331 (1986); and Zoller et al., 10:6487 (1982)), cassette mutagenesis (see e.g., Wells et al., 34:315 (1985)), restriction selection mutagenesis (see e.g., Wells et al., 317:415 (1986)).","Thus, the invention also encompasses antibodies that bind TR4 derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted, added, or substituted to generate TR4 polypeptides that are better suited for expression, scale up, etc., in the host cells chosen. For example, cysteine residues can be deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue in order to eliminate disulfide bridges; N-linked glycosylation sites can be altered or eliminated to achieve, for example, expression of a homogeneous product that is more easily recovered and purified from yeast hosts which are known to hyperglycosylate N-linked sites. To this end, a variety of amino acid substitutions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions on any one or more of the glycosylation recognition sequences in the TR4 polypeptides and\/or an amino acid deletion at the second position of any one or more such recognition sequences will prevent glycosylation of the TR4 at the modified tripeptide sequence (see, e.g., Miyajimo et al., EMBO J 5(6):1193\u20131197). Additionally, one or more of the amino acid residues of TR4 polypeptides (e.g., arginine and lysine residues) may be deleted or substituted with another residue to eliminate undesired processing by proteases such as, for example, furins or kexins.","The antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies that bind a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA (the deposit having ATCC Accession Number 97853) including the leader; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the mature polypeptide encoded by the deposited the cDNA minus the leader (i.e., the mature protein); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 including the leader; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 minus the amino terminal methionine; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 minus the leader; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the TR4 extracellular domain; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the TR4 cysteine rich domain; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the TR4 transmembrane domain; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the TR4 intracellular domain; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the TR4 death domain; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of soluble polypeptides comprising all or part of the extracellular and intracellular domains but lacking the transmembrane domain; as well as polypeptides which are at least 80% identical, more preferably at least 90% or 95% identical, still more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the polypeptides described above (e.g., the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA clone (the deposit having ATCC Accession Number 97853), the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1, and portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a reference amino acid sequence of a TR4 polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of the TR4 polypeptide. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 5% of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or to the amino acid sequence encoded by deposited cDNA clones can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the , total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.","In a specific embodiment, the identity between a reference (query) sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237\u2013245 (1990)). Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment, if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.","The present application is also directed to antibodies that bind proteins containing polypeptides at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the TR4polypeptide sequence set forth herein as n\u2013m, and\/or n\u2013m. In preferred embodiments, the application is directed to antibodies that bind proteins containing polypeptides at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the specific TR4 N- and C-terminal deletions recited herein.","In certain preferred embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR4 fusion proteins as described above wherein the TR4 portion of the fusion protein are those described as n\u2013m, and\/or n\u2013mherein.","TR7","In certain embodiments of the present invention, the antibodies of the present invention bind TR7 polypeptide, or fragments or variants thereof.

An antibody that immunospecifically binds TR7 may, in some embodiments, bind fragments, variants (including species orthologs of TR7), multimers or modified forms of TR7. For example, an antibody immunospecific for TR7 may bind the TR7 moiety of a fusion protein comprising all or a portion of TR7.","TR7 proteins may be found as monomers or multimers (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher multimers). Accordingly, the present invention relates to antibodies that bind TR7 proteins found as monomers or as part of multimers.

In additional embodiments, the multimers of the invention are at least dimers, at least trimers, or at least tetramers.","Antibodies of the invention may bind TR7 homomers or heteromers. As used herein, the term homomer, refers to a multimer containing only TR7 proteins of the invention (including TR7 fragments, variants, and fusion proteins, as described herein). These homomers may contain TR7 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences. In a specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only TR7 proteins having an identical polypeptide sequence. In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind TR7 homomers containing TR7 proteins having different polypeptide sequences. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind a TR7 homodimer (e.g., containing TR7 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences) or a homotrimer (e.g., containing TR7 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences). In additional embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer of TR7.","As used herein, the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing heterologous proteins (i.e., proteins containing polypeptide sequences that do not correspond to a polypeptide sequences encoded by the TR7 gene) in addition to the TR7 proteins of the invention. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind a heterodimer, a heterotrimer, or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer containing one or more TR7 polypeptides.","Multimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, ionic and\/or covalent associations and\/or may be indirectly linked, by for example, liposome formation. Thus, in one embodiment, multimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention, such as, for example, homodimers or homotrimers, are formed when TR7 proteins contact one another in solution. In another embodiment, heteromultimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention, such as, for example, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, are formed when TR7 proteins contact antibodies to the TR7 polypeptides (including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein) in solution. In other embodiments, multimers bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and\/or between the TR7 proteins of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein (e.g., the polypeptide sequence recited in SEQ ID NO:3 or the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA clone of ATCC Deposit 97920). In one instance, the covalent associations are cross-linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences of the proteins which interact in the native (i.e., naturally occurring) polypeptide. In another instance, the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively, such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a TR7 fusion protein. In one example, covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925). In a specific example, the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a TR7-Fc fusion protein (as described herein). In another specific example, covalent associations of fusion proteins are between heterologous polypeptide sequences from another TNF family ligand\/receptor member that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers, such as for example, oseteoprotegerin (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 98\/49305, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example, proteins desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross-linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter-molecule cross-links between the cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequence of the proteins desired to be contained in the multimer (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Further, proteins that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N-terminus of the polypeptide sequence of the protein and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified proteins (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the protein components desired to be contained in the multimer that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Alternatively, multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, proteins contained in multimers that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides coding for a homodimer that may be bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a TR7 polypeptide to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C-terminus to the N-terminus (lacking the leader sequence) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant TR7 polypeptides which contain a transmembrane domain and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, two or more TR7 polypeptides are joined through synthetic linkers (e.g., peptide, carbohydrate or soluble polymer linkers). Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Proteins comprising multiple TR7 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind proteins comprising multiple TR7 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers.","Another method for preparing multimer TR7 polypeptides involves use of TR7 polypeptides fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper domains and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 240:1759, (1988)), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric TR7 proteins are those described in PCT application WO 94\/10308, hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a soluble TR7 polypeptide fused to a peptide that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells, and the resulting soluble multimeric TR7 is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR7-leucine zipper fusion protein monomers and\/or TR7-leucine zipper fusion protein multimers.","Certain members of the TNF family of proteins are believed to exist in trimeric form (Beutler and Huffel, 264:667, 1994; Banner et al., 73:431, 1993). Thus, trimeric TR7 may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD), as described in Hoppe et al. (344:191, (1994)) and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/446,922, hereby incorporated by reference. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR7-leucine zipper fusion protein trimers.","Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric TR7. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR7-fusion protein monomers and\/or TR7 fusion protein trimers.","Antibodies that bind TR7 receptor polypeptides may bind them as isolated polypeptides or in their naturally occurring state. By \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d is intended a polypeptide removed from its native environment. Thus, a polypeptide produced and\/or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention. Also, intended as an \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d are polypeptides that have been purified, partially or substantially, from a recombinant host cell. For example, a recombinantly produced version of the TR7 polypeptide is substantially purified by the one-step method described in Smith and Johnson, 67:31\u201340 (1988). Thus, antibodies of the present invention may bind recombinantly produced TR7 receptor polypeptides. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind a TR7 receptor expressed on the surface of a cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding amino acids 1 to 411 of SEQ ID NO:3 operably associated with a regulatory sequence that controls gene expression.","Antibodies of the present invention may bind TR7 polypeptides or polypeptide fragments including polypeptides comprising or alternatively, consisting of, an amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:3, encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC deposit Number 97920, or encoded by nucleic acids which hybridize (e.g., under stringent hybridization conditions) to the nucleotide sequence contained in the ATCC deposit Number 97920, or the complementary strand thereto. Protein fragments may be \u201cfree-standing,\u201d or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Antibodies of the present invention may bind polypeptide fragments, including, for example, fragments that comprise or alternatively, consist of from about amino acid residues: 1 to 51, 52 to 78, 79 to 91, 92 to 111, 112 to 134, 135 to 151, 152 to 178, 179 to 180, 181 to 208, 209 to 218, 219 to 231, 232 to 251, 252 to 271, 272 to 291, 292 to 311, 312 to 323, 324 to 361, 362 to 391, 392 to 411 of SEQ ID NO:3. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes. Moreover, polypeptide fragments can be at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, or 150 amino acids in length. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited value, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes.","Preferred polypeptide fragments of the present invention include a member selected from the group: a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 receptor extracellular domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 52 to about 184 in SEQ ID NO:3); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, both TR7 cysteine rich domains (both of which may be found in the protein fragment consisting of amino acid residues from about 84 to about 179 in SEQ ID NO:3); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 cysteine rich domain consisting of amino acid residues from about 84 to about 131 in SEQ ID NO:3); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 cysteine rich domain consisting of amino acid residues from about 132 to about 179 in SEQ ID NO:3); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 receptor transmembrane domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 185 to about 208 in SEQ ID NO:3); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, fragment of the predicted mature TR7 polypeptide, wherein the fragment has a TR7 functional activity (e.g., antigenic activity or biological activity); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 receptor intracellular domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 209 to about 411 in SEQ ID NO:3); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 receptor extracellular and intracellular domains with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted; a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the TR7 receptor death domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 324 to about 391 in SEQ ID NO:3); and a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, one, two, three, four or more, epitope bearing portions of the TR7 receptor protein. In additional embodiments, the polypeptide fragments of the invention comprise, or alternatively, consist of, any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or all 8 of the above members. As above, with the leader sequence, the amino acid residues constituting the TR7 receptor extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains have been predicted by computer analysis. Thus, as one of ordinary skill would appreciate, the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to about 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain. Polypeptides encoded by these nucleic acid molecules are also encompassed by the invention.","As discussed above, it is believed that one or both of the extracellular cysteine rich motifs of TR7 is important for interactions between TR7 and its ligands (e.g., TRAIL). Accordingly, in highly preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind TR7 polypeptide fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues 84 to 131, and\/or 132 to 179 of SEQ ID NO:3. In another highly preferred embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind TR7 polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, both of the extracellular cysteine rich motifs (amino acid residues 84 to 179 of SEQ ID NO:3.) In another preferred embodiment, antibodies of the present invention bind TR7 polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting the extracellular soluble domain of TR7 (amino acid residues 52 to 184 of SEQ ID NO:2.) In other highly preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention that bind all or a portion of the extracellular soluble domain of TR7 (e.g., one or both cysteine rich domains) agonize the TR7 receptor.","In other highly preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention that bind all or a portion of the extracellular soluble domain of TR7 (e.g., one or both cysteine rich domains) induce cell death of the cell expressing the TR7 receptor.","Antibodies of the invention may also bind fragments comprising, or alternatively, consisting of structural or functional attributes of TR7. Such fragments include amino acid residues that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophillic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, surface forming regions, and high antigenic index regions (i.e., regions of polypeptides consisting of amino acid residues having an antigenic index of or equal to greater than 1.5, as identified using the default parameters of the Jameson-Wolf program) of TR7. Certain preferred regions are those disclosed in Table 4 and include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3, such preferred regions include; Garnier-Robson predicted alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions; Chou-Fasman predicted alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions; Kyte-Doolittle predicted hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods predicted hydrophobic regions; Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions; Emini surface-forming regions; and Jameson-Wolf high antigenic index regions, as predicted using the default parameters of these computer programs.","The data representing the structural or functional attributes of TR7 set forth in Table 4, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. Column I represents the results of a Garnier-Robson analysis of alpha helical regions; Column . represents the results of a Chou-Fasman analysis of alpha helical regions; Column III represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of beta sheet regions; Column IV represents the results of a Chou-Fasman analysis of beta sheet regions; Column V represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of turn regions; Column VI represents the results of a Chou-Fasman analysis of turn regions; Column VII represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of coil regions; Column VIII represents a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity plot; Column IX represents a Hopp-Woods hydrophobicity plot; Column X represents the results of an Eisenberg analysis of alpha amphipathic regions; Column XI represents the results of an Eisenberg analysis of beta amphipathic regions; Column XII represents the results of a Karplus-Schultz analysis of flexible regions; Column XIII represents the Jameson-Wolf antigenic index score; and Column XIV represents the Emini surface probability plot.","In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table 4 can be used to determine regions of TR7 which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response. The columns in Table 4 present the result of different analysees of the TR7 protein sequence.","The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in Table 4 include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in SEQ ID NO:3. As set out in Table 4, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Preferably, antibodies of the present invention bind TR7 polypeptides or TR7 polypeptide fragments and variants comprising regions of TR7 that combine several structural features, such as several (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4) of the same or different region features set out above and in Table

another aspect, the invention provides an antibody that binds a peptide or polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, one, two, three, four, five or more, epitope-bearing portions of a TR7. The epitope of this polypeptide portion is an immunogenic or antigenic epitope of a polypeptide described herein. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope\u201d is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen. On the other hand, a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is defined as an \u201cantigenic epitope.\u201d The number of immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes. See, for instance, Geysen et al., 81:3998\u20134002 (1983).","As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope (i.e., that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind), it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See, for instance, J. G. Sutcliffe et al., \u201cAntibodies That React With Predetermined Sites on Proteins,\u201d 219:660\u2013666 (1983). Peptides capable of eliciting protein-reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins (i.e., immunogenic epitopes) nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals.","Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides are therefore useful to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that bind to a TR7 polypeptide. See, for instance, Wilson et al., 37:767\u2013778 (1984) at 777. Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides preferably contain a sequence of at least seven, more preferably at least nine and most preferably between at least about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3.","Antibodies of the invention may bind one or more antigenic TR7 polypeptides or peptides including, but not limited to: a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about 62 to about 110 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 119 to about 164 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 224 to about 271 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 275 to about 370 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 69 to about 80 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 88 to about 95 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 99 to about 103 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 119 to about 123 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 130 to about 135 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 152 to about 163 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 226 to about 238 of SEQ ED NO:3, about 275 to about 279 of SEQ ID NO:3, about 301 to about 305 of SEQ ID NO:3, and\/or about 362 to about 367 of SEQ ID NO:3. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. As indicated above, the inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the TR7 receptor protein.","Epitope-bearing TR7 peptides and polypeptides may be produced by any conventional means. R. A. Houghten, \u201cGeneral Method for the Rapid Solid-Phase Synthesis of Large Numbers of Peptides: Specificity of Antigen-Antibody Interaction at the Level of Individual Amino Acids,\u201d 82:5131\u20135135 (1985). This \u201cSimultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis (SMPS)\u201d process is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211 to Houghten et al. (1986).","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, TR7 receptor polypeptides and the epitope-bearing fragments thereof described herein (e.g., corresponding to a portion of the extracellular domain, such as, for example, amino acid residues 52 to 184 of SEQ ID NO:3 can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgG), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half-life in vivo. This has been shown, e.g., for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins (EPA 394,827; Traunecker et al., 331:84\u201386 (1988)). Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG part can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric TR7 protein or protein fragment alone (Fountoulakis et al., 270:3958\u20133964 (1995)). TR7 fusion proteins may be used as an immunogen to elicit anti-TR7 antibodies. Thus, antibodies of the invention may bind fusion proteins that comprise all or a portion of a TR4 polypeptide such as TR7.","Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or \u201cmuteins\u201d including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Antibodies of the present invention may also bind such modified TR7 polypeptides or TR7 polypeptide fragments or variants.","For instance, for many proteins, including the extracellular domain of a membrane associated protein or the mature form(s) of a secreted protein, it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus without substantial loss of biological function or loss of the ability to be bound by a specific antibody. However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other TR7 functional activities may still be retained. For example, in many instances, the ability of the shortened protein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize TR7 (preferably antibodies that bind specifically to TR7) will retained irrespective of the size or location of the deletion. In fact, polypeptides composed of as few as six TR7 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal and\/or C-terminal residues of a complete protein retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.","As mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind TR7 ligand) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened TR7 polypeptides to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a TR7 polypeptide with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the TR7 amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:3 up to the alanine residue at position number-406 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues nof SEQ ID NO:3 where n is an integer from 2 to 406 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ II) NO:3.","More in particular, the invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues: E-2 to S-411;

For example, the ability of the shortened TR7 polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a TR7 polypeptide with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities.

If such differences in sequence are contemplated, it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity. Such areas will usually comprise residues which make up the ligand binding site or the death domain, or which form tertiary structures which affect these domains.","Thus, the invention further includes antibodies that bind variations of the TR7 protein which show substantial TR7 protein activity or which include regions of TR7, such as the protein portions discussed below. Such mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitutions. Guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in Bowie, J. U. et al., 247:1306\u20131310 (1990).","Thus, antibodies of the present invention may bind a fragment, derivative, or analog of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3, or that encoded by the cDNA in ATCC deposit 97920. Such fragments, variants or derivatives may be (i) one in which at least one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue(s), and more preferably at least one but less than ten conserved amino acid residues) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acids and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the TR7 protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations, because they can be immunogenic. (Pinckard et al., 2:331\u2013340 (1967); Robbins et al., 36:838\u2013845 (1987); Cleland et al. 10:307\u2013377 (1993)).","The replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of binding to cell surface receptors. Ostade et al., 361:266\u2013268 (1993) describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF-alpha to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Thus, the antibodies of the present invention may bind a TR7 receptor that contains one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation.","As indicated, changes are preferably of a minor nature, such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein (see Table 3 above).","In specific embodiments, the number of substitutions, additions or deletions in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 and\/or any of the polypeptide fragments described herein (e.g., the extracellular domain) is 75, 70, 60, 50, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 30\u201320, 20\u201315, 20\u201310, 15\u201310, 10\u20131, 5\u201310, 1\u20135, 1\u20133 or 1\u20132.","In specific embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind TR7 polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof (especially a fragment comprising or alternatively consisting of, the extracellular soluble domain of TR7), that contains any one or more of the following conservative mutations in TR7: M1 replaced with A, G, I, L, S, T, or V;

The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro, or in vitro proliferative activity. Sites that are critical for ligand-receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith et al., 224:899\u2013904 (1992) and de Vos et al. 255:306\u2013312 (1992)). In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind regions of TR7 that are essential for TR7 function. In other preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind regions of TR7 that are essential for TR7 function and inhibit or abolish TR7 function. In other preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind regions of TR7 that are essential for TR7 function and enhance TR7 function.","Additionally, protein engineering may be employed to improve or alter the characteristics of TR7 polypeptides. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or polypeptides including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Antibodies of the present invention may bind such modified TR7 polypeptides.","Non-naturally occurring TR7 variants that may be bound by the antibodies of the invention may be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques, which include, but are not limited to oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis, alanine scanning, PCR mutagenesis, site directed mutagenesis (see e.g., Carter et al., 13:4331 (1986); and Zoller et al., 10:6487 (1982)), cassette mutagenesis (see e.g., Wells et al., 34:315 (1985)), restriction selection mutagenesis (see e.g., Wells et al., 317:415 (1986)).","Thus, the invention also encompasses antibodies that bind TR7 derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted, added, or substituted to generate TR7 polypeptides that are better suited for expression, scale up, etc., in the host cells chosen. For example, cysteine residues can be deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue in order to eliminate disulfide bridges; N-linked glycosylation sites can be altered or eliminated to achieve, for example, expression of a homogeneous product that is more easily recovered and purified from yeast hosts which are known to hyperglycosylate N-linked sites. To this end, a variety of amino acid substitutions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions on any one or more of the glycosylation recognitions sequences in the TR7 polypeptides, and\/or an amino acid deletion at the second position of any one or more such recognition sequences will prevent glycosylation of the TR7 at the modified tripeptide sequence (see, e.g., Miyajimo et al., 5(6):1193\u20131197). Additionally, one or more of the amino acid residues of TR7 polypeptides (e.g., arginine and lysine residues) may be deleted or substituted with another residue to eliminate undesired processing by proteases such as, for example, furins or kexins.","The antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies that bind a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA (the deposit having ATCC Accession Number 97920) including the leader; the mature polypeptide encoded by the deposited the cDNA minus the leader (i.e., the mature protein); a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, amino acids about 1 to about 411 in SEQ ID NO:3; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, amino acids about 2 to about 411 in SEQ ID NO:3; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, amino acids about 52 to about 411 in SEQ ID NO:3; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 extracellular domain; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 cysteine rich domain; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 transmembrane domain; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 intracellular domain; a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the extracellular and intracellular domains with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted; and a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR7 death domain; as well as polypeptides which are at least 80% identical, more preferably at least 90% or 95% identical, still more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the polypeptides described above, and also include portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a reference amino acid sequence of a TR7 polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of the TR7 polypeptide. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 5% of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:3), the amino acid sequence encoded by deposited cDNA clones, or fragments thereof, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.","In a specific embodiment, the identity between a reference (query) sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237\u2013245 (1990)). Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment, if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.","The polypeptide of the present invention could be used as a molecular weight marker on SDS-PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns and as a source for generating antibodies that bind the TR7 polypeptides, using methods well known to those of skill in the art.","The present application is also directed to antibodies that bind proteins containing polypeptides at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the TR7 polypeptide sequence set forth herein as n\u2013m, and\/or n\u2013m. In preferred embodiments, the application is directed to antibodies that bind proteins containing polypeptides at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the specific TR7 N- and C-terminal deletions recited herein.","In certain preferred embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind TR7 proteins of the invention comprise fusion proteins as described above wherein the TR7 polypeptides are those described as n\u2013m, and n\u2013m, herein.","Antibodies of the Invention May Bind Modified TRAIL Receptor Polypeptides","It is specifically contemplated that antibodies of the present invention may bind modified forms of TR4 proteins SEQ ID NO:1). In those embodiments where an antibody of the present invention specifically binds both TR4 and TR7 (SEQ ID NO:3), it is also specifically contemplated that those antibodies may bind modified forms of TR4 and\/or TR7. Modified forms of TR7 would include, for example, modified forms of TR7 that correspond to the modified forms of TR4 described below.","In specific embodiments, antibodies of the present invention bind TR4 polypeptides (such as those described above) including, but not limited to naturally purified TR4 polypeptides, TR4 polypeptides produced by chemical synthetic procedures, and TR4 polypeptides produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells using, for example, the recombinant compositions and methods described above. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides may be glycosylated or non-glycosylated. In addition, TR4 polypeptides may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes.","In addition, TR4 proteins that are bound by antibodies of the present invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y. (1983), and Hunkapiller, et al., 310:105\u2013111 (1984)). For example, a peptide corresponding to a fragment of a TR4 polypeptide can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the TR4 polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).","The invention additionally, encompasses antibodies that bind TR4 polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease, NaBH4, acetylation, formylation, oxidation, reduction, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin; etc.","Additional post-translational modifications to TR4 polypeptides for example, e.g., N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-terminal or C-terminal ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.","Also provided by the invention are antibodies that bind chemically modified derivatives of TR4 polypeptides which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility, stability and circulating time of the polypeptide, or decreased immunogenicity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol copolymers, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule, or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one, two, three or more attached chemical moieties.","The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight) for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired, the effects, if any on biological activity, the ease in handling, the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog). For example, the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10,000, 10,500, 11,000, 11,500, 12,000, 12,500, 13,000, 13,500, 14,000, 14,500, 15,000, 15,500, 16,000, 16,500, 17,000, 17,500, 18,000, 18,500, 19,000, 19,500, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, 65,000, 70,000, 75,000, 80,000, 85,000, 90,000, 95,000, or 100,000 kDa.","As noted above, the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,575; Morpurgo et al., 56:59\u201372 (1996); Vorobjev et al., 18:2745\u20132750 (1999); and Caliceti et al., 10:638\u2013646 (1999), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The polyethylene glycol molecules (or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., EP 0 401 384, herein incorporated by reference (coupling PEG to G-CSF), see also Malik et al., 20:1028\u20131035 (1992) (reporting pegylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride). For example, polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group, such as, a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N-terminal amino acid residues; those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues, glutamic acid residues and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group, such as attachment at the N-terminus or lysine group.","As suggested above, polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example, polyethylene glycol can be linked to a proteins via covalent bonds to lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine) of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and combinations thereof) of the protein.","One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition, one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein (or peptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of pegylation reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N-terminally pegylated preparation (i.e., separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminal) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.","As indicated above, pegylation of the proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example, polyethylene glycol may be attached to the protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al., 9:249\u2013304 (1992); Francis et al., 68:1\u201318 (1998); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,002,531; 5,349,052; WO 95\/06058; and WO 98\/32466, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG, which is produced by the modification of monmethoxy polyethylene glycol (MPEG) using tresylchloride (ClSOCHCF). Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG, polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus, the invention includes protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2,2,2-trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.","Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to proteins using a number of different intervening linkers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,460, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the protein by a linker can also be produced by reaction of proteins with compounds such as MPEG-succinimidylsuccinate, MPEG activated with 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole, MPEG-2,4,5-trichloropenylcarbonate, MPEG-p-nitrophenolcarbonate, and various MPEG-succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98\/32466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.","The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each TR4 polypeptide (i.e., the degree of substitution) may also vary. For example, the pegylated proteins of the invention may be linked, on average, to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly, the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1\u20133, 2\u20134, 3\u20135, 4\u20136, 5\u20137, 6\u20138, 7\u20139, 8\u201310, 9\u201311, 10\u201312, 11\u201313, 12\u201314, 13\u201315, 14\u201316, 15\u201317, 16\u201318, 17\u201319, or 18\u201320 polyethylene glycol moieties per protein molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed, for example, in Delgado et al., 9:249\u2013304 (1992).","As mentioned the antibodies of the present invention may bind TR4 polypeptides that are modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given TR4 polypeptide. TR4 polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic TR4 polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

In specific embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules encoding an antibody of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of SEQ ID NOs:54\u201365 or fragments or variants thereof.","In a specific embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention encodes an antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof), comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a VH domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH domains of at least one of the scFvs referred to in Table 1 and a VL domain having an amino acid sequence of VL domain of at least one of the scFvs referred to in Table 1.

Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding a molecule of the invention, including, for example, site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis which result in amino acid substitutions. Preferably, the variants (including derivatives) encode less than 50 amino acid substitutions, less than 40 amino acid subsitutions, less than 30 amino acid substitutions, less than 25 amino acid substitutions, less than 20 amino acid substitutions, less than 15 amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the reference VH domain, VHCDR1, VHCDR2, VHCDR3, VL domain, VLCDR1, VLCDR2, or VLCDR3. A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge. Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity (e.g., the ability to bind TR4).","For example, it is possible to introduce mutations only in framework regions or only in CDR regions of an antibody molecule. Introduced mutations may be silent or neutral missense mutations, i.e., have no, or little, effect on an antibody's ability to bind antigen. These types of mutations may be useful to optimize codon usage, or improve a hybriodma's antibody production. Alternatively, non-neutral missense mutations may alter an antibody's ability to bind antigen. The location of most silent and neutral missense mutations is likely to be in the framework regions, while the location of most non-neutral missense mutations is likely to be in CDR, though this is not an absolute requirement. One of skill in the art would be able to design and test mutant molecules with desired properties such as no alteration in antigen binding activity or alteration in binding activity (e.g, improvements in antigen binding activity or change in antibody specificity). Following mutagenesis, the encoded protein may routinely be expressed and the functional and\/or biological activity of the encoded protein, (e.g., ability to immunospecifically bind TR4) can be determined using techniques described herein or by routinely modifying techniques known in the art.","In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the invention (including a molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an antibody fragment or variant thereof), that immunospecifically binds TR4 or a fragment or variant thereof, comprises, or alternatively consists of, an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to that encoding one of the VH or VL domains of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 1. under stringent conditions, e.g., hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 6\u00d7 sodium chloride\/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45\u00b0 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.2\u00d7SSC\/0.1% SDS at about 50\u201365\u00b0 C., under highly stringent conditions, e.g., hybridization to filter-bound nucleic acid in 6\u00d7SSC at about 45\u00b0 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1\u00d7SSC\/0.2% SDS at about 68\u00b0 C., or under other stringent hybridization conditions which are known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds., 1989, , Vol. I, Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at pages 6.3.1\u20136.3.6 and 2.10.3). Nucleic acid molecules encoding these antibodies are also encompassed by the invention.","It is well known within the art that polypeptides, or fragments or variants thereof, with similar amino acid sequences often have similar structure and many of the same biological activities. Thus, in one embodiment, an antibody (including a molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an antibody fragment or variant thereof), that immunospecifically binds to TR4 or fragments or variants of TR4, comprises, or alternatively consists of, a VH domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% identical, to the amino acid sequence of a VH domain of at least one of the scFvs referred to in Table 1.","In another embodiment, an antibody (including a molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an antibody fragment or variant thereof), that immunospecifically binds to TR4 or a fragment or variant of TR4, comprises, or alternatively consists of, a VL domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% identical, to the amino acid sequence of a VL domain of at least one of the scFvs referred to in Table 1.","Methods of Producing Antibodies","Antibodies in accordance with the invention are preferably prepared the utilization of a phage scFv display library. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed herein.","In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular, DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries (e.g., human or murine cDNA libraries of lymphoid tissues) or synthetic cDNA libraries. The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are joined together by an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector (e.g., p CANTAB 6 or pComb 3 HSS). The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to an antigen of interest (i.e., a TRAIL receotor polypeptide or a fragment thereof) can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol.

For example, the cDNAs encoding the VH and VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 1 may be expressed in all possible combinations using a phage display library, allowing for the selection of VH\/VL combinations that bind TR4 polypeptides with preferred binding characteristics such as improved affinity or improved off rates. Additionally, VH and VL segments\u2014the CDR regions of the VH and VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 1, in particular, may be mutated in vitro. Expression of VH and VL domains with \u201cmutant\u201d CDRs in a phage display library allows for the selection of VH\/VL combinations that bind TR4 polypeptides with preferred binding characteristics such as improved affinity or improved off rates.","Additional Methods of Producing Antibodies","Antibodies of the invention (including antibody fragments or variants) can be produced by any method known in the art. For example, it will be appreciated that antibodies in accordance with the present invention can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding the cDNAs or genomic clones for the particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian or nonmammalian host cells or to generate phage display libraries, for example. Additionally, polypeptide antibodies of the invention may be chemically synthesized or produced through the use of recombinant expression systems.","One way to produce the antibodies of the invention would be to clone the VH and\/or VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 1. In order to isolate the VH and VL domains from bacteria transfected with a vector containing the scFv, PCR primers complementary to VH or VL nucleotide sequences (See Example 5), may be used to amplify the VH and VL sequences. The PCR products may then be cloned using vectors, for example, which have a PCR product cloning site consisting of a 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 single T nucleotide overhang, that is complementary to the overhanging single adenine nucleotide added onto the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of PCR products by many DNA polymerases used for PCR reactions. The VH and VL domains can then be sequenced using conventional methods known in the art. Alternatively, the VH and VL domains may be amplified using vector specific primers designed to amplify the entire scFv, (i.e. the VH doamin, linker and VL domain.)","The cloned VH and VL genes may be placed into one or more suitable expression vectors. By way of non-limiting example, PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences, a restriction site, and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site may be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art, the PCR amplified VH domains may be cloned into vectors expressing the appropriate immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., the human IgG1 or IgG4 constant region for VH domains, and the human kappa or lambda constant regions for kappa and lambda VL domains, respectively. Preferably, the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise a promoter suitable to direct expression of the heavy and light chains in the chosen expression system, a secretion signal, a cloning site for the immunoglobulin variable domain, immunoglobulin constant domains, and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also be cloned into a single vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co-transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full-length antibodies, e.g., IgG, using techniques known to those of skill in the art (See, for example, Guo et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 82:925\u201331 (1997), and Ames et al., J. Immunol. Methods 184:177\u201386 (1995) which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference).","The invention provides polynucleotides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof). The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under high stringency, or alternatively, under intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined supra, to polynucleotides complementary to nucleic acids having a polynucleotide sequence that encodes an antibody of the invention or a fragment or variant thereof.","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. If the amino acid sequences of the VH domains, VL domains and CDRs thereof, are known, nucleotide sequences encoding these antibodies can be determined using methods well known in the art, i.e., the nucleotide codons known to encode the particular amino acids are assembled in such a way to generate a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody, of the invention. Such a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells or Epstein Barr virus transformed B cell lines that express an antibody of the invention) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y., which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, VH and VL domains of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, are inserted within framework regions using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, six, or more of the CDRs of VH and\/or VL domains of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, is inserted within framework regions using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457\u2013479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Preferably, the polynucleotides generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encode an antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that specifically binds to a TRAIL receptor. Preferably, as discussed supra, polynucleotides encoding variants of antibodies or antibody fragments having one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions do not significantly alter binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules, or antibody fragments or variants, lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and fall within the ordinary skill of the art.","The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase-sized human loci in YACs and to introduce them into the mouse germline provides a powerful approach to elucidating the functional components of very large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease. Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide unique insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development, their communication with other systems, and their involvement in disease induction and progression.","An important practical application of such a strategy is the \u201chumanization\u201d of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying programmed expression and assembly of antibodies as well as their role in B cell development. Furthermore, such a strategy could provide an ideal source for production of fully human monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) an important milestone towards fulfilling the promise of antibody therapy in human disease.","Fully human antibodies are expected to minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses intrinsic to mouse or mouse-derivatized Monoclonal antibodies and thus to increase the efficacy and safety of the administered antibodies. The use of fully human antibodies can be expected to provide a substantial advantage in the treatment of chronic and recurring human diseases, such as cancer, which require repeated antibody administrations.","One approach towards this goal was to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in anticipation that such mice would produce a large repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments would preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains should yield high affinity antibodies against any antigen of interest, including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human Monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificity could be readily produced and selected.","This general strategy was demonstrated in connection with the generation of the first XenoMouse\u2122 strains as published in 1994. See Green et al. 7:13\u201321 (1994). The XenoMouse\u2122 strains were engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACS) containing 245 kb and 10 190 kb-sized germline configuration fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus, respectively, which contained core variable and constant region sequences. Id. The human Ig containing YACs proved to be compatible with the mouse system for both rearrangement and expression of antibodies and were capable of substituting for the inactivated mouse Ig genes. This was demonstrated by their ability to induce B-cell development, to produce an adult-like human repertoire of fully human antibodies, and to generate antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies. These results also suggested that introduction of larger portions of the human Ig loci containing greater numbers of V genes, additional regulatory elements, and human Ig constant regions might recapitulate substantially the full repertoire that is characteristic of the human humoral response to infection and immunization. The work of Green et al. was recently extended to the introduction of greater than approximately 80% of the human antibody repertoire through introduction of megabase sized, germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and kappa light chain loci, respectively, to produce XenoMouse\u2122 mice.

While chimeric antibodies have a human constant region and a murine variable region, it is expected that certain human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) responses will be observed, particularly in chronic or multi-dose utilizations of the antibody. Thus, it would be desirable to provide fully human antibodies against TR4 polypeptides in order to vitiate concerns and\/or effects of HAMA or HACA responses.","Monoclonal antibodies specific for TR4 polypeptides may be prepared using hybridoma technology. (Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 571\u2013681 (1981)). Briefly, XenoMouse\u2122 mice may be immunized with TR4 polypeptides. After immunization, the splenocytes of such mice were extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line (SP2O), available from the ATCC. After fusion, the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium, and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225\u2013232 (1981)). The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the TR4 polypeptides.","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use human or chimeric antibodies. Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50435, WO 98\/24893, WO98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/35735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the present invention comprise one or more VH and VL domains of the invention and constant regions from another immunoglobulin molecule, preferably a human immunoglobulin molecule. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the present invention comprise one or more CDRs corresponding to the VH and VL domains of the invention and framework regions from another immunoglobulin molecule, preferably a human immunoglobulin molecule. In other embodiments, an antibody of the present invention comprises one, two, three, four, five, six or more VL CDRs or VH CDRs corresponding to one or more of the VH or VL domains of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, and framework regions (and, optionally one or more CDRs not derived from the antibodies expressed by scFvs referred to in Table 1) from a human immunoglobulin molecule. In a preferred embodiment, an antibody of the present invention comprises a VH CDR3, VL CDR3, or both, corresponding to the same scFv, or different scFvs selected from the scFvs referred to in Table 1, or fragments or variants thereof, and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin.","A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a human antibody and a non-human (e.g., murine) immunoglobulin constant region or vice versa. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., J. Immunol. Methods 125:191\u2013202 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Chimeric antibodies comprising one or more CDRs from human species and framework regions from a non-human immunoglobulin molecule (e.g., framework regions from a murine, canine or feline immunoglobulin molecule) (or vice versa) can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489\u2013498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805\u2013814 (1994); Roguska et al., PNAS 91:969\u2013973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,352). In a preferred embodiment, chimeric antibodies comprise a human CDR3 having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH CDR3s or VL CDR3s of a VH or VL domain of one or more of the scFvs referred to in Table 1, or a variant thereof, and non-human framework regions or human framework regions different from those of the frameworks in the corresponding scFv disclosed in Table 1. Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 352:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.)","Intrabodies are antibodies, often scFvs, that are expressed from a recombinant nucleic acid molecule and engineered to be retained intracellularly (e.g., retained in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, or periplasm). Intrabodies may be used, for example, to ablate the function of a protein to which the intrabody binds. The expression of intrabodies may also be regulated through the use of inducible promoters in the nucleic acid expression vector comprising the intrabody. Intrabodies of the invention can be produced using methods known in the art, such as those disclosed and reviewed in Chen et al., 5:595\u2013601 (1994); Marasco, W. A., 4:11\u201315 (1997); Rondon and Marasco, 51:257\u2013283 (1997); Proba et al., 275:245\u2013253 (1998); Cohen et al., 17:2445\u20132456 (1998); Ohage and Steipe, 291:1119\u20131128 (1999); Ohage et al., 291:1129\u20131134 (1999); Wirtz and Steipe, 8:2245\u20132250 (1999); Zhu et al., 231:207\u2013222 (1999); and references cited therein.","Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention (including antibody fragments or variants thereof (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention), requires construction of an expression vector(s) containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule (e.g., a whole antibody, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably, but not necessarily, containing the heavy or light chain variable domain)), of the invention has been obtained, the vector(s) for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention (e.g., a whole antibody, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody, or a portion thereof, or a heavy or light chain CDR, a single chain Fv, or fragments or variants thereof), operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464, the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy chain, the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains.","The expression vector(s) is(are) transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing polynucleotide(s) encoding an antibody of the invention (e.g., whole antibody, a heavy or light chain thereof, or portion thereof, or a single chain antibody, or a fragment or variant thereof), operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments, for the expression of entire antibody molecules, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, bacteriophage particles engineered to express antibody fragments or variants thereof (single chain antibodies), microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces, Pichia) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3, NS0 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as , and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio\/Technology 8:2 (1990); Bebbington et al., Bio\/Techniques 10:169 (1992); Keen and Hale, Cytotechnology 18:207 (1996)). These references are incorporated in their entirities by reference herein.","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO 1. 2:1791 (1983)), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101\u20133109 (1985); Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503\u20135509 (1989)); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) may be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. Antibody coding sequences may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example, the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example, the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8 1:355\u2013359 (1984)). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see, e.g., Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:51\u2013544 (1987)).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include, but are not limited to, CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, NSO, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT2O and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7O3O and HsS78Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1\u20132 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., Cell 22:8 17 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357 (1980); O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573\u2013596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926\u2013932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62: 191\u2013217 (1993); TIB TECH 11(5):155\u2013215 (May, 1993)); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N.Y. (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1981), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, \u201cThe use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells\u201d in 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the coding sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)).","Vectors which use glutamine synthase (GS) or DBFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate, respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availabilty of cell lines (e.g., the murine myeloma cell line, NSO) which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells (e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells) by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications: WO87\/04462; WO86\/05807; WO89\/01036; WO89\/10404; and WO91\/06657 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally, glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suppliers, including, for example Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Portsmouth, N.H.). Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al., 10:169(1992) and in Biblia and Robinson 11:1 (1995) which are incorporated in their entirities by reference herein.","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain is preferably placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In particular, antibodies and related molecules of the invention may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to TR4 or a fragment or variant of TR4, using techniques described herein or routinely modifying techniques known in the art. Assays for the ability of the antibodies of the invention to immunospecifically bind TR4 or a fragment or variant of TR4, may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, Bio\/Techniques 13:412\u2013421(1992)), on beads (e.g., Lam, Nature 354:82\u201384 (1991)), on chips (e.g., Fodor, Nature 364:555\u2013556 (1993)), on bacteria (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (e.g., Cull et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1865\u20131869 (1992)) or on phage (e.g., Scott and Smith, Science 249:386\u2013390 (1990); Devlin, Science 249:404\u2013406 (1990); Cwirla et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:7178\u20137182 (1990); and Felici, J. Mol. Biol. 222:301\u2013310 (1991)) (each of these references is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Antibodies that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to TR4 or a fragment or variant of TR4 can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for TR4 or a fragment or variant of TR4, using or routinely modifying techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.","The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding to TR4 polypeptides and cross-reactivity with other antigens by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross-reactivity include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as BIAcore analysis (See, e.g., Example 2), FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorter) analysis, immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, western blots, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96-well microtiter plate with the antigen, washing away antigen that did not bind the wells, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the wells and incubating for a period of time, washing away unbound antibodies or non-specifically bound antibodies, and detecting the presence of the antibodies specifically bound to the antigen coating the well. In ELISAs, the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Alternatively, the antigen need not be directly coated to the well; instead the ELISA plates may be coated with an anti-Ig Fc antibody, and the antigen in the form or a TRAIL receptor-Fc fusion protein, may be bound to the anti-Ig Fc coated to the plate. This may be desirable so as to maintain the antigen protein (e.g., the TR4 polypeptides) in a more native conformation than it may have when it is directly coated to a plate. In another alternative, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, the detectable molecule could be the antigen conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase). One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","The binding affinity of an antibody (including an scFv or other molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., antigen labeled with H or I), or fragment or variant thereof with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of the present invention for TR4 and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, a TR4 polypeptide is incubated with an antibody of the present invention conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., compound labeled with H or I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second anti-TR4 antibody. This kind of competitive assay between two antibodies, may also be used to determine if two antibodies bind the same or different epitopes.","In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies (including antibody fragments or variants thereof) to a TRAIL receptor, or fragments of a TRAIL receptor. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized TRAIL receptors on their surface as described in detail in Example 2.","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1 to 4 hours) at 40 degrees C, adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 40 degrees C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%\u201320% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., P or I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","Antibody Conjugates","The present invention encompasses antibodies (including antibody fragments or variants thereof), recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to a heterologous polypeptide (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. For example, antibodies of the invention may be used to target heterologous polypeptides to particular cell types (e.g., cancer cells), either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the heterologous polypeptides to antibodies of the invention that are specific for particular cell surface antigens or which bind antigens that bind particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies of the invention may also be fused to albumin (including but not limited to recombinant human serum albumin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,969, issued Mar. 2, 1999, EP Patent 0 413 622, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883, issued Jun. 16, 1998, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety)), resulting in chimeric polypeptides.

DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of antibodies (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof), such methods can be used to generate antibodies with altered activity (e.g., antibodies with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., Curr.

In another embodiment, one or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding an antibody which portions immunospecifically bind to TR4 may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","Moreover, the antibodies of the present invention (including antibody fragments or variants thereof), can be fused to marker sequences, such as a polypeptides to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine polypeptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the FLAG\u00ae tag (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.).","The present invention further encompasses antibodies (including antibody fragments or variants thereof), conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent.

No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An antibody of the invention (including an other molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an antibody fragment or variant thereof), with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it, administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and\/or cytokine(s) can be used as a therapeutic.","Uses of Antibodies of the Invention","Antibodies of the present invention may be used, for example, but not limited to, to purify, detect, and target the polypeptides of the present invention, including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example, the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of TR4 polypeptides in biological samples. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988) (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","Immunophenotyping","The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples (See, for example, Example 4). The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker, or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and\/or maturation of particular cell types, particularly of tumors and cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope, or combination of epitopes, will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker(s), and include magnetic separation using antibody-coated magnetic beads, \u201cpanning\u201d with antibody attached to a solid matrix (i.e., plate), and flow cytometry (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,660; and Morrison et al., 96:737\u201349 (1999)).","These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells, such as might be found with hematological malignancies (i.e. minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemic patients) and \u201cnon-self\u201d cells in transplantations to prevent Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Alternatively, these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and\/or differentiation, as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.","Epitope Mapping","The present invention provides antibodies (including antibody fragments or variants thereof), that can be used to identify epitopes of a TR4 polypeptide. In particular, the antibodies of the present invention can be used to identify epitopes of a human TR4 polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:1) or a TR4 polypeptide expressed on human cells; a murine TR4 or a TR4 polypeptide expressed on murine cells; a rat TR4 polypeptide receptor or a TR4 polypeptide expressed on rat cells; or a monkey TR4 polypeptide or a TR4 polypeptide expressed on monkey cells, using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5131\u20135135 (1985), further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,211.) Identified epitopes of antibodies of the present invention may, for example, be used as vaccine candidates, i.e., to immunize an individual to elicit antibodies against the naturally occuring forms of TR4 polypeptides.","Diagnostic Uses of Antibodies","Labeled antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) which specifically bind to a TR4 polypeptide can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, prognose, or monitor diseases and\/or disorders. In specific embodiments, labeled antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) which specifically bind to a TR4 polypeptide can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, prognose, or monitor diseases and\/or disorders associated with the aberrant expression and\/or activity of TR4.","The invention provides for the detection of expression of a TR4 polypeptide comprising: (a) assaying the expression of a TR4 polypeptide in a biological sample from an individual using one or more antibodies of the invention that immunospecifically binds to TR4; and (b) comparing the level of TR4 polypeptide in the biological sample with a standard level of TR4 polypeptide, (e.g., the level in normal biological samples).","The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a TR4 polypeptide comprising: (a) assaying the expression of a TR4 polypeptide in a biological sample from an individual using one or more antibodies of the invention that immunospecifically binds to TR4; and (b) comparing the level of a TR4 polypeptide in the biological sample with a standard level of a TR4 polypeptide, e.g., in normal biological samples, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed level of a TR4 polypeptide compared to the standard level of a TR4 polypeptide is indicative of aberrant expression.","By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any fluids and\/or cells obtained from an individual, body fluid, body tissue, body cell, cell line, tissue culture, or other source which may contain a TR4 polypeptide protein or mRNA. Body fluids include, but are not limited to, sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid, spinal fluid, saliva, and mucous. Tissues samples may be taken from virtually any tissue in the body. Tissue samples may also be obtained from autopsy material. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.","Antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) which specifically bind to a TR4 polypeptide can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, prognose, or monitor cancers and other hyperproliferative disorders, and\/or diseases or conditions associated therewith. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of TR4 polypeptide comprising: (a) assaying the expression of TR4 polypeptide in a biological sample from an individual using one or more antibodies of the invention that immunospecifically binds to a TR4 polypeptide; and (b) comparing the level of a TR4 polypeptide with a standard level of TR4 polypeptide, e.g., in normal biological samples, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed level of TR4 polypeptide compared to the standard level of TR4 polypeptide is indicative of a cancer and\/or a hyperproliferative disorder.","TRAIL has been shown in some instances to selectively kill tumor cells (See, for example, Oncogene 19:3363\u201371 (2000)). This may be a result of differential expression of TRAIL receptors on normal and cancerous cells. Thus, in specific embodiments, an increase in the assayed level of a TR4 polypeptide is indicative of a cancer and\/or a hyperproliferative disorder.","Other reports suggest that decreased TR4 expression by tumor cells may be a mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system (See, for example, Int. J. Oncol. 16:917\u201325 (2000)) Thus, in other specific embodiments, a decrease in the assayed level of TR4 polypeptide is indicative of a cancer and\/or a hyperproliferative disorder.","One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of TR4 in an animal, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled antibody of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically binds to a TR4 polypeptide; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled antibody to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where TR4 polypeptide is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled antibody in the subject, such that detection of labeled antibody or fragment thereof above the background level and above or below the level observed in a person without the disease or disorder indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of TR4 polypeptide. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment, the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In one embodiment, monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disorder, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Therapeutic Uses of Antibodies","One or more antibodies of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to TR4 may be used locally or systemically in the body as a therapeutic.

For example, antibodies of the invention which mimic the action of TRAIL binding to TR4, in full or in part, TR4 agonists, may be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, lack of TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or lack of TR4 ligand function. As an alternative example, antibodies of the invention which disrupt or prevent the interaction between TR4 and its ligand or inhibit, reduce, or prevent signal transduction through TR4, may be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, lack of TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or lack of TR4 ligand function. Antibodies of the invention which do not prevent TR4 from binding its ligand but inhibit or downregulate TR4 signal transduction can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, lack of TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or lack of TR4 ligand function. The ability of an antibody of the invention to enhance, inhibit, upregulate or downregulate TR4 signal transduction may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, TRAIL-induced receptor activation and the activation of signaling molecules can be determined by detecting the association of adaptor proteins such as FADD and TRADD with TR4, by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis (for example, as described herein).","Further, antibodies of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) which activate TR4-mediated biological activities (e.g., the induction of apoptosis in TR4 expressing cells) can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, lack of TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or lack of TR4 ligand function. These antibodies may potentiate or activate either all or a subset of the biological activities of TRAIL receptor, for example, by inducing a conformational change in TRAIL receptor. In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the present invention that increases TR4 activity by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, at least two-fold, at least three-fold, at least four fold, at least five fold, at least ten-fold, at least twenty-fold, at least fifty-fold, or at least one hundred-fold relative to TR4 activity in absence of the antibody is administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, lack of TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or lack of TR4 ligand function. In another embodiment, a combination of antibodies, a combination of antibody fragments, a combination of antibody variants, or a combination of antibodies, antibody fragments and\/or antibody variants that increase TR4 activity by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, at least two-fold, at least three-fold, at least four fold, at least five fold, at least ten-fold, at least twenty-fold, at least fifty-fold, or at least one hundred-fold relative to TR4 activity in absence of the said antibodies or antibody fragments and\/or antibody variants is administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression or lack of TR4 function or aberrant TR4 ligand expression or lack of TR4 ligand function.","In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the present invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that inhibits or downregulates, in full or in part, TR4 activity (e.g., stimulation of apoptosis) by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to TR4 activity in absence of the antibody is administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, excessive TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or excessive TR4 ligand function. In another embodiment, a combination of antibodies, a combination of antibody fragments, a combination of antibody variants, or a combination of antibodies, antibody fragments, and\/or variants that inhibit or downregulate TR4 activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 65%, at least 60%, at least 55%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to TR4 activity in absence of said antibodies, antibody fragments, and\/or antibody variants, are administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant TR4 expression, excessive TR4 function, aberrant TR4 ligand expression, or excessive TR4 ligand function.","In one embodiment, therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder diseases associated with increased apoptosis including, but not limited to, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Retinitis pigmentosa, Cerebellar degeneration), myelodysplastic syndromes (such as aplastic anemia), ischemic injury (such as that caused by myocardial infarction, stroke and reperfusion injury), toxin-induced liver disease (such as that caused by alcohol), septic shock, cachexia and anorexia. In another embodiment, therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate bone marrow failure, for example, aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.","Therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, may also be administered to treat, prevent, or ameliorate organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and\/or conditions associated therewith. Organ rejection occurs by host immune cell destruction of the transplanted tissue through an immune response. Similarly, an immune response is also involved in GVHD, but, in this case, the foreign transplanted immune cells destroy the host tissues. Cellular death induced by immune cell effector functions is apoptotic death. Thus, the administration of antibodies of the invention, (e.g., those that inhibit apoptosis), may be an effective therapy in preventing organ rejection or GVHD.","In another embodiment, therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate infectious diseases. Infectious diseases include diseases associated with yeast, fungal, viral and bacterial infections. Viruses associated with viral infections which can be treated or prevented in accordance with this invention include, but are not limited to, retroviruses (e.g., human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) types I and II and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)), herpes viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II, Epstein-Barr virus, HHV6-HHV8, and cytomegalovirus), arenavirues (e.g., lassa fever virus), paramyxoviruses (e.g., morbillivirus virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, mumps, and pneumovirus), adenoviruses, bunyaviruses (e.g., hantavirus), cornaviruses, filoviruses (e.g., Ebola virus), flaviviruses (e.g., hepatitis C virus (HCV), yellow fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus), hepadnaviruses (e.g., hepatitis B viruses (BBV)), orthomyoviruses (e.g., influenza viruses A, B and C), papovaviruses (e.g., papillomavirues), picornaviruses (e.g., rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and hepatitis A viruses), poxviruses, reoviruses (e.g., rotavirues), togaviruses (e.g., rubella virus), rhabdoviruses (e.g., rabies virus). Microbial pathogens associated with bacterial infections include, but are not limited to, (Vibrio) spp., spp., and ","In another embodiments, antibodies and antibody compositions of the present invention are used to treat, prevent, or ameliorate diseases associated with increased apoptosis including, but not limited to, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Retinitis pigmentosa, Cerebellar degeneration), brain tumor or prion associated disease); autoimmune disorders (such as, multiple sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, biliary cirrhosis, Behcet's disease, Crohn's disease, polymyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus and immune-related glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis) myelodysplastic syndromes (such as aplastic anemia), graft v. host disease, ischemic injury (such as that caused by myocardial infarction, stroke and reperfusion injury), liver injury (e.g., hepatitis related liver injury, ischemia\/reperfusion injury, cholestosis (bile duct injury) and liver cancer); toxin-induced liver disease (such as that caused by alcohol), septic shock, cachexia and anorexia. In preferred embodiments, anti-TR4 antagonistic antibodies, prevent TRAIL from binding to the TRAIL receptors to which the antibodies are bound, but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis) are used to treat the diseases and disorders listed above.","Many of the pathologies associated with HIV are mediated by apoptosis, including HIV-induced nephropathy and HIV encephalitis. Thus, in additional preferred embodiments, antibodies, preferably antagonistic anti-TR4 antibodies, of the invention are used to treat AIDS and pathologies associated with AIDS. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to the use of antibodies of the invention to reduce TRAIL-mediated death of T cells in HIV-infected patients.","In additional embodiments, antibodies of the present invention, particularly antagonistic anti-TR4 antibodies, are administered in combination with other inhibitors of T cell apoptosis. For example, Fas-mediated apoptosis has been implicated in loss of T cells in TV individuals (Katsikis et al., J. Exp. Med. 181:2029\u20132036, 1995). Thus, a patient susceptible to both Fas ligand mediated and TRAIL mediated T cell death may be treated with both an agent that blocks TRAIL\/TR4 interactions and an agent that blocks Fas-ligand\/Fas interactions. Suitable agents for blocking binding of Fas-ligand to Fas include, but are not limited to, soluble Fas polypeptides; mulitmeric forms of soluble Fas polypeptides (e.g., dimers of sFas\/Fc); anti-Fas antibodies that bind Fas without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis; anti-Fas-ligand antibodies that block binding of Fas-ligand to Fas; and muteins of Fas-ligand that bind Fas but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis. Preferably, the antibodies employed according to this method are monoclonal antibodies. Examples of suitable agents for blocking Fas-ligand\/Fas interactions, including blocking anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies, are described in International application publication number WO 95\/10540, hereby incorporated by reference.","Suitable agents, which also block binding of TRAIL to a TR4 that may be administered with the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, soluble TR4 polypeptides (e.g., a soluble form of OPG, TR5 (International application publication number WO 98\/30693); a soluble form of TR4 (International publication number WO 98\/32856); TR7\/DR5 (International application publication number WO 98\/41629); and TR10 (International application publication number WO 98\/54202)); multimeric forms of soluble TR4 polypeptides; and TR4 antibodies that bind the TR4 without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis, anti-TRAIL antibodies that block binding of TRAIL to one or more TRAIL receptors, and muteins of TRAIL that bind TRAIL receptors but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis.","In rejection of an allograft, the immune system of the recipient animal has not previously been primed to respond because the immune system for the most part is only primed by environmental antigens. Tissues from other members of the same species have not been presented in the same way that, for example, viruses and bacteria have been presented. In the case of allograft rejection, immunosuppressive regimens are designed to prevent the immune system from reaching the effector stage. However, the immune profile of xenograft rejection may resemble disease recurrence more that allograft rejection. In the case of disease recurrence, the immune system has already been activated, as evidenced by destruction of the native islet cells. Therefore, in disease recurrence the immune system is already at the effector stage. Antibodies of the present invention (e.g., agonistic antibodies of the invention) are able to suppress the immune response to both allografts and xenografts because lymphocytes activated and differentiated into effector cells will express the TR4 polypeptides, and thereby are susceptible to compounds which enhance apoptosis. Thus, the present invention further provides a method for creating immune privileged tissues. Antagonist of the invention can further be used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel-Disease.","Antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention may be useful for treating inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, septicemia, and inflammatory bowel disease.","In addition, due to lymphoblast expression of TR4 polypeptides, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention may be used to treat this form of cancer. Further, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention may be used to treat various chronic and acute forms of inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, septicemia, and inflammatory bowel disease.","In one embodiment, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention may be used to treat cardiovascular disorders, including peripheral artery disease, such as limb ischemia.","Cardiovascular disorders include cardiovascular abnormalities, such as arterio-arterial fistula, arteriovenous fistula, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, congenital heart defects, pulmonary atresia, and Scimitar Syndrome. Congenital heart defects include aortic coarctation, cor triatriatum, coronary vessel anomalies, crisscross heart, dextrocardia, patent ductus arteriosus, Ebstein's anomaly, Eisenmenger complex, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, levocardia, tetralogy of fallot, transposition of great vessels, double outlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia, persistent truncus arteriosus, and heart septal defects, such as aortopulmonary septal defect, endocardial cushion defects, Lutembacher's Syndrome, trilogy of Fallot, ventricular heart septal defects.","Cardiovascular disorders also include heart disease, such as arrhythmias, carcinoid heart disease, high cardiac output, low cardiac output, cardiac tamponade, endocarditis (including bacterial), heart aneurysm, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, congestive cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal dyspnea, cardiac edema, heart hypertrophy, congestive cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, post-infarction heart rupture, ventricular septal rupture, heart valve diseases, myocardial diseases, myocardial ischemia, pericardial effusion, pericarditis (including constrictive and tuberculous), pneumopericardium, postpericardiotomy syndrome, pulmonary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, ventricular dysfunction, hyperemia, cardiovascular pregnancy complications, Scimitar Syndrome, cardiovascular syphilis, and cardiovascular tuberculosis.","Arrhythmias include sinus arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia, extrasystole, Adams-Stokes Syndrome, bundle-branch block, sinoatrial block, long QT syndrome, parasystole, Lown-Ganong-Levine Syndrome, Mahaim-type pre-excitation syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, tachycardias, and ventricular fibrillation.

Thrombosis include coronary thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, carotid artery thrombosis, sinus thrombosis, Wallenberg's syndrome, and thrombophlebitis.","Ischemia includes cerebral ischemia, ischemic colitis, compartment syndromes, anterior compartment syndrome, myocardial ischemia, reperfusion injuries, and peripheral limb ischemia. Vasculitis includes aortitis, arteritis, Behcet's Syndrome, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, thromboangiitis obliterans, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Schoenlein-Henoch purpura, allergic cutaneous vasculitis, and Wegener's granulomatosis.","In one embodiment, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention is used to treat thrombotic microangiopathies. One such disorder is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Kwaan, H. C., 24:71 (1987); Thompson et al., 80:1890 (1992)). Increasing TTP-associated mortality rates have been reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (Torok et al., 50:84 (1995)). Plasma from patients afflicted with TTP (including HIV+ and HIV-patients) induces apoptosis of human endothelial cells of dermal microvascular origin, but not large vessel origin (Laurence et al., 87:3245 (1996)). Plasma of TTP patients thus is thought to contain one or more factors that directly or indirectly induce apoptosis. As described in International patent application number WO 97\/01715 (hereby incorporated by reference), TRAIL is present in the serum of TTP patients, and is likely to play a role in inducing apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells. Another thrombotic microangiopathy is hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (Moake, J. L., 343:393 (1994); Melnyk et al., (155:2077 (1995); Thompson et al., supra). Thus, in one embodiment, the invention is directed to use of antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention to treat the condition that is often referred to as \u201cadult HUS\u201d (even though it can strike children as well). A disorder known as childhood\/diarrhea-associated HUS differs in etiology from adult HUS. In another embodiment, conditions characterized by clotting of small blood vessels may be treated using of antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, those described herein. For example, cardiac problems seen in about 5\u201310% of pediatric AIDS patients are believed to involve clotting of small blood vessels. Breakdown of the microvasculature in the heart has been reported in multiple sclerosis patients. As a further example, treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is contemplated. In one embodiment, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention, preferably antagonistic anti-TR4 antibodies of the invention, may be administered in vivo to a patient afflicted with a thrombotic microangiopathy. Thus, the present invention provides a method for treating a thrombotic microangiopathy, involving use of an effective amount of an antibody or antibody composition of the invention.","Antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention may be employed in combination with other agents useful in treating a particular disorder. For example, in an in vitro study reported by Laurence et al. (87:3245 (1996)), some reduction of TTP plasma-mediated apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells was achieved by using an anti-Fas blocking antibody, aurintricarboxylic acid, or normal plasma depleted of cryoprecipitate. Thus, a patient may be treated with an antibody or antibody composition of the invention in combination with an agent that inhibits Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis of endothelial cells, such as, for example, an agent described above. In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention and an anti-FAS blocking antibody are both administered to a patient afflicted with a disorder characterized by thrombotic microanglopathy, such as TTP or HUS. Examples of blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against Fas antigen (CD95) are described in International patent application publication number WO 95\/10540, hereby incorporated by reference.","The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate (Rastinejad et al., 56:345\u2013355 (1989)). In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic development, and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis, some types of eye disorders, and psoriasis. See, e.g., reviews by Moses et al., 9:710\u2013714 (1991); Folkman et al., 353:1757\u20131771 (1995); Auerbach et al., 29:401\u2013411 (1985); Folkman, , eds. Klein and Weinhouse, Academic Press, New York, pp. 175\u2013203 (1985); Patz, 94:715\u2013743 (1982); and Folkman et al., 221:719\u2013725 (1983). In a number of pathological conditions, the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example, significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun, 235:442\u2013447 (1987).","The present invention provides for treatment of diseases or disorders associated with neovascularization by administration of an antibody or antibody compositions of the invention. Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention include, but are not limited to those malignancies, solid tumors, and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art (for a review of such disorders, see Fishman et al., 2d Ed., J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia (1985)).","Additionally, ocular disorders associated with neovascularization which can be treated with an antibody or antibody composition of the invention include, but are not limited to: neovascular glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinoblastoma, retrolental fibroplasia, uveitis, retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration, corneal graft neovascularization, as well as other eye inflammatory diseases, ocular tumors and diseases associated with choroidal or iris neovascularization. See, e.g., reviews by Waltman et al., 85:704\u2013710 (1978) and Gartner et al., 22:291\u2013312 (1978).","Additionally, disorders which can be treated with an antibody or antibody composition of the invention include, but are not limited to, hemangioma, arthritis, psoriasis, angiofibroma, atherosclerotic plaques, delayed wound healing, granulations, hemophilic joints, hypertrophic scars, nonunion fractures, Osler-Weber syndrome, pyogenic granuloma, scleroderma, trachoma, and vascular adhesions.","Antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are useful in the diagnosis and treatment or prevention of a wide range of diseases and\/or conditions. Such diseases and conditions include, but are not limited to, cancer (e.g., immune cell related cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, follicular lymphoma, cancer associated with mutation or alteration of p53, brain tumor, bladder cancer, uterocervical cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, small cell carcinoma of the lung, stomach cancer, etc.), lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., lymphadenopathy), microbial (e.g., viral, bacterial, etc.) infection (e.g., HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 infection, herpesvirus infection (including, but not limited to, HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, VZV, HHV-6, HHV-7, EBV), adenovirus infection, poxvirus infection, human papilloma virus infection, hepatitis infection (e.g., HAV, HBV, HCV, etc.), infection, invasive , etc.), parasitic infection, nephritis, bone disease (e.g., osteoporosis), atherosclerosis, pain, cardiovascular disorders (e.g., neovascularization, hypovascularization or reduced circulation (e.g., ischemic disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.))), AIDS, allergy, inflammation, neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pigmentary retinitis, cerebellar degeneration, etc.), graft rejection (acute and chronic), graft vs. host disease, diseases due to osteomyelodysplasia (e.g., aplastic anemia, etc.), joint tissue destruction in rheumatism, liver disease (e.g., acute and chronic hepatitis, liver injury, and cirrhosis), autoimmune disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), immune complex glomerulonephritis, autoimmune diabetes, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, etc.), cardiomyopathy (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy), diabetes, diabetic complications (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy), influenza, asthma, psoriasis, glomerulonephritis, septic shock, and ulcerative colitis.","Antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are useful in promoting angiogenesis, wound healing (e.g., wounds, burns, and bone fractures).","Antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are also useful as an adjuvant to enhance immune responsiveness to specific antigen, such as in anti-viral immune responses.","More generally, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are useful in regulating (i.e., elevating or reducing) immune response. For example, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention may be useful in preparation or recovery from surgery, trauma, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and transplantation, or may be used to boost immune response and\/or recovery in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Alternatively, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are useful as immunosuppressive agents, for example in the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorders. In specific embodiments, antibodies and antibody compositions of the invention are used to treat or prevent chronic inflammatory, allergic or autoimmune conditions, such as those described herein or are otherwise known in the art.","Therapeutic\/Prophylactic Compositions and Administration","The invention provides methods of treatment, inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of antibody (or fragment or variant thereof) or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, preferably an antibody of the invention. In a preferred aspect, an antibody or fragment or variant thereof is substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). The subject is preferably an animal, including but not limited to, animals such as cows, pigs, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, etc., and is preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.","Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above; additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer antibody or fragment or variant thereof of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or antibody fragment, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J.

In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antibody, of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527\u20131535 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, N.Y., pp. 353\u2013365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317\u2013327; see generally ibid.).","In yet another embodiment, the composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:20 1 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, N.Y. (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:71 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:35 1 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 7 1:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115\u2013138 (1984)).","Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527\u20131535 (1990)).","In a specific embodiment where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a protein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864\u20131868 (1991)), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody or a fragment thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or fragment thereof, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.","In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocamne to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight, more preferably 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, human antibodies, fragments, or variants, (e.g., derivatives), or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.","It is preferred to use high affinity and\/or potent in vivo inhibiting and\/or neutralizing antibodies of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) that immunospecifically bind to TR4, or polynucleotides encoding antibodies that immunospecifically bind to TR4, for both immunoassays and therapy of disorders related to TR4 polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof. Such antibodies will preferably have an affinity for TR4 and\/or TR4 polypeptide fragments. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kof less than or equal to 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, or 10M. More preferably, antibodies of the invention bind TR4 polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof with a dissociation constant or Kless than or equal to 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, or 10M. Even more preferably, antibodies of the invention bind TR4 polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof with a dissociation constant or Kless than or equal to 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d7M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, or 10M. In a preferred embodiment, antibodies of the invention induce apoptosis of TR4 expressing cells.","As discussed in more detail below, the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs, radionuclides, or toxins. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 92\/08495; WO 91\/14438; WO 89\/12624; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,995; and EP 396,387.","The antibody and antibody compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, including but not limited to chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, antivirals, anti-retroviral agents, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, conventional immunotherapeutic agents and cytokines. Combinations may be administered either concomitantly, e.g., as an admixture, separately but simultaneously or concurrently; or sequentially. This includes presentations in which the combined agents are administered together as a therapeutic mixture, and also procedures in which the combined agents are administered separately but simultaneously, e.g., as through separate intravenous lines into the same individual. Administration \u201cin combination\u201d further includes the separate administration of one of the compounds or agents given first, followed by the second.","Combination Therapies with Anti-TR4 Antibodies, TRAIL, and\/or Chemotherapeutic Agents","Anti-TR4 antibodies may be administered in combination with other anti-TR4 antibodies, TRAIL, and\/or chemotherapeutics.","In specific embodiments, an antibody of the invention that specifically binds TR4 is used or administered in combination with a second antibody that specifically binds TR7. In another embodiment, the antibodies specific for TR4 and TR7 are agonistic antibodies that induce apoptosis of TR4 expressing cells (e.g., cells that express TR4 and TR7). In a specific embodiment, the combination of anti-TR4 treatment and anti-TR7 treatment induces more apoptosis of TR4 and TR7 expressing cells than either anti-TR4 antibody treatment or anti-TR7 antibody treatment alone. The anti-TR4 and anti-TR7 antibodies can be administered either simultaneously, sequentially, or a combination of simultaneous or sequential administration throughout the dosage regimen. In another specific embodiment anti-TR4 and anti-TR7 antibodies are used or administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug, such as those described herein (see, for example, below and Example 4). In a particular embodiment, the synergistic induction of apoptosis resulting from anti-TR4 and anti-TR7 antibody treatment, is more evident or more pronounced when the anti-TR4 and anti-TR7 antibodies are used or administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent and\/or a cross-linking reagent.","In a preferred embodiment, compositions of the invention are administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent.

In specific embodiments, the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized TRAIL receptor. The TR4 provided in the kit may also be attached to a solid support. In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above-described kit includes a solid support to which TR4 is attached. Such a kit may also include a non-attached reporter-labeled anti-human antibody. In this embodiment, binding of the antibody to TR4 can be detected by binding of the said reporter-labeled antibody.","In an additional embodiment, the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with a TRAIL receptor, and means for detecting the binding of TR4 polypeptides to the antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment, the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second, labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, the detecting means may include a labeled, competing antigen.","In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having surface-bound TRAIL receptors obtained by the methods of the present invention. After TR4 polypeptides bind to a specific antibody, the unbound serum components are removed by washing, reporter-labeled anti-human antibody is added, unbound anti-human antibody is removed by washing, and a reagent is reacted with reporter-labeled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-TR4 antibody on the solid support. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric, luminescent or colorimetric substrate.","The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s).","Thus, the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant TRAIL receptor, and a reporter-labeled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-TR4 antibody.","Placental Expression of TRAIL Receptors","The expression of tumor necrosis family receptors and ligands in whole placenta and in placental macrophage and trophoblast cell lines have been carefully examined. It has been shown that trophoblasts express TR7 and TR5 but not TR10 are entirely resistant to killing by recombinant TRAIL whereas macrophages, which express TR4, TR7 and TR10 but not TR5, are sensitive (Phillips et al., J. Immunol 15:6053\u20139 (1999) which is incorporated in its entirety by refrence herein). Thus the methods for using anti-TR4 antibodies described herein, may also be used on placenta and placental cell types (e.g., macrophagges and trophoblast cells) to prevent, treat, diagnose, ameliorate, or monitor diseases and disorders of the placenta placental cell types.","Gene Therapy","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or functional derivatives thereof, are administered to treat, inhibit or prevent a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of TRAIL Receptors and\/or its ligands (e.g., TRAIL), by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505 (1993); Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573\u2013596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926\u2013932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191\u2013217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 1 l(5):155\u2013215 (1993). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1993); and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, N.Y. (1990).","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises, or alternatively consists of, nucleic acids encoding an antibody, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989). In specific embodiments, the expressed antibody molecule is an scFv; alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains, or fragments or variants thereof, of an antibody.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429\u20134432 (1987)) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06 180; WO 92\/22715; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188, WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989)).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention or fragments or variants thereof are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:581\u2013599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., Biotherapy 6:29 1\u2013302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:644\u2013651(1994); Klein et al., Blood 83:1467\u20131473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, Human Gene Therapy 4:129\u2013141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110\u2013114 (1993).","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499\u2013503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3\u201310 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431\u2013434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143\u2013155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:225\u2013234 (1993); PCT Publication WO94\/12649; and Wang, et al., Gene Therapy 2:775\u2013783 (1995). In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (Walsh et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289\u2013300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (see, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, Meth. Enzymol. 217:599\u2013718 (1993); Cohen et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:718\u2013644 (1993); Clin. Pharma. Ther. 29:69\u201392m (1985)) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or fragment thereof are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, Cell 7 1:973\u2013985 (1992); Rheinwald, Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229 (1980); and Pittelkow and Scott, Mayo Clinic Proc. 71:771 (1986)).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","Rescue of Large scFv Libraries","An scFv library of up to 1\u00d710clones, which is an expanded version of the 1.38\u00d710library described (Vaughan et. al. (1996) 14: 309\u2013314), was used to select antibodies specific for TR4. Phage were rescued by taking 3\u00d710 cells from a glycerol stock culture and growing in 2YTAG (2YT media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin and 2% (w\/v) glucose) at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 h with shaking. M13K07 helper phage (Stratagene) was added to the culture at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of approximately 10. The culture was incubated stationary at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 min followed by 45 min with light aeration (200 rpm) at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged and the cells were resuspended in 500 ml 2YTAK (2YT media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg\/ml kanamycin), and the culture incubated overnight at 30\u00b0 C. with good aeration (300 rpm). Phage particles were purified and concentrated by three cycles of polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (20% PEG 6000, 2.5M NaCl) on ice, then resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 10transducing units (tu)\/ml, titrated as ampicillin resistant clones.","Panning of scFv Libraries on TR4","Soluble, purified TR4 fusion protein was produced by HGS. Purified phagemids were first deselected on an irrelevant fusion protein to remove any irrelevant binders. To do this, 500 \u03bcl of an irrelevant fusion protein was immobilised (10 \u03bcg\/ml in PBS) on a 75 mm\u00d712 mm immunotube (Nunc; Maxisorp) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. After washing 3 times with PBS, the tube was filled with 3% MPBS (3% \u2018Marvel\u2019 skimmed milk powder in PBS) and blocked for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. The wash was repeated and phagemid particles (10tu) in 500 \u03bcl 3% MPBS containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml irrelevant fusion protein were added and the tube incubated stationary at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h. The phagemid particles were then transferred to an immunotube which had been coated with TR4 (10 \u03bcg\/ml in PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and blocked for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 3% MPBS. The tube was incubated stationary at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour and then washed 10 times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v\/v) Tween 20), and 10 times with PBS. Bound phagemid particles were eluted with 1 ml 100 mM triethylamine for 10 min at room temperature, then immediately neutralised with 0.5 ml 1M Tris.HCl (pH 7.4). The eluted phage were used to infect 10 ml exponentially growing TG1. Infected cells were grown in 2YT broth for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. with light aeration, then streaked onto 2YTAG agar plates (243 mm\u00d7243 mm; Nunc) and incubated overnight at 30\u00b0 C. Colonies were scraped off the plates into 10 ml of 2YT broth and 15% (v\/v) glycerol added for storage \u221270\u00b0 C.","Glycerol stock cultures from the first round of panning on TR4 fusion protein were then superinfected with helper phage and rescued to give phagemid particles for the second round of panning. 25 \u03bcl of glycerol stock was inoculated into 25 ml 2TYAG broth, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with good aeration until the ODreached 0.7. M13K07 helper phage (moi=10) was added to the culture which was then incubated stationary for 15 min at 37\u00b0 C. then with shaking for 45 min at the same temperature. The culture was centrifuged, the cells were resuspended in 50 ml prewarmed 2YTAK and rescue was performed overnight at 30\u00b0 C. as before. Phagemid particles were purified and concentrated as before and resuspended in PBS to 10tu\/ml. Repertoires harvested at subsequent rounds of selection were superinfected and rescued in the same way.","Four rounds of panning selection were performed and individual colonies screened by phage ELISA for binding to TR4.","Phage ELISA","To determine the specificity of each of the antibodies, a phage ELISA was performed for each antibody against TR4 fusion protein and an irrelevant fusion protein.","Individual colonies containing phagemid were inoculated into 96 well plates containing 100 \u03bcl 2TYAG medium per well. Plates were incubated 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours, shaking. M13K07 helper phage was added to each well to an moi of 10 and the plates were incubated for a further 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The plates were centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl 2TYAK and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. overnight, shaking. The next day, plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and 100 \u03bcl phage-containing supernatant from each well carefully transferred into a fresh 96-well plate. Twenty \u03bcl of 6\u00d7MPBS was added to each well, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to block the phage prior to ELISA.","Flexible 96-well plates (Falcon) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with human TR4 (1 \u03bcg\/ml) or an irrelevant fusion protein (1 \u03bcg\/ml).

The entire immobilization experiment was performed at 5 \u03bcL\/min. A 3-minute injection of EDC\/NHS (1:1) was applied to each flow cell to active esters. A target level of \u02dc200RU was set as the goal for all each flow cell. Fc-fusion receptors, TR4 and TR2 at 5 \u03bcg\/mL, were immobilized onto individual flow cells of a sensor chip.

For comparison purposes, a TR4 polypeptide is used as a sample in this assay.","Assay for Ability of Anti-TRAIL-R1 (TR4) Antibodies to Induce Apoptosis","General Methods","Anti-TR4 antibodies are tested for their ability to induce apoptosis of TR4 expressing cells, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic or cross-linking agents. Briefly, antibodies are tested for activity to induce TR4 mediated apoptosis of TR4 expressing cell lines, SW480 and HeLa. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line, which does not express TR4, is used as a negative control.","To induce apoptosis, either HeLa or SW480 cells are incubated with the indicated concentration of monoclonal antibodies or a human IgG2a control antibody. One day prior to assay, cells (0.3\u00d710cells\/ml; 100 ul\/well) are seeded into wells of a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, the test antibody is added either in the presence or absence of 2.0 micrograms\/ml cycloheximide (Sigma R75010-7). In some experiments, the potency of anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody is compared to rhuTRAIL-FLAG protein (Alexis Biochemicals). rhuTRAIL is used at the indicated concentrations in the presence of anti-FLAG enhancer antibody at 2 micrograms\/ml. The effect of secondary crosslinking is also assessed by measuring the ability of the monoclonal antibodies to kill cells alone, or in the presence of a secondary goat-anti-human Ig Fc specific antibody (SIGMA). The secondary crosslinking antibody is added to cells at an equivalent concentration as the test monoclonal antibody. The ability of a chemotherapeutic agent to sensitize cells to killing via the monoclonal antibody is assessed by treating either Hela or SW480 cells with monoclonal antibody in the presence of Topotecan (Hycamtin, SmithKline Beecham NDC 0007-4201-01).","Assays are performed for 16\u201318 hrs at 37\u00b0 C., after which viability is revealed using the reagent, Alamar Blue (Biosource, cat. # DAL1100) using conditions suggested by the manufacturer. Alamar Blue fluorescence is detected using the CytoFluor fluorescence reader at 530 nm excitation and 590 emission. Results are expressed as a percent viability compared to untreated cells.","Other chemotherapeutics that may be tested in this assay (and used in treatment regimens in conjunction with the antibodies of the present invention) include, for example, 5-Fluorouracil, Etoposide, Taxol, Cisplatin, Cytabarine (Cytosar), IFN gamma, camptothecin, irinotecan (camptosar, CPT-11), adraimycin (doxorubicin), methotrexate, paraplatinin, interferon-alpha, paclitaxel, docetaxel, the NF-kappa-B inhibitor SN50, and gemcitabine (Gemzar\u2122). Other cell lines that may be tested in this assay include, for example, the human Burkitt lymphoma line ST486, human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, the human uterine carcinoma cell line RL-95, the human lung carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1, human colon cancer cell lines, LS174T, HT29, and HCT116, the su.86.86 and CFPAC pancreatic cancer cell lines, the human ovarian cancer cell line TOV21G, and the human heptocellular cancer cell line SNU449. Cancers of the tissues corresponding to the tissues from which these cancer cell lines were derived may be treated with the therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention.","Analysis of Anti-TR4 Antibodies","Using the assay above, several scFVs of the present invention that had been converted to whole IgG1 molecules were tested for the ability to induce apoptosis of TR4 1 (TR4) expressing cells. The IgG1 format of T1014A04 induces apotosis of SW480 cells in the presence of a cross linking agent, but in the absence of cycloheximide. In the presence of cycloheximide, but with or without a crosslinking reagent, the IgG1 format of T1014A04 induces apoptosis of SW480 and HeLa cells. Killing of SW480 and HeLa cells by treatment with the IgG1 format of T1014A04 in the presence of cyclohexomide is greater when crosslinking reagent is also used. In fact in the presence of crosslinking reagent, and cycloheximide, the IgG1 format of T1014A01 is able to induce more apoptosis than an equal concentration (in ng\/ml) of soluble TRAIL. The IgG1 format of T1015A02 does not induce killing in the absence of the sensitizing agent cycloheximide. In the presence of cycloheximide, with or without a crosslinking reagent, the IgG1 format of T1015A02 induces apoptosis of SW480 cells but not HeLa cells. Killing of SW480 by treatment with the IgG1 format of T1015A02 is greater in the presence of a crosslinking reagent.","In addition, the assay described in this example may also be used to test the effect of more than one anti-TR4 antibody on TR4 expressing cells. For example, cells may be treated with both an antibody that specifically binds TR4 and an antibody that specifically binds TR7. As above, this experiment may be performed in the presence of absence of one or more chemotherapeutic agents or crosslinking agents. In another variation of the present experiment antibodies of the invention may tested for the apoptosis inducing effect when used in the presence of TRAIL. The amount of apoptosis induced by dual treatment with anti-TR4 and anti-TR7 may be synergistic compared to treatment with either anti-TR4 or anti-TR7 alone. Such an effect may be more pronounced when the experiment is performed in the presence of chemotherapeutic and\/or crosslinking agents.","Identification and Cloning of VH and VL Domains","One method to identify and clone VH and VL domains from cell lines expressing a particular antibody is to perform PCR with VH and VL specific primers on cDNA made from the antibody expressing cell lines. Briefly, RNA is isolated from the cell lines and used as a template for RT-PCR designed to amplify the VH and VL domains of the antibodies expressed by the EBV cell lines. Cells may lysed in the TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville. Md.) and extracted with one fifth volume of chloroform. After addition of chloroform, the solution is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes, and the centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant is collected and RNA is precipitated using an equal volume of isopropanol. Precipitated RNA is pelleted by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. Following centrifugation, the supernatant is discarded and washed with 75% ethanol. Following washing, the RNA is centrifuged again at 800 rpm for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet allowed to air dry. RNA is the dissolved in DEPC water and heated to 60\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. Quantities of RNA can determined using optical density measurements.","cDNA may be synthesized, according to methods well-known in the art, from 1.5\u20132.5 micrograms of RNA using reverse transciptase and random hexamer primers. cDNA is then used as a template for PCR amplification of VH and VL domains. Primers used to amplify VH and VL genes are shown in Table 6. Typically a PCR reaction makes use of a single 5\u2032 primer and a single 3\u2032 primer. Sometimes, when the amount of available RNA template is limiting, or for greater efficiency, groups of 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 primers may be used. For example, sometimes all five VH-5\u2032 primers and all JH3\u2032 primers are used in a single PCR reaction. The PCR reaction is carried out in a 50 microliter volume containing 1\u00d7PCR buffer, 2mM of each dNTP, 0.7 units of High Fidelity Taq polymerse, 5\u2032 primer mix, 3\u2032 primer mix and 7.5 microliters of cDNA. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primer mix of both VH and VL can be made by pooling together 22 pmole and 28 pmole, respectively, of each of the individual primers. PCR conditions are: 96\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes; followed by 25 cycles of t 94\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, 50\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, and 72\u00b0 C. for 1 minute; followed by an extension cycle of 72\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. After the reaction is completed, sample tubes were stored 4\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0500","num":"0525"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Primer Sequences Used to Amplify VH and YL do-",{}]},{"entry":"mains."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Primer name","SEQ ID NO","Primer Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["VH Primers",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Hu VH1-5\u2032","6","CAGGTGCAGCTGGTGCAGTCTGG"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu VH2-5\u2032","7","CAGGTCAACTTAAGGGAGTCTGG"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu VH3-5\u2032","8","GAGGTGCAGCTGGTGGAGTCTGG"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu VH4-5\u2032","9","CAGGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCGGG"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu VH5-5\u2032","10","GAGGTGCAGCTGTTGCAGTCTGC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu VH6-5\u2032","11","CAGGTACAGCTGCAGCAGTCAGG"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu JH1,2-5\u2032","12","TGAGGAGACGGTGACCAGGGTGCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu JH3-5\u2032","13","TGAAGAGACGGTGACCATTGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu JH4,5-5\u2032","14","TGAGGAGACGGTGACCAGGGTTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu JH6-5\u2032","15","TGAGGAGACGGTGACCGTGGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"VL Primers"},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa1-5\u2032","16","GACATCCAGATGACCCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa2a-5\u2032","17","GATGTTGTGATGACTCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa2b-5\u2032","18","GATATTGTGATGACTCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa3-5\u2032","19","GAAATTGTGTTGACGCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa4-5\u2032","20","GACATCGTGATGACCCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa5-5\u2032","21","GAAACGACACTCACGCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vkappa6-5\u2032","22","GAAATTGTGCTGACTCAGTCTCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda1-5\u2032","23","CAGTCTGTGTTGACGCAGCCGCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda2-5\u2032","24","CAGTCTGCCCTGACTCAGCCTGC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda3-5\u2032","25","TCCTATGTGCTGACTCAGCCACC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda3b-5\u2032","26","TCTTCTGAGCTGACTCAGGACCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda4-5\u2032","27","CACGTTATACTGACTCAACCGCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda5-5\u2032","28","CAGGCTGTGCTCACTGAGCCGTC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Vlambda6-5\u2032","29","AATTTTATGCTGACTCAGCCCCA"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jkappa1-3\u2032","30","ACGTTTGATTTCCACCTTGGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jkappa2-3\u2032","31","ACGTTTGATCTCCAGCTTGGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jkappa3-3\u2032","32","ACGTTTGATATCCACTTTGGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jkappa4-3\u2032","33","ACGTTTGATCTCCACCTTGGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jkappa5-3\u2032","34","ACGTTTAATCTCCAGTCGTGTCCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda1-3\u2032","35","CAGTCTGTGTTGACGCAGCCGCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda2-3\u2032","36","CAGTCTGCCCTGACTCAGCCTGC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda3--3\u2032","37","TCCTATGTGCTGACTCAGCCACC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda3b-3\u2032","38","TCTTCTGAGCTGACTCAGGACCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda4-3\u2032","39","CACGTTATACTGACTCAACCGCC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda5-3\u2032","40","CAGGCTGTGCTCACTCAGCCGTC"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Hu Jlambda6-3\u2032","41","AATTTTATGCTGACTCAGCCCCA"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"PCR samples are then electrophoresed on a 1.3% agarose gel.

The tumor cells were harvested from the T-150 flasks, rinsed with sterile PBS and then resuspended in sterile saline at a density of 5(104) cells\/ul. Tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously on the upper back or flanks of Swiss athymic mice at a density of 10cells per site, 2 sites per animal. In preventive (de novo) tumor models, chemotherapeutic agents and antibody treatments were initiated 24 hr post-tumor cell inoculation.","The antibody treatment, with an antibody comprising the VH and VL domain from either T1014A04 or T1014G03 (in this example hereinafter \u201cT1014A04\u201d or \u201cT1014G03\u201d), was as follows: loading dose: 20 mg\/kg, intravenously 24 hours post injection of tumor cells with maintenance doses of 10 mg\/kg, intraperitoneally. Maintenance doses of T1014A04 were given on days four, seven, ten, thirteen and sixteen. Maintenance doses of T1014G03 were given on days four, seven, ten, fourteen, twenty-two and twenty-five.

Cell viability was determined using an ALAMAR Blue\u2122 (Biosource International, Camarillo, Calif.) assay. TRAIL reduced cell viability at all concentrations tested, and induced caspase activity at the highest concentration tested. In contrast to TRAIL, T1014G03 treatment was found not to effect either caspase or cell viability in Human hepatocytes.","The objective of this experiment was to examine whether T1014G03 is able to alter the growth pattern of the RL95-2 tumor in athymic mice when T1014G03 is used as a single agent.","RL95-2 is a uterine adenocarcinoma cell line that forms solid tumors when injected subcutaneously in athymic mice.

The growth of tumor was significantly retarded in mice T1014G03 antibody treatment at 20 mg\/Kg compared to the control and T1014F08 treated animals. The effect of T1014G03 antibody at 0.2 and 2.0 mg\/Kg was not significantly different from the control.

One of skill in the art will be aware of routine modifications to the protocol described below, for example, as regards column choice, column, loading, wash, and elution buffers, and pH.","Cell Culture Scale-up and Antibody Production","A serum-free and animal source-free growth medium (HGS-NS0SF) is used from thawing cells through scale-up to the production bioreactor. The HGS-NS0SF growth medium is prepared by adding 20 mL\/L GS supplement and 1 mL\/L cholesterol (synthetic) lipid concentrate into 1 L CD hybridoma media without 1-glutamine (Invitrogen\/Life technologies). The media are stored at 2\u20138\u00b0 C. until use.","Thawing cells from MCB Vial(s)","Approximately 16\u00d710cells are thawed at 37\u00b0 C. in a water bath. The cells are transferred into T-225 culture flask(s) to yield approximately 50 mL working volume with an inoculation density of approximately 3.0\u00d710cells\/mL. The culture flask(s) is then placed in a humidified COincubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% COfor 4 days.","First Expansion(s) of Culture in Spinner Flask","The culture is aseptically expanded into a 500 mL spinner flask to give approximately 300 mL working volume, at an inoculation cell density of approximately 2.2\u00d710cells\/mL. The spinner flask is then placed on magnetic stirrers in a humidified COincubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% COfor 4 days. The agitation rate for the spinner flask is 80 rpm.","The culture is again expanded aseptically into one 3000 mL spinner flask to give approximately 1500 mL working volume, at an inoculation cell density of approximately 2.2\u00d710cells\/mL. The spinner flask is then placed on magnetic stirrers in a humidified COincubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% COfor 4 days. The agitation rate for the spinner flasks is 80 rpm. If a sufficient amount of cell culture is accumulated to inoculate the seed bioreactor, proceed to Step 4. If not, the culture is expanded aseptically into multiple 3000 mL spinner flasks for a total of 3 to 4 expansions, until a sufficient amount of cell culture is accumulated to inoculate the seed bioreactor.","Seed Culture","The seed bioreactor is equipped with 2 impellers for mixing, a dissolved oxygen probe, a temperature probe, a pH probe, aseptic sampling and additional systems. The first step of the cell cultivation process is the addition of HGS-NS0SF media into the bioreactor. After the HGS-NS0SF media temperature reaches 37\u00b10.5\u00b0 C., the dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH levels are stabilized by addition of Nand COto decrease dissolved oxygen concentration to 30\u00b15% air saturation, and obtain a pH of 7.20\u00b10.10. The agitation rate is 80 rpm. The pooled cell culture is transferred aseptically to a 15 L seed bioreactor containing sterile HGS-NS0SF growth media to yield a culture with an inoculation cell density of approximately 2.2\u00d710cells\/mL. During the cultivation process the temperature is maintained via a heat blanket and a cooling finger, the oxygen concentration is maintained via sparger and surface aeration, and pH is controlled by addition of COgas to lower the pH. The cultivation period is 5\u20136 days. The bioreactor air vents are protected by hydrophobic 0.2 \u03bcm vent filters.","Production Culture","The production bioreactor is equipped with 2 impellers for mixing, 2 dissolved oxygen probes, a temperature probe, 2 pH probes, aseptic sampling and additional systems. 80 L of HGS-NS0SF growth media is aseptically transferred into the 100 L production bioreactor. After the HGS-NS0SF growth media temperature reaches 37\u00b10.5\u00b0 C., the DO and pH levels are stabilized by addition of Nand COto decrease dissolved oxygen concentration to 30\u00b15% air saturation, and obtain a pH of 7.20\u00b10.10. The agitation rate is 45 rpm. The 15 L seed culture is aseptically transferred into the production bioreactor to yield a culture with an inoculation cell density of approximately 2.2\u00d710cells\/mL. During the cultivation process the temperature is maintained via a heat exchanger, the oxygen concentration is maintained via sparger and surface aeration, and pH is controlled by addition of COgas to lower the pH. On day 3 after inoculation when cell density reaches approximately 1.0\u00d710cells\/mL, approximately 6 L of HGS-NS0SF fed-batch media was fed into the production bioreactor. The production culture containing the antibody was harvested on Day 5 after feeding.","Harvest of Cell Supernatant","Cell supernatant, (e.g., culture supernatant from NSO cells expressing antibodies of the invention) is harvested on day 5 or 6 post final feeding in the final production bioreactor using a fed-batch cell culture process. The harvest process is started when the antibody concentration of at least 400 mg\/L is attained. Cell culture temperature in the production bioreactor is cooled down to 15\u00b0 C. at the time of harvest and maintained at that temperature during the recovery. A depth filtration process is used for cell removal and antibody recovery. The filtration process train consists of 4.5 \u03bcm, 0.45 \u03bcm and 0.2 \u03bcm pore size filters connected in series. A constant flow rate of 1.00 L\/min is maintained during the operation with a cross-filter-pressure control of up to 15 psi. The 0.2 \u03bcm filtered culture supernatant is collected in a process bag and transferred for purification.","The purification process is conducted at 22 to 26\u00b0 C.","Chromatography on MEP HyperCEL HCIC Column","The culture supernatant is loaded onto a MEP HyperCEL\u2122 column, a Hydrophobic charge interaction chromatography, HCIC, available from Ciphergen Biosystems, or equivalent column that is equilibrated in 50 mM Tris, 0.5 M sodium chloride, pH 7.5. The MEP column is washed with 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 6.4 and eluted with 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 4.4. The elution is monitored by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 280 nm. The peak fractions are collected, analyzed by Aand SDS-PAGE. Appropriate fractions are pooled.","Virus Inactivation","The eluate from the MEP column is adjusted with 1 M citric acid to pH 3.4\u00b10.2 and allowed to stand for 45\u201360 minutes for viral inactivation. The solution is then re-adjusted to pH 5.0 with 1 M Tris base.","Chromatography on SP Sepharose FF Column","The inactivated eluate from the MEP column is diluted with water for injection (WFI) to a conductivity of 5 mS\/cm, and loaded onto a SP Sepharose FF (cation exchange chromatography, Amersham-Pharmacia) column, or equivalent column equilibrated with 65 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The antibody is eluted from the SP column with 20 mM sodium citrate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 1.9% glycine, pH 7.1. The elution is monitored by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 280 nm. Peak fractions are collected and analyzed by Aand SDS-PAGE. Appropriate fractions are pooled.","Virus Removal Filtration, Diafiltration and Concentration","The eluate from the SP Sepharose FF column is filtered through a sequentially connected 0.2 \u03bcm filter and a Pall DV50 viral removal filter. The DV50 filtrate is placed into a 30 kD MW cut-off membrane device (Millipore Pellicon) to concentrate to a target concentration of 35\u201340 mg\/mL, and diafiltered against 10 mM sodium citrate, 1.9% glycine, 0.5% sucrose, pH 6.5. The diafiltered material is monitored by A. The diafiltered bulk is 0.2 \u03bcm filtered and stored at 2\u20138\u00b0 C. up to 24 hours.","Chromatography on Q Sepharose FF Column","The diafiltered TRM-1 solution is passed over a Q Sepharose FF column (anion exchange chromatography, Amersham-Pharmacia) or equivalent column equilibrated with 10 mM sodium citrate, 1.9% glycine, 0.5% sucrose, pH 6.5. The antibody is collected in the flow-through and monitored by A. Appropriate fractions are pooled and the final target concentration is 25 mg\/mL.","Bulk Formulation, Filtration and Bulk Drug Substance Fill","Polysorbate 80 (2% stock solution) is pre-filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and added to the antibody solution from step 7 to a final concentration of 0.02%. The purified antibody is aseptically filtered under a laminar flow hood through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and filled into polypropylene containers.","Storage of Bulk Drug Substance","The bulk drug substance is stored at 2\u20138\u00b0 C. (short-term storage) or at or below \u221265\u00b0 C. (long-term storage) prior to the release of the product. In-process testing of the unprocessed production bioreactor culture at harvest for each batch and in-process testing during the purification process are performed. The bioreactor is sampled aseptically and the culture is tested at various times throughout cultivation for cell density, viability and nutrient determination to ensure consistency of material being supplied for purification. The purification process is monitored at each step. Appearance is checked by visual inspection. The protein concentration is determined by Absorbance at 280 nm. The pH of the material is checked. Purity is checked, for example, by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. An ELISA may be performed to check the ability of the antibody to bind its antigen. The biological activity of the antibody is also monitored. Residual DNA content, Endotoxin levels, and the bioburden (the number of viable organisms present in the antibody preparation) are all monitored and kept at or below standard acceptable levels. Additionally the oligosaccharide content may be analyzed; the peptide sequence of the antibody chains may also be analyzed using N-terminal sequencing and peptide mapping. Short and long-term studies of antibody stability may also be performed.","It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples.
