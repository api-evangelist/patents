No. 09\/926,336, filed Oct. 15, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,601,916 B1, issued Aug. 5, 2003, which is the national stage application under \u00a7371 of International application PCT\/JP01\/03592, filed Apr. 25, 2001, which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a safety seat for children that is attached to a seat of a motor vehicle and protects a child from an impact, an external discharge from a vehicle or the like at a time of collision.","Importance of safety seats for children is a common recognition in all the countries in the world, and in our country as well, an amendment of Road Traffic Law that includes such obligations for wearing a safety seat for children went into effect in April, 2000. Together therewith, there has been developed various kinds of safety seats for children, however, in view of the necessity to meet safety standards, basic structures thereof are substantially common.","That is, most of the safety seats for children are provided with a seat-shaped main body portion obtained by combining a seat surface portion and a back rest reclining portion so as to make it compact in correspondence to a body shape of the child, and are structured such that the main body portion is mounted on a base portion except a part thereof. Then, by using a seat belt, the main body portion is fixed to a seat of a motor vehicle, and the child is fixed by a belt provided in the main body portion.","It is needless to say that the safety seat for children having such a basic structure has high safety, however, on the contrary, since a size and a weight of the safety seat for children are increased, there are problems that it is not easily attached to and detached from a seat of a motor vehicle, as well as such a safety seat for children is not easily stored and carried.","As a structure for solving the problems in view of handling, there has been developed a wear type safety seat for children. This is structured such that a crotch belt or the like is attached to a vest type main body portion so as to obtain a fixing function to the child, as well as a seat belt of the motor vehicle is passed through a back portion thereof so as to obtain a fixing function to the seat.","It is needless to say that the safety seat for children of such a flexible structure has a greater handling property. Further, it is allowed by the safety standard and has no problem in view of safety. However, in accordance with the safety seat for children of this kind, the child directly sits on a seat surface of the motor vehicle, and in most cases, an eye line is disposed below a window and screened by a door. As a result, the child has a great cooped-up feeling.","First of all, the safety seat for children restrains the child without relation to the type thereof and gives not a little uncomfortable feeling, so that it is said to be a great problem to give a cooped-up feeling so as to increase an uncomfortable feeling.","Further, the wear type safety seat for children applied a great pressure to shoulder portions of the child at a time of collision and in some cases there is a risk that a clavicle is broken.","The present invention is made by taking the matters mentioned above into consideration, and an object of the present invention is to provide a safety seat for children which can of course secure a high safety, is excellent in a handling property and can widely reduce an uncomfortable feeling of a child.","In order to achieve the object mentioned above, a safety seat for children according to the present invention, comprising: a seat surface portion having a flexible structure; and a back rest reclining portion having a flexible structure, characterized in that at least the seat surface portion among the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion is constituted by an airtight bag body expanding due to an injection of gas so as to form an air cushion, at least the back rest reclining portion among the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion has a fixing mechanism with respect to a child, and at least one of the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion has a fixing mechanism with respect to a seat of a motor vehicle.","In accordance with the safety seat for children according to the present invention, in spite that the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion have the flexible structure, it is possible to sit the child at a high position and it is possible to make an eye line high, whereby it is possible to remove a cooped-up feeling. Further, since at least the back rest reclining portion among the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion has the fixing mechanism with respect to the child, it is possible to secure a necessary safety.","The fixing mechanism with respect to the child can be constituted by a wear type, preferably a vest shaped wear type fixing portion. Accordingly, it is possible to securely fix the child.","The wear type fixing portion can be structured such that an air cushion is provided in at least a part thereof, preferably in at least both shoulder portions, and more preferably in a portion extending from both shoulder portions to a back. Accordingly, it is possible to increase an impact absorbing property and improve a safety. Further, a sitting feeling can be improved.","The wear type fixing portion can be combined with a crotch hanging type fixing belt. Accordingly, it is possible to more securely fix the child.","The wear type fixing portion can be combined with a pants type fixing portion. Accordingly, it is possible to more securely fix the child.","The wear type fixing portion can be commonly used as the back rest reclining portion. Accordingly, a structure can be simplified.","The wear type fixing portion commonly used as the back rest reclining portion can be structured so as to be attached to and detached from the seat surface portion. Accordingly, it is possible to improve a mounting property to the child.","The fixing mechanism with respect to the child may be a multi-point supporting type fixing belt. The fixing mechanism with respect to the seat of the motor vehicle is provided in at least one of the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion, however, in view of preventing the back rest reclining portion from being bent forward so as to be fallen down at a time of being exposed to an impact, it is preferable to provide it in the portion including the back rest reclining portion, and in the case of using the wear type fixing portion, it is preferable to provide it therein.","The seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion can be constituted by an airtight bag body. Accordingly, a sitting feeling can be improved and a safety can be improved.","In this case, the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion may be structured so as to form a seat-shaped air cushion in a state that the gas is injected, or may be structured so as to form a mat-shaped air cushion in a state that the gas is injected and to deform along the seat surface and the back rest reclining portion in a state of being mounted to the seat of the motor vehicle, thereby forming a seat-shaped air cushion. In the latter case, it is possible to be folded particularly in a compact size in a state that the air is taken out.","In accordance with the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the invention will be described in detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIGS. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["6","4"]},"The safety seat for children in accordance with the first embodiment is, as shown in , constituted by a seat surface portion  having an air cushion structure, a wear type back rest reclining portion  commonly used as a fixing portion, and a crotch hanging type fixing belt  combined with the back rest reclining portion .","The seat surface portion  is, as shown in , constituted by a main body portion  which mainly receives a weight of a child, a pair of first holding portions  and  protruding upward from both side portions of the main body portion  and a comparatively thin second holding portion  extending upward from an end portion in a back surface side of the main body portion , and is formed in such a manner as to surround a waist portion of the child from three directions. Then, these portions are constituted by an integrally formed airtight bag body, and are expanded as illustrated by being injected with an air from an air injection port  provided on a front surface of the main body portion  so as to form an air cushion having a predetermined shape. A fastener  is attached in an upper edge portion of the second holding portion  for the purpose of connecting to the back rest reclining portion .","The wear type back rest reclining portion  is of a front open vest type. The back rest reclining portion  can be separated from the seat surface portion , and can be integrally formed with the seat surface portion  by connecting a fastener  laterally mounted to a portion of the back to the fastener  of the seat surface portion . The fastener  is provided a little above a lower end portion of the back rest reclining portion . Accordingly, a lower portion of the back rest reclining portion  overlaps on a front surface side of the second holding portion  in the seat surface portion .","The vest type back rest reclining portion  has size adjusting belts  in both shoulder portions, as shown in . An air cushion  is mounted to a portion extending from both shoulders of the back rest reclining portion  to the back. The air cushion  is commonly used as a fixing mechanism with respect to the seat of the motor vehicle. That is, a seat belt  of the motor vehicle is passed between the main body of the back rest reclining portion  and the air cushion , and a lateral band portion of the seat belt  is fixed to the main body of the back rest reclining portion  in both sides of the air cushion  by a pair of stoppers  and , thereby fixing the safety seat for children to the seat of the motor vehicle. The stoppers  and  are formed, for example, in a hair pin shape, and are inserted into the main body of the back rest reclining portion , thereby fixing the lateral band portion of seat belt  to the main body thereof.","Both shoulder portions of the air cushion  are fixed by a surface fastener  for the purpose of operating the size adjusting belt . Three (two in front, and one in the rear) belt loops ,  and  are provided in a lower portion of the back rest reclining portion  for the purpose of mounting the fixing belt . Reference numeral  denotes an air injection port of the air cushion .","The crotch hanging type fixing belt  is structured such that two crotch belts  and  are mounted to a waist belt , and is mounted to the back rest reclining portion  by passing the waist belt  through the belt loops ,  and .","A using method and a function of the safety seat for children in accordance with the first embodiment are as follows.","The air is injected to the seat surface portion  of the safety seat for children, and the seat surface portion  is expanded until a predetermined rigidity is obtained. The back rest reclining portion  is connected to the seat surface portion . The fixing belt  is mounted on the back rest reclining portion  and the air is also injected to the air cushion . In this state, the safety seat for children is mounted to the seat of the motor vehicle so as to be fixed thereto by using the seat belt  and the stoppers  and . In this case, the air may be injected by an air pump using a cigar lighter in the motor vehicle as a power source.","Since the safety seat for children does not use a resin or metal flame, it is light, and it can be deformed even in a state that the air is injected to the seat surface portion  or the air cushion . Accordingly, it is easy to mount on the seat.","A child is seated on the seat surface portion  of the safety seat for children mounted on the seat of the motor vehicle, the vest type back rest reclining portion  is worn on the child and the fixing belt  is attached. Accordingly, the child is fixed to the safety seat for children. The structure may be made such that before the back rest reclining portion  is connected to the seat surface portion , the back rest reclining portion  is worn on the child and thereafter the back rest reclining portion  is connected to the seat surface portion .","The safety seat for children has a fixing function with respect to the child by itself, and the fixing function with respect to the child can be also achieved by fixing the fixing belt . In accordance with these structures, the child is securely fixed to the safety seat for children. Further, since particularly the main body of the back rest reclining portion  in the safety seat for children is fixed to the seat of the motor vehicle, it is possible to prevent the main body of the back rest reclining portion  from forward falling down at a time of receiving an impact.","Further, the child does not directly sit on the seat of the motor vehicle but sits on the seat surface portion . Accordingly, since an eye line of the child is made high and a cooped-up feeling is removed, an uncomfortable feeling is widely reduced in comparison with a case of directly sitting on the seat. Since the seat surface portion  has a cushion function in itself, a sitting feeling is good even when the cushion is not mounted thereon. In addition, since the air cushion  is also provided in the back rest reclining portion , a sitting feeling becomes further good, and an effect of reducing an impact at a time of collision, particularly an effect of protecting a clavicle of a child is increased.","When taking the air out of the air cushion  of the seat surface portion  and the back rest reclining portion , the safety seat for children loses a rigidity so as to return its original flexible state. Accordingly, it is possible to fold up small, whereby it is possible to store and transfer. That is, as shown in , the safety seat for children from which the air is taken out may be stored in an exclusive bag . Reference numeral  in  denotes a accommodating portion of an air pump for inflating the air cushion .","As mentioned above, in accordance with the safety seat for children of the first embodiment, although the seat surface portion  and the back rest reclining portion  are made in the flexible structure which can be easily transferred and stored, it is possible to make the child sit at a high position, so that it is possible to widely reduce an uncomfortable feeling of the child.","Further, the back rest reclining portion  is commonly used as the fixing mechanism with respect to the child. Accordingly, it is comparatively compact.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"]},"A back rest reclining portion  shown in  is different from the back rest reclining portion  mentioned above in view that a pants type fixing portion  is combined in place of the fixing belt .

The shoulder belt  is inserted into one of holes , , and engages with one of engaging fixtures , .","In practice, as shown in , with the cover portion  closed, passing the seat belt  through the opening , and thereafter engaging the belt  with the first engaging means causes the child seat to be fixed to the seat of a motor vehicle.","As shown in ,  and , the board  is provided at the upper end with an engaging hole  and at both ends with engaging holes , respectively as second engaging means of engaging a fixing belt  for fixing the child seat to a seat of a motor vehicle and of engaging fixing belts , ","The fixing belt  is mounted at one end thereof with an engaging piece , the engaging piece  being engaged with the engaging hole . On the other hand, the fixing belts , are sawn at one end thereof to the engaging holes , . The fixing belts , , are provided at the other end with hooks as shown in , the hooks being engaged respectively with engaging portions provided on the seat portion of a seat of a motor vehicle.","In practice, engaging one end of the fixing belts , , with the engaging holes , , , and thereafter passing the other end thereof through the opening  of the cover portion  causes both the ends to be engaged respectively with the engaging portions of a seat of a motor vehicle with the cover portion  in question closed. Doing in such a manner allows the child seat to be fixed to a seat of a motor vehicle by the use of the board  and the fixing belts , , , as shown in FIG. .","With such a child seat in accordance with the ninth embodiment, the fixing mechanism with respect to a seat of a motor vehicle is provided with the board  engageable with the seat belt  or the fixing belts , , , so that the child seat in question can be fixed positively to the seat of a motor vehicle, thus allowing the safety to be further improved.","While the child seat has been configured so as to be fixed to the seat by the use of one of the seat belt  and the fixing belts , , , it is also naturally possible that the child seat is fixed to the seat by the use of both of the seat belt  and the fixing belts , , ","While the board  has been configured so as to be provided with both of the first engaging means and the second engaging means, it is sufficient that the board is provided with one of the first engaging means and the second engaging means.","Furthermore, while the board  has been configured so as to be provided with the engaging hole , and the engaging holes , as the second engaging means, the position in which the engaging holes are provided, and the number thereof are optional. For example, in the case where depending on the kind of a motor vehicle, the engaging portion for engaging the other end is provided on ceiling and the like inside the motor vehicle, rather than on the seat, it is also sufficient that the engaging portion is provided on the four corners of the board .","While the back rest reclining portion body  here has been configured so as to be formed on the inside surface with the hole , it is also sufficient that the body is formed on the outside surface with the hole . Where the design has been changed in such a manner, the outside portion of the cover portion  is provided with the openings , .","While the board  has been configured so as to be incorporated into the back rest reclining portion , it is also possible that the board is incorporated into the seat surface portion . In this case, it is sufficient to use the fixing belt rather than the seat belt .","As described above, since the safety seat for children in accordance with the present invention is provided with the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion having the flexible structure, and at least the seat surface portion among the seat surface portion and the back rest reclining portion is constituted by the airtight bag body which expands due to the injection of the gas so as to form the air cushion, it is possible to make the child sit at the high position and it is possible to widely reduce the uncomfortable feeling of the child in spite that the back surface portion and the back rest reclining portion are made in the flexible structure which is easily transferred and stored. Further, since the sitting feeling is good and it is possible to be deformed in spite of being light even in a state that the air is injected, it is easy to mount it.","Further, by mounting the air cushion to the shoulder portions, it is possible to reduce the pressure applied to the shoulder portions at a time of collision and it is possible to previously prevent the clavicle or the like from being broken."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"FIG.
