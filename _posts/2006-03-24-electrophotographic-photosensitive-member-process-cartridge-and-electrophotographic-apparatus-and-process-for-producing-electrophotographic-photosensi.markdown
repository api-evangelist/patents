{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","EXAMPLES","Examples","Examples 1 to 34","Comparative Examples 1 to 14"],"p":["This invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have the electrophotographic photosensitive member, and also to a process for producing the electrophotographic photosensitive member.","In recent years, research and development are energetically made on electrophotographic photosensitive members making use of organic photoconductive materials (i.e., organic electrophotographic photosensitive members).","The electrophotographic photosensitive members are each basically constituted of a support and a photosensitive layer formed on the support. Under existing circumstances, however, various layers are often formed between the support and the photosensitive layer in order to, e.g., cover defects on the support surface, improve coating performance for the photosensitive layer, improve the adhesiveness between the support and the photosensitive layer, protect the photosensitive layer from electrical breakdown, improve chargeability, and improve the performance of blocking the injection of electric charges from the support to the photosensitive layer. Thus, the layers to be formed between the support and the photosensitive layer are required to have many functions such as covering properties, adhesiveness, mechanical strength, conductivity, electrical barrier properties, and so forth.","The layers to be provided between the support and the photosensitive layer are conventionally known to include the following types.\n\n","The type-(i) layer contains no conductive material, and hence the layer has a high resistivity. Moreover, in order to cover defects on the support surface having not been subjected to surface smoothing treatment, it must be formed in a large thickness (layer thickness).","However, if such a type-(i) layer having a high resistivity is formed in a large layer thickness, a problem may arise such that it brings about a high residual potential at the initial stage and during repeated use.","Accordingly, in order for the type-(i) layer to be put into practical use, it is necessary to lessen defects on the support surface and also to form the layer in a small layer thickness.","On the other hand, the type-(ii) layer is a layer in which a conductive material such as conductive particles are dispersed in a resin, and the layer can be made to have a low resistivity. Hence, the layer may be formed in a large layer thickness so as to cover defects on the surface of a conductive support or a non-conductive support (such as a support made of a resin).","However, where the type-(ii) layer is formed in a large layer thickness, the layer must be endowed with a sufficient conductivity, compared with the type-(i) layer to be formed in a small thickness, and hence the type-(ii) layer results in a layer having a low volume resistivity. Hence, in order to block the injection of electric charges from the support and the type-(ii) layer into the photosensitive layer, which is causative of image defects, under environmental conditions ranging broadly from low temperature and low humidity to high temperature and high humidity, it is preferable that a layer having electrical barrier properties is additionally provided between the type-(ii) layer and the photosensitive layer. Such a layer having electrical barrier properties is a resin layer containing no conductive material, such as the type-(i) layer.","That is, the layer to be provided between the support and the photosensitive layer may preferably have the type-(iii) constitution in which the type-(i) layer and the type-(ii) layer are superimposed one on another.","The type-(iii) constitution requires formation of a plurality of layers, and hence requires steps in a correspondingly larger number. However, it has such an advantage that the tolerance for defects on the support surface can be of a wide range, and hence the tolerance for the use of the support can be of a vastly wide range, promising the achievement of improvement in productivity.","In general, the type-(ii) layer is called a conductive layer and the type-(i) layer is called an intermediate layer (a subbing layer or a barrier layer).","An aluminum pipe produced by a production process having an extrusion step and a drawing step and an aluminum pipe produced by a production process having an extrusion step and an ironing step are used as supports for electrophotographic photosensitive members, which can achieve a good dimensional precision and surface smoothness as non-cut pipes without requiring surface cutting and besides are advantageous in view of cost as well. However, burr-like protruding defects tend to occur on the surfaces of these aluminum non-cut pipes. Thus, from the viewpoint of covering surface defects of such supports, too, the type-(iii) constitution is preferred.","As the conductive material used in the conductive layer, it includes various metals, metal oxides and conductive polymers. In particular, tin oxide (hereinafter also \u201cSnO\u201d) having powder resistivity usually in the range of from 10to 10\u03a9cm is preferred as having superior resistivity characteristics. A conductive material is also available whose powder resistivity is reduced to 1\/1,000 to 1\/100,000 by mixing (or doping), when the SnOconductive material is produced, a compound of a metal having a valence different from tin, such as antimony oxide, or a non-metallic element. An oxygen deficient SnOconductive material is also available in which the resistivity of SnOhas been made to be as small as that of antimony doped materials without adding constituent elements and in a non-doped state.","As prior art relating to oxygen deficient SnO, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H07-295245 for example discloses a technique making use of oxygen deficient SnOin a conductive layer. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H06-208238 also discloses a technique in which barium sulfate particles are coated with oxygen deficient SnOso that dispersibility can be further improved than that in a case in which only SnOis used. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-186702 still also discloses a technique in which barium sulfate particles are used in order to improve dispersibility, the particles being coated with titanium oxide (TiO) in order to improve whiteness and further coated with SnOin order to provide conductivity. This Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-186702, however, does not disclose any embodiments of the oxygen deficient SnO.","In recent years, an electrophotographic apparatus has become widely used employing a contact charging system in which a voltage is applied to a charging member provided in contact with an electrophotographic photosensitive member (i.e., a contact charging member), to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member. In particular, a system is prevalent in which a roller-shaped contact charging member (a charging roller) is brought into contact with the surface of an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a voltage generated by superimposing an alternating-current voltage on a direct-current voltage is applied thereto to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member (an AC\/DC contact charging system), or in which only a direct-current voltage is applied to the charging member to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member (a DC contact charging system).","In the AC\/DC contact charging system, there are disadvantages, e.g., such that a direct-current power source and an alternating-current power source are required to bring about a rise in cost of the electrophotographic apparatus itself and that the size of electrophotographic apparatus becomes enlarged as compared with the case of the DC contact charging system. In addition, there is such a disadvantage that alternating current consumed in a large quantity causes deterioration in durability of the contact charging member and electrophotographic apparatus.","Accordingly, taking into account cost reduction, compactness and high durability, the DC contact charging system can be said to be more preferred.","However, electrophotographic apparatus employing the DC contact charging system tend to become inferior in the uniformity of the surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member at the time of charging (i.e., charging uniformity) to electrophotographic apparatus employing the AC\/DC contact charging system. Accordingly, faulty images caused by non-uniform charging and appearing in non-uniform lines in the lengthwise direction (the direction perpendicular to the peripheral direction) of the electrophotographic photosensitive member (hereinafter also \u201ccharging lines\u201d) are apt to bring about a problem in halftone images or the like.","In regard to such a problem, a proposal for improvement has been made in respect of the charging member. Specifically, as a measure for improving charging uniformity, studies are made on how to make the resistance distribution of the charging member uniform and improve the surface properties of the charging member.","As to the former, measures are available in which, e.g., the dispersion of a conductive material in a surface layer (outermost layer) of the charging member is improved, a resin having a relatively low volume resistivity is used in a binding material of a surface layer of the contact charging member, and the layer thickness of each layer constituting the contact charging member is adjusted to be uniform.","As to the latter, measures are available in which, e.g., a leveling agent is added to a surface layer of the charging member, and an elastic layer of the charging member is improved in surface properties.","In the case where only a direct-current voltage is applied to the charging member to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H05-341620 proposes a technique in which the surface roughness of the charging member is made to be 5 \u03bcm or less to achieve the charging uniformity.","Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H08-286468 proposes a technique in which that the ten-point average roughness Rz jis (JIS B 0601) of the charging member surface is made to be 20 \u03bcm or less in order for the charging uniformity to be secured to provide good images.","According to the above proposals, the improvement of initial-stage charging uniformity can be substantially achieved, but under existing circumstances, is insufficient in respect of stabilizing the charging uniformity. More specifically, as a result of long-term service, contaminant such as developer dust or paper dust adheres to the surface of the charging member. In that case, where they come to adhere partially non-uniformly or adhere in a large quantity, they may lower the charging uniformity.","For the subject of stabilizing the charging uniformity during long-term service, proposals are made in which the surface roughness is further adjusted to make improvement. For example, in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 2004-061640 and No. 2004-309911, a technique is disclosed in which the surface roughness of the charging member is controlled to secure the charging uniformity. Also, in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 2004-038056, a technique is disclosed in which the surface roughness of the charging member and the coefficient of surface friction of the electrophotographic photosensitive member are controlled to secure the charging uniformity.","In general, it is known that contaminant can be better kept from adhering to the surface of the charging member as a result of long-term service as the charging member has a smaller surface roughness. Also, if it has too large surface roughness, faulty images such as spots may come about because of faulty charging due to the surface shape of the charging member. From these viewpoints, it is more preferable for the charging member to have a smaller surface roughness.","Electrophotographic apparatus are more highly demanded to achieve higher speed and higher image quality. In particular, as images have come to be reproduced in colors (in full color), halftone images and solid images have come to be often reproduced, and such a demand for higher image quality increases steadily year by year.","For example, importance is attached to the uniformity of density and tint in reproduced images on each sheet and the stability in continuous image reproduction, and tolerance therefore have become remarkably severer as compared with that in black-and-white printers and black-and-white copying machines. In particular, in electrophotographic apparatus employing the DC contact charging system, records in one cycle of electrophotographic processing tends to appear as charge potential non-uniformity of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, which may cause ghost due to records of exposure (image exposure) and charge memory due to transfer (transfer memory). Then, as a result, density non-uniformity may come about in reproduced images.","Accordingly, in usual cases, a measure is applied in which a charge elimination (de-charging) means such as a pre-exposure means is provided on the downstream side of a transfer means and on the upstream side of a charging means so as to eliminate records in one cycle of electrophotographic processing and eliminate the non-uniformity of surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member.","However, as a result of studies made by the present inventors, it has turned out that the charging lines tend to greatly occur when the electrophotographic photosensitive member employing the type-(iii) constitution between the support and the photosensitive layer is used in an electrophotographic apparatus having such a pre-exposure means. In addition, it has turned out that the charging lines occur more conspicuously in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment and also in the case where cycle time is short.","An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member in which it is difficult for the charging lines to occur even when employing the type-(iii) constitution between the support and the photosensitive layer.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.","The present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member having a support, a conductive layer formed on the support, an intermediate layer formed on the conductive layer, and a photosensitive layer formed on the intermediate layer, wherein;","The conductive layer is a layer formed by using a conductive layer coating fluid which contains TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving an average particle diameter of from 0.20 \u03bcm or more to 0.60 \u03bcm or less; and","the conductive layer has a volume resistivity of from more than 8.0\u00d710\u03a9cm to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less.","The present invention is also a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have the above electrophotographic photosensitive member.","The present invention is still also a process for producing an electrophotographic photosensitive member; the process having a conductive layer forming step of forming on a support a conductive layer having a volume resistivity of from more than 8.0\u00d710\u03a9cm to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less, an intermediate layer forming step of forming an intermediate layer on the conductive layer, and a photosensitive layer forming step of forming a photosensitive layer on the intermediate layer;","In the conductive layer forming step, the layer being formed by using a conductive layer coating fluid which contains TiO particles coated with oxygen deficient SnO coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving an average particle diameter of from 0.20 \u03bcm or more to 0.60 \u03bcm or less.","According to the present invention, an electrophotographic photosensitive member can be provided in which the charging lines are difficult to cause even when employing the type-(iii) constitution between the support and the photosensitive layer.","According to the present invention, a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus also can be provided having the electrophotographic photosensitive member in which it is difficult to cause the charging lines.","What is denoted by reference numerals in the drawings is:\n\n","The present invention is described below in greater detail.","The electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention has a support, a conductive layer formed on the support, an intermediate layer formed on the conductive layer, and a photosensitive layer formed on the intermediate layer.","In the present invention, particles including TiOparticles coated with SnOwhose resistivity has been reduced by effecting oxygen deficiency are used as a conductive material to be incorporated in the conductive layer. In the present invention, such particles are referred to as \u201cTiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO\u201d. As a result of decreasing the resistivity in this way, the particles have been made to have a resistivity reduced to about 1\/10,000 in terms of powder resistivity.","The oxygen deficient SnOhas reuse properties superior to SnOdoped with a different element such as antimony. In addition, with the oxygen deficient SnO, increase in resistivity in a low-humidity environment and decrease in resistivity in a high-humidity environment are less, and hence it is superior in environmental stability.","The conductive material for the conductive layer used in the present invention is also not particles consisting of only the oxygen deficient SnO(oxygen deficient SnOparticles), but the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO. The reason therefor is as follows:","First, the use of core particles (TiOparticles) is to improve the dispersibility of particles in a conductive layer coating fluid. If a conductive layer coating fluid is prepared using the oxygen deficient SnO, the oxygen deficient SnOtend to become agglomerated especially when the oxygen deficient SnOis contained in a high percentage.","Then, TiOparticles are used as the core particles for the reason that the affinity between the oxygen deficient moiety of the oxygen deficient SnOand the oxide moiety at the TiOparticle surfaces strengthens the bonding between oxygen deficient SnOcoat layers and the core material. The oxygen deficient SnO, unlike doped SnO, may be oxidized in the presence of oxygen to lose oxygen deficient moieties, resulting in low conductivity (high powder resistivity). However, using the TiOparticles as the core particles protects, the oxygen deficient moieties of the oxygen deficient SnOis protected.","Where exposure light (image exposure light) is laser light, the core particles TiOparticles can also keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light reflecting from the support surface at the time of laser exposure.","In addition, a method for producing the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO(a method for preparing the oxygen deficient SnOand a method for coating the TiOparticles with the oxygen deficient SnO) are disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open Nos. H07-295245 and H04-154621.","In order to keep the charging lines from occurring, the conductive layer is required to have a volume resistivity of from more than 8.0\u00d710\u03a9cm to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less. The conductive layer may preferably have a low resistivity. However, in order to keep the charging lines from occurring in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment, the conductive layer is required to have a volume resistivity of 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less. On the other hand, if the conductive layer has too low resistivity, spots and fog may occur because of the injection of electric charges into the photosensitive layer in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment, and hence the conductive layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of more than 8.0\u00d710\u03a9cm.","In the present invention, the volume resistivity of the conductive layer is measured in the following way.","First, using the conductive layer coating fluid, a conductive layer sample (layer thickness: about 10 to 15 \u03bcm; the layer thickness may preferably be the same as that of the conductive layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member) is formed on an aluminum sheet. On this conductive layer sample, a thin film of gold is formed by vacuum deposition. The value of electric current flowing across the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and the thin film of gold is measured with a picoammeter (pA meter). The measurement is performed in an environment of 23\u00b0 C.\/60% RH. A voltage of 0.1 V is applied. One minute after the start of the measurement of the value of electric current, a value having become stable is read, and the volume resistivity of the conductive layer is derived therefrom.","In order to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range, it is preferable to use TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving powder resistivity in the range of from 1 to 500 \u03a9cm, and more preferably in the range of from 1 to 250 \u03a9cm. A conductive layer coating fluid prepared using TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving too high powder resistivity makes it difficult to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. On the other hand, a conductive layer coating fluid prepared using TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving too low powder resistivity may produce an electrophotographic photosensitive member having low chargeability.","In order to stably obtain the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving volume resistivity within the above range, the mixing proportion of raw materials may be controlled when the particles are produced. For example, a tin raw-material necessary for producing SnOin an amount of from 30 to 60 mass % based on the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOmay be mixed when the particles are produced (as calculated assuming that the purity of SnOobtained from the tin raw-material is 100%). In other words, it is preferable that the coverage of the oxygen deficient SnOon the TiOparticles is from 30 to 60 mass %.","The powder resistivity in the present invention is measured in the following way.","A resistance measuring instrument LORESTA AP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, is used as a measuring instrument. A measurement object powder (i.e., particles) is compacted at a pressure of 500 kg\/cmto prepare a pellet-shaped measuring sample. The measurement is performed in an environment of 23\u00b0 C.\/60% RH. A voltage of 100 V is applied.","In order to keep the charging lines from occurring, the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare also required to have an average particle diameter of from 0.20 \u03bcm or more to 0.60 \u03bcm or less in the conductive layer coating fluid. In the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOcontained in the conductive layer coating fluid, TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOof from 0.10 \u03bcm or more to 0.40 \u03bcm or less in particle diameter may preferably be in a proportion of 45% by number or more, and more preferably 60% by number or more, based on the number of all the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOcontained in the conductive layer coating fluid.","In the present invention, the particle diameter (inclusive of average particle diameter and particle size distribution) of the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOin the conductive layer coating fluid is measured by a liquid-phase sedimentation method in the following way.","First, the conductive layer coating fluid is diluted with the same solvent included therein, to have a transmittance of 0.8 or more and 1.0 or less. Next, a histogram of average particle diameter (volume-base D50) and particle size distribution is made out by measurement using an ultra-centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument (CAPA 700) manufactured by Horiba Ltd. at the number of revolutions of 3,000 rpm.","Even where the conductive layer has the same composition, the powder resistivity decreases as the average particle diameter of the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOincreases, and at the same time, the volume resistivity also decreases.","If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhave an average particle diameter of less than 0.20 \u03bcm, the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOmust be used in a large quantity in order to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. However, if the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare used in a large quantity, it is difficult to achieve the conductive-layer surface roughness (Rz jis: 1 to 3 \u03bcm) that is preferable in order to keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light reflecting from the surface of the conductive layer. In addition, Rz jis corresponds to what has ever been defined as Rz in JIS B 0601 (1994). The JIS B 0601 standard has been revised in 2001, and the Rz has been revised and replaced by Ry (maximum height) used in 1994. The Rz in 1994 has been changed in 2001 for the purpose of distinction, and named Rz jis.","If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare used in a large quantity, the conductive layer tends to come cracked when it has a large layer thickness, to have low film properties.","On the other hand, where the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhave an average particle diameter of more than 0.60 \u03bcm, or, even though not more than that, where the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOof from 0.10 \u03bcm or more to 0.40 \u03bcm or less in particle diameter are in a proportion of less than 45% by number, it is possible to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. However, the surface of the conductive layer may become extremely rough to tend to cause local injection of electric charges into the photosensitive layer, and in some case, spots appear conspicuously on the white background in reproduced images.","In the present invention, the conductive layer may be formed by coating the support with a conductive layer coating fluid obtained by dispersing in a binding material together with a solvent the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving an average particle diameter of from 0.20 \u03bcm or more to 0.60 \u03bcm or less, and then drying the wet coating formed. For dispersing the particles, a method is available which makes use of a paint shaker, a sand mill, a ball mill, a liquid impact type high-speed dispersion machine or the like.","The solvent used for the conductive layer coating fluid may be exemplified by the following: Alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monomethyl ether; esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene.","From the viewpoint of the covering of surface defects of the support, the conductive layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 10 \u03bcm or more to 25 \u03bcm or less, and more preferably from 15 \u03bcm or more to 20 \u03bcm or less.","In addition, in the present invention, the layer thickness of each layer inclusive of the conductive layer, of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is measured with FISCHERSCOPE Multi Measurement System (mms), available from Fisher Instruments Co.","The binding material of the conductive layer may include resins (binder resins) such as phenol resin, polyurethane, polyamide, polyimide, polyamide-imide, polyvinyl acetal, epoxy resin, acrylic resin, melamine resin and polyester. One or two or more of these may be used. Also, among various resins, the binder resin of the conductive layer may preferably be a hardening resin, and more preferably a thermosetting resin, from the viewpoint of the prevention of migration to other layer(s), the adhesiveness to the support, the dispersibility and dispersion stability of the conductive material, the solvent resistance after film formation, and so forth. Specifically, thermosetting phenol resin and polyurethane are preferred. In the case where the hardening resin is used as the binder resin of the conductive layer, the binding material to be contained in the conductive layer coating fluid includes a monomer and\/or an oligomer of the hardening resin.","It is also preferable that in the conductive layer coating fluid, the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO(P) and the binding material (B) are in a mass ratio (P:B) ranging from 2.3:1.0 to 3.3:1.0. If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare in too small proportion, it is difficult to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare in too large proportion, it is difficult for the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOto bind in the conductive layer, tending to cause cracking.","In order to keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light reflecting from the surface of the conductive layer, a surface roughness providing material for roughening the surface of the conductive layer may be added to the conductive layer coating fluid. Such a surface roughness providing material may preferably be resin particles having an average particle diameter of from 1 \u03bcm or more to 3 \u03bcm or less. For example, such particles may include particles of hardening rubbers and of hardening resins such as polyurethane, epoxy resin, alkyd resin, phenol resin, polyester, silicone resin and acryl-melamine resin. In particular, particles of silicone resin are preferred as being less agglomerative. The specific gravity of resin particles (which is 0.5 to 2) is smaller than the specific gravity of TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO(which is 4 to 7), and hence the surface of the conductive layer can efficiently be roughened at the time of formation of the conductive layer. However, the conductive layer has a tendency to increase volume resistivity as the content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer increases. Hence, in order to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range, the content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer may preferably be so controlled as to be from 15 to 25 mass % based on the binder resin in the conductive layer.","A leveling agent may be added in order to enhance the surface properties of the conductive layer, and pigment particles may be incorporated in the conductive layer in order to improve the covering properties of the conductive layer.","In order to block the injection of electric charges from the conductive layer into the photosensitive layer, it is necessary that an intermediate layer having electrical barrier properties is provided between the conductive layer and the photosensitive layer. Such an intermediate layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of from 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or more to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9cm or less. If the intermediate layer has too low volume resistivity, it may have poor electrical barrier properties to tend to seriously cause spots and fog due to the injection of electric charges from the conductive layer. If on the other hand the intermediate layer has too high volume resistivity, the flow of electric charges (carriers) may stagnate at the time of image formation to tend to result in a serious rise in residual potential.","The volume resistivity of the intermediate layer in the present invention is measured in the following way.","First, using an intermediate layer coating fluid, an intermediate layer sample (layer thickness: about 2 to 5 \u03bcm) is formed on an aluminum sheet. On this intermediate layer sample, a thin film of gold is formed by vacuum deposition. The value of electric current flowing across the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and the thin film of gold is measured with a picoammeter (pA meter). The measurement is measured in an environment of 23\u00b0 C.\/60% RH. A voltage of 100 V is applied. One minute after the start of the measurement of the value of electric current, a value having become stable is read, and the volume resistivity of the intermediate layer is derived therefrom.","The intermediate layer may be formed by coating the conductive layer with an intermediate layer coating fluid containing a binder resin, and drying the wet coating formed.","The binder resin for the intermediate layer may be exemplified by the following: Water-soluble resins such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyacrylic acids, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, polyglutamic acid, casein and starch; and polyamide, polyimide, polyamide-imide, polyamic acid, melamine resin, epoxy resin, polyurethane, and polyglutamates.","In order to effectively bring out the electrical barrier properties, and from the viewpoint of coatability, adhesiveness, solvent resistance and electrical resistance, the binder resin for the intermediate layer may preferably be a thermoplastic resin. Specifically, a thermoplastic polyamide is preferred. As the polyamide, a low-crystallizable or non-crystallizable copolymer nylon or the like is preferred as being able to be coated in the state of solution. Also, the intermediate layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 0.1 \u03bcm or more to 2 \u03bcm or less.","In a multi-layer sample prepared by using the conductive layer coating fluid and the intermediate layer coating fluid and by superposing the conductive layer sample and the intermediate layer sample in this order, it is preferred to satisfy the relationship of 0.2\u2266Imin\/I(0)\u22661.0 where under the application of a voltage of 0.10 V\/\u03bcm to the multi-layer sample total thickness (the layer thickness of the conductive layer sample+the layer thickness of the intermediate layer sample), the value of electric current at voltage application time t second is represented by I(t), and the minimum value of electric current I(t) in the range of 0\u2266t\u2266300 is represented by Imin.","A method for measuring the value of electric current with respect to the voltage application time and a method for determining the value of Imin\/I(0) are described below.","In the multi-layer sample, the layer thickness of the conductive layer sample and the layer thickness of the intermediate layer sample may preferably be equal respectively to the layer thickness of the conductive layer and the layer thickness of the intermediate layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. Specifically, the conductive layer sample is formed on an aluminum sheet in a layer thickness of from 10 to 15 \u03bcm, and the intermediate layer is formed thereon in a layer thickness of from 0.5 to 1.5 \u03bcm.","First, a thin film of gold is formed on the intermediate layer sample by vacuum deposition, and a voltage of 0.10 V\/\u03bcm is applied to the multi-layer sample total thickness through the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and the thin film of gold from a constant-voltage power source. Next, the value of electric current flowing across the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and thin film of gold is measured with a picoammeter (pA meter). The measurement is performed in an environment of 23\u00b0 C.\/60% RH. A voltage of 100 V is applied. The value of electric current is measured until 300 seconds has passed, regarding the voltage application starting time as 0 second.
