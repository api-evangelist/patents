abstract: A CNT electron source, a method of manufacturing a CNT electron source, and a solar cell utilizing a CNT patterned sculptured substrate are disclosed. Embodiments utilize a metal substrate which enables CNTs to be grown directly from the substrate. An inhibitor may be applied to the metal substrate to inhibit growth of CNTs from the metal substrate. The inhibitor may be precisely applied to the metal substrate in any pattern, thereby enabling the positioning of the CNT groupings to be more precisely controlled. The surface roughness of the metal substrate may be varied to control the density of the CNTs within each CNT grouping. Further, an absorber layer and an acceptor layer may be applied to the CNT electron source to form a solar cell, where a voltage potential may be generated between the acceptor layer and the metal substrate in response to sunlight exposure.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/022,291, filed Jan. 18, 2008, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GROWING CARBON NANOTUBES ON METAL SUBSTRATES AND MODIFYING THE METAL SUBSTRATES TO CONTROL THE PROPERTIES OF THE CARBON NANOTUBES,\u201d naming Cattien V. Nguyen as the inventor. That application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.","The inventions described herein were made by non-government employees, whose contributions were made in the performance of work under a NASA contract, and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 U.S.C. \u00a7202). These inventions were made with Government support under contract NAS2-03144 awarded by NASA. The Government has certain rights in these inventions.","Carbon nanotubes are often used in conventional electron sources given their robust physical, chemical and electrical properties. For example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) generally have high aspect ratios providing a low turn-on field, thereby enabling CNTs to emit electrons well. The CNTs are generally grown on a metal catalyst disposed on a non-metal substrate such as silicon dioxide.","Despite the ability to produce conventional electron sources with CNTs, the functionality of conventional electron sources is limited given the limitations of applying the metal catalyst to the non-metal substrate. For example, it is difficult to apply the metal catalyst in a precise pattern to the non-metal substrate. As such, the spacing of CNT groupings grown on respective regions of metal substrate is often non-uniform and difficult to control, thereby reducing the effectiveness of conventional electron sources. Further, the density of the CNTs in each of the groupings is difficult to control.","Additionally, the process of applying the metal catalyst to the non-metal substrate, e.g., metal catalyst deposition, is relatively expensive. As such, the cost of producing conventional electron sources is increased due to the relatively high cost of applying the metal catalyst to the non-metal substrate.","Accordingly, a need exists for a carbon nanotube (CNT) electron source with improved effectiveness. More specifically, a need exists for a CNT electron source with improved patterning of CNT groupings. A need also exists for a CNT electron source with a CNT density which can be more precisely controlled during manufacturing. Further, a need exists for a CNT electron source which can be produced more cheaply than conventional electron sources. Embodiments of the present invention provide novel solutions to these needs and others as described below.","Embodiments are directed to a CNT electron source, a method of manufacturing a CNT electron source, and a solar cell utilizing a patterned CNT sculptured substrate. More specifically, embodiments utilize a metal substrate which enables CNTs to be grown directly from the substrate. An inhibitor may be applied to the metal substrate to inhibit growth of CNTs from the metal substrate. The inhibitor may be precisely applied to the metal substrate in any pattern (e.g., using photolithography, nanoimprinting with a patterned stamp, bubble jet printing, etc.), thereby enabling the positioning of the CNT groupings to be more precisely controlled. The surface roughness of the metal substrate may be varied (e.g., by polishing or roughening the metal substrate before growing the CNTs) to control the density of the CNTs within each CNT grouping. Further, an absorber layer and an acceptor layer may be applied to the CNT electron source to form a solar cell, where a voltage potential may be generated between the acceptor layer and the metal substrate in response to sunlight exposure.","In one embodiment, a method of manufacturing an electron source includes accessing a metal substrate. An inhibitor is applied to a first plurality of regions of the metal substrate, wherein the inhibitor is operable to inhibit growth of carbon nanotubes in the first plurality of regions of the metal substrate. The carbon nanotubes are grown on the metal substrate in a second plurality of regions separate from the first plurality of regions. Applying an inhibitor may be done by applying photoresist to the metal substrate and exposing a portion of the photoresist to ultraviolet light using a photolithography process, wherein the portion of the photoresist is disposed on the second plurality of regions. Unexposed portions of the photoresist disposed on the first plurality of regions of the metal substrate may be removed. The inhibitor may be applied to the metal substrate and the portion of the photoresist. Additionally, the portion of the photoresist may be removed leaving the inhibitor disposed on the first plurality of regions of the metal substrate.","Alternatively, the inhibitor may include a polymer, and wherein applying an inhibitor may be done by applying a polymer to the metal substrate. The polymer may be patterned using a patterned stamp, wherein the patterned stamp includes features corresponding to the first plurality of regions. The polymer may be cured while the patterned stamp is in place. And in another embodiment, applying the inhibitor may be done by applying the inhibitor using a bubble jet printing process","In one embodiment, an electron source includes a metal substrate, an inhibitor disposed on a first plurality of regions of the metal substrate, and carbon nanotubes disposed on the metal substrate in a second plurality regions separate from the first plurality of regions. The metal substrate may include nickel chromium with an RMS surface roughness of less than approximately 5 nanometers. The carbon nanotubes may include a plurality of groupings of carbon nanotubes, and wherein each of the plurality of groupings of carbon nanotubes are physically separated from one another.","In yet another embodiment, a solar cell may include a metal substrate, an inhibitor disposed on a first plurality of regions of the metal substrate, and carbon nanotubes disposed on the metal substrate in a second plurality of regions separate from the first plurality of regions. An absorber layer is disposed on the inhibitor and the carbon nanotubes. Further, an acceptor layer is disposed on the absorber layer, the acceptor layer for generating a voltage potential with respect to the metal substrate in response to light exposure therewith.","Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the present invention will be discussed in conjunction with the following embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present invention to these embodiments alone. On the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents which may be included with the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to an electron source with a metal substrate which enables carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be grown directly from the substrate. An inhibitor may be applied to the metal substrate to inhibit growth of CNTs from the metal substrate, thereby enabling the CNTs to be precisely positioned and\/or patterned on the metal substrate. The inhibitor may be applied to the metal substrate using the following: photolithography (e.g., as discussed with respect to ); nanoimprinting with a patterned stamp (e.g., as discussed with respect to ); bubble jet printing (e.g., as discussed with respect to ); etc. The surface roughness of the metal substrate may be varied (e.g., by polishing or roughening the metal substrate before growing the CNTs) to control the density of the CNTs.

The metal substrate may include nickel chromium, a metal capable of growing carbon nanotubes, a metal alloy capable of growing carbon nanotubes, some combination thereof, etc. Additionally, preparation of the metal substrate may include changing the surface roughness of the substrate (e.g., by polishing the metal substrate, roughening the metal substrate, etc.), where the surface roughness may be used to adjust the density of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown from the metal substrate (e.g., as discussed with respect to step  below). In one embodiment, the metal substrate may be prepared with an RMS surface roughness of less than approximately 5 nanometers. Additionally, in one embodiment, the roughness of the substrate may be changed using chemical polishing, mechanical polishing, some combination thereof, etc.","In one embodiment, preparation of the metal substrate (e.g., ) may include an HDMS treatment of the metal substrate to remove impurities (e.g., water, solvents, etc.). For example, a primer (e.g., MCC primer 80\/20 produced by MicroChem Corporation of Newton, Mass.) may be applied (e.g., puddled) onto the metal substrate (e.g., ) and spun-dry (e.g., for approximately 30 seconds at approximately 4,500 rpm). The metal substrate may then be heated or baked (e.g., at approximately 110 degrees Celsius for approximately two minutes).","Step  involves applying photoresist (e.g., ) to the metal substrate (e.g., ). The photoresist may include UV-60.6 in one embodiment. Additionally, the photoresist may be applied to the metal substrate using a spin-on process in one embodiment. Further, the photoresist may be heated or baked (e.g., at approximately 130 degrees Celsius for approximately one minute).","As shown in , step  involves exposing a portion of the photoresist to ultraviolet light (e.g., ). In one embodiment, the photoresist (e.g., ) may be covered with a mask (e.g., ) prior to exposing portion of the photoresist to ultraviolet light (e.g., ). The mask (e.g., ) may enable portions of the ultraviolet light (e.g. ) to pass through the mask and expose corresponding portions of the photoresist (e.g., ). For example, as shown in , the darkened squares of mask  may block light  (e.g., leaving portions  of photoresist  unexposed) while the light squares of mask  may enable light  to pass through mask  (e.g., as represented by light ) and expose portions  of photoresist . In this manner, the mask (e.g., ) may be used to pattern the photoresist (e.g., ) and ultimately pattern the CNTs grown from the metal substrate (e.g., in step  of process ).","Mask  may include a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid. Alternatively, mask  may include a stencil mask, photolithography mask, or the like.","Step  involves heating or baking the photoresist (e.g., ). In one embodiment, the post-exposure bake may include heating the photoresist (e.g., ) at 140 degree Celsius for approximately 90 seconds.","As shown in , step  involves removing unexposed portions (e.g., ) of the photoresist (e.g., ) or exposed portions (e.g., ) of the photoresist (e.g., ). In one embodiment, acetone may be applied to the photoresist to remove the portions (e.g., , , etc.) of the photoresist.","As shown in , step  involves heating the remaining photoresist (e.g., exposed portions  of photoresist , unexposed portions  of photoresist  where exposed portions  are removed in step , etc.). In one embodiment, the remaining photoresist may be heated or baked at approximately 140 degrees Celsius for approximately three minutes.","Step  involves applying an inhibitor (e.g.,  and ) to the remaining photoresist (e.g., exposed portions  of photoresist , unexposed portions  of photoresist  where exposed portions  are removed in step , etc.) and the metal substrate (e.g., ). The inhibitor may be used to inhibit the growth of CNTs in the regions of the metal substrate on which the inhibitor is disposed. Additionally, the inhibitor (e.g.,  and ) may include any material that inhibits the growth of CNTs. For example, the inhibitor (e.g.,  and ) may include a non-metal, a polymer, and a metal (e.g., Mo, Al, Cr, etc.). And in one embodiment, the inhibitor (e.g.,  and ) may include IBS molybdenum.","As shown in , step  involves removing the remaining photoresist (e.g., exposed portions  of photoresist , unexposed portions  of photoresist  where exposed portions  are removed in step , etc.) and the portions of the metal inhibitor disposed on the remaining photoresist (e.g., portions  of the metal inhibitor disposed on photoresist portions , portions of the metal inhibitor disposed on unexposed portions  of photoresist  where exposed portions  are removed in step , etc.). In this manner, only portions of the metal inhibitor (e.g., ) disposed on regions of the metal substrate (e.g., ) may remain, thereby patterning the remaining inhibitor (e.g., ) and creating regions on the surface of the metal substrate without any metal inhibitor (e.g., regions ). In one embodiment, the remaining photoresist (e.g., exposed portions  of photoresist , unexposed portions  of photoresist  where exposed portions  are removed in step , etc.) may be removed using at least two consecutive baths with a developer (e.g., Microposit 1165), where each bath lasts for approximately 5 minutes at approximately 80 degrees Celsius.","Step  involves treating the metal substrate (e.g., ) and the remaining metal inhibitor (e.g., ). In one embodiment, the metal substrate (e.g., ) and the remaining metal inhibitor (e.g., ) may be washed with de-ionized water and cleaned with methanol.","As shown in , step  involves growing CNTs (e.g., ) in regions of the metal substrate without metal inhibitor disposed thereon (e.g., in regions ). The CNTs (e.g., ) may be multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in one embodiment. Each pillar or grouping of CNTs (e.g., ) grown from the metal substrate (e.g., ) may be physically spaced from one another. Additionally, the pillars or groupings of CNTs may be patterned in accordance with the mask (e.g., ) used to expose portions of the photoresist (e.g., as discussed with respect to step ). Further, the density of each grouping of CNTs (e.g., ) may be related to the surface roughness of the metal substrate (e.g., in regions  of metal substrate ) in one embodiment.","Accordingly, exemplary process  may be used to produce an electron source (e.g., ) with a metal substrate (e.g., ). The electron source (e.g., ) may be produced without metal catalyst deposition in one embodiment. Additionally, the CNTs may be grown (e.g., in step ) directly from the substrate (e.g., instead of from a metal catalyst deposited on another substrate layer).
