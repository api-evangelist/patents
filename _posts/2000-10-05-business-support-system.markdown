{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a continuation of International Application PCT\/JP99\/02642, with an international filing date of May 20, 1999, published in English under PCT Article 21(2).","The present invention relates to a business support system, and more particularly, to a business support system that can connect existing external processing systems such as bank settlement systems, securities firm host computers, and data warehouses and the like with a variety of terminal apparatuses (channels) and provide the latest existing system data to the most appropriate terminal apparatus used by a customer, and can also provide information from the terminal apparatus to an existing processing system determined by the customer.","Conventionally, a business support system like that for example shown in  has been provided. This business support system  is set up at a bank telephone center and the like and is connected to media  such as a telephone and to a computer terminal apparatus located on the floor of the bank, and is configured to provide a variety of types of service information to the media .","The business support system  includes an application  for taking the place of and\/or providing support to a live banking-services operator, a data management object for collecting and managing data , an item definition unit  that defines the location of each piece of data, and a database  of service information such as customer information on each customer.","If the data relating to the request is within the data management object , then the data management object  returns that data as is to the application . If, however, the data relating to the request is not within the data management object , then the item definition unit  is checked and data (an account balance) relating to the request is extracted from the database  and is read into the data management object  and sent to the application .","When the application  obtains data relating to the request from the data management object , it sends that data onward to the requesting media . As a result, a user using that media  can access account balance and other service information via the media .","However, in the conventional business support system described above, the customer information database  is normally batch-processed on a weekly or monthly basis or delay-processed, in which the database is updated with information gathered from the bank's settlement system and\/or one or more data warehouses. Accordingly, the conventional business support system cannot provide the latest information in response to a request from a customer using the media  because the information it has may differ from the information actually available in the bank's settlement system.","Additionally, the conventional business support system is not directly connected to the external processing systems such as the bank settlement system or data warehouse, so operations that are to be carried out with the bank's settlement system, such as transfers and payments or loan applications, must be carried out using a different system.","The present invention has as its general object to provide an improved and useful business support system in which the above-described disadvantages are eliminated.","A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a business support system capable of providing the latest information available in an existing external processing system to a terminal apparatus used by a user and also capable of exchanging information between a terminal apparatus and an external processing system.","In order to achieve the above-described objects, the business support system according to the present invention has a service request production means for  producing service information request data in a predetermined form for an external processing system in response to a request from a terminal apparatus, a data form conversion means for converting the form of the service information request data produced by the service request production means into a form that can be processed by the external processing system and also for converting service information provided from the external processing system in response to said service information request data into said predetermined form, and a service information providing means for providing the service information converted into the predetermined form by the data form conversion means to the terminal apparatus originating the request for service information.","In the above-described business support system, when service information request data is input from a terminal apparatus by operation of a customer, service information request data in a predetermined form is produced and converted into a form (protocol) capable of being processed by an external processing system. The external processing system then transmits service information in response to the service information request data from the business support system. This returned service information is converted into the above-mentioned form (protocol) and provided to the terminal apparatus from which the service information request originated.","According to the above-described system, service information request data is provided to the external processing system in a form that can be processed by the external processing system, and also service information in the form particular to the external processing system that is sent back from the external processing system in response to a service information request data is converted into a predetermined form. Accordingly, the external processing system can be connected regardless of the I\/O relation of the external processing system to the business support system. The business support system can then provide the latest service information from the external processing system to the terminal apparatus originating the request as information from a hypothetical database.","Additionally, this business support system is connected to the external processing system, so it can support information exchange between the external processing system and the terminal apparatus.","In terms of being able to provide appropriate service information to customers, the present invention can be configured to further comprise campaign monitoring means for monitoring the rate at which an advertising campaign generates successful sales based on service information provided to customers as well as service information determining means for determining which type of service information should be provided to customers in response to the monitored campaign sales success rate.","Additionally, in terms of being able to provide service information via means which are convenient for the customer to use, the present invention can be configured to further comprise service channel determining means for determining which type of service information should be provided to customers in response to the monitored campaign sales success rate.","Further, in terms of not overloading the service information providing means, the present invention can be configured to comprise adjusting means for making sure that a service information providing means determined by the service channel determining means do not concentrate on a particular type of service information.","A description will now be given of a preferred embodiment for practicing the present invention, with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","101","102","103","103","105","11","12","101","101","11","102","101","103","103","102","103","103","105","105","103","103","103","103"],"i":["a","b","a","b ","a","b ","a","b ","a","b "]},"This business support system  further has a router , a reception terminal  and a server . A computer terminal  (including both home personal computers as well as so-called kiosk outlet terminals) is connected to the router  via a data communications network  such as the internet. The reception terminal  connected to other computer terminals on the data communications network  via the router  is also connected to the server  and can use the information on the server .","This business support system  further has gateways , and . These gateways , and -are connected both to the above-described servers ,  and to a local area network (LAN). External processing systems such as a bank settlement system host computer , a data warehouse database (M-CIF) , and a securities firm host computer  are connected to each of the gateways , and . Data processed within the business support system  is provided to the above-described bank settlement system host computer , data warehouse database (M-CIF)  and securities firm host computer , via the gateways , and , and also data from the above-described bank settlement system host computer , data warehouse database (M-CIF)  and securities firm host computer  is read into the business support system  via the gateways , and ","Additionally, a CRM  server  containing member (customer) information is connected to the LAN. The data inside the CRM server  can be utilized from the operator terminals , and the reception terminals  via the servers , .","The business support system  having the hardware configuration described above may have a functional configuration such as that shown in FIG. .","In other words, functionally, the business support system  is linked to the above-described media such as the telephone , facsimile machine  and computer terminal , an application  that takes the place of or augments the work of an operator in providing service information to customers, a data management object  that manages the collection of data and the provision of data to customers, access routines , and that access external processing systems (such as the bank settlement system host computer , data warehouse database (M-CIF)  and securities firm host computer  described above), an item definition  in which is inscribed the relation between each data item and the access routine that obtains the data, and gateways , and that convert protocols. Additionally, a CRM agent  and a campaign manager  are provided for the purpose of providing various types of sales campaign information (regarding pensions, new types of fixed-term products, loans, securities and so forth).","The above-described application , data management object , access routines -, definition item , CRM agent  and campaign manager , are configured as the functions of the operator terminals , and servers , .","The above-described CRM agent  exchanges information with the data management object , generates sales campaign information based on the latest information in the data management object  and provides it to the application . The campaign manager  manages operations concerning the sales campaign information which should be gathered by the CRM agent  as well as the media  (terminal apparatus) to which the information is provided, and may for example be configured as shown in FIG. .","In , the campaign manager  is composed of a monitor unit , a campaign selector , a channel selector  and a channel balancer , a campaign cue  and a campaign scheduler . The monitor unit  monitors the success rate of each sales campaign and the success rate of each channel (media). The results of this monitoring are used in advertisement campaign scheduling and channel load adjustment.","The campaign selector  calculates the potential value of customers (segmenting them by age, sex, annual income and so forth) to which the sales campaign is to be directed using such methods as segment analysis and determines which sales campaigns are to be directed to customers on the basis of those potential values.","The channel selector  scores the customer and channel compatibility and determines the best channel for the customer. That is, it determines which channel (electronic mail, direct mail, telephone, etc.) is effective in obtaining a successful sale during a sales campaign for the customer. The scoring is calculated as a sum of several factors, for example.\n\n","\u201cMining\u201d here refers to analysis of products to be advertised to customers.","The channel balancer  adjusts the channels of the customers to which a sales campaign is to be directed so that no one channel gets overloaded. Initially, it calculates the load rate by determining for each channel on a per-time-unit basis the target number of items to be processed and the scheduled number of items to be processed. Once running, it corrects the parameters based on the per-time-unit processing capacity results gotten from the monitor unit .","The above-described campaign selector , channel selector  and channel balancer  correct their respective determinations based on the success rates for each campaign and each channel obtained from the monitor unit . For example, based on the monitored per-channel success rate, an effective channel (such as electronic mail) can be nearly overloaded while a less effective channel (such as direct mail) can be set to a reduced rate of utilization. This type of adjustment makes it possible to improve the success rate of a sales campaign and to provide effective business support.","In the above-described business support system , for example the application  may acquire a customer's account balance information based on the customer's account number gotten from the media  (a telephone, computer terminal apparatus and so forth), by executing the steps for example shown in .","In , when there is a balance inquiry request from the media  (for example a computer terminal apparatus), according to that request the application  will request that the data management object  open a record (step S). Based on the item information in the item definition , the data management object  prepares a record region in the memory. The item information has tags that indicate the identity of the item as well as its address (for access routine recognition purposes). The account number received by the application  is then stored in the data management object . Then, the data management object  is given a read command (step S). When the data management object  is given a read command, a telephonic conversation with the user is conducted in parallel with communication with a host computer (step S).","Thereafter the process proceeds to the steps shown in , in which the application makes a balance inquiry request of the data management object  (step S). The data management object  then determines whether or not there has already been an access of the balance regarding this inquiry (step S) and, if no such access is found, reads out the access routine (, or ) that shows the tag of the item information in the item definition  (step S). In this case, for example, the access routine for accessing a bank account balance in a bank settlement system  is read out.","The read-out access routine makes a balance inquiry request to the corresponding gateway (step S). It should be noted that this access routine conducts a balance inquiry regardless of the information requested.","Next, the gateway makes an interface conversion to the protocol used to exchange data between the existing bank settlements system  and the terminal apparatus (an ATM and the like). Then, a balance inquiry statement is sent up from the gateway to the bank settlement system  (step S).","Thereafter the process moves to the steps shown in , in which, in response to the balance inquiry statement, said settlement system host computer  searches for the account balance using the account number included in the uploaded request. The settlement system host computer  then sets up a balance statement including the balance obtained, which statement is then downloaded from the settlement system host computer  to the business support system  (step S). When this downloaded statement is received at the gateway , this gateway converts the protocol of the downloaded statement and transmits it to the access routine (step S).","The access routine extracts the information (that is, the balance) from the downloaded statement and supplies that downloaded statement to the data management object . Then, that data is stored in the data management object  (step S). Thereafter, the data management object  transfers the information in the memory to the application  (step S). The application  that has acquired the balance or other information then provides that account balance or other information to the media  that originated the request. As a result, the customer can ascertain their account balance at the media .","It should be noted that if the data management object  determines in the process of step S in  that the balance has already been accessed, then the routine proceeds to step S in FIG.  and data relating to the balance stored in the memory by the previous accession is transferred from the data management object  to the application .","In the system as described above, data relating to the data management object  request is obtained from the external processing system (for example the bank settlement system ) via the gateways , and that convert the protocol of the data, so it is as if the application  can obtain data relevant to said request using the same processes used to obtain data from a conventional database (see FIG. ). This information is obtained directly from the external processing system (such as the bank settlement system ), so it is always up to date.","Additionally, by using a gateway, the external processing system (for example the bank settlement system ) can connect to the business support system  in the same way that it can connect to existing terminal apparatuses, so there is no need to change the external processing system architecture.","Additionally, the process of providing information about the above-described service information (account balances, sales campaign information and the like) to a customer is monitored by the above-described campaign manager , and depending on the results sales campaign information most likely to generate successful sales can be routed to such customer using the most effective channel.","It is also possible to spread the functions of the above-described business support system  among a plurality of servers. In that case, for example as shown in , a plurality of systems are integrated by a broad-channel bus.","In , the business support system  () through  (n) is dispersed, with the individual business support systems () (i=1-n), as shown in , having an application () connected to a media (), a data management object (), an access routine (i) -(i) and an item definition (). It should be noted that, though not shown in the drawing, as with the example shown in , each business support system () has a CRM agent and a campaign manager.","The business support system () access routines (i)-(i) are connected in parallel to the broad-channel bus , and by this broad-channel bus  the business support systems ()-() are integrated. Further, gateways -for converting protocol with the bank settlement system , gateways and for converting protocol with the data warehouse database , and gateways and for converting protocol with the securities firm host computer , are connected to this broad-channel bus . As a result, no matter what the business support system (), it is possible to exchange data with the external processing system (bank settlement system , database  or securities firm host computer ) via the broad-channel bus  and gateways.","Additionally, an integrated supervisor  for overall management of the dispersed system and a bus monitor apparatus  for monitoring the broad-channel bus  are also connected to the broad-channel bus .","The broad-channel bus  may for example have the functional configuration shown in FIG. . That is, the configuration is composed of units () through (), each comprising a node application, a communications application programming interface (API), a bus system, a communications protocol and a LAN protocol, with each of the units () through () connected to the TCP\/IP network. Additionally, the broad-channel bus  has a monitoring system for managing a directory of addresses and other information corresponding to the bus monitor apparatus . This monitoring system may be composed of a bus monitoring apparatus application, a communications API, a bus system, a communications protocol and a LAN protocol, and be connected to a TCP\/IP network.","The bus system of the above-described units has the functional configuration shown in FIG. . That is, when the communications API makes a request to send or receive transmissions with logic addresses attached, the bus system converts the received logic address to an actual address (normal bus-internal script address) based on the node directory information and script information allotted from the bus monitor apparatus , and then transmits the information pertaining to the request to that address. This address may be a script. Depending on the script that is to be an address, it is possible to process the message or generate a new message.","Additionally, according to the business support system  described above (as per FIG.  and FIG. ), it is possible to provide services to customers using steps like the following. The following example is of process steps in concluding a loan agreement with an internet user.","1) Database (M-CIF)  information (use channel frequency and customer designation) is examined dynamically, so that, for example, in the case of an internet user, information is sent by electronic mail.","2) By including a URL in that electronic mail, the user may click on that URL at the user's terminal apparatus and be promptly moved to the website (with SET security protocol, a balance statement issued internally terminates user identification).","3) The website HELP button automatically connects the user with the customer relation center.","Financing terms can be discussed and the content of the agreement finalized by talking with the customer over the telephone. The finalized agreement can then be sent to the customer's terminal apparatus (PC), where the customer can click a button signalizing agreement and automatically submitting the loan application.","During the call, the application undergoes a preliminary review by an automated review system.","Measures to record the conversation and conduct voice pattern identification at this time improves caller identification security and provides confirmation of the contents of the call, so possible legal trouble can be avoided.","4) Additionally, the loan application is generated automatically and thus automatically sent to the credit division for review.","5) Upon approval from the credit division, loan approval is sent automatically via electronic mail.","6) The repayment schedule and actual loan agreement are sent to the customer, without the customer ever having actually set foot in the bank.","7) The customer can get the money as soon as proper identification is obtained.","As described above, it is possible to conclude a loan agreement securely and accurately over the internet without the customer ever having to come into the bank to do so directly.","As described above, the business support system according to the present invention converts service information request data from a customer terminal apparatus into a form that can be processed by an external processing system, and also converts service information from the external processing system generated in response to the request into a form that can be processed within the business support system and provide that service information to the customer. As a result, the business support system can function as a system that provides to a terminal apparatus used by a customer the latest information held by an existing external processing system.","Additionally, in the business support system according to the present invention, the external processing system and the business support system are directly connected to each other, so the business support system can function as a system that allows information to be exchanged between the terminal apparatus and the external processing system."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FOR PRACTICING THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
