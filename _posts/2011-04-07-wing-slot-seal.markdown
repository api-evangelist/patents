title: Wing slot seal
abstract: A low cost, lightweight frangible wing slot seal can be applied to a guidance wing slot of a folding fin aerial rocket or missile, providing a barrier against exposure of internal missile components to external contaminants, while allowing unhindered deployment of missile guidance wings simply by bursting through the seals. The simple design is nearly foolproof, and has no impact the likelihood of weapon failure. The seal is a flexible sheet which is sufficiently thin so as not to exceed the required volume envelope of the missile. The sheet includes a burst seam, which is breached when impacted by the leading edge of a deploying wing. No additional wing deployment force is required, and after deployment the seal has minimal impact on the aerodynamic performance of the wing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/321,816, filed Apr. 7, 2010, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. W31P4Q-06-C-0330 awarded by the Navy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to ballistic weaponry, and more particularly to folding fin aerial rockets and missiles.","Aerial rockets and missiles which include guidance wings have been in use at least since the late 1940's, with the FFAR (Folding Fin Aerial Rocket) being used in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, and the more recent Hydra 70 family of WAFAR (Wrap-Around Fin Aerial Rocket) and the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon. System (APKWS) laser guided missile. The guidance wings for these weapons are typically folded within the main fuselage in a stowed configuration until the weapon is launched, at which point the wings are extended through slots in the fuselage and deployed in a flight configuration.","While foldable wing designs provide the advantages of compact storage and reduced launcher size, the slots in the fuselage required for deployment of the wings tend to create a hazard that internal components of the weapon will be exposed to contaminants. These can include natural contaminants, such as salt, moisture from fog, moisture from humidity, blowing sand, blowing dust, and such like. The internal components can also be exposed to induced contaminants, such as debris from an adjacent rocket launch, and contaminants resulting from handling of the missile.","One approach is to provide retractable or openable covers over the wing slots. However, such mechanisms add weight and cost to the missile, take up space which may be needed for other components, and tend to be complex and prone to failure.","What is needed, therefore, is a wing slot seal which will protect the internal components of a rocket or missile from external contaminants while the wings are in their stowed configuration, will interfere as little as possible with deployment of the wings, and will not substantially affect the aerodynamics of the missile once the wings are deployed, all without consuming significant space and without adding significant weight, cost, complexity, or likelihood of failure.","The present invention is a simple, low cost, lightweight wing slot seal which provides a frangible barrier against exposure of internal components of a rocket or missile to external contaminants, while enabling deployment of a wing stored within the rocket or missile simply by bursting of the wing through the frangible seal. The seal is strong enough to resist rupture or dislodgement from the exterior due to normal transport and handling of the missile, while at the same time presenting minimum resistance to penetration from the interior when the guidance wings are deployed by bursting through the seal. The invention itself includes no moving parts, and is therefore unaffected by exposure to contaminants. The simple design of the invention also provides no significant increase in the likelihood of weapon failure.","The invention includes a thin, flexible sheet which can be adhered to a surface of the fuselage of the rocket or missile so as to cover a wing slot. In embodiments, the seal is sufficiently thin so as not to exceed the diameter of \u201cbore riders\u201d of the missile which define the maximum diameter of the missile, and which support the missile when resting within a cylindrical launching or transporting tube.","The thin, flexible sheet includes an outer layer and an inner layer. In embodiments, both of the layers are made of a nickel alloy, and in some of these embodiments one layer is made of half-hard nickel sulfamate, while the other layer is made of fully hard nickel sulfamate. The inner layer includes at least one penetration cut or \u201cburst seam\u201d which assists the wing in breaking through the seal for deployment. The flexible sheet is curved according to the cylindrical shape of the rocket or missile, and the two layers are stiff, although flexible, so that inward deformation due to pressure applied from outside the rocket or missile tends to force the edges of the burst seam together, thereby resisting the applied force, while outward deformation caused by the wing pressing against the seal from within the rocket or missile tends to force the edges of the burst seam apart, so that the wing passes through the cut or cuts in the inner layer and is only required to break through the outer layer.","In embodiments, the flexible sheet is resilient or \u201cspringy,\u201d so that once the wing is deployed, portions of the flexible sheet which lie against the deployed wing remain substantially flush against the wing, while portions of the flexible sheet which are not adjacent to the deployed wing tend to spring back into place and close the opening made in the frangible seal. The effect of the frangible seal on the aerodynamics of the rocket or missile is thereby minimized.","Embodiments of the invention include a puncture feature at a location where the wing first makes contact with the seal during wing deployment. The puncture feature includes a region where the inner layer is omitted and where at least one puncture initiator is attached to the inner surface of the outer layer, the puncture initiators being isolated from each other and from the inner layer. The puncture initiators are arranged so that impact with the leading edge of the wing during the initial stages of wing deployment will tend to drive the puncture initiators into the outer layer, causing the puncture initiators to pierce the outer layer and to provide perforations which will assist the wing in breaking through the outer layer.","The present invention is a frangible wing slot seal suitable for preventing penetration of contaminants through a wing slot provided in the fuselage of a folding fin aerial rocket or missile, the wing slot seal being frangible so as to permit deployment of a guidance wing through the wing slot by breaking of the guidance wing through the wing slot seal, the wing slot seal. The wing slot seal includes a barrier sheet having an inner layer and an outer layer, the barrier sheet having dimensions sufficient for covering the wing slot and for overlapping a region of fuselage surrounding the wing slot, the barrier sheet having a curvature corresponding substantially to a curvature of the fuselage, at least one of the inner and outer layers being a stiff layer which is resistant to deformation.","The wing slot seal further includes a burst seam formed in the stiff layer of the barrier sheet, the burst seam being configured so as to allow a guidance wing to separate and pass through the burst seam during deployment of the guidance wing, the burst seam being configured to close and resist penetration when a force is applied to the barrier sheet from outside of the rocket or missile, and an adhesive layer at least applicable to an inner surface of the barrier sheet, the adhesive layer being configured for adhering the barrier sheet to the region of fuselage surrounding the wing slot, the adhesive layer providing an adhesive strength which is sufficient to maintain the barrier sheet in position over the wing slot while the guidance wing breaks through the barrier sheet during deployment of the guidance wing.","In embodiments, the stiff layer is the inner layer of the barrier sheet.","In various embodiments at least one of the inner layer and the outer layer of the barrier sheet is a resilient layer which tends to restore the barrier sheet to its original configuration after the guidance wing has broken through the barrier sheet. Some of these embodiments further include at least one cross-seam formed in the stiff layer and configured so as to cause the formation of a first pair of flaps and a second pair of flaps in the barrier sheet when the guidance wing breaks thorough the barrier sheet, the first pair of flaps being configured to rest against the guidance wing after the guidance wing is deployed, and the second pair of flaps being configured to return approximately to its original configuration and to thereby at least partly cover the wing slot after the guidance wing has been deployed. And in some of these embodiments the first pair of flaps is approximately triangular in shape, and the second pair of flaps is approximately rectangular in shape.","In certain embodiments one of the layers of the barrier sheet is a layer of half-hard nickel sulfamate, and the other layer of the barrier sheet is a layer of full-hard nickel sulfamate.","Various embodiments further include a burst initiating region which is contiguous with the burst seam and formed at a location of initial contact between the deploying guidance wing and the barrier sheet, the inner layer being absent from the burst initiating region, the burst initiating region including at least one burst assisting feature attached to the outer layer in the burst initiating region, the burst assisting feature, upon contact with the deploying guidance wing, tending to press against and perforate the outer layer of the barrier sheet. In some of these embodiments the at least one burst assisting feature is formed of the material of the inner layer, and is shaped by exclusion of the inner layer material from a region surrounding the burst assisting feature. In other of these embodiments the burst assisting feature is substantially co-planar with the inner layer of the barrier sheet, the burst assisting feature tending to tip out of the plane of the inner layer upon contact with the deploying guidance wing so as to press an edge of the burst assisting feature against the outer layer of the barrier sheet. And in some of these embodiments the edge of the burst assisting feature is at least one of sharp and pointed.","In certain embodiments the wing slot seal is able to inhibit penetration of moisture through the wing slot. And some embodiments further include an alignment feature suitable for alignment with a compatible alignment feature provided on the fuselage of the rocket or missile, the alignment feature thereby facilitating attachment of the wing slot seal to the fuselage at a desired location and with a desired alignment.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","With reference to , the present invention is a simple, low cost, lightweight wing slot seal  which provides a frangible barrier against exposure of internal components of a rocket or missile ( in ) to external contaminants, while enabling deployment of a wing () stored within the rocket or missile () simply by bursting of the wing  through the frangible seal .
